Abstract = {{In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, initiation of DNA replication occurs
   at a discrete number of foci. One component of these foci is the DNA
   replication factor RP-A. Here, the process leading to the association of
   RP-A with foci was reconstituted with cytosolic fractions derived from
   Xenopus eggs. With the use of this fractionated system, a 170-kilodalton
   protein required for the assembly of RP-A into foci was identified and
   purified. The protein appears to be an integral component of the foci at
   which replication of DNA is initiated in eukaryotic nuclei.}},

Abstract = {{The Pravastatin, Lipids, and Atherosclerosis in the Carotid Arteries
   trial (PLAC-II) was initiated in 1987 and was the first double-blind,
   randomized clinical trial with progression of early extracranial carotid
   atherosclerosis as an outcome variable. We randomized 151 coronary
   patients to placebo or pravastatin and treated them for 3 years. B-mode
   ultrasound quantification of carotid artery intimal-medial thickness
   (IMT) was obtained at baseline and sequentially during this period. The
   primary outcome was the change in the mean of the maximum IMT
   measurements over time. Effects on individual carotid artery segments
   (common, bifurcation, internal carotid artery) and on clinical events
   were also investigated. During follow-vp, plasma concentrations of total
   cholesterol were lower in pravastatin-treated patients compared with
   those of placebo-treated patients (4.81 vs 6.08 mmol/liter {[}186 vs 235
   mg/dl]) as were concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL)
   cholesterol (3.10 vs 4.29 mmol/liter {[}120 vs 167 mg/dl]). Plasma
   concentrations of high density lipoprotein(2) (HDL(2)) cholesterol were
   higher in pravastatin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients
   (0.16 vs 0.14 mmol/liter {[}6.1 vs 5.5 mg/dl]). Active treatment
   resulted in a nonsignificant 12\% reduction in progression of the
   mean-maximum IMT (from 0.068 mm/yr placebo to 0.059 mm/yr pravastatin)
   and a statistically significant 35\% reduction in IMT progression in the
   common carotid (p = 0.03). Active treatment was also associated with a
   60\% reduction of nonfatal myocardial infarction plus death caused by
   coronary artery disease (p = 0.09), a 61\% reduction of any fatal event
   plus any nonfatal myocardial infarction (p = 0.04), and an 80\%

Abstract = {{A TLC procedure was developed to determine dihydropyrimidine
   dehydrogenase (DPD) activity in human peripheral lymphocytes. The assay,

   recombinant pig DPD in which it was demonstrated to yield kinetic
   constants similar to those found by methods that rely on either
   spectroscopic determination of NADPH oxidation or HPLC. DPD activity was
   measured in a group of human lymphocyte extracts, including an extract
   from a subject that actually presented toxicity to 5-fluorouracil
   treatment. Measurements of DPD protein content using western immunoblots
   revealed a significant correlation with activity levels in human
   lymphocytes. Thus, this correlation could be used to determine not only
   the levels of expression of this enzyme, which is the cause of an
   inherited genetic deficiency in pyrimidine catabolism, but also to
   estimate the degree of sensitivity to pyrimidine-based cancer drugs such
   as 5-fluorouracil.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic absorption coefficients in aqueous solutions of urea at 1.50,
   3.00, 4.00 and 6.05 M urea have been measured in the frequency range
   from 1.3 to 220 MHz at 25 degrees C. No excess absorption has been
   observed in these solutions, and the absorption decreased with increase
   of the concentration. The absorption measurements have been carried out
   in aqueous solutions of propylamine in the concentration range from 0.01
   to 0.6 M, in which urea coexists. The excess absorption has been
   observed, and the frequency dependence of the ultrasonic absorption
   coefficient has been well fitted to a usual Debye-type
   single-relaxational equation. The cause of the relaxation has been
   attributed to a perturbation of an equilibrium associated with a proton
   transfer reaction. The rate constants have been determined from the
   hydroxide ion concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency, and
   the standard volume change of the reaction has been calculated from the
   reactant concentration dependence of a maximum absorption per
   wavelength. It has been found that the forward rate constant and the
   standard volume change of the reaction decrease with increase in the
   concentration of urea. On the other hand the backward rate constant has
   not been so affected by the addition of urea. It has been found that a
   linear relationship exists between the diffusion-controlled rate
   constant and the reciprocal viscosity coefficient in the solutions with
   urea. Using a theoretical equation for the diffusion-controlled reaction
   of ions, the diffusion coefficient of the hydroxide ion has been
   determined at various concentrations of urea. These results have been
   discussed in relation to the effect of urea on water structure.}},

Abstract = {{We have used a new methodology to measure the activity of P-glycoprotein
   (P-gp) in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells, This activity leads to
   a lower cytosolic concentration and a lower cytotoxicity of the
   classical anthracyclines, daunorubicin (DNR), and doxorubicin (DOX). It
   has been reported that the anthracycline idarubicin (IDA), which is more
   lipophilic, has a higher clinical efficacy in acute myeloid leukemias
   (AML) than DNR and DOX. In our study, the aim was to determine for a
   series of anthracyclines how variations in the passive drug influx rate
   as well as the P-gp-mediated drug pumping rate affect their cytosolic
   free drug concentrations and how these parameters are related to drug
   cytotoxicity. We selected six anthracyclines: DOX, DNR, epidoxorubicin
   (EPI), IDA, cyano-morpholino-doxorubicin (CMD), and carminomycin (CAR),
   ordered according to their increasing octanol/PBS buffer concentration
   ratios, respectively. To measure the passive permeation coefficient, the
   P-gp-mediated drug pumping rate, and the cytosolic free drug
   concentration, we used a flow-through system in which cells were exposed
   to a flowing medium containing drugs. We used the MDR P-gp-containing
   cell line KB8-5. It was shown that the passive drug permeation
   coefficient as well as the drug pumping rate of P-gp increased with
   increasing lipophilicity in this series of anthracyclines. The cytosolic
   free drug concentration was lowered by P-gp to a similar extent in KB8-5
   cells for all drugs tested (40-50\% of the extracellular drug
   concentration), CMD, IDA, and CAR had lower IC50 values and lower
   resistance factors in comparison to DOX, DNR, and EPI. Verapamil
   reversed the resistance for all anthracyclines tested. In conclusion,
   for several anthracyclines the activity of P-gp leads to a similar
   relative decrease in the cytosolic free drug concentration;
   consequently, the reported lower resistance factor of IDA compared to
   that of DNR is not due to the inability of P-gp to export IDA from
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{IMAGES of young stars(1) and supernova remnants(2) often reveal small,
   high-density knots of material which are interpreted as `bullets'
   ejected by the source and propagating at supersonic speeds into the
   surrounding interstellar medium. But it is unclear how these bullets
   could be created and accelerated without disrupting their structure, An
   alternative interpretation of these features is that they condense in
   situ in high-velocity stellar winds as a result of hydrodynamical
   instabilities-such mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
   condensations seen in supernova ejecta(3), and may also operate in
   planetary nebulae. Here we show that similar processes can also form
   bullets in the poorly collimated winds from young stars, We therefore
   suggest that bullets associated with outflow sources should not, in
   general, be ascribed to explosive events at the source; rather, they
   form as a direct result of the interaction between the outflowing gas
   and the surrounding medium.}},

Abstract = {{The Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID)
   study was designed when considerable disagreement existed as to relative
   benefits and risks of cholesterol reduction. Between June 1990 and
   December 1992, 9,014 patients aged 31-75 years were randomized to
   receive either pravastatin 40 mg once daily or placebo. These patients
   had experienced either acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina
   within the preceding 3 months to 3 years and had total cholesterol
   levels of 155-271 mg/dl (4.0-7.0 mmol/liter). All patients received
   dietary advice. The LIPID study is projected for conclusion in 1997,
   after a follow-up period of at least 5 years. The primary study
   end-point is mortality due to coronary artery disease (CAD). The
   Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (45) is the first secondary
   prevention trial to show a reduction in total mortality with
   lipid-lowering therapy. However, the LIPID study should continue for the
   following reasons: (1) important differences exist between the LIPID
   study and 45 cohorts. Overall, >80\% of the LIPID patients could not
   have been included in 45 on the basis of their cholesterol level, age,
   or history of CAD; (2) the LIPID study will also provide important
   information on noncoronary mortality and on other groups, such as women
   and diabetic patients, who have been underrepresented in previous
   trials; (3) the LIPID study design allows for clinical management,
   including lipid-lowering therapy, to be at the discretion of the
   physician managing a trial patient. The 45 results have been brought to
   the attention of all LIPID investigators, Institutional Ethics
   Committees, the physicians of the individual patients, and the patients
   themselves. After reviewing 45 results, any physician who is convinced
   of the benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy for a particular patient
   can commence active treatment; (4) revised power calculations, including
   assumptions that the number of drop-in patients will increase even up to
   40\%, with only 1\% reduction in deaths due to CAD for each 1\%
   reduction in the level of total cholesterol, show that the LIPID study
   is still scientifically viable.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (AChE) contains three tetrameric sets of
   catalytic subunits disulfide-linked to structural subunits of a
   collagenic tail. This form is localized in the basement membrane zone of
   the neuromuscular junction, where it interacts with proteoglycans. It
   has been described that heparin-binding domains of many proteins
   contains clusters of basic residues. Here we show that protamine - a
   highly basic protein - specifically solubilizes asymmetric AChE from the
   rat neuromuscular junction, starting at 25 mu g/ml and reaching a
   plateau at 250 mu g/ml protamine. We also show that protamine was able
   to displace AChE bound to heparin-agarose. Two synthetic peptides
   corresponding to the sequence of the collagenic tail polypeptide also
   release the enzyme. Finally, we propose that two heparin-binding
   consensus sequences (-B-B-X-B-) are present in the tail of AChE. Our
   results indicate that clusters of basic residues are responsible for the
   interaction of the collagen-tailed AChE with proteoglycans.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the Hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent
   recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous)
   sequences during transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae was
   investigated, By using as donor in transformation cloned fragments
   1.7-17.5\% divergent in DNA sequence from the recipient, it was observed
   that the Hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and
   the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other
   fragments, In the latter case, the Hex system becomes saturated
   (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a
   single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome, Further
   investigation with chromosomal donor DNA, carrying only one genetically
   marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can
   lead to saturation of the Hex system, Increase in cellular concentration
   of either HexA, the MutS homologue that binds mismatches, or HexB, the
   MutL homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains
   obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating
   conditions, Investigation of heterospecific transformation by
   chromosomal DNA from two related streptococcal species, Streptococcus
   oralis and Streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the
   Hex system, Therefore the Hex system is not a barrier to interspecies
   recombination in S, pneumoniae, These results are discussed in light of
   those described for the Mut system of Escherichia coli.}},

Abstract = {{The structures at 2.0 and 2.25 Angstrom resolution of native and
   recombinant nitrite reductase from Alcaligenes faecalis show that they
   are identical to each other and very similar to nitrite reductase from
   Achromobacter cycloclastes. The crystallographic structure of a mutant,
   M150E, which unlike the wildtype protein cannot be reduced by
   pseudoazurin, shows that the glutamate replacement for methionine binds
   to a metal at the type I Cu site via only one oxygen. Anomalous
   scattering data collected at wavelengths of 1.040 and 1.377 Angstrom
   reveal that the metal at the type I site is a Zn. No significant
   differences from the native structure other than local perturbations at
   the type I site are seen, A local pseudo 2-fold axis relates the two
   domains of different monomers which form the active site. The two
   residues, Asp98 and His255, believed to be involved in catalysis are
   related by this 2-fold. An unusual + - + charge interaction between
   Lys269, Glu279, and His100 helps to orient the active site Cu ligand,
   His100. A number of negatively charged surface residues create an
   electrostatic field whose shape suggests that it may serve to direct
   incoming negatively charged nitrite as well as to dock the electron
   donor partner, pseudoazurin.}},

Abstract = {{The Hox gene products are DNA-binding proteins, containing a
   homeodomain, which function as a class of master control proteins
   establishing the body plan in organisms as diverse as Drosophila and
   vertebrates, Hox proteins have recently been shown to bind cooperatively
   to DNA with another class of homeodomain proteins that include
   extradenticle, Pbx1, and Pbx2, Hox gene products contain a highly
   conserved hexapeptide connected by a linker of variable length to the
   homeodomain, We show that the hexapeptide and the linker region are
   required for cooperativity with Pbx1 and Pbx2 proteins, Many of the
   conserved residues present in the Hoxb-8 hexapeptide are required to
   modulate the DNA binding of the Pbx proteins, Position of the
   hexapeptide relative to the homeodomain is important, Although deletions
   of two and four residues of the linker peptide still show cooperative
   DNA binding, removal of all six linker residues strongly reduces
   cooperativity. In addition, an insertion of 10 residues within the
   linker peptide significantly lowers cooperative DNA binding, These
   results show that the hexapeptide and the position of the hexapeptide
   relative to the homeodomain are important determinants to allow
   cooperative DNA binding involving Hox and Pbx gene products.}},

Abstract = {{The Tibetan Slab gneisses are currently considered as the source for the
   High-Himalayan leucogranites. The rare-earth element distributions in
   zircons from the Tibetan Slab migmatites and the Manaslu leucogranite
   (Nepal Himalaya), were investigated by in situ ion probe analysis. These
   data combined with textural information have been used to elucidate the
   zircon growth conditions and, indirectly, the processes involved in
   incipient anatexis and evolution of granitic magmas.
   In the migmatites, the zircons from gneisses and melanosomes have
   rounded shapes and variable REE patterns with low Yb contents (145-700
   ppm) and chondrite-normalized (Yb/Sm)(N) ratios (less than or equal to
   81). Zircons from low-Zr tonalitic leucosomes are morphologically and
   chemically indistinguishable from those of the gneisses and melanosomes.
   Zircons from the high-Zr tonalitic leucosomes and granitic leucosomes
   are euhedral and show higher Yb contents (409-2820 ppm) and (Yb/Sm),
   ratios (greater than or equal to 145) than those of the gneisses and
   melanosomes. The euhedral shapes and distinctive REE patterns of zircons
   from the high-Zr leucosomes and granitic leucosomes are consistent with
   crystallization from a melt, whereas the morphological and chemical
   similarities of zircons from the low-Zr leucosomes with those from the
   gneisses and melanosomes suggest inheritance without significant
   chemical change.
   In the Manaslu granite, zircons have rounded cores with REE patterns
   distinct from those of the rims (e.g., 250 ppm less than or equal to Yb
   less than or equal to 710 ppm in the core, 965 ppm less than or equal to
   Yb less than or equal to 2775 ppm in the rim) but comparable to those
   from the Tibetan Slab gneisses suggesting inheritance. The rim
   compositions, however, are distinct from those of either zircon types of
   the Tibetan Slab leucosomes, indicating that the leucosomes cannot be
   the unsegregated equivalent to the Manaslu granite parental magma,
   Comparison of the rim compositions with fractional crystallization
   models suggests that the range in zircon Sm and Yb contents are
   consistent with zircon crystallization from a monazite-saturated,
   xenotime-undersaturated melt. The Yb contents in the different zircons
   studied, and their variation within a single zircon, further suggest
   boundary-layer effects and magma compositional heterogeneity, in
   agreement with previous models which considered that the Manaslu granite
   resulted from the aggregation of magma batches.}},

Abstract = {{We have stained an unusual population of retinal bipolar cells. When the
   low molecular weight tracer biocytin was injected into the vitreous body
   of rabbits, it subsequently accumulated in the somata and processes of a
   population of wide-field bipolar cells. The cells have 2-4 primary
   dendrites. Their dendritic arbors span a field 50 to 200 mu m in
   diameter. The axonal arbors are sparse and often highly asymmetric. The
   longest dimension of the axonal arbor ranges from 100 to 300 mu m. The
   cells are moderately evenly spaced. They make up less than 1\% of the
   total population of bipolar cells in the rabbit retina.
   With the whole population stained, regularities in the spatial
   arrangement of nearby cells can be recognized. Their dendrites often run
   to a common point, where they have the appearance of making contact with
   each other. A similar arrangement is seen for the cells' axonal arbors,
   so that the whole population is spatially linked in both the outer
   retina and the inner. The exact nature of the points of conjunction
   cannot be learned from light microscopy. One possibility is that the
   processes run together because they contact a common target. If so, the
   target structures (one in the outer retina and one in the inner) must be
   sparse. An alternative is that the points of conjunction represent
   synapses or gap junctions among wide-field bipolars of this type. (C)

Abstract = {{N-Bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (DHPN) is a very potent mutagen and
   wide spectrum carcinogen in rodents. In the present study, we
   investigated mutational activation of the Ki-ras gene in eight thyroid,
   five kidney (four mesenchymal and one transitional cell lesion) and two
   lung tumors induced with DHPN. Mutations were identified using
   single-strand conformation polymorphism, restriction fragment length
   polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. All of the 15 neoplasms could
   be shown to have mutations in codon 12 (GGT --> GAT). These results
   suggest that Ki-ras mutations are frequent events during the development
   of DHPN-induced carcinomas in these organs. In a separate experiment,
   moreover, we analyzed the presence of Ki-ras mutations in various:
   tissues 8 weeks after DHPN treatment. One of five thyroid tissues
   treated with DHPN was found to have the same characteristic mutation,

Abstract = {{Two volcanic tuffs of the Tomioka area (central Japan) were selected
   from a fossiliferous marine succession of Late Senavallian age (Miocene)
   and dated using the incremental heating Ar-40/Ar-39 technique. The
   Kitamura Tuff, located 10 m below the regional first occurrence (FO) of
   the planktonic foraminifera Globigerina nepenthes, yielded a biotite age
   of 11.79 +/- 0.08 Ma. The Baba Tuff, located 180 m above the previous
   one, yielded ages of 11.26 +/- 0.09 Ma (biotite), 11.29 +/- 0.12 Ma
   (sanidine) and similar to 11.3 Ma (plagioclase). Isochron ages are
   similar to the plateau ages.
   The FO of G. nepenthes is estimated to have an age of 11.76 +/- 0.10 Ma
   in Japan, Similarly precise results obtained from the Central Apennines
   (biotite: 11.48 +/- 0.13 Ma) lead to an age estimate of 11.53 Ma for the
   same FO in an Italian section. The age difference between sections is of
   the same magnitude as the analytical errors. However, the potential
   diachronism of the biostratigraphic signal has been independently
   estimated at 0.25 Ma. The FO of G. nepenthes and FO of Neogloboquadrina
   acostaensis are commonly taken as index for the beginning of N14 and end
   of N15 foraminiferal biozones, respectively. In the Italian section, the
   time interval between the two signals - i,e. the duration of the two
   biozones - may be estimated at 0.3 Ma. The Serravallian-Tortonian
   boundary located near the dated layers can be estimated to have an age
   of similar to 11.25 +/- 0.20 Ma.}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance to ketamine (KET) induced blockade of cortical spreading
   depression (CSD) was investigated in 31 rats anesthetized with
   pentobarbital. CSD was elicited by injection of 1 mu l of 5\% KCl into
   cortex at 15 min intervals and monitored by recording the accompanying
   slow potential waves. After control recording, five injections of KET
   (50 mg/kg) were applied at 75 min intervals. The first KET injection
   elicited CSD blockade lasting for 30-45 min at the near and for 60-75
   min at the far electrode. The CSD blocking effect of subsequent
   injections gradually declined and was not recognizable after the fifth
   KET injection. MK-801 (2.5 mg/kg) injected to rats with fully developed
   KET tolerance 30 min after the last KET dose, failed to block CSD.
   Without KET pretreatment the same dosage of MK-801 induced CSD blockade
   lasting more than 1 h. KET tolerance did not prevent local CSD blockade
   in a cortical area superfused with 10(-3) mol/l AP5. It is concluded
   that repeated applications of KET may induce some conformational changes

Abstract = {{The human carcinogen vinyl chloride is metabolized in the liver to
   reactive intermediates which generate various ethenobases in DNA. It has
   been reported that 1,N-G-ethenoadenine (epsilon A) is excised by a DNA
   glycosylase present in human cell extracts, whereas protein extracts
   from Escherichia coli and yeast were devoid of such an activity. We
   confirm that the human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (ANPG protein)
   excises epsilon A residues. This finding was extended to the rat (ADPG
   protein), We show, at variance with the previous report, that pure E.
   coli 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II (AlkA protein) as well as its
   yeast counterpart, the MAG protein, excise epsilon A from double
   stranded oligodeoxynucieotides that contain a single epsilon A. Both
   enzymes act as DNA glycosylases. The full length and the truncated human
   (ANPG 70 and 40 proteins, respectively) and the rat (ADPG protein)
   3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylases activities towards epsilon A are 2-3
   orders of magnitude more efficient than the E. coli or yeast enzyme for
   the removal of epsilon A. The K-m of the various proteins were measured.
   They are 24, 200 and 800 nM for the ANPG, MAG and AlkA proteins
   respectively, These three proteins efficiently cleave duplex
   oligonucleotides containing epsilon A positioned opposite T, G, C or
   epsilon A. However the MAG protein excises A opposite cytosine much
   faster than opposite thymine, guanine or adenine.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are presented of the long time behaviour of
   viscous columnar vortices subject to non-uniform axial stretching. The
   relevant result is that the vortices reach a steady state even when the
   axial average of the strain is zero, such that they are being compressed
   during half of their extent. The structure of the flow is analysed and
   shown to range from local Burgers equilibrium to massive separation. For
   an intermediate range of Reynolds numbers the vortices are more or less
   uniform and compact, and it is suggested that this condition is related
   to the strong vortices observed in turbulent flows. The reason for the
   survival of the vortices under compression is traced to induced axial
   pressure gradients and to the viscous cancellation of outgoing
   vorticity. Theoretical analyses of the linear Burgers' regime and of the
   onset of separation are presented and compared to the numerical
   experiments. The results are related to the observation of intermittency
   in turbulence, and shown to be consistent both with the observed scaling
   of vortex diameter, and with the lack of intermittency of the velocity
   signal.}},

Abstract = {{Many new drugs in the future will be very expensive and have major
   resource implications. Given current structures and legislation covering
   the prescribing of drugs, there are no clear means of controlling the
   use of these drugs to avoid diverting money away from other health care
   services and into drug treatment. This paper considers what mechanisms
   might be used by a purchaser to manage the introduction of an expensive
   new drug and uses interferon beta-1b for treating multiple sclerosis as
   an example. The most likely mechanism is the prescribing of the drug by
   a general practitioner on the advice of a neurologist. This would
   achieve a good benefit for the resources invested but would not control
   total expenditure. Devolving a limited budget for the drug to a
   specialist centre so that neurologists may prescribe it directly would
   be preferable, as this would link clinical, prescribing, and budgetary
   responsibility. These issues need to be addressed urgently by purchasers
   if major disruptions of services are to be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG) with normal karyotype is a

   previously cloned follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene had
   been assigned to 2p, we searched it for mutations, A C566T transition in
   exon 7 of FSHR predicting an Ala to Val substitution at residue 189 in
   the extracellular ligand-binding domain segregated perfectly with the
   disease phenotype. Expression of the gene in transfected cells
   demonstrated a dramatic reduction of binding capacity and signal
   transduction, but apparently normal ligand-binding affinity of the
   mutated receptor. We conclude that the mutation causes ODG in these

Abstract = {{Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were examined for the expression of
   pro-enkephalin mRNA, protein, and Met-enkephalin ({[}Met]-Enk) peptide.
   Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) and in situ
   hybridization demonstrated the presence of pro-enkephalin mRNA in these
   cells. Immunocytochemistry using an antibody which recognizes
   pro-enkephalin and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed
   by radioimmunoassay indicated that pro-enkephalin was synthesized in
   these cells and processed to yield the bioactive pentapeptide,
   {[}Met]-Enk. Furthermore, release studies showed that the {[}Met]-Enk
   was secreted from these cells with high K+ stimulation. Using double
   labeling, in situ hybridization combined with immunocytochemistry, we
   demonstrated that prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) mRNA is colocalized with
   pro-enkephalin in the same Neuro-2a cells, suggesting that this enzyme
   may be responsible for processing this precursor. We also showed the
   presence of vasopressin mRNA and arginine-vasopressin peptide in these
   cells using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively.
   Thus, the Neuro-2a cells are a multiple neuropeptide-producing cell line
   and an excellent model for studying the mechanisms involved in the
   synthesis, intracellular targeting and processing of endogenous
   pro-enkephalin and pro-vasopressin, as well as other transfected
   neuropeptide precursors.}},

Abstract = {{Lysosomal enzymes and IGF-II both bind to the mannose 6-phosphate
   (M6P)/IGF-II receptor. This receptor targets newly synthesized lysosomal
   enzymes to lysosomes. The functional meaning of IGF-II binding to this
   receptor is not well known. We have Postulated that IGF-II may affect
   the targeting of lysosomal enzymes in cartilage remodeling. We therefore
   examined the effect of IGF-II, the Ser(29) IGF-II variant (vIGF-II) and
   IGF-I on lysosomal cathepsin B and L activities from post-natal rabbit
   chondrocytes in vitro. This effect was compared with the ability of each
   peptide to stimulate chondrocyte-sulfated proteoglycan synthesis. The
   sulfating dose-response relationship of the IGF peptides corresponded to
   their relative binding affinities for the type I-IGF receptor (IGF-I >
   IGF-II > vIGF-II). The intracellular cathepsin B and L activities were
   inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by IGF-II or vIGF-II.
   Maximal inhibition of cathepsin B and L activities (40 and 30\% below
   controls, respectively) was found after an 8 h treatment with 100 ng/ml
   IGF-II or vIGF-II. By contrast, IGF-I up to 1 mu g/ml or insulin up to 2
   mu g/ml had no inhibitory effect. The relative potency pattern
   corresponded to the binding profile of each ligand for the M6P/IGF-II
   receptor. A treatment of chondrocytes with IGF-I or insulin transiently
   increased the binding of radiolabelled IGF-II at the cell surface to
   similar to 120\% of controls, whereas IGF-II or vIGF-II had no effect.
   Thus, it is unlikely that the inhibition of lysosomal enzyme activities
   by IGF-II peptides could result from a redistribution of M6P/IGF-II
   receptors from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. We
   hypothesize that internalized IGF-II peptides could occupy the
   intracellular M6P/IGF-II binding sites required for the targeting of
   cathepsins B and L to lysosomes.}},

Abstract = {{The primary and gene structures and tissue distribution of porcine
   SPAI-2, a protein that belongs to the WAP protein superfamily and has a
   sodium-potassium ATPase inhibitory activity, were determined by
   molecular cloning and Northern analysis. A full-length cDNA clone was
   isolated from a porcine duodenum cDNA Library. The cDNA insert encoded a
   polypeptide of 187 amino acids, which is composed of three domains: a
   hydrophobic presequence of 21 amino acids, a prosegment of 105 amino
   acids ending with Asp(126), and the mature SPAI-2 sequence of 61 amino
   acids beginning with pro(127). The prosegment contained 16 repeats of a
   hexapeptide that is highly homologous to the repetitive sequence found
   in the transglutaminase domain of the human elafin, an elastase-specific
   inhibitor that also belongs to the WAP superfamily, The repetitive
   sequence was demonstrated to be a good substrate of transglutaminase
   using a recombinant preparation produced in Escherichia coli. A porcine
   genomic Library was then screened for the SPAI gene. Characterization
   and sequencing of positive clones indicated that the gene is similar to
   the elafin gene, having 3 exons encoding the 5'-untranslated region and
   signal sequence, proSPAI, and 3'-untranslated region, respectively.
   Northern blot analysis revealed intestine-specific expression of SPAI
   mRNA; the message was especially abundant in the small intestine,
   ProSPAI was also found in the circulation. The similarity of proSPAI to
   elafin in the domain structure, the acid-labile nature of the cleavage
   site (Asp(126)-pro(127)), and the fact that the major form of SPAI in
   the plasma is proSPAI strongly suggest that proSPAI is not the precursor
   but rather it is the native form of SPAI. Like elafin, therefore, SPAI
   appears to be a new type of biologically active substance with a
   transglutaminase substrate domain that acts as an anchoring sequence.}},

Abstract = {{As potential targets for polyphosphoinositides, activation of protein
   kinase C (PKC) isotypes (beta(1), epsilon, zeta, eta) and a member of
   the PKC-related kinase (PRK) family, PRK1, has been compared in vitro.
   PRK1 is shown to be activated by both phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P-2) as well as phosphatidylinositol
   3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P-3) either as pure sonicated lipids
   or in detergent mixed micelles. When presented as sonicated lipids,
   PtdIns-4,5-P-2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P-3 were equipotent in activating PRK1,
   and, furthermore, sonicated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and
   phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) were equally effective. In detergent mixed
   micelles, PtdIns-4,B-P-2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P-3 also showed a similar
   potency, but PtdIns and PtdSer were 10-fold less effective in this
   assay. Similarly, PKC-beta(1), -epsilon, and -eta were all activated by
   PtdIns-4,5-P-2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P-3 in detergent mixed micelles. The
   activation constants for PtdIns-4,5-P, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P, were
   essentially the same for all the kinases tested, implying no specificity
   in this in vitro analysis. Consistent with this conclusion, the effects
   of PtdIns-4,5-P-2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P-3 were found to be inhibited at 10
   mM Mg2+ and mimicked by high concentrations of inositol hexaphosphate
   and inositol hexasulfate. The similar responses of these two classes of
   lipid-activated protein kinase to these phosphoinositides are discussed
   in light of their potential roles as second messengers.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To review postmarketing experience of adverse reactions associated
   with nefopam.
   Methods. Spontaneous reports of adverse reactions associated with
   nefopam over a 12 year period received by the New Zealand Centre for
   Adverse Reactions Monitoring were reviewed.
   Results. There were 70 reports of adverse reactions thought to be
   causally related to nefopam, most of which appear to be predictable
   extensions of the pharmacological effect of nefopam, and included
   confusion, hallucinations, convulsions, dizziness, headache, sweating,
   urinary retention, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia and palpitations. The
   first report of angina is described. Convulsions occurred in a stable
   epileptic in whom nefopam was contraindicated, and in another where the
   seizure threshold may have been lowered by a concomitant tricyclic
   antidepressant.
   Conclusions. Nefopam can cause unpleasant adverse effects and there are
   important cautions and contraindications with this analgesic. A clearer
   presentation of its basic pharmacology in the datasheet should help to
   ensure appropriate use.}},

Abstract = {{The three-state Ports antiferromagnetic model on the triangular lattice
   (3PAFT) has a weak first-order transition in the pure case. The
   first-order nature follows from analytic arguments and while it has been
   observed in some simulations, the precision of (and internal
   disagreement between) these observations has left much to be desired.
   The 3PAFT is the only two-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ports model with
   an ordered phase that does not have an infinite degeneracy, that remains
   without an exact value for its critical point. This model is expected to
   exhibit interesting glassy behaviour and a possible crossover to a
   second-order transition upon dilution. A careful characterization of the
   nature of the pure transition is needed in order to explore the physics
   of the dilute model. We find clear indication of a first-order
   transition at T-t = 0.627 31 +/- 0.000 06, using a cluster method that
   can be extended to the dilute case and histogram reweighting analysis.
   Our estimate is two orders of magnitude more precise than previous
   simulations and falls within the error bounds of a reanalysis of
   existing series expansion (T-t = 0.628 +/- 0.004) reported on herein.}},

Abstract = {{Some aspects of the bound state and scattering properties of a quantum
   mechanical particle in an arbitrary scalar N-prong potential are
   considered. Such a study is relevant in applications to mesoscopic
   devices. Multi-prong potentials are in some way intermediate between
   one- and two-dimensional systems. In contrast to the one-dimensional
   situation, where there is no degeneracy, the energy levels for the case
   of N identical prongs exhibit an alternating pattern of non-degeneracy
   and (N - 1)-fold degeneracy. We generalize the techniques of
   supersymmetric quantum mechanics to multi-prong systems and generate
   solutions to new N-prong systems. Solutions for prongs of arbitrary
   lengths are developed. Scattering on piecewise constant potentials and
   tunnelling in N-well potentials are discussed in detail. Since our
   treatment is for general values of N, the results can be studied in the
   large N-limit. A somewhat surprising result is that a free particle
   incident on an N-prong vertex undergoes continuously increased
   backscattering as the number of prongs is increased.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to obtain the intrinsic kinetics of Fischer-Tropsch (FT)
   synthesis over the Fe-Cu-K catalyst, which. is sensitive to reaction
   temperature, has been developed. The initial activity of the fresh
   catalyst was depressed (passivated) under a pressure of 3.15 MPa and at
   a temperature of 573 K before measuring the kinetic data. The `lumping'
   (i.e. considering the reaction products in terms of six species;CH4,
   CO2, H2O, C-2(+), C-2+(0), and C-1+(OH)) of chemical reactions was used
   to deal with kinetic models. On the basis of kinetic data for the fresh
   catalyst and the intrinsic kinetics for the passivated catalyst, the
   intrinsic kinetics over the Fe-Cu-K catalyst for the FT synthesis was
   proposed by regression of the pre-exponential factor, k(0) and the
   Arrhenius rate constant. The intrinsic kinetic model is in agreement
   with those obtained by enol theory. The intrinsic kinetic activation
   energy and enthalpy of adsorption are 66.52 kJ mol(-1) and -65.412 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The intrinsic kinetics indicates that the
   inhibition of the reaction by water is significant, but no inhibition by
   carbon dioxide was observed under the conditions investigated.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the effect of isospin-violating meson-nucleon coupling
   constants on low-energy pion-nucleon scattering. We compute the
   couplings in the context of a nonrelativistic quark model. The
   difference between the up and down constituent masses induces a coupling
   of the neutral pion to the proton that is slightly larger than the
   corresponding one for the neutron. This difference generates a large
   isospin-violating correction - proportional to the isospin-even
   contribution arising from the nucleon Born terms - to the
   charge-exchange (pi(-)p --> pi(0)n) amplitude. In contrast to the
   isospin-conserving case, this correction is not cancelled by sigma-meson
   exchange; in our model there is no isospin-violating NN sigma coupling
   at q(2) = 0. As a result, we find a violation of the triangle identity
   consistent with the one reported by Gibbs, Ai, and Kaufmann from a

Abstract = {{The tumor suppressor candidate p16(INK4) is a cyclin-dependent kinase
   inhibitor that inhibits cell proliferation, The p16 coding gene is often
   mutated in glioblastomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas and melanoma-prone
   pedigrees, but, until recently, the significance of these allelic
   variants has remained unclear. Here, we used interaction mating and
   coprecipitation to measure interaction of seven p16 allelic variants
   detected in melanoma-prone pedigrees with Cyclin-dependent kinases
   (Cdks), We found that most variants were deficient in interaction with
   Cdk4 and Cdk6. One defective variant was found both in cancer prone
   families and in the control population and therefore previously defined
   as a common polymorphism. Another variant, which is weakly linked to
   familial cancer, is only slightly affected in interaction with Cdks.
   These results are consistent with the idea that p16 allelic variants
   that decrease Cdk interaction predispose individuals who carry them to
   an increased risk of cancer. Moreover, they suggest that determination
   of affinity between p16 mutants and partner proteins may help identify
   functionally-significant allelic variants not detected by classical
   human genetic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The first in situ kinetics investigation of benzene formation from
   acetylene (2.5 L) on Pd(111) is reported. Laser-induced thermal
   desorption with Fourier transform mass spectrometry is used to monitor
   the surface molecular composition as a function of temperature and
   reaction time. The reaction occurs in a stepwise mechanism, the
   rate-determining step being the reaction of 1 equiv of acetylene with 1
   equiv of C4H4 surface intermediate (formed at similar to 110 K) to form
   benzene. At low temperatures (less than or equal to 210 K), the reaction
   is self-poisoning by site blocking, and the reaction ceases with excess
   acetylene remaining. Heating to 260 K, however, drives the reaction to
   completion. Below 210 K, the reaction is observed to be pseudo zeroth
   order in acetylene surface concentration, but follows pseudo-first order
   kinetics overall. The activation barrier for benzene formation is 43.5
   +/- 4.5 kJ/mol with a preexponential of 10(9.8+/-0.1) s(-1).
   Additionally, butadiene is observed, confirming the presence of C-4
   species on the surface.}},

   two with solid millimeter-wave detections of molecular gas. The
   continuum data are assembled from the literature, from a new analysis of
   IRAS measurements, and from new measurements in the near-infrared,
   optical, and at 1.25 mm. The spectral shapes and luminosities of the two
   objects are nearly identical from the rest submillimeter to 20 mu m, but
   they diverge dramatically in the optical/ultraviolet. A simple unifying
   obscuration/reflection model is presented that may explain the
   differences. Considering their very similar molecular gas content,
   together with evidence based on the continuum energy distributions and
   optical spectropolarimetry, it appears quite plausible that the
   Cloverleaf and F10214+4724 in fact differ for the most part only in

   the external mass flux, the external pressure, and a dimensionless
   factor, which regulates the mass deposition rate along the flow. Three
   different assumptions on the supernova rate have been considered. A
   moderate value for the supernova rate in elliptical galaxies is found to
   be preferred. Confining pressures of p(ext) similar to 4-15 x 10(3) K
   cm(-3) and significant accretion rates of external material, up to 4 M.

   minute band, the f- and p(1)-modes would be expected to suffer
   substantial absorption, but p-modes of higher radial order would not be
   damped sufficiently to account for observations. On the other hand, in
   the higher frequency range (greater than or equal to 5 mHz), damping
   lengths off and p(1)-p(3) modes are smaller than or comparable to

Abstract = {{The mouse WASP gene, the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich
   syndrome, has been isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid
   sequence is 86\% identical to the human WASP sequence. A distinct
   feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic GGA trinucleotide
   repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in
   different Mus musculus strains. The genomic structure of the mouse gene
   closely resembles the human with respect to exon-intron positions and
   intron lengths. The mouse WASP gene is expressed as an similar to 2.4-kb
   mRNA in thymus and spleen. Chromosomal mapping in an interspecific M.
   musculus/M. spretus backcross placed the Wasp locus near the centromere
   of the mouse X chromosome, inseparable from Gatal, Tcfe3, and scurfy
   (sf). This localization makes Wasp a candidate for involvement in
   scurfy, a T cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has
   previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
   Northern analysis of sf tissue samples indicated the presence of WASP
   mRNA in liver and skin, presumably as a consequence of lymphocytic

Abstract = {{We present identifications, fluxes, and sizes for H II regions in three
   galaxies that are in or near the Local Group: WLM, UGC A86, and EGB
   0427+63. A deep search for H II regions in a fourth galaxy, LGS 3,
   produced a negative result. Our results for UGC A86 indicate that,
   contrary to a previous suggestion, it is a single galaxy. Its disjointed
   appearance in broadband images apparently is caused by the presence of
   several star-forming regions of different ages. Our data, together with
   other information about it, especially its radial velocity, also suggest
   that this object is beyond the limits of the Local Group.
   The H II regions of the three galaxies in which they were detected show
   normal luminosity functions that fit power laws and normal size
   distributions that are reasonably well fitted by an exponential
   function. The calculated star formation rates range from zero for LGS 3
   to 0.014 M. yr(-1) for UGC A86.
   Emission-line spectra of seven H II regions in the three galaxies allow
   abundances to be determined. We find that all are low in heavy elements,
   with mean values for O/H of approximately 7\% solar.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effect of fluorine on the bonding of selectively
   fluorinated propenes (CH3CH=CH2, CFH2CH=CH2, CF3CH=CH2, CF3CH=CF2 and
   CF3CF=CF2) to the Cu(111) surface using temperature programmed
   desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy
   (HREELS). The fluorinated propenes adsorb reversibly at low
   temperatures, desorbing during heating at 120-140 K. TPD measurements
   indicated that the desorption activation energy increased with
   increasing fluorination of the propene molecule. Specifically, the
   desorption activation energy increased from 5.9 +/- 0.9 and 5.5 +/- 0.6
   kcal/mol for propene and 3-fluoropropene respectively to 8.1 +/- 0.9
   kcal/mol for trifluoropropene. Further fluorination of propene did not
   increase the desorption activation energy (E(d) = 9.0 +/- 1.5 kcal/mol
   for 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropene and E(d) = 8.0 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol for
   hexafluoropropene). HREELS was used to monitor changes in the
   vibrational spectrum of the fluorinated propenes upon adsorption.
   Specifically, the nu(C=C) mode was monitored to probe the extent of
   backbonding that occurs between the molecule and metal. A significant,
   downward shift in the frequency of the nu(C=C) mode of the propenes upon
   adsorption would indicate backbonding to the metal surface by the
   adsorbate. However, no changes in the vibrational spectra of any of the
   fluorinated propenes were detected upon adsorption, indicating no
   significant backbonding. Fluorine is found to have a weak effect on the
   adsorbate-metal bond strength but the vibrational spectra do not
   indicate that there is substantial backbonding.}},

Abstract = {{The RecA protein is a key enzyme involved in DNA recombination in
   bacteria. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification we
   cloned a recA homolog from Helicobacter pylori. The gene revealed an
   open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 37.6 kDa showing
   closest homology to the Campylobacter jejuni RecA (75.5\% identity). A
   putative ribosome binding site and a near-consensus sigma(70) promoter
   sequence was found upstream of recA. A second ORF, encoding a putative
   protein with N-terminal sequence homology to prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   enolases, is located directly downstream of recA. Compared to the
   wild-type strains, isogenic H. pylori recA deletion mutants of strains
   69A and NCTC11637 displayed increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light
   and abolished general homologous recombination. The recombinant H.
   pylori RecA protein produced in Escherichia coli strain GC6 (recA(-))
   was 38 kDa in size but inactive in DNA repair, whereas the corresponding
   protein in H. pylori 69A migrated at the greater apparent molecular
   weight of approx. 40 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However,
   complementation of the H. pylori mutant using the cloned recA gene on a
   shuttle vector resulted in a RecA protein of the original size and fully
   restored the general functions of the enzyme. These data can be best
   explained by a modification of RecA in H. pylori which is crucial for
   its function. The potential modification seems not to occur when the
   protein is produced in E. coli, giving rise to a smaller but inactive
   protein.}},

Abstract = {{HD 193793 = WR 140 is a W-R + O binary system with a 7.9 yr, highly
   elliptical (e = 0.85) orbit. It shows variable, nonthermal radio
   emission over its orbital period that is explained as synchrotron
   radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated in the shock between
   the W-R and O winds. Although we now know of quite a few W-R + O star
   binary systems, only HD 193793 is well studied across the entire
   electromagnetic spectrum; hence, it affords us the best opportunity to
   test various models for the system against a wealth of observational
   data. HD 193793 is an ideal laboratory for studying the properties of
   hot star winds and the physics of particle acceleration by strong shocks
   in those winds.
   In this paper we present the results of 8 years of monitoring the radio
   flux density from HD 193793 with the VLA. This database is unique both
   in terms of its dense coverage of an entire binary cycle and because it
   extends the radio coverage to 2 cm wavelength, a shorter wavelength than
   previously available. With these data we are able to simultaneously
   solve for the time-dependent attenuation in the system and the intrinsic
   radio luminosity. The standard model of spherically symmetric colliding
   winds faces severe difficulties in explaining the observations. We
   conclude that the radio data are most readily interpreted if we adopt a
   new model of the system in which the W-R star wind is strongly
   equatorially enhanced, so that most of the mass loss is confined to a
   plane. This model for the W-R wind also provides a natural explanation
   for the sudden formation of dust that causes an infrared outburst just
   after periastron.}},

Abstract = {{In petunia, a mitochondrial (mt) locus, S-Pcf, has been found to be
   strongly associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). The S-Pcf
   locus consists of three open reading frames (ORF) that are
   co-transcribed. The first ORF, Pcf, contains parts of the atp9 and coxII
   genes and an unidentified reading frame, urf-s. The second and third
   ORFs contain NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (nad3) and ribosomal protein
   S12 (rps12) sequences, respectively. The nad3 and rps12 sequences
   included in the S-Pcf locus are identical to the corresponding sequences
   on the mt genome of fertile petunia. In both CMS and fertile petunia,
   only a single copy of nad3 and rps12 has been detected on the physical
   map of the main mt genome. The origin of the urf-s sequence and the
   molecular events leading to the formation of the chimeric S-Pcf locus
   are not known. This paper presents evidence indicating: that two
   different mt sequences, related to urf-s and found in fertile petunia
   lines (orf-h and Rf-1), might have been involved in the molecular
   evolution of the S-Pcf locus. Southern analysis of mtDNA derived from
   both fertile and sterile petunia plants suggests that one of these urf-s
   related sequences (showing 100\% homology to urf-s and termed orf-h) is
   located on a sublimon. An additional, low-homology urf-s related
   sequence (Rf-l) is shown to be located on the main mt genome 5' to the
   nad3 gene. It is, thus, suggested that the sequence of events leading to
   the generation of the S-Pcf locus might have involved introduction of
   the orf-h sequence, via homologous recombination, into the main mt
   genome 5' to nad3 at the region where the Rf-1 sequence is located.}},

Abstract = {{Ion channels formed by the peptide gramicidin A in planar lipid
   membranes have been reported to react very sensitively upon irradiation
   of the membrane by ionizing radiation (radiolysis), by UV light
   (photolysis), or by visible light in the presence of appropriate
   photosensitizers (photodynamic inactivation). In all three cases the
   effect is due to. the presence of the four tryptophan residues of the
   pentadecapeptide. Modifications of these amino acids - due to an
   interaction with free radicals formed upon water radiolysis or due to
   light absorption - have been found to reduce the membrane conductance by
   many orders of magnitude. The present study was intended to correlate
   functional changes, observed at the level of single ion channels, with
   changes of the molecular structure identified by mass spectrometry.
   About 98\% of the inactivated channels showed a single-channel
   conductance of virtually zero, while about 2\% of the channels present
   before irradiation are converted to a state of reduced conductance (and
   reduced Lifetime). On the structural level, irradiation in the presence
   of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal was found to produce oxidation and
   fragmentation of the peptide at the positions of the tryptophan
   residues. Our results provide evidence that the main effect of
   radiolysis, or of photodynamic treatment, is the cleavage of the peptide
   backbone leading to immediate closure of an open ion channel.}},

Abstract = {{The human 5-HT1A receptor was expressed in Sf9 insect cells to examine
   desensitization as manifested by agonist-induced uncoupling from G
   proteins and second messengers. New binding sites were detected after
   infection of cells with the 5-HT1A receptor-bearing baculovirus. 5-HT1A
   receptor agonists caused inhibition of cAMP-accumulation that could be
   attenuated by specific receptor antagonists. Brief pretreatment with
   5-HT resulted in (1) an uncoupling of receptor from G proteins as
   evidenced by a loss of high-affinity agonist binding sites and a
   diminished ability of the receptor to increase incorporation of AA-GTP
   into endogenous G(o alpha)-like G proteins, (2) a decreased ability of
   the receptor to inhibit cAMP accumulation, and (3) increased
   phosphorylation of the 5-HT1A receptor on serine and threonine residues.
   Phosphorylation occurred in the presence of a number of cyclic
   nucleotide dependent kinase inhibitors, and desensitization of the cAMP
   response occurred in the presence of H-7 and also in cells with
   prolonged exposure to PMA. Both phosphorylation and desensitization were
   markedly attenuated by 100 nM and 1 mu M heparin and demonstrated
   similar time courses and concentration-response relationships. Those
   results demonstrate a close association between agonist-induced
   desensitization and phosphorylation of the 5-HT1A receptor in Sf9 cells
   through a pathway that mainly does not involve protein kinase A or C and
   might involve a G protein-linked receptor kinase.}},

Abstract = {{Flavonoids, a group of naturally occurring benzo-gamma-derivatives, have
   been shown to possess several biological properties, many of which may
   be related, partially at least, to their capacity to penetrate into the
   cell membrane and so to affect membrane-dependent processes. In the
   present paper we report the results of an investigation by differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) on the effects of three flavonoids
   (quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin) upon the gel-to-liquid
   crystalline phase transition of model membranes constituted by
   L-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles. All tested
   flavonoids interacted with DPPC liposomes causing different shifts,
   towards lower values, of the T-m typical for DPPC multilayers; the
   enthalpy changes (Delta H), related to the calorimetric peak area,
   remained nearly constant. Furthermore, their effects on DPPC
   thermotropic behaviour were greater for high molar concentrations (up to
   a limit value different for each flavonoid) and were affected by the
   time. Several hypotheses (drug molecule aggregation into the model
   membrane, changes in the barrier function of the lipid bilayer,
   different drug structural features and conformation, possible formation
   of flavonoid-phospholipid complexes) are presented to explain the nature
   of the interaction between flavonoids and phospholipid vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{Charge transfer between Ru(bpy):(2+)(3) (where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine)
   complexes incorporated into a Nafion(R) membrane has been investigated
   using in situ spectrocyclic voltammetry and statistical calculation of
   the intermolecular distance between the complexes. The membrane was
   prepared either by a mixture casting method in which an alcoholic
   mixture solution of Nafion and the complex was cast to form a membrane,
   or by an adsorption method in which the complex was adsorbed from its
   aqueous solution into a precoated Nafion(R) membrane. It has been found
   that the electrochemical reactivity of the complex in a membrane
   prepared by the adsorption method is much higher than that prepared by
   the mixture casting method. The charge transfer distance between the
   complexes (R(0)) in the membrane prepared by the adsorption method was
   1.6 nm (scan rate, 2 mV s(-1); pH 5.5), when assuming a random
   dispersion of the complex, which is significantly longer than that (1.1
   nm) in the membrane prepared by the mixture casting method. The emission
   lifetime of the photoexcited Ru(bpy):(2+)(3) in the membrane suggests
   that the complex is localized in the membrane when it is prepared by an
   adsorption method; such localization would make the calculated R(0)
   value greater than the real value. The fraction of the volume in the
   membrane where the complex is adsorbed was estimated as 20 +/- 3\%, by
   comparing the real local complex concentration in the membrane obtained
   from the R(0) value (1.1 nm) for the mixture casting system with the
   apparent average complex concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide appears to mediate growth factor actions, and it
   inhibits DNA synthesis in normal mouse osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) at
   non-toxic doses. However the sensitivity of cells to H2O2 is greatly
   decreased in their ras-transformants. To understand the molecular basis
   of this sensitivity to H2O2, we attempted to identify H2O2-inducible
   cDNA clones from MC3T3 cells by differential screening of cDNA
   libraries, and one of such genes, named HIC-53, was isolated. The level
   of HIC-53 mRNA was moderately increased by H2O2 as well as by calcium
   ionophore or dexamethasone, but was not increased by the addition of
   serum, tumor promoting phorbol ester, or epidermal growth factor. Among
   mouse organs, HIC-53 mRNA levels were higher in the kidney and lung, but
   were almost undetectable in the brain, heart, bone, muscle or spleen. In
   MC3T3 cells transformed with v-Ki-ras, the HIC-53 mRNA level was
   markedly decreased, and effect of H2O2 was abolished. Although the
   biological function of HIC-53 is unknown at present, the predicted amino
   acid sequence exhibited some similarity with bovine cardiac Na+/Ca+
   exchanger. The nucleotide sequence of HIC-53 cDNA showed no significant
   similarity with other known gene sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Condensation of 3-azidobenzo{[}b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 1 with
   acetone, diethyl malonate, ethyl acetoacetate and pentane-2,4-dione
   furnished the 3-azido-2-vinylic derivatives 4a-d in fairly good yields.
   In refluxing toluene the azides 4a, b,d smoothly gave solely fused
   pyrrole products, 5a, b, d, whereas the azide 4c furnished an isomeric
   mixture of the cyclized pyrroles 5c and 6. The observed 1H-pyrroles 5a-d
   and 6 are assumed to occur through aromatization of initially formed
   2H-pyrroles 7a-d. Attempted condensation of
   2-azidobenzo{[}b]thiophene-3-carbaldehyde 2 with acetone or
   pentane-2,4-dione gave no vinylic product, but instead resulted in
   reduction of the azide 2 to the amine 8 or in its conversion into the
   1,2,3-triazole adduct 9, respectively.
   Azido group transfer of 3-styrylbenzo{[}b]thiophene with tosyl azide
   yielded the ortho-vinyl-substituted azide 10, but in poor yield.
   Thermolysis of the azide 10 gave quantitatively the benzothiopyran 12
   clearly ascribable to an initial ring-opening reaction. It is therefore
   inferred that, in the presence of ortho-vinyl substituent, an
   alpha-azidobenzo{[}b]thiophene can exhibit `normal' ring-cleavage
   fragmentation, in contrast with previous deoxygenations of
   2-nitro-3-vinylbenzo{[}b]thiophenes reported to yield cyclized
   benzothieno{[}2,3b]pyrroles. Evidence is also presented that, upon
   thermolysis, the o-azidoaldehyde 1 cleanly affords a
   benzothienoisoxazole product, whereas the isomeric azide 2 essentially
   leads to intractable material.,}},

Abstract = {{Stromelysin-3 (STR-3) is a recently characterized matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP) that was cloned on the basis of differential
   expression in benign and malignant breast tumors. This MMP has a unique
   processing mechanism and substrate specificity. Unlike previously
   characterized MMPs that are secreted as inactive zymogens, STR-3 is
   processed within the constitutive secretory pathway and secreted as an
   active enzyme. Although STR-3 has a characteristic MMP structure, the
   enzyme does not hydrolyze many of the extracellular matrix components
   that are substrates for other MMPs. However, STR-3 cleaves certain
   serine protease inhibitors (serpins), including the alpha 1 proteinase
   inhibitor (alpha 1 anti-trypsin). Because alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor
   deficiency has a known pathogenetic role in pulmonary disease, the role
   of STR-3 in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) is of great interest.
   STR-3 transcripts and protein were significantly more abundant in
   primary NSCLC than in adjacent normal lung specimens in an extensive
   panel of stage I-III squamous cell and adenocarcinomas. The major form
   of STR-3 detectable in the primary NSCLC was the mature fully processed
   active enzyme. STR-3 transcripts and protein were primarily localized to
   NSCLC stromal elements, prompting analysis of STR-3 induction in normal
   pulmonary fibroblasts. Although STR-3 could be induced in normal
   pulmonary fibroblasts with growth factors (basic fibroblast growth
   factor and platelet-derived growth factor) and/or
   12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, STR-3 induction was inhibited by
   all-trans retinoic acid, a commonly used chemopreventive agent for
   aerodigestive tract malignancies. Taken together, these data suggest
   that STR-3 may be a novel marker and potential therapeutic target in
   NSCLC.}},

Abstract = {{Background Glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia are common
   disturbances in nondiabetic men with premature coronary artery disease
   (CAD). To investigate the relation between insulin-like molecules and
   severity of coronary atherosclerosis, 62 consecutive nondiabetic men
   presenting with a first myocardial infarction before the age of 45 were
   studied along with 41 healthy, age-matched, male, population-based
   control subjects.
   Methods and Results Specific two-site immunoradiometric assays were used
   to distinguish intact proinsulin, (des 31,32)proinsulin, and `'true''
   insulin in fasting plasma and during an oral glucose tolerance test
   (OGTT). Global coronary atherosclerosis and number and severity of
   distinct stenoses were determined in the patients in 15 proximal
   coronary arterial segments by use of separate semiquantitative
   classification systems. The patients had a two- to threefold increase in
   insulin and insulin propeptide concentrations in the fasting state as
   well as during the OGTT. Severity of coronary atherosclerosis correlated
   significantly (P<.05 to P<.01) with basal proinsulin (r=.40) and the
   proinsulin area under the curve (AUG) (r=.34), basal insulin (r=.31),
   basal C peptide (r=.30), and the glucose AUC (r =.30). In multiple
   stepwise regression analysis including insulin-like molecules, major
   plasma lipoproteins, and lipoprotein subfractions, basal proinsulin
   (increase in R(2)=.09) and dense LDL triglycerides (increase in
   R(2)=.10) predicted 19\% of the variation of the global coronary
   atherosclerosis score after adjustment for age, body mass index, fasting
   insulin concentration, and VLDL triglycerides.
   Conclusions This study shows that young, nondiabetic, male survivors of
   myocardial infarction are truly hyperinsulinemic during an OGTT and
   suggests a close association between proinsulin and coronary
   atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{By immunization with a partially purified form of a novel human B cell
   differentiation factor, 446-BCDF, we generated a series of mAbs that
   inhibit the functional activity of this cytokine (induction of Ig
   secretion by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain organisms-activated B
   cells). Two mAbs, 929 and 204, were shown to be specific for 446-BCDF in
   that they failed to inhibit B cell differentiation in response to other
   known cytokines (IL-2, IL-6) or mitogens (PWM). More importantly,
   passage of crude 446-BCDF over a mAb 929-Sepharose 4B column resulted in
   the depletion of 446-BCDF activity, which could be recovered after
   elution with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.8. Finally, TCA precipitation of
   column-eluted fractions was run on SDS-PAGE. Two bands corresponding to
   the previously described m.w. range of 446-BCDF were detected in the
   eluate, but not in the effluent column fractions. Furthermore, protein
   eluted from these bands resolved with nondenaturing gels also
   demonstrated 446-BCDF activity. Thus, together these data further
   support the existence of a novel human B cell differentiation factor

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) produced at high concentrations by the inducible NO
   synthase is an important effector molecule involved in immune regulation
   and defense. We have examined whether NO represents a signal for
   triggering apoptosis in thymocytes. Freshly isolated thymocytes were
   incubated with different chemical NO donors for various intervals.
   Apoptosis was determined by detection of DNA strand breaks with in situ
   nick translation. All NO donors induced thymocyte apoptosis with 30\%
   positive thymocytes vs 10\% in controls after 8 h. Apoptosis was
   prevented by addition of ZnSO4. Short-term pre-exposure to NO resulted
   in protection from apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids comparable with
   the protective effect of heat shock. Flow cytometry revealed that NO
   treatment as well as heat shock or dexamethasone incubation is
   accompanied by reduction in the CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocyte subpopulation.
   Apoptosis induction was accompanied by increased expression of p53, as
   detected by PCR analysis 2 h after NO donor addition. In vivo treatment
   of mice with endotoxin results in increased thymic apoptosis. Focal
   apoptosis was found to occur in close proximity to blood vessels 18 h
   after LPS treatment. Capillary endothelium and dendritic cells adjacent
   to apoptotic foci were found to stain strongly for inducible NO synthase
   expression. Furthermore, in an in vitro experiment using cocultures of
   thymocytes with LPS/cytokine-activated endothelial cells expressing
   inducible NO synthase, a significantly increased rate of thymocyte
   apoptosis was found, and this could be prevented completely by
   inhibiting NO production. Addition of dexamethasone to these cocultures
   did not lead to a further increase in the percentage of apoptotic
   thymocytes, underlining the protective effect of NO on
   dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The folding of the bacterial protease subtilisin BPN' (SET)
   is dependent on its 77-residue prosegment, which is then
   autocatalytically removed to give the mature enzyme. Mature subtilisin
   represents a class of proteins that lacks an efficient folding pathway.
   Refolding of mature SET is extremely slow unless catalyzed by the
   independently expressed prosegment, leading to a bimolecular complex.
   Results: We report the crystal structure at 2.0 Angstrom resolution of
   the prosegment-SBT complex and consider its implications for
   prosubtilisin BPN' maturation and folding catalysis. The prosegment
   forms a compact domain that binds SET through an extensive interface
   involving the enzyme's two parallel surface helices (residues 104-116
   and 133-144), supplying negatively charged caps to the N termini of
   these helices. The prosegment C terminus binds in the enzyme active site
   in a product-like manner, with Tyr77 in the P1 binding pocket.
   Conclusions: The structure of the complex supports a unimolecular
   mechanism for prosubtilisin cleavage, involving a 25 Angstrom

Abstract = {{Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignancy in the adult
   kidney. Because RCC is generally thought to arise from the epithelium of
   the proximal tubules, the expression of Pax-2, a gene required for renal
   epithelium development, was examined in primary tumors and tumor-derived
   cell lines. Immunostaining of frozen sections from the primary tumors
   indicated Pax-2 expression in the malignant cells but not in the
   surrounding stroma. In a panel of human RCC-derived cell lines, 73\%
   expressed Pax-2 protein and mRNA. Treatment of RCC cell lines with
   antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in down-regulation of Pax-2
   protein expression and growth inhibition after 3 days in culture. These
   data indicate that Pax-2 gene function is required for proliferation, as
   well as differentiation during embryonic development, and suggest a
   novel therapy for RCC.}},

Abstract = {{The metalloexozymogen procarboxypeptidase A is mainly secreted in
   ruminants as a ternary complex with zymogens of two serine
   endoproteinases, chymotrypsinogen C and proproteinase E. The bovine
   complex has been crystallized, and its molecular structure analysed and
   refined at 2.6 Angstrom resolution to an R factor of 0.198. In this
   heterotrimer, the activation segment of procarboxypeptidase A
   essentially clamps the other two subunits, which shield the activation
   sites of the former from tryptic attack. In contrast, the propeptides of
   both serine proproteinases are freely accessible to trypsin. This
   arrangement explains the sequential and delayed activation of the
   constituent zymogens. Procarboxypeptidase A is virtually identical to
   the homologous monomeric porcine form. Chymotrypsinogen C displays
   structural features characteristic for chymotrypsins as well as
   elastases, except for its activation domain; similar to bovine
   chymotrypsinogen A, its binding site is not properly formed, while its
   surface located activation segment is disordered. The proproteinase E
   structure is fully ordered and strikingly similar to active porcine
   elastase; its specificity pocket is occluded, while the activation
   segment is fixed to the molecular surface. This first structure of a
   native zymogen from the proteinase E/elastase family does not
   fundamentally differ from the serine proproteinases known so far.}},

Abstract = {{We studied mice expressing one of two H chain transgenes. Both
   transgenes expressed the same 3H9 anti-DNA VDJ, but differed in their
   constant domains. The IgM transgene efficiently induced tolerance and
   selected for a subset of endogenous L chains that prevented dsDNA
   binding. In contrast, the IgG2b secreted-only H chain allowed expression
   of a broad range of L chains, most of which yielded anti-dsDNA Ab. To
   deduce the features of L chains that affect DNA binding, we derived
   hybridomas from LPS-stimulated splenic B cells from the two transgene
   lines and compared the VK sequences of Ab they secreted. identification
   of L chains with related sequences but different binding to ssDNA,
   dsDNA, and cardiolipin allowed us to pinpoint L chain residues that
   correlate with enhanced or reduced binding. Arginines at the junction of
   V kappa 1 or V kappa 8 regions and J kappa 1, and arginines or
   asparagines in CDR1 or CDR2 enhanced DNA binding. Negatively charged
   residues at the same positions were found to interfere with binding.
   Thus, we predict that appropriate amino acids at these positions may
   form contacts with DNA. The likely locations of contact residues in the
   combining site were evaluated by inspection of previously determined Ab
   structures. Our results indicate that L chains in anti-DNA Ab are able
   to modulate DNA binding and contribute contact sites for additional
   determinants on a complex autoantigen.}},

Abstract = {{Sex determination and X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila
   melanogaster are directed by the Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein, In part, Sxl
   functions by regulating the splicing of the transformer pre-mRNA by
   binding to a 3' splice site polypyrimidine tract. Polypyrimidine tracts
   are essential for splicing of metazoan pre-mRNAs. To unravel the
   mechanism of splicing regulation at polypyrimidine tracts we analyzed
   the interaction of Sxl with RNA. The RNA binding activity of Sxl was
   mapped to the two ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence domains of the
   protein. Quantitation of binding showed that both RNA binding domains
   (RBDs) were required in cis for site-specific RNA binding. Individual
   RBDs interacted with RNA more weakly and had lost the ability to
   discriminate between wild-type and mutant transformer polypyrimidine
   tracts. Structural elements in one of the RBDs that are likely to
   interact with a polypyrimidine tract were identified using nuclear
   magnetic resonance techniques. In addition, our data suggest that
   multiple imino protons of the transformer polypyrimidine tract were
   involved in hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, in vitro Sxl bound with
   equal affinity to polypyrimidine tracts of pre-mRNAs that it does not
   regulate in vivo. We discuss the implications of this finding for the
   mechanism through which Sxl may gain selectivity for particular
   polypyrimidine tracts in vivo.}},

Title = {{RHYTHMICAL BURSTS INDUCED BY NMDA IN GUINEA-PIG CHOLINERGIC NUCLEUS
   BASALIS NEURONS IN-VITRO}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON}},
Year = {{1995}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{1. Intracellular recordings were performed in neurones within the basal
   forebrain of guinea-pig brain slices. Following injection of biocytin
   (or biotinamide), a subset of recorded neurones which displayed distinct
   intrinsic membrane properties were confirmed as being cholinergic by
   immuno-histochemical staining for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). They
   were all located within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. The
   response of the cholinergic cells to NMDA and to the agonists of the
   other glutamate receptors was tested by bath application of NMDA,
   t-ACPD, AMPA and kainate.
   2. When depolarized from a hyperpolarized level, cholinergic basalis
   neurones display the intrinsic ability to discharge in rhythmic bursts
   that are generated by low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. In control solution,
   these rhythmic bursts were not sustained for more than 5-6 cycles.
   However, in the presence of NMDA when the membrane was held at it
   hyperpolarized level, low-threshold bursting activity was sustained for
   prolonged periods of time. This activity could be reversibly eliminated
   by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), showing that it
   depended upon specific activation of NMDA receptors.
   3. NMDA-induced, voltage-dependent, rhythmic depolarizations persisted
   in the presence of tetrodo-toxin (TTX), indicating that they did not
   depend upon a TTX-sensitive Na+ current and were generated
   postsynaptically. The rhythmic depolarizations mere, however, eliminated
   by the par tial replacement of of Na+ with choline, demonstrating that
   they did depend upon Na+, the major carrier of the NMDA current.
   4. In the presence of TTX, the NMDA-induced rhythmic depolarizations
   were also eliminated by removal of Ca2+ from or addition of Ni2+ to the
   bath, indicating that they also depended upon Ca2+, which is carried by
   both the NMDA current and the low-threshold Ca2+ current. The duration
   of the rhythmic depolarizations was increased in the presence of apamin,
   suggesting that the repolarization of the cells depended in part upon a
   Ca2+ activated K+ (SK) conductance, but that other mechanisms were
   additionally involved in the repolarization phase of the bursting.
   5. In both the absence and presence of TTX, the NMDA-induced rhythmic
   activity persisted when Mg2+ was removed from the medium, indicating
   that the sustained rhythmic depolarizations did not hinge upon the Mg2+
   block of the NMDA channels during hyperpolarization. The voltage
   dependence of the NMDA-induced rhythmic depolarizations in the absence
   of Mg2+ appeared to be determined by the properties of the low-threshold
   Ca2+ spike in the cholinergic basalis neurones.
   6. These in vitro results show that activation of NMDA channels excites
   cholinergic basalis neurones and mag drive them into tonic firing if
   allowed to depolarize fully or maintain them in a rhythmic bursting mode
   if they are simultaneously held at a hyperpolarized level from which
   intrinsic lon thr threshold Ca2+ spikes are triggered. Assuming the
   presence of contingent hyperpolarizing afferent input, these data
   suggest that brainstem and cortical afferents that release glutamate
   could stimulate rhythmic bursting sia NMDA receptors in the cholinergic
   cells in vivo. Such rhythmic oscillations in the basalis neurones would
   provide a rhythmic modulation to target neurones within the cerebral
   cortex and thereby potentially promote slow oscillations within a delta
   or theta frequency range in cortical activity across the sleep-waking
   cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Protein phosphorylation in vitro was investigated in guard cells from
   Vicia faba. A number of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 72,
   67, 57, 52, 49, 44, 37, and 26 kDa were phosphorylated when guard-cell
   extract was incubated with {[}gamma-P-32]ATP under Ca2+-free conditions.
   In the presence of Ca2+ at 1 mu M, several proteins with apparent
   molecular masses of 125, 83, 41, 31, and 25 kDa were newly
   phosphorylated. These Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylations were
   suppressed by
   (8R{*},9S{*},11S{*})-(-)-9-hydroxy-9-methoxycarbonyl-8-methyl-2,3,9,10-t

   cde]trinden-1-one (K-252a), a wide-range inhibitor of protein kinases,
   suggesting that the protein phosphorylations were mediated by protein
   kinases. Several proteins were phosphorylated in vitro in mesophyll
   extract from Vicia. In contrast to guard cells, there was no detectable
   Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation in mesophyll cells,
   1-(5-Indonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine (ML-7), an
   inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and an antagonist of
   calmodulin (CaM), N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide
   (W-7), inhibited Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of 41- and 25-kDa
   proteins in guard cells. Fractionation experiments revealed that the
   Ca2+-dependent phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 41 and
   25 kDa were present in the mitochondria, and the 125- and 31-kDa
   proteins in the cytosol. These results suggest that Ca2+-dependent
   protein phosphorylation occurs markedly in guard cells, and that
   Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of 41- and 25-kDa proteins may be
   catalyzed by MLCK or MLCK-like protein kinase in guard cells.}},

Abstract = {{Resistance to chemotherapy is a major factor limiting successful
   treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); one of the best characterized
   drug resistance mechanisms is extrusion of drugs by the energy-dependent
   multidrug resistance (MDR1) transport protein. Expression of MDR1 is
   common in AML and has been linked to lower remission induction rates and
   decreased remission durations. Because MDR1 efflux function may be
   modified by drugs such as cyclosporin A, accurate identification of
   MDR1(+)/efflux(+) AML cases will be critical to identify patients who
   may benefit from therapies that contain such MDR1 modulators. We have
   optimized single and multiparameter flow cytometric assays to detect
   efflux of drugs or fluorescent dyes by previously cryopreserved AML
   blasts. These assays allowed precise identification of efflux by
   leukemic blasts, and correlation with CD34 and MDR1 expression. We
   subsequently studied a series of 60 previously untreated AML cases.
   Functional efflux was identified in 39 cases and was significantly
   correlated with MDR1 expression (P = .0002). However, discrepant cases
   were identified; 10 cases were efflux(+) without significant MDR1
   expression, whereas 6 MDR1(+) cases were efflux(-). There was also a
   highly significant correlation of efflux with CD34;31 (79\%) of the 39
   efflux(+) cases were CD34(+) in comparison with only 5 (24\%) of the 21
   efflux(-) cases (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that efflux
   was significantly associated with independent effects of both CD34 (P =
   .0011) and MDR1 expression (P = .034); the majority of efflux(+) cases
   were CD34(+), whereas 5 of the 6 MDR1(+) efflux(-) cases lacked CD34
   expression. Cyclosporin A blocked efflux in all but 2 cases regardless
   of MDR1 expression. Functional efflux in AML is frequently detected
   without the classic MDR1(+) phenotype indicating that alternate
   non-MDR1-mediated efflux mechanisms may be important. Efflux assays may
   better identify patients who would benefit from therapies that include
   efflux modulators. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetization (M) comes from both the persistent currents and the spin
   polarization. The spin-B interaction is important in a graphene tubule,
   because it makes the one-dimensional subband with the divergent density
   of states capable of crossing the Fermi level (E(F)=0 eV). It causes
   cusps in magnetization and power divergencies in differential
   susceptibility (chi(M)), and destroys the periodicity (period
   phi(0)=hc/e) of the physical properties. The special structures shown in
   M and chi(M) are found to be insensitive to the chirality. The power
   divergencies in chi(M) are replaced by the peak structures at low
   temperature (T). The order of chi(M) is 10(-4)-10(-5); therefore, the
   peak structures are measurable at T less than or equal to 1K. The
   temperature effect in reducing magnetization is relatively obvious for a

Abstract = {{Selenocysteine is co translationally incorporated into prokaryotic and
   eukaryotic selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons. However, the only
   component of the eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation machinery
   identified to date is the selenocysteine-specific tRNA(Sec). In
   prokaryotes, selenocysteine is synthesized from seryl-tRNA(Sec) and the
   active selenium donor, selenophosphate. Selenophosphate is synthesized
   from selenide and ATP by the selD gene product, selenophosphate
   synthetase, and is required for selenocysteine synthesis and
   incorporation into bacterial selenoproteins. We have now cloned human
   selD and shown that transfection of the human selD cDNA into mammalian
   cells results in increased selenium labeling of a mammalian
   selenoprotein, type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase. Despite significant
   differences between the mechanisms of selenoprotein synthesis in
   prokaryotes and eukaryotes, human selD weakly complements a bacterial
   selD mutation, partially restoring selenium incorporation into bacterial
   selenoproteins. Human selenophosphate synthetase has only 32\% homology
   with the bacterial protein, although a highly homologous region that has
   similarity to a consensus ATP/GTP binding domain has been identified.
   Point mutations within this region result in decreased incorporation of
   selenium into type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase in all but one case.
   Further analysis revealed that reduced selenium labeling was due to
   altered ATP binding properties of the mutant selenophosphate
   synthetases.}},

Abstract = {{The rate at which immunodeficiency develops in untreated human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected persons might be
   increasing or decreasing over time because of viral evolution or other
   factors. Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators
   recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US
   metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1
   seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural
   history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data
   from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for
   measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors
   adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative
   participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first
   seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values
   observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular
   pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+
   percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988.
   In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+
   lymphocyte count of <500 cells/mm(3) was not associated with the secular
   time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95\% confidence interval
   0.97-1.13). The authors' data do not suggest a major change in the
   natural history of HIV-1 infection in this population.}},

Abstract = {{We seek relationships among turbulence and fine-scale and large-scale
   flow by ensemble averaging the observations taken in the Pacific
   Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at 0 degrees/140 degrees W in April 1987.
   A combination of fine- and microscale sensors resolves vertical
   wavenumber spectra of shear and temperature from scales of 300 m to the
   viscous and thermal diffusive cutoffs. We study the depth range 50-350
   m, which encompasses high-shear layers below and above the core of the
   EUC and the thermostad, but not the diurnal cycle near the surface.
   Fine-scale shear dominates over large-scale shear (related to the slowly
   varying EUC) at 50-170 m and below 270 m, where large-scale gradient
   Froude numbers (Fr) drop below I, while large-scale shear dominates in
   the weakly stratified thermostad at 170-270 m, where (\$) over bar (\$)
   over bar Fr > 1. We analyze shear fluctuations in different vertical
   wavenumber bands and pragmatically separate nonturbulent and turbulent
   fluctuations, the latter being associated with vertical overturning and
   viscous dissipation. In part of the fine-scale range, shear spectra fall
   off approximately in inverse proportion to vertical wavenumber. The
   shear variance in this wavenumber band stays close to the squared
   buoyancy frequency independent of large-scale shear. At a vertical
   resolution that resolves turbulent overturning, the Kunze et al. (1990)
   model of shear instability well predicts average dissipation rates below
   100 m. Yet instantaneous high-resolution gradient Froude numbers show
   virtually no correlation with turbulent dissipation rates. At 20-m
   vertical resolution, mean dissipation rates from below 50 m and total
   rms shear S-tot are well correlated as (\$) over bar epsilon similar to
   S-tot(-3.5). Fine-scale shear is essential in this relationship.
   Large-scale gradient Froude numbers and large-scale shear are
   comparatively poorly correlated with mixing parameters.}},

   regions was studied on peripheral T cells with a novel V delta
   3-specific mAb (p11l.10b), generated against a soluble V gamma 9V delta
   3 TCR. V delta 3(+) cells represented the vast majority of V delta 1/V
   delta 2(-) gamma delta T cells within peripheral blood and mucosal
   lymphocytes. No preferential V gamma region expression was noted within
   V delta 3(+) cells, but the frequency of V gamma 9(+) cells was
   significantly lower among V delta 3(+) than among V delta 1(+) or V
   delta 2(+) PBL. Phenotypic analysis of cultured V delta 3(+) cells
   sorted with p11.10b mAb revealed the presence of T lymphocytes with
   unusual phenotypes. First, cells carrying two distinct surface TCR
   delta-chains, recognized by both V delta 1- and V delta 3-specific mAbs,
   were detected in most T cell lines, though at frequencies much lower
   than that of dual gamma expressors, indicating that allelic exclusion of
   delta genes is more tightly regulated than that of gamma genes.
   Moreover, a significant fraction of V delta 3(+) cells were recognized
   by C beta- but not C delta-specific mAbs. Molecular analysis of V delta
   3(+)C beta(+) clones revealed the presence of V delta 3J alpha C alpha
   transcripts in all of them. Given the peculiar location of the V delta 3
   gene between the delta Rec/psi J alpha elements, those observations
   formally demonstrate that activation of rearrangements with J alpha
   elements is not necessarily preceded by a delta Rec/psi J alpha-mediated

Abstract = {{We examine the gas-to-liquid frequency shifts and isotropic Raman
   linewidths for the axial and equatorial CH stretching vibrations of
   cyclohexane-d(11) in 13 different solvents. The `'perturbed hard-fluid
   model'' of Ben-Amotz and Herschbach provides a consistent description of
   the observed shifts in terms of average repulsive and attractive
   solute-solvent interactions. The attractive part of the shift is
   dominated by dispersive interactions, with a small contribution from
   inductive forces. This analysis also reproduces the observed ratio of
   equatorial to axial attractive shift components if certain details of
   the cyclohexane-d(11) geometry are accounted for when the repulsive part
   of the shift is calculated. The ratio of equatorial to axial peak
   Linewidths is nearly the same for all solvents and is consistent with
   inhomogeneous broadening by attractive force fluctuations. A version of
   the Schweizer-Chandler theory of attractive force broadening, modified
   to incorporate interactions between the solute vibrational dipole and
   solvent dipoles, successfully describes the dependence of the observed
   linewidths on solvent dipole moment. However, the remaining portion of
   the linewidth does not correlate with solvent parameters characterizing
   dispersive force fluctuations in the manner predicted by the theory. (C)

   analyzed. The two-photon ionization of TMPD with excimer laser
   excitation at 77 K produced an ester radical anion of PMMA (PMMA(center

   after the detachment of the ester side group by annealing of the sample
   at room temperature. The main chain scission radical C-center
   dot(CH3)(COOCH3)- (PMMA(center dot)) which was formed by the
   beta-scission from -CH2-C(CH3)-CH2- showed the 13-line ESR spectrum
   instead of the ordinary 9-line, due to the fast quenching of the sample
   to 77 K. The change of the molecular weight distribution was measured by
   GPC after several irradiation-and-annealing operations. The simulation
   of the GPC curve comfirmed that the scission reaction occurs at random

Abstract = {{Background. The grading of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the
   esophagus as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet
   proved to be prognostically significant. Therefore, the prognostic
   impact of various histologic parameters was investigated and compared
   with that of the WHO grading.
   Methods. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor samples from 138 patients
   with SCC of the esophagus who underwent potentially curative resection
   (no residual tumor or distant metastases) were evaluated for the
   following histologic parameters: degree of keratinization, nuclear
   polymorphism, pattern of invasion, mitotic activity, and inflammatory
   response. The prognostic impact of these parameters was analyzed by
   univariate and multivariate survival analyses.
   Results. In the univariate analysis, the inflammatory response (P =
   0.0006), pattern of invasion (P = 0.0011), and nuclear polymorphism (P =
   0.0161) were the only parameters that correlated with survival. However,
   in a multivariate survival analysis including these parameters, only
   pattern of invasion (P = 0.0010) and inflammatory response (P = 0.0076)
   were prognostically significant. Based on these results, a new
   prognostic score system was defined that correlated significantly with
   survival in the univariate survival analysis (P = 0.0002), In contrast,
   the WHO histologic grade was not prognostically significant. In the
   multivariate Cox regression analysis, the new prognostic score system
   proved to be an independent prognostic parameter (P = 0.0062), ranking
   next to pT classification (P = 0.0001) and pN classification (P =
   0.0014).
   Conclusions. For SCC of the esophagus, histologic grading based on
   pattern of invasion and inflammatory response had an independent
   prognostic impact, whereas the grading system proposed by the WHO had no
   significant prognostic value.}},

   membrane. Aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors in the mast cells
   induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatase. The tyrosine
   phosphorylation was mimicked by stimulation with calcium ionophore
   A23187 but not by direct activation of protein kinase C. Since
   phosphorylation of the phosphatase was dramatically reduced when the
   cells were activated in Ca2+ free media, it is dependent on a rise in
   intracellular Ca2+. These data strongly suggest that hematopoietic
   tyrosine phosphatase may be involved in the IgE receptor-mediated
   signaling cascade.}},

Abstract = {{A `'DH-system'' is defined as a multidimensional hydrogen atom (or its
   one-particle analogue), D greater than or equal to 1. Investigating many
   Coulomb problems in R(D) it is necessary to know exact analytical
   expressions of multipole matrix elements (q/r(k)/q(l))(D) for
   DH-systems, where q = (N, mu) is a set of parameters, N - `'principal''
   and mu - `'orbital'' quantum numbers. The paper deals with the new
   method for the evaluation of similar matrix elements using new
   properties of Appell's function F-2 (x, y) to the vicinity of the
   singular point (1, 1).
   Such approach allows: 1) to get exact analytical expressions of these
   matrix elements (considering the selection rules) by means of Appell's
   F-2 (or Clausen's F-3(2)) functions; 2) to reveal `'latent'' symmetry of
   diagonal matrix elements with respect to the point K-0 = -3/2, the above
   symmetry is connected with the property of Appell's function F-2 (1, 1)
   mirror-like symmetry; 3) to find (exact) asymptotics of the off-diagonal
   matrix elements in terms of Horn's function psi(1) (x, y); 4) to prove
   that the orthogonality of radial functions f(N mu) (D, tau) over N and
   mu for DH-systems is connected with the properties of Appell's F-2
   function to the vicinity of the singular point (1, 1), it generalizes
   the known result for 3H-atom by Pasternack and Sternheimer, J. Math.

Abstract = {{Evidence for lifetime enhancement of Rydberg states by interactions with
   surrounding ions is obtained from femtosecond pump-probe experiments on
   the vibrational wave packet dynamics of the I-2(B)-state, in which
   either detection of I-2(+) ions or zero-kinetic energy (ZEKE) electrons
   was used. The use of the ZEKE technique leads to the appearance of new
   frequency components in the Fourier transform power spectra of
   pump-probe time delay scans, as well as the observation of enhanced
   peak-to-valley ratios in these scans. These observed frequency
   components do not correspond to any energy level spacings in the
   molecule; they correspond to a sum of two energy level spacings,
   suggesting a nonlinear detection mechanism in the ZEKE technique (i.e.,
   interaction with ions). Additional evidence for our interpretation is
   presented through experiments in which additional ions were formed
   through nonresonant multiphoton ionization of I-2 with a picosecond 266
   nm laser, as well as experiments in which both the decay time of the
   ZEKE signal and the appearance of the pump-probe time delay scans as a
   function of the pulsed field time delay were studied. Theoretical wave
   packet calculations which support the conclusions are presented. (C)

Abstract = {{Using sea, surface height data collected by the TOPES/POSEIDON
   altimeter, we studied the low-frequency variability in the Kuroshio
   Extension and Gulf Stream. The most significant signals are the
   basin-wide background seasonal cycle and low-frequency wave activity
   generated over major bottom bathymetry and subsequent westward
   propagation in both regions. The spatial structures of the seasonal
   cycle in the two regions are quite different. In the Kuroshio Extension
   the seasonal cycle has a northeast-southwest orientation and lies closer
   to the western boundary, whereas it has an east-west orientation and
   lies more offshore in the Gulf Stream. The close relationship between
   the low-frequency wave activity and major bottom bathymetry features is
   discussed through both empirical orthogonal functional (EOF) analysis
   and calculation of eddy kinetic energy and Reynolds stress. The spatial
   structures of these eddy statistics are fundamentally different from
   those of high-frequency mesoscale variability. They ape not in the
   proximity of maximum time-mean flow, but rather, they lie mostly to the
   west of major bottom bathymetry. The close association of the clusters
   of local maximum eddy properties with major bottom topographic features
   in both regions, wave generation over the major bottom topographic
   features and subsequent westward propagation, and difference of the eddy
   statistics from that associated with high-frequency mesoscale
   variability all suggest that unlike in the case with high-frequency
   mesoscale variability generation in which internal dynamics of the
   background mean flow such as nonlinear instability plays a fundamental
   role, external forcing through bottom topography must play a fundamental
   role im generating the low-frequency wave activity.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation examined the concept that arachidonic acid (AA)
   serves as a second messenger in stimulation of the respiratory burst and
   degranulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The main support
   for this idea is from observations that reagent AA added to cell
   suspensions, stimulates the respiratory burst and degranulation and
   these events are blocked by PLA(2) inhibitors. We verified that
   exogenously-added AA stimulated release of O-2(-) myeloperoxidase (MPO),
   and lysozyme (LZ), but this required amounts of AA which approximated
   the critical micellar concentration. This suggested that such
   administration of AA might act as an extracellular agonist, similar to
   particulate stimuli, rather than acting as a second messenger as might
   occur following mobilization of AA from cellular membranes. To
   investigate the role of fatty acids released by hydrolysis of cellular
   phospholipids, exogenously-added group I, II or III PLA(2)'s were used
   to mobilize fatty acids from cellular membranes. Mole quantities of
   cell-associated free fatty acids were measured by negative ion chemical
   ionization gas chromatography mass spectrometry. AA mobilization in
   response to exogenous PLA(2) was dose-(0.1 to 10 U/ml PLA(2)) and
   time-dependent (peak at 1 to 2 min with a reduction by 4 min). Resting
   neutrophils contained <10 pmol free AA/10(7) PMN; the receptor-mediated
   agonist N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) alone did not
   increase these values. Exogenously-added PLA(2) generated large
   quantities of free AA in control and fMLP-treated cells (426+/-122 and
   2097+/-176 pmol/10(7) PMN, respectively): however, this did not induce
   O-2(-), nor did it augment the level of O-2(-) stimulated by fMLP. Also,
   PLA(2) caused no degranulation and did not alter degranulation induced
   by fMLP. PLA(2) also did not alter O-2(-) or degranulation responses in
   primed PMN. The data indicate that mobilization of AA from cellular
   phospholipids neither stimulates nor modulates the respiratory burst or
   degranulation of PMN.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the amounts of the major fatty acids present in the lipids of
   the yolk complex and the embryo were delineated during embryogenesis of
   the chicken, The rates of transfer of palmitic, oleic, linoleic,
   linolenic and arachidonic acids from the lipids of the yolk complex were
   essentially identical. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was
   preferentially transferred from the yolk complex at a rate which was
   significantly higher than that exhibited by the other major fatty acids.
   The rates of accumulation of both arachidonic acid and DHA in the lipids
   of the whole embryo were significantly greater than the rates observed
   for the C-16 and C-18 fatty acids, particularly between days 12 and 16
   of the 21-day embryonic period. Analysis of the fatty acid composition
   of plasma lipid throughout development indicated that the
   triacylglycerol fraction contained relatively high proportions (up to
   approx. 14\% w/w of total fatty acids) of DHA, but much lower
   proportions (approx. 3\%) of arachidonic acid. In contrast, plasma
   phospholipid was enriched in arachidonic acid (up to approx. 18\%), but
   contained much lower proportions (generally less than 3\%) of DHA. A
   considerable amount of DHA was incorporated into adipose tissue
   triacylglycerol, so that by the time of hatching, the tissue represented
   a major store of this fatty acid. Over the hatching period, the amount
   of DHA in adipose triacylglycerol decreased dramatically, by up to 85\%,
   whereas there was little or no change in the amounts of the other major
   fatty acyl components in this tissue. The amount of DHA as a component
   of brain phospholipid increased continuously throughout the
   developmental period studied. However, by the time of hatching, the
   amount of DHA in brain phospholipid represented less than 10\% of the
   amount of this fatty acid originally present in the lipids of the yolk.}},

   of Auger spectra of polyatomic molecules, and discuss the results of an
   application to the acetaldehyde molecule. The underlying vertical double
   ionization spectrum, comprising hundreds of relevant transitions, is
   computed using a Green's function method and the extremely dense Auger
   intensity distributions are estimated via a two-hole population analysis
   of the eigenstates. The simulation incorporates the main effects of
   nuclear vibrational motion on the energy position and broadening of the
   Auger bands. This analysis is shown to be indispensable for the faithful
   reproduction of the very different carbon and oxygen spectral profiles
   and their conclusive interpretation. The experimentally unique carbon
   spectrum is discussed in terms of its superimposed methylic and
   carbonylic components.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we show that the thymus atrophy inducing compound
   DBTC stimulates the intracellular release, but not the influx, of Ca2+
   elicited by cross-linking of the TcR alpha beta-CD3-complex on rat
   thymocytes and inhibits capping of TcR alpha beta. Similarities with the
   effects of cytochalasin B together with the finding that DBTC also
   inhibited capping of CD8, whereas cross-linking of CD8 did nest cause a
   Ca2+-response, suggest that DBTC interferes with TcR alpha
   beta-CD3-signalling by selective interference with cytoskeletal
   functioning. The responding thymocytes were CD53- and FSClow, thus
   possibly including the non proliferating counterpart of the presumed
   immature CD4-CD8(+)CD53- target cells of DBTC. The present effects may
   therefore relate to the mechanisms of organotin-induced thymus atrophy.

Abstract = {{A novel catecholato complex, Nb-V(tpp)(cat)(Hcat), where cat and Heat
   are two distinct catechol ligands (a bidentate catecholate dianion and a
   monodentate catecholate monoanion, respectively) and tpp is
   5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin dianion, has been isolated in the
   reaction of NBV(tpp)(O)(AcO) with catechol, where AcO is an acetato
   ligand. Its molecular structure has been determined by X-ray
   crystallography. Crystal data: monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c, Z = 4, a
   = 14.592(3) Angstrom, b = 23.46(1) Angstrom, c = 14.415(4) Angstrom,
   beta = 100.95(2)degrees, R = 0.079. The molecular structure was
   confirmed to have no oxo ligand, and in this respect it is unique among
   the niobium(V) porphyrins. The bidentate and monodentate ligands are
   located on the same side of the porphyrin ring. The heptacoordinate
   niobium atom is bonded to the four gyrrole nitrogen atoms and to three
   oxygen atoms in the catechols. The niobium atom is displaced by 1.02
   Angstrom from the mean plane of the four nitrogen atoms. The structure
   of the complex in solution and the mechanism of the Nb = O cleavage were
   investigated by means of H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The bidentate catechol is
   oriented in C-s symmetry with respect to the porphyrin plane, and the
   monodentate catechol is located perpendicularly to both the bidentate
   catechol and the porphyrin plane. Two intermediates with the bidentate
   catechol were observed after addition of 2 equiv of catechol to
   Nb(tmp)(O)(AcO) at -30 degrees C, where tmp denotes the 5, 10, 15,
   20-tetramesitylporphyrin dianion. These intermediates were determined to
   be Nb(tmp)(cat)(OH) and Nb(tmp)(cat)(AcO). Thus, the Nb = O bond of
   Nb(tmp)(O)(AcO) was easily cleaved to create the two intermediates. We
   propose a unique route to the Nb = O cleavage that involves an
   intramolecular electron transfer from the catechol ligand coordinated at
   the first stage through a ligand exchange with AcO. Both protonation and
   electron transfer to the Nb = O moiety play important roles in the Nb =
   O cleavage.}},

Abstract = {{One of the toxic products from chlorine bleaching of wood pulp is
   4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Detoxification of such compounds usually requires
   their dechlorination. The present study involves a fairly detailed
   comparison of the attempt and success of the photolytic dechlorination
   of 4-CP in O-2-saturated aqueous solutions using ArF{*} (193 nm) and
   KrF{*} (248 nm) excimer laser radiation at higher (1.1 X 10(-2) M) and
   lower (4.5 X 10(-4) M) starting substrate concentrations and comparisons
   of quantum yields (Phi), product distributions, etc.
   At the higher starting substrate concentration (1.1 X 10(-2) M) the
   average initial quantum yields, i.e, early in the reaction process, for
   the disappearance of 4-CP (Phi approximate to 0.30) and for the
   generation of chloride ions (Phi approximate to 0.25) were about the
   same for both 193 and 248 nm radiation. However, when the number of
   photons absorbed (n) became greater than about 3 X 10(20), more chloride
   ions (higher Phi) were generated with the 193 nm radiation than with the
   248 nm radiation. Oligomers were the major products for both wavelengths
   of radiation, but the quantity of oligomers generated was greater using
   the 193 nm radiation. At 248 nm a significant amount of hydroquinone was
   generated, whereas hydroquinone was not detected with the 193 nm
   radiation. In addition, a significant amount of 4-chlorocatechol was
   generated during the direct photolysis of 4-CP using either wavelength
   of radiation. This is a new result for the photolysis of 4-CP at a
   wavelength longer than 193 nm in the absence of added H2O2.
   At the lower starting substrate concentration (4.5 X 10(-4) M) the
   average initial quantum yields for the disappearance of 4-CP (Phi
   approximate to 0.55) and for the generation of chloride ions (Phi
   approximate to 0.45) were both much greater using the 193 nm radiation
   than with the 248 nm radiation (Phi approximate to 0.20 and 0.10
   respectively). At 193 nm oligomers were still the major products
   generated, but the fraction of oligomeric products generated was less
   than the fraction at the higher substrate concentration. This is
   consistent with the fact that at the lower substrate concentration a
   significant amount of hydroquinone was generated at 193 nm, whereas it
   was not detected at this wavelength for the higher substrate
   concentration. During the 248 nm photolysis of 4-CP at this lower
   starting substrate concentration, hydroquinone was the only major
   product generated in these experiments. Oligomers were not observed at
   this lower substrate concentration using 248 nm radiation, whereas
   oligomers were generated at the higher substrate concentration.
   The results demonstrate the utility of using an excimer laser for the
   photolytic dechlorination of 4-CP without added photocatalysts or
   additives. It is also possible to suggest a number of explanations,
   given in the text, which are consistent with our findings.}},

Abstract = {{The granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor
   (GMR) is a heterodimeric receptor expressed by myeloid lineage cells, In
   this study we have investigated domains of the GMR beta-chain (GMR beta)
   involved in maintaining cellular viability, Using a series of nested GMR
   beta deletion mutants, we demonstrate that there are at least two
   domains of GMR beta that contribute to viability signals, Deletion of
   amino acid residues 626-763 causes a viability defect that can be
   rescued with fetal calf serum (FCS), Deletion of residues 518-626, in
   contrast, causes a further decrement in viability that can be only
   partially compensated by the addition of FCS, GMR beta truncated
   proximal to amino acid 517 will not support long-term growth under any
   conditions, Site directed mutagenesis of tyrosine-750 (Y750), which is
   contained within the distal viability domain, to phenylalanine
   eliminates all demonstrable tyrosine phosphorylation of GMR beta, Cell
   lines transfected with mutant GMR beta (Y750 --> F) have a viability
   disadvantage when compared to cell lines containing wild-type GMR that
   is partially rescued by the addition of FCS. We studied signal
   transduction in mutant cell lines in an effort to identify pathways that
   might participate in the viability signal. Although tyrosine
   phosphorylation of JAK2, SHPTP2, and Vav is intact in Y750 --> F mutant
   cell lines, She tyrosine phosphorylation is reduced, This suggests a
   potential role for Y750 and potentially She in a GM-CSF-induced
   signaling pathway that helps maintain cellular viability.}},

Abstract = {{The cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-15 have similar biological
   effects on T cells and bind common hematopoietin receptor subunits.
   Pathways that involve Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and
   activators of transcription (STATs) have been shown to be important for
   hematopoietin receptor signaling. In this study we identify the STAT
   proteins activated by IL-2 and IL-15 in human T cells. IL-2 and IL-15
   rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5, and
   DNA-binding complexes containing STAT3 and STAT5 were rapidly activated
   by these cytokines in T cells. IL 4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation and
   activation of STAT3 but not STATS. JAK1 and JAK3 were
   tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2 and IL-15. Hence, the JAK
   and STAT molecules that are activated in response to IL-2 and IL-15 are
   similar but differ from those induced by IL-4. These observations
   identify the STAT proteins activated by IL-2 and IL-15 and therefore
   define signaling pathways by which these T-cell growth factors may
   regulate gene transcription.}},

Abstract = {{The functional and structural properties of the monomeric and
   filamentous actin-myosin head (S1) complexes were compared under
   strictly controlled conditions which avoid the S1-induced polymerization
   of monomeric actin. Under these conditions, monomeric (G) and
   filamentous (F) actin were found to activate S1 Mg2+-ATPase by 3- and
   120-fold, respectively, in the presence of a 5-fold excess of actin over
   S1. Using the change in fluorescence intensity of pyrene-G-actin induced
   by S1 binding in the presence of various nucleotide analogues, we
   discovered that the ternary G-actin-S1-AMPPNP complex could not be
   formed. Moreover, the association constants of G-actin to S1-ADP or of
   ADP to the G-actin-S1 complex were at least an order of magnitude lower
   than in the Filamentous state. Such a low affinity between G-actin and
   the S1-nucleotide intermediates can reasonably explain the lack of
   ATPase activation by the monomeric complex. Analysis of the G-actin-S1
   interface by chemical cross-linking and limited proteolytic experiments
   showed that, in the monomeric complex, S1 interacted almost exclusively
   by its positively charged segment 636-642 with the patch of negative
   residues located on the actin flexible loops 1-7, 20-28, and 90-100.
   Moreover, the variation in the crosslinking pattern and in the
   proteolytic susceptibility of S1 segment 636-642 demonstrated that this
   electrostatic interface was different in the monomeric and the
   filamentous complexes. Taken together, the results suggested that the
   G-actin-S1 interaction encompasses only a small fraction of the strong
   as well as of the weak F-actin-S1 interface. The monomeric complex would
   in fact resemble more the collision complex which takes place early in
   the F-actin-S1 interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Leishmaniavirus (LRV) is a double-stranded RNA virus that persistently
   infects the protozoan parasite Leishmania. LRV produces a short RNA
   transcript, corresponding to the 5' end of positive-sense viral RNA,
   both in vivo and in in vitro polymerase assays. The short transcript is
   generated by a single site-specific cleavage event in the 5'
   untranslated region of the 5.3-kb genome. This cleavage event can be
   reproduced in vitro with purified viral particles and a substrate RNA
   transcript possessing the viral cleavage site. A region of nucleotides
   required for cleavage was identified by analyzing the cleavage sites
   yielding the short transcripts of various LRV isolates. A 6-nt deletion
   at this cleavage site completely abolished RNA processing. In an in
   vitro cleavage assay, baculovirus-expressed capsid protein possessed an
   endonuclease activity identical to that of native virions, showing that
   the viral capsid protein is the RNA endonuclease. Identification of the

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive and
   behavioral disturbances that are mediated in part by cholinergic brain
   deficits.
   Objective: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of an
   investigational. cholinesterase inhibitor, that is, velnacrine maleate,
   in treating patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's disease
   (according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological
   Disorders and Stroke {[}Washington, DC]-Alzheimer Disease and Related
   Disorders Association {[}Chicago, 111]). Methods: This was a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a single-blind washout
   period, patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 152),
   velnacrine maleate, 150 mg/d (n = 149), or velnacrine maleate, 225 mg/d
   (n = 148) for 24 weeks. Primary end points were cognitive behavior and
   memory components of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and the
   Clinical Global Impression of Change scale. Secondary end points were
   caregiver-rated scales.
   Results: The scores for the cognitive behavior and memory components of
   the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale deteriorated in the
   placebo-treated group (P < .05) but not in the velnacrine-treated
   groups. Between-group comparisons favored velnacrine maleate, 225 mg
   over 150 mg (P < .05). Findings were similar for the Clinical Global
   Impression of Change scale and three of the four caregiver-rated scales.
   Treatment-related adverse clinical events occurred in 36\%, 28\%, and
   30\% of patients in the groups that received placebo, velnacrine maleate
   (150 mg), and velnacrine maleate (225 mg), respectively. The most common
   adverse clinical event was diarrhea, which rarely interrupted therapy.
   Treatment was stopped because of reversible abnormal liver function test
   results (five or more times the upper limits of normal) in 3\%, 30\%,
   and 24\% of the patients who received placebo, velnacrine maleate (150
   mg), and velnacrine maleate (225 mg), respectively.
   Conclusions: Velnacrine produces modest but significant benefits in
   patients with Alzheimer's disease. Velnacrine maleate (225 mg) is more
   effective than 150 mg of velnacrine. Both dosages have acceptable safety
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{High-spin properties of rotational bands are studied in Ta-173 using the
   Gd-160(F-19,6n) reaction at bombarding energies of 103-105 MeV. With the
   existing bands being extended, and new bands established, a total of 16
   rotational sequences are interpreted in terms of their (multi)
   quasiparticle structure. Measurements of electromagnetic properties for
   these bands include E2/M1 mixing ratios, branching ratios and lifetimes
   of isomeric states close to band heads, for which all energies have now
   been determined. Particular emphasis is devoted to (i) the band
   structures related to the 1/2(-) {[}541] intruder configuration, for
   which both favoured, and unfavoured partners as well as the extended g-
   and S-bands in the (delayed) crossing region have been established, (ii)
   the reduced E1 transition strength between the (new) 1/2(+) {[}411] and
   1/2(-) {[}541] bands, which is strongly enhanced, most likely due to
   coupling to octupole degrees of freedom, and show a Delta I = 4
   staggering, (iii) the observation of weak interband transitions between
   the two partners of a pseudo-spin doublet composed of the 5+ {[}402] and
   1+ {[}404] bands together with accurately measured intraband mixing
   ratios enable an analysis of the mixing of these bands through
   comparisons to particle-rotor calculations, (iv) the observed
   three-quasiparticle bands which are assigned to specific configurations
   coupling the lowest protons to lowest two-quasineutrons with negative
   parity.}},

Abstract = {{Ligands containing pyridyl groups and saturated nitrogens as donor
   groups, DPA-2 (N,N'-di-2-picolylethylenediamine), DPA-3
   (N,N'-di-2-picolyl-1,3-propanediamine), and TPEN
   (N,N,N',N'-tetra-2-picolylethylenediamine) were studied with large metal
   ions in 0.1 M NaNO3 at 25 degrees C. The pair of ligands DPA-2 and DPA-3
   which form five and six-membered chelate rings, respectively, between
   two central nitrogen donor atoms was studied with Cd-II, Pb-II, and
   Bi-III by glass electrode potentiometry, by differential pulse
   polarography (DPP), and by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The
   complexes of TPEN with Cd-II, Pb-II, and Bi-III were studied by DPP, and
   with Hg-II by metal electrode potentiometry. Glass electrode
   potentiometry could not be used for metal-TPEN systems because
   precipitation of complexes occurs during titration and complexes are
   formed much below pH 2. Protonation constants and complex formation
   constants for these ligands and metal ions are reported. It has been
   shown that change in complex stability, Delta log K-1, on passing from
   DPA-2 to DPA-3, plotted as a function of a metal ion radius, supports
   the rule that the change of chelate ring size from five to six-membered
   stabilizes the complexes of small relative to large metal ions. The
   effect of chelate ring size on complex stability obtained for DPA-2 and
   DPA-3 ligands is compared with corresponding relations for the pairs of
   ligands 2,2,2-tet and 2,3,2-tet, and py-12-aneN(4) and py-14-aneN(4).
   The possible steric effects of the bulky pyridyl groups of DPA-2 and
   DPA-3 were analyzed by Molecular Mechanics calculation in relation to
   steric aspects of complex formation. The results obtained here and
   elsewhere for TPEN are discussed in relation to the affinity of each
   metal ion for nitrogen donor ligands.}},

   sulphate micelle systems, MS-RTP emission of DNS-Cl can be induced with
   TINO3 as heavy atom perturber and Na2SO3 for deoxygenation,
   lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 328/558 nm. The intensity of RTP is linear with
   the concentration of DNS-Cl in the range of 1 X 10(-7) to 4 X 10(-5) mol
   l(-1). On several solid substrates, the SS-RTP of DNS-Cl can be achieved
   with lead acetate (Pb(AC)(2)) as heavy atom perturber. On filter paper
   and for lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 335/575 nm, the linear range is 12 to
   300 pmol DNS-Cl in 0.3 mu l sample volume and the limit of detection is
   12 pmol. On the other hand, the MS-RTP emission of derivative products
   for amino acid and ethanolamine can also be induced. Compared with that
   of DNS-Cl, not only the lambda(ex)/lambda(em) of the derivative products
   show a clear shift to longer wavelengths, but also the optimal pH
   increased from 7 to 10. These results show that DNS-Cl can be used not

   the introduction of p-methylstyrene comonomeric units tends to
   destabilize the clathrate delta-form. For the solution as well as for
   the melt crystallization, the increase of p-methylstyrene content favors
   obtaining the alpha-form over the beta-form and, in particular, for the
   20 mol \% p-methylstyrene copolymer, the beta-form is never obtained.
   Both kinetic and thermodynamic factors seem to be involved. Structural
   variations for the alpha-form with the introduction of p-methylstyrene

Abstract = {{In the sol-gel synthesis of silica by the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and
   condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), the fractal dimension,
   density, and homogeneity of the gel depend strongly on reaction
   conditions such as the acid and water concentrations. However, Si-29
   nuclear magnetic resonance shows that gel conversions of at least 80\%
   are observed over a wide range of initial acid (10(-5)-10(-1) mol/L),
   water (4-22 mol/L), and TEOS (1.3-2.5 mol/L) concentrations. This is
   very high compared to the value predicted by random branching theory
   even under the worst possible negative first-shell substitution effect.
   Moreover, nonrandom cyclization is commonly evidenced in these systems
   by Si-29 NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and gas chromatography with mass
   spectroscopy. The gel conversions suggest that nonrandom cyclization
   reactions are strongly favored, and the development of conversions with
   time is consistent with the formation of compact three-dimensional
   cagelike intermediates. These are probably the same nanometer-scale
   objects shown by recent scattering and microscopy observations.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the flexible alkyl chain spacer on the molecular
   dynamics of glass transition in side-chain liquid-crystalline polymers
   (SCLCPs) and its dependence on the spacer length are considered in the
   framework of the Coupling model. Short spacer length may enable the
   mesogenic groups in the side chain to enhance the degree of
   cooperativity of the segmental dynamics responsible for glass transition
   compared with that of the corresponding parent main-chain polymer
   without the side chains. However, when the spacer length becomes long,
   not only motions of the mesogenic group and the main chain are decoupled
   but also the preponderance of flexible methylene chains in the vicinity
   of the polymer backbone will diminish the degree of cooperativity of the
   segmental dynamics compared with that of the corresponding parent
   main-chain polymer without the side chain. The degree of cooperativity
   is quantified in the coupling model for SCLCPs by the steepness of the
   plot of a characteristic relaxation time, tau{*}, of the segmental
   relaxation time spectrum against normalized reciprocal temperature,
   T-g/T, where T-g is operationally defined as the temperature at which
   tau{*}(T-g) is equal to an arbitrarily chosen but fixed long time.
   Dielectric and mechanical relaxation data of several families of SCLCPs
   published in the past 10 years are used to test this prediction. The
   results from the analysis of these data are in accord with the predicted
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the absence of highly specific symptoms and without
   esophageal erosions, long-term pH monitoring is necessary for diagnosing
   gastroesophageal reflux disease. This method, however, is not generally
   available.
   Objective: To determine whether gastroesophageal reflux disease can be
   diagnosed empirically by acid suppression in patients with normal
   results of endoscopy.
   Methods: We studied 33 consecutive outpatients with pathologic findings
   on pH monitoring who had symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal
   reflux disease and normal results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy,
   particularly a normal appearance of the esophageal mucosa. The severity
   of symptoms was graded on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10 by the
   patient. The patients were treated for at least 7 days with either
   ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily (patients 1 through 10), omeprazole, 40
   mg/d (patients 11 through 21), or omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily
   (patients 22 through 33). A reassessment of symptoms and second pH
   monitoring were performed during the last day of treatment.
   Results: Omeprazole, 40 mg/d, significantly reduced the severity of
   symptoms from 7.1 (range, 4 to 9) to 3.7 (0 to 8) and the reflux measure
   mean acidity from 0.98 mmol/L (0.21 to 76 mmol/L) to 0.02 mmol/L (0 to
   0.47 mmol/L). Omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily, significantly reduced the
   severity of symptoms from 6.8 (3 to 10) to 0.6 (0 to 2) and the mean
   acidity from 0.38 mmol/L (0.13 to 8.5 mmol/L) to 0.01 mmol/L (0 to 0.14
   mmol/L). Both doses of omeprazole were superior to ranitidine, 150 mg
   twice daily. When a 75\% reduction of symptoms was defined as positive,
   the `'omeprazole test'' with 40 mg twice daily had a sensitivity of
   83.3\%, whereas the sensitivity with 40 mg/d was only 27.2\%.
   Conclusion: In practice, the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux
   disease can be ruled out if symptoms do not improve with a limited
   course of high-dose proton pump inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of fullerenes using a standard de are evaporation of composite
   graphite anode containing 0-100 wt \% of diamond is reported. The
   benzene soluble material-to-soot weight ratio W increases linearly with
   increasing diamond composition C-D up to 45 wt \%. At 50 wt \%, W is
   1.86 times as large as that for pure graphite. Above 50 wt \%, W turns
   to decrease linearly. It is shown that diamond and graphite contribute
   independently to W. The graphite contribution to the linear behaviors is
   discussed in terms of kinetics of the transformation from planar sp(2)
   network to quasitetragonal sp(3) hybridization through quasiplanar sp(2)
   hybridization during the de are. Furthermore, a new type of
   encapsulation compound, single crystals of diamond encapsulated in
   multiwalled carbon nanocages, is presented. (C) 1995 American Institute

Abstract = {{The carbon star V Hya is known to have a bipolar circumstellar outflow
   and an unusual photospheric spectrum. After measuring the changes in the
   photospheric velocity and carrying out a spectral broadening analysis
   over 10 photometric phases, we conclude that rotation due to spin-up by
   a companion in a common envelope configuration is the most compelling
   explanation for all the data taken together. After considering the
   spectral and velocity behavior of 74 other carbon stars, we find that V
   Hya is alone in our sample in having such obvious phase-dependent
   broadening.
   In this paper we detail the broadening results and explore other
   possible causes of spectral broadening in late-type stars. In
   particular, we find that: (1) the spectral broadening in V Hya varies
   about a mean value of 13.5 km s(-1) (with total variation of 9 km s(-1))
   in concert with the photometric phase and with a phase relationship
   consistent with that expected for a rapidly rotating star that conserves
   angular momentum as it pulsates, (2) V Hya's unusual, very long
   secondary period of 6500 days might be attributed to a coupling of
   radial pulsation (529 day period) with rotation, (3) the upper limit on
   the ultraviolet continuum flux favors a common envelope versus detached
   binary system, (4) the variability type, Mira versus semiregular
   variable, is uncertain since V Hya demonstrates spectral characteristics
   of both, and (5) the evolutionary placement on the asymptotic giant
   branch is in question since V Hya appears to lack Tc-99, a signature
   element of third dredge-up whose absence suggests that a mass transfer
   event in the past might be responsible for V Hya's carbon and s-process
   element enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments done at low driving frequencies suggest that a large
   degree of dispersion exists in the measured value of the shear modulus,
   mu, of alpha iron at high temperature. Discrepancies between values for
   mu from ultrasonic measurements and those from low-frequency torsional
   measurements have been interpreted in terms of viscoelastic relaxation.
   However, the ultrasonic data are not in agreement with one another, and
   the degree of dispersion is not accurately known. We present new
   high-temperature data for the elastic moduli of single-crystal iron
   (alpha phase). The elastic moduli were measured using the rectangular
   parallelepiped resonance method (0.27-0.59 MHz) from room temperature to
   925 K. Our data show that the difference in mu at high temperature
   between ultrasonic-based measurements and low-frequency (1 Hz) torsional
   measurements is only 14 GPa, rather than 29 GPa, as inferred from
   previous analyses. Thus the possible effects of viscoelastic relaxation
   are reduced but not eliminated. We find no dispersion in measurements
   for mu of alpha iron when considering frequencies ranging from 0.27 to
   70 MHz and discuss the possibility that significant viscoelastic effects
   on measurements of mu at high temperature are Limited to frequencies
   below 3 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{An impact load was applied to full-depth circular samples of articular
   cartilage in vitro and the effects of impact energy and velocity on
   matrix integrity and chondrocyte viability were studied. Following a
   severe impact, calculated to correspond to the energy density over the
   cartilage surface that might be expected in a manjumping off a 1-m-high
   wall, the tissue was grossly disrupted, It became elliptical, fissured,
   and flattened. Cartilage samples remaining attached to the underlying
   bone showed less damage at similar drop masses and heights. Chondrocyte
   viability was found to decrease linearly with increasing impact energy.
   Cartilage biopsies maintained in culture for up to 15 days following
   impact gained mass over the first 3 days which they did not subsequently
   lose. The gain in mass increased with the severity of impact and was due
   to an increased hydration of the tissue. Scanning electron microscopy
   and light microscopy showed fissures penetrating the tissue but which
   were never found to pass through the full depth. They were commonly
   oriented at about 45 degrees to the plane of the surface and gave the
   appearance of being deflected parallel to the surface on reaching the
   transition zone. This produced a `'delaminating'' effect where the
   surface zone was separating from the deep zone. (C) 1995 Academic Press,

Abstract = {{Intrusion of magmatic bodies into continental crust has been extensively
   used to explain high heat flow, anomalous seismic velocity structure,
   and gravity anomalies. These intrusions significantly control the
   crustal deformation by modifying the heat and mass budget of the crust.
   However, thermal modeling results based on simple cooling of intrusives
   ignore the effect of moying boundaries during magma solidification. In
   the present work we discuss a mathematical formulation of the thermal
   evolution of continental crust in presence of such magma solidification
   process. The solution is obtained by using the Fourier spectral approach
   in the space domain and a modified finite difference scheme In time
   domain. This solution provides the cooling history and thermal evolution
   within an intrusion unlike the solutions proposed earlier to adjust the
   effect of latent heat of intrusion in the form of apparent specific heat
   or apparent temperature of intrusion and is a general one in the sense
   that this includes the radiogenic heat sources distribution and an
   initial depth dependent temperature distribution in lithosphere. We
   apply this solution to study the thermo-theological evolution of
   continental lithosphere after magmatic underplating. We conclude that
   this effect keeps the intrusive body and the surrounding rocks at a
   higher temperature for a longer duration than when the effect is ignored
   or is adjusted in the form of increased specific heat. For an initially
   ductile lower crust and brittle upper mantle, magmatic underplating
   causes a change in the mode of deformation from brittle to ductile in
   the mantle layer and the latent heat effect included in the form of
   moving boundaries prolongs the duration of ductile deformation in this
   layer in comparison to the latent heat effect adjusted by increasing the
   specific heat of intrusion. The prolonged duration of ductility in lower
   crust/upper mantle due to the slow cooling of intrusion results in a
   weak lithosphere and is important in addressing the issues concerning
   crustal dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the interactions of human and mouse gelatinases with
   fetuin and asialofetuin. The data showed that recombinant human
   gelatinase A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) were both specifically bound to
   asialofetuin and fetuin immobilized to activated agarose (affigel) with
   subsequent cleavage of the enzymes to lower molecular weight forms,
   which were likewise bound to asialofetuin/fetuin. The binding of
   gelatinases to immobilized forms of asialofetuin and fetuins was
   abrogated in the presence of either soluble fetuin or asialofetnin.
   Endogenous mouse macrophage gelatinases (mol wt 92 and similar to 52
   kDa) were also specifically bound to immobilized asialofetuin upon which
   the two forms of the gelatinases were reduced to a similar to 45-kDa
   fragment. The binding of the similar to 45-kDa fragment to asialofetuin
   was also abrogated in the presence of either soluble fetuin or
   asialofetuin. Whereas only the activated MMP-2 bound to immobilized
   asialofetuin had significant gelatinolytic activity, both the zymogen
   and the activated forms of MMP-9 hydrolyzed soluble {[}H-8]gelatin to
   the same extent while still bound to asiaIofetuin. Our data suggest that
   cell surface bound fetuin/asialofetuin could perform two functions: they
   could (a) act as cell surface receptors or anchors for MMP-2 and MMP-9
   and (b) bind and activate MMP-9 on the cell surface. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{We have studied the adsorption of elemental S on Ni(100) surfaces by
   LEED, AES, TDS and WF measurements in UHV. We compared the measurements
   to those of reported investigations, most of which used H2S as sulfur
   source. The elemental S, at room temperature, is grown on Ni(100) in a
   layer by layer mode. Sulfur forms the p(2 x 2), initially, and
   subsequently the c(2 x 2) structure at the completion of the first S
   layer. The second layer is disordered. These findings are in contrast
   with most of the published papers which report that the S on Ni(100)
   saturates in the first layer, its sticking coefficient decreases
   drastically and it does not desorb before 1200 K. Deposition of S, at
   RT, increases the work function of Ni by 0.25 eV. Heating before the
   desorption temperature (1100 K) of S causes: (a) a rearrangement of Ni
   atoms with a possible diffusion of Ni from the bulk to the surface,
   having the tendency to interact with the S overlayer and (b) an increase
   of the WF change close to 0.4 eV, the value reported after the exposure
   of Ni(100) to H2S and subsequent heating. The AES and WF variation are
   related to a recently reported difference in electronic structure
   between the p(2 X 2)S and c(2 X 2)S structures.}},

Abstract = {{A second genotype of bovine viral diarrhea virus, BVDV genotype 2 or
   BVDV 2, has been identified based on phylogenic analysis of sequences
   from the 5' untranslated region of the viral RNA. In this study, we
   derived the complete nucleic acid sequence of a virulent BVDV 2 virus,
   BVDV2-890, isolated from an animal that died of an acute uncomplicated
   BVDV infection. BVDV2-890 is noncytopathic in cell culture and does not
   produce a p80 viral polypeptide. The ORF of BVDV2-890 is 11,922
   nucleotide bases long and codes for 3973 amino acids. In comparison, the
   ORFs of other noncytopathic pestiviruses are shorter by about 250
   nucleotides. The sequence identity at the amino acid level, between
   BVDV2-890 and published sequences for other pestiviruses, is 74\% or
   less. The most conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequences between
   BVDV2-890 and other pestiviruses are located in the region coding for
   the nonstructural protein p80. The least conserved are in the regions
   coding for the structural polypeptide gp53 and nonstructural
   polypeptides p54 and p58. The larger size of the BVDV2-890 ORF is due to
   a 228-nucleotide insertion in the portion of the genome coding for the
   viral polypeptide p54. The location of this insertion was upstream from
   those reported in cytopathic pestiviruses. This insertion was not
   characteristic of all of the BVDV 2 viruses or all of the virulent BVDV
   2 viruses.}},

   Interleukin-1 beta induced C3 protein expression ten-fold more rapidly

   stimulate C3 expression, while cycloheximide and IL-1 beta treatment of
   cells markedly increased C3 expression. Actinomycin D, inhibited C3 gene
   induction by IFN-gamma and IL-1 beta suggesting that these cytokines

Abstract = {{Retroviruses convert their RNA genome into a DNA form by means of
   reverse transcription. According to the current model of reverse
   transcription, two strand transfer reactions are needed to synthesize a
   full-length DNA genome. Because reverse transcription is initiated close
   to the 5' end of the RNA genome, the first strand transfer translocates
   the minus-strand cDNA to the 3' end of the viral genome. This jump is
   facilitated by the presence of a perfect repeat element (R) at both ends
   of a retroviral genome. Strand transfer has been extensively studied in
   in vitro systems with purified reverse transcriptase enzyme (RT) and
   nucleic acid donor and acceptor templates. In this study, we set out to
   test several parameters of the strand transfer reaction as it occurs in
   cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-I). We
   constructed mutant HIV-1 genomes with 3' R acceptor sequences that were
   specifically altered either in length or structure. Analysis of the
   replication characteristics of the mutant viruses indicates that repeats
   much shorter than the wild-type 97-nucleotides R region can efficiently
   act as accepters during reverse transcription. Furthermore, the
   introduction of excessively stable hairpin structures within the 3' R
   element did only marginally affect the strand transfer efficiency. We
   also analysed the DNA forms inherited upon infection of cells with HIV-1
   templates with multiple 3' R copies. These experiments indicate that
   various 3' R repeats can serve as acceptor during minus-strand DNA
   transfer. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{The role of anxiety disorders in the development of sex differences in
   major depression is analyzed. Data come from a longitudinal
   epidemiologic study of young adults in the Detroit, Michigan area. The
   Diagnostic Interview Schedule, revised according to DSM-III-R, was used
   at baseline to measure lifetime psychiatric disorders and at follow-up
   to measure psychiatric disorders during the 3.5-year interval since
   baseline assessment. Consistent with previous reports, the lifetime
   prevalence of major depression was nearly two-fold higher in females
   than in males. The sex difference was primarily in major depression
   comorbid with anxiety disorders. Results from Cox-proportional hazards
   models, with time-dependent covariates, showed that prior anxiety
   disorder increased the risk for subsequent major depression in both
   sexes, with no evidence of an interaction, History of anxiety disorder,
   including number of prior anxiety disorders, accounted for a
   considerable part of the observed sex difference in major depression.
   Controlling for prior anxiety reduced by more than 50\% the coefficient
   that estimates the association between gender and major depression. The
   results suggest that the higher occurrence of anxiety disorders in
   females than males beginning early in life might explain in large part
   the higher female risk for major depression. They emphasize the need for
   further research on sex differences in anxiety disorders.}},

   years. HCV antibodies were detected in 84.2\% of the sample and HCV RNA
   in 66.1\% of the sample including 75.9\% amongst those who were anti-HCV
   positive and 16.6\% amongst those who were anti-HCV negative. AST and
   ALT levels were elevated amongst 16.8\% and 46.2\% of the sample
   respectively.
   The likelihood of being anti-HCV positive increased with years of drug
   use and with increased sharing of injecting equipment. No significant
   relationship between HCV status and sexual practices was evident. Data
   on the history of drug using practices indicated that sharing of
   injecting equipment had become less common over time and access to new
   equipment through reliable sources had become more common with time.
   Conclusions. HCV is widespread amongst this population of injecting drug
   users suggesting the possibility of a major clinical and social problem.
   Despite evidence of a reduction in the sharing of injecting equipment,
   HCV transmission is still occurring indicating the potential for other
   parenterally transmitted diseases, such as HIV, to become established
   amongst injecting drug users. Those at high risk of HCV should be
   discouraged from donating blood because of the possibility of HCV
   seronegative infectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induces angiogenesis in
   vivo and capillary morphogenesis in vitro. Two receptor serine/threonine
   kinases (types I and II) have been identified as signal transducing
   TGF-beta receptors. We explored the possibility of inhibiting
   TGF-beta-mediated events in glomerular capillary endothelial cells using
   a TGF-beta type II receptor (TPR-II) transdominant negative mutant.
   A mutant TGF-beta type II receptor (T beta R-IIM), lacking the
   cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain, was produced by polymerase
   chain reaction using rat T beta R-II cDNA as template. Since T beta R-II
   and TGF-beta type I receptor (T beta R-I) heterodimerize for signal
   transduction, the mutant receptor competes for binding to wild-type T
   beta R-I, hence acting in a dominant negative fashion. Glomerular
   capillary endothelial cells were stably transfected with T beta R-IIM,
   and four independent clones were expanded. That the T beta R-IIM mRNA
   was expressed was shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
   reaction. RNase protection assay, and Northern analysis. Presence of
   cell surface T beta R-IIM protein was shown by affinity cross-linking
   with I-125-TGF-beta 1. In wild-type endothelial cells, TGF-beta 1 (2
   ng/ml) significantly inhibited {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation to 63 +/-
   10\% of control (n = 4). In transfected endothelial cells carrying T
   beta R-IIM, TGF-beta 1 stimulated {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation to 131
   +/- 9\% of control (n = 4, p < 0.005). Also, in wild-type endothelial
   cells, endogenous and exogenous TGF-beta 1 induced apoptosis and
   associated capillary formation. Both apoptosis and capillary formation
   were uniformly and entirely absent in transfected endothelial. cells
   carrying T beta R-IIM.
   This represents the first demonstration that capillary morphogenesis in
   vitro is associated with apoptosis, and that interference with T beta
   R-II signaling inhibits this process in glomerular capillary endothelial
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen-regulated control system responsible for the induction of
   erythropoietin (Epo) by hypoxia is present in most (if not all) cells
   and operates on other genes, including those involved in energy
   metabolism. To understand the organization of cis-acting sequences that
   are responsible for oxygen-regulated gene expression, we have studied
   the 5' flanking region of the mouse gene encoding the hypoxically
   inducible enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH). Deletional and
   mutational analysis of the function of mouse LDH-reporter fusion gene
   constructs in transient transfection assays defined three domains,
   between -41 and -84 base pairs up stream of the transcription initiation
   site, which were crucial for oxygen-regulated expression, The most
   important of these, although not capable of driving hypoxic induction in
   isolation, had the consensus of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)
   site, and cross-competed for the binding of HIF-1 with functionally
   active Epo and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 sequences. The second domain
   was positioned close to the HIF-1 site, in an analogous position to one
   of the critical regions in the Epo 3' hypoxic enhancer, The third domain
   had the motif of a cAMP response element (CRE), Activation of cAMP by
   forskolin had no effect on the level of LDH mRNA in normoxia, but
   produced a magnified response to hypoxia that was dependent upon the
   integrity of the CRE, indicating an interaction between inducible
   factors binding the HIF-1 and CRE sites.}},

Abstract = {{The low affinity receptor for IgG, Fc gamma RII (CD32), has a wide
   distribution on hematopoietic cells where it is responsible for a
   diverse range of cellular responses crucial for immune regulation and
   resistance to infection. Fc gamma RII is a member of the immunoglobulin
   superfamily, containing an extracellular region of two Ig-like domains.
   The IgG binding site of human Fc gamma RII has been localized to an
   8-amino acid segment of the second extracellular domain,
   Asn(154)-Ser(161). In this study, evidence is presented to suggest that
   domain 1 and two additional regions of domain 2 also contribute to the
   binding of IgG by Fc gamma RII. Chimeric receptors generated by
   exchanging the extracellular domains and segments of domain 2 between Fc
   gamma RII and the structurally related Fc epsilon RI alpha chain were
   used to demonstrate that substitution of domain 1 in its entirety or the
   domain 2 regions encompassing residues Ser(109)-Val(116) and
   Ser(130)-Thr(135) resulted in a loss of the ability of these receptors
   to bind hIgG1 in dimeric form. Site-directed mutagenesis performed on
   individual residues within and flanking the Ser(109)-Val(116) and
   Ser(130)-Thr(135) domain 2 segments indicated that substitution of
   Lys(113), Pro(114), Leu(115), Val(116), Phe(129) and His(131) profoundly
   decreased the binding of hIgG1, whereas substitution of Asp(133) and
   Pro(134) increased binding. These findings suggest that not only is
   domain 1 contributing to the affinity of IgG binding by Fc gamma RII
   but, importantly, that the domain 2 regions Ser(109)-Val(116) and
   Phe(129)-Thr(135) also play key roles in the binding of hIgG1. The
   location of these binding regions on a molecular model of the entire
   extracellular region of Fc gamma RII indicates that they comprise loops
   that are juxtaposed in domain 2 at the interface with domain 1, with the
   putative crucial binding residues forming a hydrophobic pocket
   surrounded by a wall of predominantly aromatic and basic residues.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium nitrate (KNO3) isolated in solid argon at 13 K was irradiated
   with emission from an ArF excimer laser at 193 nm. Recombination of the
   photofragments led to formation of both cis- and trans-potassium
   peroxynitrites (KOONO). The cyclic conformer, cis-KOONO, absorbs at
   1444.5, 952.3, 831.6, and 749.1 cm(-1), whereas trans-KOONO absorbs at
   1528.4, 987.4, and 602.2 cm(-1) The assignments are based on observed
   O-18- and N-15-isotopic shifts and comparison with similar compounds,
   cis-cis and trans-perp HOONO. Ab initio calculations using density
   functional theory at a Becke3LYP level predicted similar line positions
   and isotopic shifts for both conformers. Photoconversion among these
   three isomers was achieved at various wavelengths and periods of
   irradiation; cis-KOONO was photolyzed readily at 308 nm, whereas
   trans-KOONO increased slightly in intensity initially and was eventually
   transformed to KNO3 on prolonged irradiation. Similar results were

Abstract = {{History and findings: A 68-year-old man, without any preceding hepatic
   or abdominal disease, suddenly developed a severe septic illness with
   consumptive coagulopathy and upper abdominal pain. B-mode and duplex
   ultrasonography revealed fresh portal vein thrombosis. Despite extensive
   conservative measures there was no significant improvement after one
   week and further thrombus extension with threatened acute mesenteric
   vein occlusion.
   Treatment and course: Local fibrinolysis with recombinant plasminogen
   activator and urokinase via percutaneous transjugular intrahepatic
   catheterization of the portal vein achieved almost complete dissolution
   of the thrombus within 3 days. Subsequently the portal vein catheter was
   changed into a transjugular portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS).
   Conclusions: While local or systemic fibrinolysis has been practised in
   previously reported cases of acute portal vein thrombosis, the described
   use of TIPS introduces a new element. The shunt between hepatic and
   portal veins assures therapeutic access to the portal venous bed. It
   lowers portal vein pressure and can diminish the danger of recurrent
   thrombosis by raising portal flow. This minimally invasive procedure may
   be a nearly ideal treatment even in the course of portal vein thrombosis
   which has a high complication rate.}},

Abstract = {{Predissociation resonances of the radicals HCO and DCO were calculated
   using a three-dimensional (J=0) complex scaled discrete variable
   representation (DVR) method that was applied previously to a study of
   the weakly bound van der Waals complex NeICl {[}Lipkin, Moiseyev, and
   Leforestier, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 1888 (1993)]. This study represents a
   first application of the complex scaling method to a full dimensional
   chemical reactive system described by a fitted ab initio potential
   energy surface {[}Bowman, Bittman, and Harding, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 911
   (1986)]. It is shown that the calculation method, being applied to a
   strongly coupled three-dimensional system, provides a unique criteria
   that makes it possible to identify all resonances in a given energy
   range as stationary solutions with respect to a complex variational
   parameter, independently of the resonance widths and their mutual
   overlapping. About 50 resonances were found for the radical HCO in the
   energy range between the ground and the second vibrational state of the
   product diatomic CO, whereas only half of them were located in recent
   calculations {[}Dixon, J. Chem. Sec. Faraday Trans. 88, 2575 (1992);
   Wang and Bowman, J. Chem. Phys. 100, 1021 (1994)]. It was found that the
   labeling procedure based on a spectroscopic Hamiltonian fit of the bound
   states and resonance positions agrees completely with the assignment of
   HCO resonances given in previous calculations, and provides an
   assignment for the whole set of calculated resonances. Eighty-three
   resonances of the radical DCO were found in the same energy range. (C)

Abstract = {{A second protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) of the focal adhesion kinase
   (FAK) subfamily, cell adhesion kinase beta (CAK beta), was identified by
   cDNA cloning. The rat CAK beta is a 115.7-kDa PTK that contains N- and
   C-terminal domains of 418 and 330 amino acid residues besides the
   central kinase domain, The rat CAK beta has a homology with mouse FAK
   over their entire lengths except for the extreme N-terminal 88 residues
   and shares 45\% overall sequence identity (60\% identical in the
   catalytic domain), which indicates that CAK beta is a protein
   structurally related to but different from FAK. The CAK beta gene is
   less evenly expressed in a variety of rat organs than the FAK gene,
   Anti-CAK beta antibody immunoprecipitated a 113-kDa protein from rat
   brain, 3Y1 fibroblasts, and COS-7 cells transfected with CAK beta cDNA,
   The tyrosine-phosphorylated state of CAK beta was not reduced on
   trypsinization, nor enhanced in response to plating 3Y1 cells onto
   fibronectin, CAK beta localized to sites of cell-to-cell contact in
   COS-7 transfected with CAK beta cDNA, in which FAK was found at the
   bottom of the cells. Thus, CAK beta is a PTK possibly participating in
   the signal transduction regulated by cell-to-cell contacts.}},

Abstract = {{The 257 nm photodissociation dynamics of CH3I adsorbed on a MgO(001)
   surface is studied using classical molecular dynamics method. The

   semi-infinite array of static ions. A single adsorbate molecule is
   aligned with the surface normal, the methyl end pointed either toward or
   away from the substrate. The system is equilibrated by using a Monte
   Carlo method to obtain the starting configuration. Fragment final state
   distributions are calculated for kinetic energy, angle of departure, and
   rovibrational states. Upon photodissociation of the adsorbate with the
   methyl end pointed toward the surface, the methyl fragments experienced
   vibrational cooling, in agreement with experimental results. Some
   rotational excitation is predicted for fragments produced from the
   methyl down orientation. The kinetic energy distributions of both the
   methyl and iodine fragments are qualitatively similar to those obtained
   by experiment. The results are compared with those obtained by the same
   model for CH3I adsorbed on LiF(001). Trapping of iodine atoms by the

   in which some nu(CO) bands increase and some decrease in frequency;

   5-methyl-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4-isoxazole carboximide] is an
   immunosuppressive agent effective in the treatment of rheumatoid
   arthritis. In spite of its clinical potential, its mechanism of action
   has not been elucidated. Recent studies suggest that leflunomide may
   interfere with the metabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides. In our studies,
   the active metabolite of leflunomide, RS-61980 (A77 1726,
   2-hydroxyethylidene-cyanoacetic acid-4-trifluoromethyl anilide), was
   cytostatic towards a human T-lymphoblastoma cell line (A3.01). The
   inhibition of growth could be overcome completely by uridine. The other
   nucleosides, cytidine, adenosine and guanosine, did not overcome the
   effect of the compound. Since uridine is a precursor for the salvage
   synthesis of UMP, we propose that RS-61980 may be inhibiting the de novo
   pathway of UMP synthesis. Using human cells, the six enzymes catalyzing
   de novo UMP biosynthesis were tested for their sensitivity towards
   RS-61980. Only one of the enzymes, dihydroortate dehydrogenase (DHODH,
   EC 1.3.3.1) was inhibited by RS-61980 with a K-i value of 2.7 +/- 0.7 mu
   M. The other five enzymes were not affected. The inhibition exhibited
   mixed-type kinetics towards both substrates, dihydroorotic acid and
   coenzyme Q. These results suggest that the molecular target of
   leflunomide action is DHODH. The immunomodulating activity may be
   related to the inhibition of UMP synthesis in proliferating lymphocytes.}},

Abstract = {{completely revised version of the CHEAT force field (carbohydrate
   hydroxyl groups represented by extended atoms) is presented. This force
   field is meant to allow simulation of oligosaccharides in aqueous
   solution without the explicit inclusion of water molecules. Thus, the
   average effect of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding has been
   introduced into the potential energy function by adding a new (extended)
   atom type to the Quanta/CHARMm 4.0 force field. The additional force
   field parameters for the new atom type have been optimized by using a
   set of 56 estimated interaction energy differences for solvated
   cyclohexanols and aldopyranoses. The resulting CHEAT95 force field,
   which is computationally very efficient, has been applied to the
   disaccharides cellobiose, maltose, and sucrose. By comparing calculated
   potential energy maps with experimentally determined conformational data
   from X-ray, NMR, and optical rotation studies, it is shown that CHEAT95
   results closely agree with the disaccharide conformations observed in
   solution. All but one conformation of the disaccharides in crystal
   structures are within 4 kcal/mol of the calculated global minima. In
   particular sucrose, which conformational behavior constitutes a major
   problem to force field calculations, could be simulated in full
   agreement with the experimental data. Finally, a complete conformational
   search has been carried out for the glycosidic and exocyclic dihedrals
   of GlcNAc beta(1-->4){[}Fuc alpha(1-->3)]GlcNAc beta, a structural
   variant of Lewis X. The CHEAT95 results are in better agreement with NMR
   data and molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly include water
   molecules rather than with in vacuo calculations.}},

Abstract = {{UV absorption spectra of CF3CClH and CF3CClHO2 radicals have been
   investigated. The CF3CClH spectrum was quantified over the wavelength
   range 225-280 nm. The absorption cross section at 250 nm was (139 +/-
   16) x 10(-20) cm(2) molecule(-1). The absorption spectrum for CF3CClO2
   was quantified over the wavelength range 225-290 nm, and at 250 nm
   sigma(250) (nm) = (258 +/- 30) x 10(-20) cm(2) molecule(-1). The
   kinetics of the reactions of the peroxy radical CF3CClHO2 with NO and
   NO2 were studied and the derived rate constants were k(3) = (1.0 +/-
   0.3) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k(4) = (6.4 +/- 1.5) x
   10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), respectively. The self-reaction rate
   for the CF3CClHO2 radicals was measured and a value of k(6obs) = (4.4
   +/- 0.3) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) was obtained. The reactions
   of F atoms with CF3CH2Cl and of CF3CClH with O-2 were found to proceed
   with rate constants of k(8) = (2.0 +/- 0.6) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1)
   s(-1) and k(2) = (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10-(12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)
   respectively. The reaction of CF3CClHO2 radicals with NO gives NO2, and
   by implication CF3CClHO radicals, which in the atmosphere (a) react with
   O-2 to give CF3C(O)Cl and (b) decompose to give, most likely, CF3
   radicals and HC(O)Cl. In 700 Torr of N-2 diluent the rate constant ratio
   k(O2)/k(diss) = (2.1 +/- 0.4) x 10(-19) cm(3) molecule(-1). As part of
   the present work, relative rate techniques were used to measure rate
   constants for the reactions of Cl and F atoms with CF3CH2Cl of (6.8 +/-
   1.2) x 10(-15) and (2.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1),

   operating under conditions of dimensional restriction is shown to
   exhibit new types of synergism and noninteger kinetic orders. These

Abstract = {{THE synthesis of fullerenes encapsulating various metal atoms within the
   carbon cage (endohedral metallofullerenes) has stimulated wide
   interest(1,2) because of their unusual structural and electronic
   properties. Most of the metallofullerenes prepared so far have been
   based on C-82, and have incorporated lanthanum(1,3-5) yttrium(6,7),
   scandium(8) (10) and most of the lanthanide elements(11,12) Although
   there has been some debate about the endohedral nature of these
   compounds(2,13,14), observations using scanning tunnelling
   microscopy(15,16), extended X-ray absorption fine structure(17,18),
   transmission electron micrscopy(19) and electron spin; resonance(3,6)
   (8,10) have strongly suggested that the metal atoms are indeed inside
   the fullerene cages; theoretical calculations(20,21) also indicate that
   this is the case. But until now, no structural model has been derived
   experimentally to confirm the endohedral nature of the
   metallofullerenes. Here we report the results of a synchrotron X-ray
   powder diffraction study of Y@C-82 that confirms that the yttrium atom
   is located within the carbon cage. The yttrium atom is displaced from
   the centre of the C-82 molecule and is strongly bound to the carbon
   cage.}},

   acetonitrile compared to those in heptane could partly be explained by
   an increased solvation of the substrates in acetonitrile. Substrate
   solvation caused a 10-fold change in substrate going from heptane to
   acetonitrile. Deacylation was the rate determining specificity, defined
   as (V-m/K-m)(ethyl) (octanoate)/(V-m/K-m)(octanoic) (acid), step for the
   acyl transfer in heptane with vinyl- and ethyl octanoate as acyl donors
   and (R)-2-octanol as acyl acceptor. With I-octanol, a rate determining
   deacylation step in heptane was indicated using the same acyl donors.
   Using I-octanol as acceptor in heptane, S-ethyl thiooctanoate had a 25-
   to 30-fold lower V-m/K-m value and vinyl octanoate a 4-fold higher
   V-m/K-m value than that for ethyl octanoate. The difference showed to be
   a K-m effect for vinyl octanoate and mainly a K-m effect for S-ethyl
   thiooctanoate. The V-m values of the esterification of octanoic acid
   with different alcohols was 10-30-times lower than those for the
   corresponding transesterification of ethyl octanoate. The low activity
   could be explained by a low pH around the enzyme caused by the acid or a
   withdrawing of active enzyme by nonproductive binding by the acid.}},

Abstract = {{The metallo-peptide {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 contains two copies of the DNA
   recognition peptide of the yeast bZIP protein GCN4 assembled into a
   dimer with a 4'-substituted bis(terpyridyl)iron(II) complex.
   {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 contains the same DNA recognition peptide as GCN4, yet
   it possesses a function that GCN4 does not: it discriminates between the
   CRE (ATGACGTCAT) and AP-1 (ATGACTCAT) target sites, two bZIP target
   sites that differ by the presence or the absence of a single G . C base
   pair. In terms of its CRE/AP-1 specificity, {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 resembles
   the bZIP proteins CREB and CRE-BP1, whose biological functions require
   accurate discrimination of these two target sites. Here are described a
   series of experiments that explore the molecular basis for the high
   CRE/AP-1 specificity of {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 and its homologue
   {[}G(28)T(S)]Fe-2. Quantitative analysis of equilibrium dissociation
   constants reveals that the stabilities of the {[}G(28)T(S)]Fe-2 . CRE
   and {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 . CRE complexes are no higher than those of the
   corresponding disulfide-dimer . CRE complexes. In addition, the
   phosphate interference patterns of the {[}G(28)TS]Fe-2 . CRE and
   {[}G(29)T(S)]Fe-2 . CRE complexes superpose on those of the
   corresponding disulfide-dimer . CRE complexes. Finally, helical phasing
   analysis reveals that the metallo-peptides and the disulfide-dimer
   peptides all induce equivalent distortions in the DNA. However, CRE/AP-1
   specificity is eliminated when the bis(terpyridyl)iron(II) complex is
   replaced by a sterically less-demanding bipyridyl moiety. This result,
   analyzed in the context of recently solved structures of GCN4 bound to
   the CRE and AP-1 target sites, leads us to propose that CRE/AP-1
   specificity results from interactions between the
   bis(terpyridyl)iron(II) complex and the proximal region of the peptide
   that disrupts one or more critical protein AP-l interactions.
   Remarkably, the mechanism of CRE/AP-1 specificity proposed for the
   metallo-peptide bZIP models miners, at least in part, the mechanism
   employed by the naturally CRE-selective proteins CREB and CRE-BP1. Our
   observation that subtle and indirect effects on the conformation of a
   short peptide can lead to large changes in DNA target specificity
   provides evidence that it may be possible to design surprisingly small
   molecules that bind DNA with high sequence-specificity as well as high
   affinity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective.-To determine the impact of limiting international medical
   graduate (IMG) participation in US graduate medical education (GME) on
   the delivery of hospital care to the poor.
   Methods.-To ascertain the pattern of IMG participation in GME and the
   degree to which the principal teaching hospitals with programs with
   large IMG enrollments provide care to the poor, we used data from the
   American Medical Association 1993 Annual Survey of Graduate Medical
   Education Programs and Teaching Institutions to analyze the pattern of
   IMG participation in GME in the six core specialties of internal
   medicine, family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery,
   pediatrics, and psychiatry.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Programs were identified as IMG dependent if at
   least 50\% of the resident physicians enrolled in the first year of the
   program were IMGs. All programs were linked to their principal teaching
   hospitals, and hospitals were assessed according to the number of
   programs based at each institution, the number of IMG-dependent programs
   at the institution, and whether no-pay patients and/or Medicaid/public
   assistance beneficiaries constituted more than 20\% of the patients
   served.
   Results.-Of the 20 170 first-year resident physicians in the six core
   specialties, 31.8\% were IMGs. The proportion of programs dependent on
   IMG enrollment was 27.7\%, ranging from 5.2\% in obstetrics and
   gynecology programs to 49.5\% in psychiatry programs. About 72\% of all
   first-year IMGs were in IMG-dependent programs. Of the 688 hospitals
   serving as principal teaching sites for programs in at least one of the
   six core specialties, 106 were categorized as dependent on IMG programs,
   but only 77 of those provided a disproportionate amount of care to the
   poor. Finally, 40\% of IMG-dependent GME programs and 36\% of first-year
   IMG residents were based in hospitals that did not provide a
   disproportionate amount of care to the poor.
   Conclusions.-Based on this analysis, 77 hospitals can arguably be
   considered dependent on IMG resident physicians to provide care to the
   poor. Moreover, a large number of IMG residents and IMG-dependent
   programs are in hospitals that do not provide a disproportionate amount
   of care to the poor. These findings show the scale of the problem
   policymakers must address if they choose to limit IMG access to GME
   while maintaining access of the poor to needed hospital care.}},

Abstract = {{The cGMP-mediated phospholamban phosphorylation was investigated in
   cardiomyocytes in response to receptor-dependent (atrial natriuretic
   peptide, ANP) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside; SNP) cGMP
   generation. ANP (InM-1 mu M) induced phospholamban phosphorylation in a
   concentration-dependent fashion (EC(50): 5.0+/-0.09 nM). Concomitantly,
   an elevation in cGMP levels was observed. Phospholamban was also
   dose-dependently phosphorylated in response to SNP, but it required
   about three orders of magnitude higher concentrations (EC(50):
   2.9+/-0.03 mu M) than ANP. Treatment of the cells with 8Br-cGMP (10 mu
   M) or with the specific activator of cGMP-protein kinase 8-pCPT-cGMP
   (1-100 mu M) mimicked these effects. The results demonstrate for the
   first time that a ANP/cGMP signaling pathway exists in neonatal
   cardiomyocytes which may contribute to modulation of heart
   contractility. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Regeneration of severed central axons is supposed to depend on two
   factors: a permissive local environment and the particular intrinsic
   properties of axotomized neurones. To assess the role of each of these
   factors in axonal regeneration, the capability of two particular axon
   populations of the adult mouse cerebellum to grow into target-specific
   (cerebellum) and target-unspecific (neocortex) embryonic grafts was
   determined. Purkinje cell and inferior olivary axons were transected by
   passing a microscalpel through the axial white matter of the cerebellar
   folia, particularly those of the anterior lobe. Immediately after the
   injury, solid transplants were placed in the lesion cavity. Purkinje
   cell axons were labelled by using anticalbindin immunocytochemistry, and
   olivocerebellar fibres were visualized by biotinylated dextran amine
   anterograde axonal tracing.
   Following axotomy, Purkinje cell axons appeared as thickened processes
   ending with large terminal clubs. Their morphology and number did not
   change up to the longest survival time considered (2 months), thereby
   confirming previous demonstrations that Purkinje cells survive axon
   injury (I. Dusart and C. Sotelo, 1994, J. Comp. Neurol. 347:211-232).
   Inferior olivary axons were thinner and bore smaller terminal bulbs.
   When embryonic cerebellar grafts, containing cortical and deep nuclear
   precursors, were placed close to the injured axons, olivocerebellar
   fibres vigorously regenerated into the transplants and ended in new
   climbing fibres along the dendrites of grafted Purkinje cells. By
   contrast, host Purkinje cell axons never showed any outgrowth towards
   the graft. Similarly, these axons failed to regenerate into grafts
   containing solely the rostromedial portion of the cerebellar anlage,
   mostly consisting of deep nuclear neurones, their main targets.
   Comparable results were obtained by transplanting embryonic neocortical
   tissue: inferior olivary axons also regenerated into the grafts,
   although with distinct terminal arbours without the climbing fibre
   phenotype, whereas Purkinje cell axons always failed to grow.
   These results provide the first direct demonstration that severed
   inferior olivary axons are able to regenerate. In addition, they show
   that the growth-permissive/-promoting conditions created by embryonic
   nervous tissue are not sufficient to induce the regeneration of every
   axonal type and allow us to hypothesise that successful regeneration
   depends on the interplay between environmental cues and intrinsic
   properties of the axotomized neurones. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments on superfused slices of rat hippocampus showed that the
   nootropic drugs pyracetam, ethymizol, ambocarb, and nooglutil increase
   the amplitude of populational EPSP (pEPSP) of neurons of the dentate
   gyrus evoked by electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway (PP).
   Nootropes exert no effect on the process of presynaptic glutamate
   liberation from the PP axons, but increase the chemosensitivity of the
   postsynaptic AMPA/kainate receptors mediating EPSP generation in the
   dentate gyrus neurons. Inhibitors of protein kinase (A-buthamide) and
   guanylatecyclase (methylene blue) do not modify the effects of
   nootropes. The nootrope-induced potentiation of pEPSP does not develop
   against the background of the application of calmodulin inhibitor W-7.
   In the presence of protein kinase inhibitor C, polymixin B, nootropes
   reversibly depress pEPSP in the dentate gyrus neurons, Blocking of the
   NMDA receptor ionic channels by ketamine and of the voltage-dependent
   T-type calcium channels by Ni2+ does not significantly modify the
   effects of nootropic drugs. A blocker of Ca2+-ATPase of the Ca2+ stores
   sodium orthovanadate, potentiates the effects of nootropes. Dantrolene,
   which disrupts Ca2+ liberation from the non-mitochondrical depots,
   blocks the effects of nootropes and diminishes pEPSP depression evoked
   by nootropes in the presence of polymixin B. On the basis of presented
   data, it is supposed that nootropic drugs assist Ca2+ liberation from
   the neuronal depots and activate calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and
   protein kinase C. Protein kinases phosphorylate the intracellular
   domains of the AMPA/kainate receptors, and this process results in an
   increase in their sensitivity to excitatory amino acids.}},

Abstract = {{Optimum treatment of neuropathic pain includes the use of adjuvant
   analgesics such as antipsychotic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants.
   Although the mechanism of their analgesic action is not known, it is
   possible that such agents act directly on pain pathways. The ability of
   capsaicin and its analogs to selectively deactivate primary afferent
   neurons provides a basis for their use in human therapy to relieve a
   number of chronic pain conditions. We examined whether the phenothiazine
   antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine (TFP) as well as other neuroleptics
   and tricyclic antidepressants have an effect on the agonist binding
   properties and the activation of the human and rat vanilloid receptors.
   Binding of {[}H-3]resiniferatoxin (RTX) to membrane preparations of
   human dorsal horn and rat whole spinal cord was affected by TFP in a
   biphasic fashion, with an initial 25 and 65\% enhancement of {[}H-3]RTX
   binding, respectively, preceding inhibition. The apparent K-i values for
   inhibition were 3.93 +/- 0.13 mu M for human dorsal horn and 7.91 +/-
   0.62 mu M for rat spinal cord. Scatchard analyses revealed that TFP
   affected both the affinity and the cooperativity of {[}H-3]RTX binding
   by the receptors, leaving the receptor density unaltered. Similar
   effects on {[}H-3]RTX binding to rat spinal cord membranes were also
   induced by other antipsychotic phenothiazines and other types of
   antipsychotics, by phenothiazines without antipsychotic actions, as well
   as by tricyclic antidepressants. In cultures of dorsal root ganglion
   neurones, TFP at concentrations that increased {[}H-3]RTX binding (1-3
   mu M) also induced an increase in Ca-45 uptake; this increase was absent
   in cultures prepared from capsaicin desensitized animals. Furthermore,
   TFP at a concentration of 10 mu M also increased the extent of Ca-45
   uptake induced by 0.3 mu M capsaicin. Our results suggest that at
   therapeutic concentrations (0.5-5.0 mu M) TFP may increase the affinity
   of the vanilloid receptor for agonists and thereby accelerate its
   desensitization.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-transient tests in naturally fractured reservoirs often exhibit
   nonuniform responses. Various models explain such nonuniformity;
   however, their relevance is often not justified on a geologic basis.
   Fractal geometry provides a method to account for a great variety of
   such transients under the assumption that the network of fractures is
   fractal. This paper presents an application to real well tests in
   various fractured reservoirs. The physical meaning of the fractal
   parameters is presented in the context of well testing. Examples showing
   a behavior similar to the finite-conductivity fracture model or to
   spherical flow are presented and explained by the alternative of fractal
   networks. A behavior that can be mistakenly interpreted as a
   double-porosity case is also analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Aged mice exhibit an increase in their body weight (BW), which is
   associated with fat deposit increase. Epidermal growth. factor (EGF)
   concentration in the submandibular gland also increases with aging. We
   examined the effects of elevated EGF on the adiposity of aged female
   mice. Studies were started in two groups of animals consisting of
   sham-operated (n=10) and sialoadenectomized (n=10, Sr; surgical removal
   of the submandibular glands) mice at 8 weeks of age. Body weight gain
   and food intake were measured throughout 78 weeks of age in these two
   groups. Body weight was significantly less in the Sr group throughout 78
   weeks, while food intake was not changed by Sr after 12 weeks of age. To
   examine further if EGF plays a role in the induction of adiposity in
   aged female mice, sham-operated animals were given 100 mu l anti-EGF
   rabbit antiserum (anti-EGF group, n=5) or normal rabbit serum (control
   group, n=5) every 3 days, and Sr animals were given 5 mu g/day EGF
   (Sx+EGF group, n=5) or saline (Sx group, n=5) from 78 weeks of age for 3
   weeks. At 81 weeks of age, all animals of these four groups were killed,
   and carcass fat deposition and fat cell sizes were measured. Although
   the relative weights (weight ratio to BW) of the Liver and kidney were
   not changed by Sr and anti-EGF treatment, the relative weights of
   mesenteric and subcutaneous fat tissues and adipocyte weights were
   significantly decreased in Sr and anti-EGF; groups compared with the
   control group. Moreover, both acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and lipoprotein
   lipase (LPL) mRNA levels were significantly decreased by Sr or anti-EGF
   administration in mesenteric and subcutaneous fat tissues. On the other
   hand, EGF administration to Sr animals had no effect on BW, fat tissues
   and adipocyte weights, and ACS and LPL mRNA levels. The results,
   however, were consistent with the fact that adipose tissue EGF receptors
   were down regulated in Sr mice. These findings suggest that EGF may play
   a role in the induction of adiposity in aged female mice.}},

Abstract = {{Localized, irreversible adsorption of interacting colloid particles from
   well-defined hows was studied experimentally and theoretically. The
   impinging-jet cells were used for creating the axisymmetric and
   plane-parallel (slot) laminar flows, enabling a direct microscope
   determination of particle adsorption kinetics. Monodisperse suspension
   of polystyrene latex particles was used for measuring the influence of
   how intensity (shear rate) on particle adsorption kinetics. The
   experimental data were interpreted in terms of the approximate
   analytical predictions derived using the random sequential adsorption
   (RSA) approach valid for low and moderate surface concentrations. For an
   arbitrary range of surface concentrations the general sequential
   Brownian dynamics (SBD) simulation method was used to interpret the
   experimental data. It was found that these theoretical methods reflected
   well the characteristic features of the adsorption experiments,
   especially the significant decrease of adsorption kinetics for higher
   how shear rates and low ionic strengths caused by the hydrodynamic
   scattering effect (HSE). Due to this effect, the surface-blocking
   phenomena for spherical particles become analogous to elongated
   non-spherical particles under no-how adsorption conditions. (C) 1995

   used to develop an ELISA-inhibition system using a reference Parietaria
   judaica extract (in-house Reference preparation, IHR). The assays
   performed with these reagents were firstly standardized by testing the
   IHR several times. A good reproducibility, evaluated both at the level

   the slopes of the regression curves, was obtained. Subsequently, the
   potency of several Parietaria judaica extracts, either obtained by
   manufacturing companies or produced in other laboratories, was evaluated
   by these tests. Data obtained by interpolation with the IHR values and
   expressed in terms of arbitrary units (AU) were compared with those
   obtained by classical human IgE inhibition, performed with sera from

   Results indicate that the monoclonal antibodies produced in our

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate the immediate reproducibility of
   time domain parameters in the signal averaged electrocardiogram using a
   new method for endpoint determination in individual Frank leads. The
   method is based on a statistical model of the electrocardiogram (EGG) in
   which maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is employed. The
   reproductibility of the ML method was compared to that of conventional
   time domain analysis using the vector magnitude (VM) of Frank leads.
   Fifty-nine patients were included in the study and two consecutive ECGs
   were recorded for signal averaging. The results showed that the mean of
   the absolute difference of the filtered ORS duration (QRSD) between two
   consecutive recordings was significantly lower for the ML method than
   the conventional method when employing 60 Hz high filtering (2.1 +/- 2.2
   ms vs 5.9 +/- 10.2 ms, P<0.05). Moreover, the ML method resulted in a
   significantly longer QRSD compared to the VM-based method (P<0.05). The
   terminal amplitude of the QRS complex (RMS40) showed a greater
   variability than the QRSD for both methods, although the ML method was
   associated with a higher reproducibility than the VM method for the 60
   Hz filter. These findings may contribute to a better identification of
   patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias. A reduction in the
   number of measurement errors has important implications when QRS changes

Abstract = {{The effect of various tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors on processes
   involved in the antiproliferative effect of interferon-gamma on WISH
   cells was studied. Following 24 hr treatment interferon-gamma inhibited
   thymidine incorporation into DNA and thymidine kinase activity bur no
   significant effect on cell number was observed. The isoflavonoid,
   genistein, which is a specific inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinase,
   reversed the inhibition in thymidine incorporation caused by the
   cytokine in a dose dependent manner. Prunetin, a member of the same
   group, did not significantly antagonize this effect.
   N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysyl chloromethane, a serine protease inhibitor which
   also selves as a tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor, partially reversed
   the effect of interferon-gamma at a concentration of 100 mu M. The
   bioflavonoid quercetin, a non-specific tyrosine protein kinase
   inhibitor, at a concentration of 30 mu M completely abolished the action
   of interferon-gamma on thymidine incorporation. Genistein completely
   reversed the inhibition of thymidine kinase exerted by interferon, while
   quercetin had only a slight effect. However, the drugs could not
   antagonize the antiproliferative effect of interferon following 48 hr
   incubation, as measured by reduction of cell number. The results
   indicate that tyrosine protein kinase may play a role in the effects of
   interferon on thymidine methabolism and thymidine kinase activity. The
   differential effects of the inhibitors on thymidine metabolism and cell
   proliferation could support dissociation between the effect of
   interferon-gamma on these processes. Alternatively, this dissociation of
   effects could point to the limited use of inhibitors in clarifying modes
   of action as described.}},

Abstract = {{The antagonistic control of the phytopathogen Fusarium oxysporum by
   Trichoderma species is impaired in the presence of phosphinothricin, a
   microbial toxin commercialized for chemical weed control under trade
   names Basta, Ignite, and Herbiace. The influence of phosphinothricin on
   growth parameters and nitrogen metabolism in nine strains of Trichoderma
   and a closely related fungus Nectria ochroleuca was investigated. The
   presence of 1 mM phosphinothricin was lethal to the Trichoderma anamorph
   of Hypocrea gelatinosa and almost equally inhibitory to Trichoderma
   polysporum. In other species it caused marked reductions in the hyphal
   protein content, accompanied by lower biomass yields in all except N.
   ochroleuca. Under normal growth conditions, these rapidly growing fungi
   maintain highly active levels of the two key enzymes of ammonium
   assimilation, glutamine synthetase, and NADPH-dependent glutamate
   dehydrogenase. Phosphinothricin, by causing an inhibition in glutamine
   synthetase activity, diminishes the enzymic potential for the combined
   operation of these two alternative pathways. The level of
   NADPH-glutamate dehydrogenase activity was exceptionally high in N.
   ochroleuca, and although declining in the presence of phosphinothricin,
   remained much higher than those in nine strains of Trichoderma. The
   levels of NADPH-glutamate dehydrogenase in T. harzianum, T.
   citrinoviride, and T. viride were higher in the presence than in the
   absence of phosphinothricin. In the presence of phosphinothricin, the
   levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase
   activities were stimulated in T. harzianum, T. atroviride, T.
   citrinoviride, and T. viride and that of alanine aminotransferase in T.
   koningii. Trichoderma harzianum and T. atroviride contain single anionic
   molecular forms of glutamine synthetase, NADPH-glutamate dehydrogenase,

Abstract = {{A number of studies, using either rat or rabbit models, have focused on
   delineating the role of cell surface glycoconjugates in corneal
   epithelial cell migration and wound healing. We have recently identified
   the cell surface sialoglycoproteins of rabbit corneal epithelium and
   have shown that the levels of at least three membrane glycoproteins are
   markedly altered during cell migration. Because species-related
   differences may be present, it is important to select an appropriate
   animal model for studies designed to contribute to the understanding of
   the mechanism of human corneal wound healing. The purpose of this study
   was to identify the cell surface sialoglycoproteins of human corneal
   epithelium. Plasma membrane sialoglycoproteins of primary cultures of
   human corneal epithelium were labeled with (NaBH4)-H-3 after oxidation
   by mild NaIO4 treatment. The labeled glycoproteins were analyzed by
   SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Four different
   preparations of human corneal epithelial cell cultures were analyzed,
   and results were compared with those of rabbit corneal epithelium. Of
   the 11 radiolabeled sialoglycoproteins we identified recently in rabbit
   corneal epithelium, eight were also present in human corneal epithelium.
   These similarities in the electrophoretic patterns of the plasma
   membrane glycoproteins of the two species suggest that rabbit is most
   likely an appropriate animal model for studies designed to contribute to
   the understanding of the structure and function of cell surface
   glycoproteins of human corneal epithelium.}},

Abstract = {{The donor-recipient protoplast fusion method was used to produce cybrid
   plants and to transfer cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) from two
   cytoplasmic male-sterile lines MTC-5A and MTC-9A into a fertile japonica
   cultivar, Sasanishiki. The CMS was expressed in the cybrid plants and
   was stably transmitted to their progenies. Only cytoplasmic traits of
   the male-sterile lines, especially the mitochondrial DNAs, were
   introduced into the cells of the fertile rice cultivar. More than 80\%
   of the cybrid plants did not set any seeds upon selfing. Sterile cybrid
   plants set seeds only when they were fertilized with normal pollen by
   hand and yielded only sterile progenies. This maternally inherited
   sterility of the cybrid plants showed that they were characterized by
   CMS. The CMS of cybrid plants could be restored completely by crossing
   with MTC-10R which had the single dominant gene Rf-1 for restoring
   fertility. These results indicated that CMS was caused by the
   mitochondrial genome introduced through protoplast fusion. The
   introduced CMS was stably transmitted to their progenies during at least
   eight backcross generations. These results demonstrate that cybrids
   generated by the donor-recipient protoplast fusion technique can be used
   in hybrid rice breeding for the creation of new cytoplasmic male-sterile
   rice lines.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphocytes of intestinal epithelia were examined in lambs
   experimentally infected with coccidia. Fourteen conventional,
   coccidia-free 3-week-old lambs of the Dala breed were given either
   250,000 (eight lambs in experiment 1) or 100,000 (six lambs in
   experiment 2) sporulated oocysts of Eimeria ovinoidalis (>99.9\% pure)
   via a stomach tube. Nine lambs (five in experiment 1 and four in
   experiment 2) of the same age served as uninoculated controls. The
   infected lambs developed diarrhea and dehydration between days 10 and 13
   after infection. Intestinal specimens were collected 10-20 days after
   inoculation. A heavy multifocal infection of the epithelium comprising
   schizonts, gamonts, and oocysts resulted, with changes being most
   pronounced in the large intestine and the terminal part of ileum.
   Lesions included villous atrophy, villous fusions, and crypt
   hyperplasia. Computer-assisted morphometric analysis was applied to
   immunoperoxidase-stained sections for quantification of intraepithelial
   T cell subsets and included the distal jejunum of lambs of experiment 1.
   A significant increase in the epithelial area of the distal jejunum
   occupied by CD8+ lymphocytes was found in the infected lambs as compared
   with uninfected controls (18.3\% versus 3.7\%). The increased presence
   of CD8+ cells may be of significance in the intestinal immune response
   to ovine coccidiosis. A moderate, overall increase was also found for
   the gamma delta lymphocytes in the jejunal epithelium. Examination of
   the ileum of infected lambs of both experiments showed a scarcity of
   gamma delta cells (0.4\% of epithelial area) in stretches of epithelium
   infected by coccida as compared with adjacent noninfected epithelium
   (4.0\% of epithelial area). The significance of this negative
   association between gamma delta T cells and infected epithelial cells in
   ovine coccidiosis is unknown.}},

   estimate of the ductility capacity of a RC section. The maximum value of
   tension steel ratio permissible to insure a specified ductility for
   singly and doubly reinforced sections is calculated under low and high
   strain rates of loading. The ductility capacities of the sections
   reinforced by the maximum longitudinal steel ratio permitted by the ACI
   Code for conventional and seismic design and for moment redistribution
   also are calculated.
   The results indicate that using the code-specified yield strength of the
   reinforcing steel leads to an overestimation of the ductility capacity
   of RC sections. ACI provisions of limiting the maximum longitudinal
   steel ratios insure sufficient ductility only for maximum ratio allowed

   Methods. One hundred women completed measures of benefits and barriers
   to calcium intake, exercise participation, ERT/HRT usage; self-efficacy;
   control of health; importance of health; and health status. Participants
   also reported their actual calcium intake, exercise participation, and
   use of ERT/HRT.
   Results. Participants consumed an average of 1,243 mg of calcium from
   milk, yogurt, calcium-rich foods, and supplements; 81\% participated in
   weight-bearing and resistant training exercise but on an irregular
   basis; and 31\% were users of ERT/HRT at the time of data collection.
   There were significant relationships between some of the HPM variables
   and calcium intake and exercise participation. There was a significant
   difference between past and current users of ERT regarding benefits and
   barriers to taking hormones. Hormone users reported higher calcium
   intake and greater exercise participation than nonusers.
   Conclusion. There is early evidence that variables of the HPM are
   associated with OPBs. After continued testing, intervention programs for
   osteoporosis prevention may use variables of the HPM as a theoretical
   base for behavior changes. (C) 1995 academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Ambiguous genitalia represents a true medical and social emergency which
   needs a multi-disciplinary team approach for elucidation. The paediatric
   radiologist plays an important role in defining the genital anatomy
   which remains one of the most important factors in sex determination.
   Aiming to compare the predictive value of pelvic ultrasonography and
   genitography in sex determination in patients with ambiguous genitalia,
   we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 69 patients, 53
   females and 16 males, where both procedures were employed. In female
   pseudohermaphroditism, the presence of a uterus with or without vagina
   was predicted in 46 (86.8\%) patients by ultrasound compared with 44
   (83\%) patients in whom a genitogram revealed a vagina +/- uterus. In
   six (11.3\%) patients, a genitogram revealed a male-type urethra. The
   combination of ultrasound and genitogram, however, was more sensitive
   and predicted the presence of a uterus with or without vagina in 52
   (98.1\%) patients. In male pseudo-hermaphroditism, there was no false
   positive by ultrasound, and a genitogram revealed a male-type urethra in
   12 (75\%) patients. In conclusion, although real time pelvic
   ultrasonography is less invasive than genitography, its yield in
   elucidating genital anatomy is comparable. The combination of both
   procedures is more informative and has a better yield.}},

Abstract = {{Myristoylated, alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a
   lipopolysaccharide-induced protein kinase C (PKC) substrate that has
   been proposed to regulate actin-membrane interactions, as well as actin
   structure at the membrane. We studied the distribution of MARCKS, the
   alpha isozyme of PKC (PKC alpha), and myosin I in
   lipopolysaccharide-treated peritoneal macrophages ingesting zymosan
   particles. MARCKS, PKC alpha, and myosin I colocalized with F-actin and
   talin in the cortical cytoplasm adjacent to forming phagocytic cups.
   After particle ingestion was completed, myosin I, F-actin, and talin
   were no longer enriched in the vicinity of the phagosome. By contrast,
   MARCKS and PKC alpha remained associated with the phagosome membrane
   until after acquisition of the lysosomal marker Lamp-1. Vinculin was not
   detected on phagosomes at any time point examined. Phagocytosis of
   zymosan was accompanied by rapid and sustained phosphorylation of
   MARCKS. Inhibitors of PKC reduced zymosan binding to the macrophage
   surface and blocked the focal accumulation of F-actin, talin,
   phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, MARCKS, and PKC alpha beneath
   attached particles. We propose that PKC-dependent phosphorylation is an
   early signal required for zymosan phagocytosis and that MARCKS and PKC
   alpha have a role in phagosome maturation. The colocalization of F-actin
   and MARCKS at the cytoplasmic face of the nascent phagosome reinforces
   the hypothesis that MARCKS regulates actin structure at the membrane.
   Our data also suggest that myosin I functions as a mechanical motor
   during particle uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction experiments on mixtures of N2O/H2O/N-2 were performed in a
   variable pressure flow reactor over temperature, pressure, and residence
   time ranges of 1103-1173 K, 1.5-10.5 atm, and 0.2-0.8 s, respectively.
   Mixtures of approximately 1\% N2O in N-2 were studied with the addition
   of varying amounts of water vapor, from background to 3580 ppm.
   Experimentally measured profiles of N2O, O-2, NO, NO2, H2O, and
   temperature were compared with predictions from detailed kinetic
   modeling calculations to assess the validity of a reaction mechanism
   developed from currently available literature thermochemical and rate
   constant parameters. Sensitivity and reaction flux analyses were
   performed to determine key elementary reaction path processes and rates.
   Reaction rate constants for the uni-molecular reaction, N2O --> N-2 + O,
   were determined at various pressures in order to match overall
   experimental and numerical decomposition rates of N2O. The numerical
   model included a newly determined rate constant for N2O + OH --> HO2 +
   N-2 with an upper limit of 5.66 x 10(8) cm(3) mol(-1) sec(-1) at 1123 K.
   This is considerably smaller than presently reported in the literature.
   The experimentally observed rate of N2O decomposition was found to be
   slightly dependent on added water concentration. The rate constant
   determined for the elementary decomposition is strongly dependent on the
   choice of rate constants for the N2O + O double left right arrow N-2 +
   O-2 and N2O + O double left right arrow NO + NO reactions. In the
   absence of accurate data at the temperatures of this work, and based on
   these and other experiments in this laboratory, we presently recommend
   rate constants from the review of Baulch et al. The basis for this
   recommendation is discussed, including the impact on the rate constants
   derived for elementary nitrous oxide decomposition. The uncertainties in
   the rate constants as reported here are +/-30\%.
   The present mechanism was applied to previously reported high-pressure
   shock tube data and yields a high-pressure limit rate constant a factor
   of three larger than previously reported at these temperatures. The
   following expressions for the elementary decomposition reaction are
   recommended: k(0), N-2 = 9.13 x 10(14) exp(-57,690/RT) cm(3) mol(-1)
   s(-1) and k(x) = 7.91 X 10(10) exp(-56020/RT) s(-1). Simple Lindemann
   fits utilizing these parameters reproduce the pressure dependent rate
   constants measured here within +/-25\%. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons,

   median age of 34.5 years and a median weight of 70.0 kg were enrolled in
   the study, Patients received 1 of 15 dose levels (range, 0.5 to 8.0

   cumulative dose amount of 8 g. Plasma samples for amphotericin B
   determination (median number, 4; range, 2 to 30) and daily serum
   creatinine values were obtained for each patient. Iterative two-stage
   analysis, one of several approaches to population pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic modelling, was employed for the pharmacokinetic
   analysis, The plasma data were available for 51 of 75 patients and were
   best described by a two-compartment model, Both plasma clearance and
   volume of distribution increased with escalating doses; the overall
   average terminal elimination half-life was 29 h, Of the covariates
   studied, only body weight and dose size were significant. Serum
   creatinine values over the duration of therapy were available for 59 of
   75 patients, Overall, there was no net change in renal function over the
   duration of therapy; 12 patients had >30\% increases in creatinine
   clearance, whereas 13 had >30\% decreases, No measure of amphotericin B
   colloidal dispersion exposure, demographic values, or concomitant

   with rest technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) tomograms in
   order to compare the tracers for the assessment of myocardial viability
   and to validate a rapid protocol combining the two tracers. We studied
   30 consecutive patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease
   {[}group 1: 16 with normal left Ventricular function, mean left
   ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 55\%, SD 6\%; group 2: 14 with
   abnormal function, mean LVEF 28\%, SD 8\%]. (201)T1 was injected during
   infusion of adenosine followed by acquisition of conventional stress and
   redistribution tomograms. On a separate day, (201)T1 was injected at
   rest with imaging 4 h later. Tc-99m-MIBI was then given at rest and
   imaging was performed. Three images were compared: redistribution
   (201)T1, rest (201)T1, and rest Tc-99m-MIBI. Tracer activity was
   classified visually and quantitatively in nine segments and segments
   with > 50\% activity were defined as containing clinically significant
   viable myocardium. Mean (+/- SD) global tracer uptake as a percentage of
   maximum was similar in group I (rest (201)T1 69\% +/- 12\%,
   redistribution (201)T1 69\% +/- 15\%, rest Tc-99m-MIBI 70\% +/- 13\%,
   ANOVA P > 0.05), but in group 2 mean tracer uptake was significantly
   greater in the rest (201)T1 images (59\% +/- 16\%) than in
   redistribution (201)T1 images (53\% +/- 17\%) or rest Tc-99m-MIBI images
   (53\% +/- 19\%) (ANOVA P = 0.02). Overall agreement for regional uptake
   score was excellent (kappa from 0.79 to 0.84), although there were a
   significant number of segments with less uptake shown by redistribution
   (201)T1 and by rest Tc-99m-MIBI than by rest (201)T1 in group 2 (P <
   0.001). The number of segments with significant viable myocardium in
   group 1 was very similar between the three images (P > 0.05) but in
   group 2 rest (201)T1 identified significantly more segments as viable
   than the other images (McNemar P < 0.001). Thus (201)T1 and Tc-99m-MIBI
   provide similar information in patients without prior infarction and
   with normal left ventricular function (group 1), and a rapid protocol
   with stress (201)T1 injection and imaging followed immediately by rest
   Tc-99m-MIBI injection and imaging is feasible. In patients with abnormal
   left ventricular function and prior infarction (group 2), Tc-99m-MIBI
   may underestimate the extent of clinically significant viable
   myocardium.}},

Abstract = {{The flow and heat transfer in a laminar condensate film on an isothermal
   vertical plate is modelled mathematically. The strict Boussinesq
   approximation is adopted to account for buoyancy due to local
   temperature variations within the film. A similarity transformation
   reduces the governing boundary-layer type equations to a coupled set of
   ordinary differential equations and the resulting three-parameter
   two-point boundary value problem is solved numerically for Prandtl
   numbers, Pr, ranging from 0.001 to 1000 and Jakob numbers, Ja, between
   0.0001 and 1.5. The principal effects of the favourable buoyancy are to
   reduce the thickness of the condensate film and increase the film
   velocity at the smooth liquid-vapour interface, whereas the friction and
   heat transfer at the plate are enhanced. In accordance with the
   classical Nusselt theory, it is found that the temperature varies nearly
   linearly across the film. The computed similarity profiles for velocity
   reveal, however, substantial departures from the parabolic distribution
   assumed in the simplified Nusselt analysis.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{432-443}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydroelectric power is a major source of electric energy in northwestern
   Washington, and an important part of the region's economy. In
   `'run-of-the-river'' hydroelectric projects, water is diverted from a
   river when the discharge exceeds a specified flow and is conveyed
   downhill to a powerhouse. Creeks used for hydropower generation also
   constitute the natural spawning habitat for anadromous cold-water fish.
   Because fish embryo survival rates decrease with an increase in the
   percentage of fine sediments in spawning gravels, studies of the
   potential effects of flow diversion on sediment transport are typically
   required when applying for a permit to build a run-of-the-river project.
   To provide insight into the actual impacts of flow diversion on sediment
   conditions, and thus fish habitat, we reproduced channel-morphology
   measurements and sediment texture sampling originally made for the
   pre-construction study of Koma Kulshan, a small run-of-the-river
   hydroelectric power plant in northwestern Washington that has been in
   operation since 1990. Potential non-project changes were controlled by
   additional sampling upstream of the project. Flow diversion appears to
   have had an impact on fine-sediment transport, but has not significantly
   affected coarse-sediment transport in the gravel-bed streams studied.
   This is because flow diversion represents a small portion of the peak
   flows likely to move coarse sediment, but can be a significant portion
   of the low flows during which only fine sediment is transported.}},

   potent antagonist at cardiac M(2) receptors that mediate the decrease in

   this dose did not affect the ganglionic M(1) receptor-mediated
   tachycardia and presser response to muscarine or McN-A-343. These in

Abstract = {{A quantitative mobility spectrum analysis (QMSA) of experimental Hall
   and resistivity data as a function of magnetic field is presented. This
   technique enables the conductivity contribution of bulk majority
   carriers to be separated from that of other species such as thermally
   generated minority carriers, electrons, and holes populating n and p
   doped regions, respectively, and two-dimensional species at surfaces aad
   interface layers. Starting with a suitable first trial function such as
   the Beck and Anderson mobility spectrum analysis (MSA), a variation on
   the iterative procedure of Dziuba and Gorska is used to obtain a
   mobility spectrum which enables the various carrier species present in
   the sample to be identified. The QMSA algorithm combines the fully
   automated execution and visually meaningful output format of MSA with
   the quantitative accuracy of the conventional least-squares
   multi-carrier fitting procedure. Examples of applications to HgCdTe
   infrared detector materials and InAs/GaSb quantum wells are discussed.
   The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide an automated, universal
   algorithm which may be used routinely in the analysis and interpretation
   of magneto-transport data for diverse semiconductor materials and
   bandgap engineered structures.}},

Abstract = {{The Microscopic Photometric Monolayer Technique provides a tool to
   measure red blood cell (RBC) stiffness (resistance to elongation) and
   relaxation time. It combines many of the advantages of flow channel
   studies of point-attached RBCs with the simplicity, sensitivity and
   accuracy of photometric light transmission measurement. This technique
   allows the study of the effects of physicochemical factors on the
   elongation and relaxation time of the same cells within an average of
   four to five thousand cells adhered as a monolayer to glass. Further,
   the time course of physicochemical effects on cell membrane and
   wash-in/wash-out kinetics of interactions can be followed. An automated
   version of this technique was developed. A dense monolayer of
   point-attached RBCs was prepared at the bottom of a flow-chamber. A
   steady-state flow, with stepwise increases of flow rate, induced the RBC
   elongation. The light transmission perpendicular through the monolayer
   plane was measured photometrically. Photomicrographs compared with
   photometric results showed that the flow-induced bending and curvature
   change of RBC membrane was associated with the increase of light
   transmission. There was a linear correlation between the photometric
   index of elongation and the elongation taken from photomicrographs for
   shear stresses up to 0.75 Pa. A stiffness parameter, S (in Pa), was
   defined as the ratio of shear stress and elongation at a shear stress of
   0.25 Pa. Following a sudden flow stoppage, the RBCs returned to their
   resting shape and the RBC relaxation time was measured. The
   stiffness-relaxation time product, V (in mPas), was calculated to
   provide an estimate of viscosity. Diamide treatment, known to stiffen
   RBCs, did result in dose-dependent decreases of elongation and
   relaxation time. With increasing temperature, the relaxation time
   decreased at a rate of -2.96 ms/K; the stiffness increased significantly
   at a rate of 0.0038 Pa/K, and the stiffness-relaxation time product
   decreased with -2.95 mPas/K, reflecting an inverse relationship between
   RBC viscosity and temperature. Using the automated version of this
   technique (Elias-c-) to test RBCs of 36 healthy subjects, we found the
   inter-individual coefficients of variation to be 8.6\% for stiffness,
   7.9\% for relaxation time and 12.4\% for stiffness-relaxation time
   product.}},

Abstract = {{Several approaches to decrease the parasitic base-emitter and
   base-collector capacitances, and parasitic extrinsic base resistance, of
   III-V HBTs are reviewed. Base-emitter depletion capacitance reduction is
   achieved through modifications of the epitaxial layer structure to
   reduce doping in the emitter. A doping dipole is introduced in order to
   compensate for effects of conduction band offset that can adversely
   affect current gain and transconductance in AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs.
   Base-collector capacitance reduction is achieved with compensating
   implants of hydrogen and helium into the collector and subcollector
   regions (through the base layer), which decrease the extrinsic portion
   of the capacitance to a fringe component. Finally, to reduce extrinsic
   base resistance and to allow base-emitter capacitance reduction, a new
   structure is presented that allows HBT lateral scaling without excessive
   emitter edge recombination. This structure is based on multiple
   epitaxial growths, using GaInP, GaAs and InGaAs selective-area regrowth
   in the emitter region of the BET. Concepts and initial experimental
   results for these approaches are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In two reading level design experiments, matched groups of normal and
   poor readers were compared with regard to their use of phonological and
   orthographic information. Experiment I used a semantic decision task
   similar to the task described in the study of Jarvella and Snodgrass
   (1974). Experiment 1 was aimed to assess the way normal and poor
   readers, matched on reading level, automatically process phonological
   and orthographic incongruencies when comparing the singular and plural
   of nouns. Experiment 2 investigated the automatized processing of
   uppercase-lowercase letter incongruencies in a same-different task using
   words and pseudowords, It assessed the role of letter feature cues
   involved in the initial identification process. Experiment 1
   demonstrated that poor readers needed more time for evaluating
   phonologically incongruent word pairs. No independent effect of
   orthographic incongruency was found. Experiment 2 showed that, if
   compared with reading age matched normals, poor readers had more
   problems with evaluating uppercase-lowercase incongruencies. This
   orthographic processing problem was particularly prominent when
   pseudowords were presented. It is concluded that poor readers not only
   have phonological processing problems, but also have difficulties at the
   orthographic processing level.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of n-butane was studied between 523 K and 623 K over acidic
   mordenites with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios between 10 and 20. The main products
   were iso-butane, propane, and pentane. The selectivity to olefins,
   methane, ethane, C-6 paraffins, and aromatics was lower than 4 mol\%
   under all reaction conditions. Isomerization and disproportionation were
   identified to be the dominating reactions. At 523 K, both reactions are
   suggested to proceed via dimeric intermediates. Their relative
   contributions to the total conversion depend on temperature, partial
   pressure, and the concentration of the acid sites of the catalyst. The
   highest yield in iso-butane was achieved over a catalyst with a low
   density of acid sites and at low temperature. At higher temperatures,
   the rate of isomerization decreased in favor of disproportionation and
   cracking. A mechanistic model for the isomerization is proposed. (C)

   0.30 (structural type Cu-2(OH)(2)NO3, phase I) and for 0.50 < x < 0.65
   (structural type Zn-3(OH)(4)(NO3)(2), phase I'). In the interval 0.3 < x
   < 0.5 the structurally closely related phases I and I' coexist. For 0.65
   < x less than or equal to 1.0 a second two-phase region with I' and a
   third structure type Zn-5(OH)(8)(NO3)(2) . 2H(2)O (phase Pi-b) was
   observed. From the intensities of the X-ray reflections and the
   dependence of the lattice parameter b' on x it was deduced that only a
   small fraction of Cu2+ enters phase Pi-b. Using the structural data and
   the EPR spectra together with calculations within the angular overlap
   model (AOM) the observed EPR signals could be correlated with the
   occupation of the various Zn2+ sites by Cu2+ in the three phases. It was
   also possible to derive the changes of the Zn2+ host site geometries
   induced by substituting Cu2+ ions due to vibronic coupling. The nicely
   resolved EPR spectra at high x values originate from small amounts of
   Cu2+ in phase Pi-b. They display patterns of tetragonally elongated
   and-in the dynamical average-compressed Cu(OH)(6) octahedra at higher
   temperatures, which are assigned to the Zn(2) and Zn(1) sites,
   respectively. At 5 K the latter polyhedron freezes into a geometry with
   a strong orthorhombic distortion component due to vibronic Jahn-Teller
   coupling. The EPR spectra further indicate that the bulk of Cu2+ enters
   phases I and I'. Powder reflectance spectra at 5 K are in support of
   these conclusions. The bonding parameters of Cu2+ in phase Pi-b have
   been determined from the well-resolved hyperfine structure in the EPR
   spectra. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The authors discuss the origin of a unique footprint on the sea induced
   by storm winds and rainfall as seen by synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   from space. Two hypotheses are presented to explain the origin of an
   apparent wind shadow downwind of a storm cell. The first suggests that
   the cool air pool from the storm acts as an obstacle to divert the
   low-level easterly ambient winds and leaves a `'wind shadow'' on its
   downwind side. This theory is discarded because of the excessive storm
   lifetime needed to cause the long downstream `'shadow.'' The second
   hypothesis invokes the cool outflows from two preexisting storm cells
   such that their boundaries intersect obliquely leaving a triangular
   wedge of weaker winds and radar cross section (i.e., the shadow). A new
   precipitation cell is initiated at the point of intersection of the
   boundaries at the apex of the shadow, giving the illusion that this cell
   is the cause of the shadow. While the authors lack corroborative
   observations, this theory is consistent with prior evidence of the
   triggering of convective clouds and precipitation by intersecting cool
   air boundaries. The regular observation of such persistent cool air
   storm outflow boundaries both in satellite observations, and more
   recently in SAR imagery, suggests that such discontinuities are
   ubiquitous and serve to trigger new convection in the absence of
   large-scale forcing.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical and isotopic investigations indicate that the recharge source

   deuterium close to that of Nile water. Another minor source of recharge
   to the far west of the Nile bank is palaeowater. This water's chemical
   type is sodium sulphate and sodium chloride. The change of water quality
   in some groundwater samples could be due to the extensive use of
   fertilizers to improve soil characteristics in new reclamation projects.
   In addition, these wells are slightly depleted in oxygen-18, deuterium
   and tritium. Recommendations for the periodic monitoring of groundwater
   quality for proper use are given.}},

   Concentrations of cyanobacteria, which accounted for approximately
   15-50\% of the carbon biomass of phytoplankton in open water, decreased
   from the reef face towards the leeward reef flat. Concentrations of
   ciliates were consistently lower at the leeward reef hat than at the

   planktonic microbial communities were estimated to reach 253 gC d(-1)

Abstract = {{Background and Design: We used the amplification of junctional V
   (variable)-J (joining) sequences of the rearranged T-cell receptor gamma
   (TCR gamma) genes by polymerase chain reaction for rapid and sensitive
   detection of a clonal T-cell population in a total of 51 skin specimens
   obtained from 45 patients with mycosis fungoides, five patients with
   Sezary syndrome, and 29 patients with chronic inflammatory dermatoses.
   Results: A clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement was present in all tumors
   (3/3, 100\%) and in most infiltrated plaques (16/22, 73\%) and
   erythrodermas (10/12, 83\%). In the patch stage, a clonal subset was
   found in more than half of the cases (8/14, 57\%), whereas no clonality
   was observed in the controls. We also amplified the V-J sequences of the
   Igh locus coding for the heavy chain of immunoglobulins, without
   evidence of clonal rearrangement. These data were compared with those
   from in situ immunophenotypic analysis. Moreover, by using the same
   assay with successive dilutions of standard clonal T-cell DNA, a
   semiquantitative study of the T-cell clone was carried out in some
   cases. The highest ratios of clonal DNA were observed in advanced
   stages.
   Conclusions: These data validate polymerase chain reaction V gamma-J
   gamma as a rapid, sensitive tool that can be used in the routine
   analysis of clonality in cutaneous lesions of mycosis fungoides and in
   the early diagnosis of mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.
   Semiquantitative studies suggest that the malignant T-cell clone follows
   a selective process during the course of the progressive form of mycosis
   fungoides.}},

   valued, where assimilation is not a condition of citizenship and where
   aspirations are formed within consumerism, this tradition of

   paper demonstrates how persons, without formal medical and nursing

   occurred along the line of the fibers. There were no digital nerve
   injuries. The release was within 2 mm of a thumb digital nerve in seven
   hands and the little finger ulnar digital nerve in two. In the thumb,
   the close proximity of the digital nerves makes percutaneous trigger
   digit release potentially hazardous. With the little finger held in

Abstract = {{The study examined whether eight characteristics attributed to adult
   children of alcoholics (ACOAs) by Woititz (1983) were supported by
   personality measures. The Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST)
   and nine scales from the California Personality Inventory and the 16-PF
   were administered to 166 undergraduates. Forty-nine (29\%) of these
   subjects were identified as ACOAs. ACOAs' scores on the personality
   measures were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group. No
   differences were identified between ACOA men and control men. ACOA women
   were found to be more flexible, impulsive, and pessimistic, with a sense
   of less wellbeing than control women. A significant discriminant
   function correctly classified 77.6\% of the women subjects. This
   function indicated that easygoingness, independence, self-assurance, and
   self-directedness are associated with status as an ACOA for women.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA of a broad
   range of representative microsporidia including five species from humans
   (Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Nosema corneum, Septata intestinalis,
   Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi), reveals that human
   microsporidia are polyphyletic in origin. Septata intestinalis and E.
   hellem are very similar to the mammalian parasite E. cuniculi Based on
   the results of our phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that S.
   intestinalis be designated Encephalitozoon intestinalis. Furthermore,
   analysis of our data indicates that N. corneum is much more closely
   related to the insect parasite Endoreticulatus schubergi than it is to
   other Nosema species. This finding is supported by recent studies which
   have shown a similarity between E. schubergi and N. corneum based on the
   origin and development of the parasitophorous vacuole. Thus these
   opportunistic microsporidian parasites can originate from hosts closely
   or distantly related to humans. Finally, the phylogeny based on small
   subunit ribosomal DNA sequences is highly inconsistent with traditional
   classifications based on morphological characters. Many of the important
   morphological characters (diplokaryon, sporophorous vesicle, and
   meiosis) appear to have multiple origins.}},

   related to prompts that offered no control. Subsequently in Phase 2, we
   modified prompts within three different routines to provide greater
   control through choice. Within the context of an A-B-A-B design, the
   effects of a `'traditional'' no-choice versus choice task analysis were
   evaluated in each routine across three staff. The results demonstrated
   that when routines included opportunities for choice, task initiations
   were high, whereas protests, including severe aggression, were virtually
   eliminated. These results ave discussed in relation to their
   implications for participant control, individualizing choice
   opportunities, embedding choice in daily routines, and the prevention of

   using starch gel electrophoresis for 22 loci. The percentage of
   polymorphic loci observed per population varied from 4.5 to 63.6\%, with
   a mean of 28.7\%; observed heterozygosity levels varied from 0.002 to
   0.126, with an average of 0.052. Observed heterozygosity and
   polymorphism values fell within the range of values reported in previous
   studies of the genus, but observed heterozygosity in most cases was less
   than expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genetic variance was
   partitioned among species, populations and individuals using
   hierarchical G-statistics. For all of the populations considered
   together, the variance among species was 58.4\%, among populations
   within species 24.9\%, and among individuals within a population 16.7\%.
   When only the Neotropical species were considered, the percentages of
   the total variance attributable to variation among species, among
   populations within species, and among individuals were 18.1\%, 29.2\%
   and 52.7\%, respectively. For the African species, 27.8\% of the

   individuals. Intraspecific Roger's genetic distances ranged from 0.01 to
   0.38, and interspecific distances from 0.1 to 0.84. Nei's unbiased
   distances ranged from 0.00 to 0.44 within a nominal species, and from
   0.02 to 1.82 between species. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of
   Rogers' distances revealed a clear separation of African species from
   Neotropical species and of the Neotropical species from each other. The

Abstract = {{The most accurate method for assessing the dialysis dose delivered
   during high efficiency/flux hemodialysis has not been established. Most
   current indices of dialysis dose are based on blood-side urea
   measurements, and thus estimate urea removal. Unfortunately, these
   methods may lead to inappropriately short dialysis during high flux or
   high efficiency dialysis, perhaps because of inaccuracies in estimating
   the amount of urea removal. It is unknown whether these clearance-based
   approaches can accurately predict either absolute or fractional net urea
   removal, the latter being equivalent to the solute removal index (SRI).
   Therefore, we compared the urea removal calculated by five blood-side
   kinetic methods: (1) urea reduction ration, (2) 1-pool, (3) 2-pool
   models, and the (4) Smye and (5) Daugirdas formulae. These were compared
   with the gold standard measurement by direct dialysate quantification.
   Eight stable patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis were studied over
   four sessions each. BUN was measured at 0, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, end
   dialysis, one hour after dialysis (equilibrium value), and 48 hours
   later. Total body water was determined from the dialysate urea removal;
   the urea generation rate was calculated using one hour post-dialysis and
   48-hour BUN values. Both the total body water and urea generation rate
   were provided to the 1- and 2-pool models to optimize accuracy. The urea
   reduction ratio overestimated SRI. The 1-pool model overestimated both
   absolute urea removal and SRI in 28 of 32 sessions. The 2-pool model
   slightly underestimated both absolute urea removal and SRI. In contrast,
   the Smye and Daugirdas formulas accurately estimated SRI. We conclude
   that: (1) The 1-pool model consistently overestimates urea removal,
   which leads to inappropriately short dialysis times. (2) The 2-pool
   model, provided with an accurate TBW, slightly underestimates urea
   removal. (3) The Smye and Daugirdas methods accurately predict SRI and
   are sufficiently accurate to quantify dialysis dose and adequacy.
   Because the Smye and Daugirdas methods are operationally and
   mathematically simpler than 1- or 2-pool kinetic modeling, we propose
   that they be tested in a randomized controlled trial of dialysis
   adequacy during high efficiency or high flux hemodialysis.}},

   viruses, raspberry bushy dwarf (RBDV) and zucchini yellow mosaic (ZYMV).
   For both viruses, only limited sequence information was available at the
   time of primer design, but most of the isolates which were tested could
   be amplified (the one exception being a serologically quite distinct
   isolate of ZYMV). Restriction endonucleases revealing diagnostic RFLPs
   were readily identified. Each of two isolates of ZYMV could be detected
   in the presence of the other and the relative proportions approximately
   quantified by visual estimation of the relative intensity of the
   appropriate bands. A range of isolates of different RBDV pathotypes were
   compared; isolates were grouped in ways that accorded with their known
   history. Computer analysis of the published sequence from which the
   primers had been derived showed the sequenced isolate to be identical
   with an isolate imported from the USSR. The PCR/RFLP procedure is rapid

Abstract = {{The field of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation has
   been expanded recently as a treatment for solid tumors and hematological
   malignancies. Severe emesis remains one of the main extramedullary
   side-effects of high-dose regimens during the first week of treatment,
   Traditional antiemetics such as chlorpromazine, diazepam, and
   phenothiazines are extensively used but are unable to control emesis.
   The new antiemetic ondansetron, a serotonin receptor (5HT(3)) antagonist
   appears to be superior to these drugs for cisplatin-induced emesis. The
   study we present here is an attempt to control emesis following
   high-dose regimens, during bone marrow or peripheral stem cell
   transplantation, with ondansetron. To our knowledge no other paper has
   reported the efficacy of this antiemetic in such group of patients. A
   total of 29 patients who received highly emetogenic polychemotherapy as
   conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation were treated with
   ondansetron, which was given as an 8-mg i.v. short infusion prior the
   initiation of treatment and every 6h thereafter for 3 days, and an 8-mg
   dose every 8 h for 5 additional days. All the patients had previously
   been treated with chemotherapy and were evaluable for response and
   toxicity. Complete and major protection of vomiting on day 1 was
   achieved by 76\% of the patients, 58\% on day 2 and 52\% on day 3.
   Nausea was absent or mild in 79\% of patients on day 1, 45\% on day 2
   and 41\% on day 3. For the days 4-8 as a whole, complete and major
   protection against vomiting was achieved by 59\%-86\% of the patients,
   while 51\%-90\% of patients had no or mild nausea. The most frequent
   side-effects were headache (24\%) and constipation (17\%). On the basis
   of these results we conclude that ondasetron can be succesfully used as
   an effective antiemetic prophylaxis for patients who receive megatherapy
   and bone marrow rescue, and should allow the majority of these patients
   to receive their treatment without serious side-effects and discomfort.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra has considerable
   potential for increasing the understanding of these enigmatic sources. A
   diversity of ideas and analyses has been generated over the last two
   decades to explain line features and continuum shapes, encompassing both
   older galactic neutron star and `'new age'' cosmological source models.
   This paper reviews some of the highlights of these studies, discussing
   the merits and limitations of various ideas, and in particular their
   compatibility with the observational data. The first focus will be on
   continuum models for GRBs, which include optically thin synchrotron
   emission and resonant Compton upscattering near galactic neutron stars,
   while the synchrotron and non-magnetic inverse Compton scattering
   mechanisms are prominent in the less well-developed cosmological
   scenarios. Line formation scenarios will then be discussed, in
   particular the scattering model for producing cyclotron features, which
   remains the only viable explanation for the Ginga observations of double
   lines. Absorption-like line production in cosmological burst models is
   generally difficult, though interesting notions such as femtolensing
   interference patterns have been proffered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the results of research which examined the sorption
   characteristics of a forest soil profile for phosphorus (P) and the
   heavy metals arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and
   zinc (Zn). It is suggested that these sorption measurements may allow an
   estimate of metal and P loadings and subsequently sludge application
   rates which are environmentally acceptable, particularly in terms of
   minimal off-site movement. The extent of sorption of an element in a
   particular soil horizon was characterised by sorption curves which
   showed the relationship between the amount of element sorbed by the soil
   and the concentration of that element remaining in the supernatant
   solution after an equilibrating period. Buffer capacity, defined by the
   slope of the sorption curve, was calculated for each element in each
   soil horizon. Sorption behaviour of heavy metals and phosphorus varied
   greatly within the soil profile. Cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and copper
   (Cu) were retained mainly in the surface All horizon. This was indicated
   by their relatively higher buffer capacities in this horizon and may be
   due to their affinity for organic matter which was present in greatest
   concentrations in this part of the soil profile. On the other hand, the
   greatest sorption capacity for arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) occurred
   deep in the profile in the B2 horizon where there was a predominance of
   clay and iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) hydrous oxides. Metal and
   phosphorus sorption equations were used to estimate sludge-borne
   elemental loadings to soil at an `'allowable'' output elemental
   concentration of soil leachate to the environment. These loadings,
   together with soil bulk density and extractabilities of elements in the
   sludge, were incorporated in a `'first approximation'' model to estimate
   sludge application rates which were environmentally acceptable in terms
   of minimal off-site movement. These rates, along with other factors such
   as health risk and contamination aspects, should be taken into account
   when calculating ecologically sustainable sludge application rates at a
   particular disposal site.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of receptors for the novel neuropeptide pituitary adenylate
   cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been recently demonstrated in
   the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum, a germinative matrix
   that generates the majority of cerebellar interneurons. In the present
   study, we have taken advantage of the possibility of obtaining a culture
   preparation that is greatly enriched in immature cerebellar granule
   cells to investigate the effect of PACAP on the adenylyl cyclase and
   phospholipase C transduction pathways. The two molecular forms of PACAP,
   i.e., 27-(PACAP27) and 38-(PACAP38) amino-acid forms of PACAP, induced a
   dose-dependent stimulation of cyclic AMP production in granule cells,
   The potencies of PACAP27 and PACAP38 were similar (ED(50) = 0.12 +/-
   0.01 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 nM, respectively), whereas vasoactive intestinal
   polypeptide (VIP) was similar to 100 times less potent. PACAP27 and
   PACAP38 also induced a dose-dependent stimulation of
   polyphosphoinositide breakdown (ED(50) = 19.1 +/- 6.3 and 13.4 +/- 6.0
   nM, respectively), whereas VIP had no effect on polyphosphoinositide
   metabolism. The effect of PACAP38 on inositol phosphate formation was
   significantly reduced by U-73122 and by pertussis toxin, indicating that
   activation of PACAP receptors causes stimulation of a phospholipase C
   through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. In contrast, forskolin
   and dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not affect PACAP-induced stimulation of
   inositol phosphates. Taken together, the present results demonstrate
   that PACAP stimulates independently the adenylyl cyclase and the
   phospholipase C transduction pathways in immature cerebellar granule
   cells. These data favor the concept that PACAP may play important roles
   in the control of proliferation and/or differentiation of cerebellar
   neuroblasts.}},

   epithelial damage. Lung permeability was assessed by absorption into
   blood from the lung of inhaled technetium-99m diethylenetriamine

   Neutrophil migration into the airspaces therefore appeared to precede
   the increased lung permeability. Long-term exposure was not associated

   mortality were hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, albumin, total
   protein, gamma-globulins, and AaDo(2). LDH values, percentage of
   neutrophils in the BAL, as well as the cellular immunologic state as
   indicated by CD4-cell count were not significantly associated with the
   outcome. The discriminant function yielded the best classification
   results with the inclusion of hemoglobin, albumin, and gamma-globulins
   (overall accuracy 86\%). Two or more of the following parameters were
   associated with a 14-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality:
   hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl, albumin less than 3 g/dl, and
   gamma-globulins less than 1.2 g/dl, This prognostic rule was 80\%
   sensitive and 94\% specific with a negative predictive value of 94\%,
   yielding an overall accuracy of 91\%, Patients with HIV-associated PCP
   with a positive prognostic rule have a 14-fold increased risk for
   in-hospital lethal outcome, This discriminant rule may be helpful in
   identifying patients at risk.}},

Abstract = {{German and British health authorities have issued warnings drawing
   attention to American publications reporting unexpectedly high
   concentrations of carboxyhaemoglobin as high as 30\% and more in
   patients undergoing inhalation anaesthesia. American and our own studies
   indicate that these accidental carbon monoxide intoxications stem from a
   chemical reaction of the inhalation anaesthetic agents with carbon
   dioxide absorbants leading to the production of carbon monoxide. Such
   reaction occurs, in decreasing order of magnitude, for desflurane,
   enflurane and isoflurane, brit is only slight in the case of halothane
   and sevoflurane. The highest concentrations of carbon monoxide resulted
   when the inhalation agent reacted with absolutely dry absorbent When the
   latter was even only partially moist CO production decreased
   dramatically; absorbents with normal water content do not react with the
   anaesthetic agents to produce CO. Although there have been no reports of
   clinically relevant CO intoxication to date, care should nevertheless be
   taken to ensure adequate moistening of the absorbent and to avoid any
   measures likely to lend to its drying out.}},

   lymphocytes were cultured in media supplemented with species-specific
   sera, chimpanzee T cells were stimulated by lower doses of
   staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1
   (TSST1) than were human T cells, while chimpanzee responses to SEE and
   SEC1 were nearly equivalent to the human response. Interestingly, rhesus
   lymphocytes responded to 10,000 times lower amounts of SEA, SEE, and
   SEC1 and to 100 times lower concentrations of TSST1 than human cells.
   The greater sensitivity of rhesus T cells to these toxins was not a
   result of differences in class II binding affinities and was only partly
   attributable to the presence of anti-SE and TSST1 antibodies in human
   serum. These results suggest that rhesus T lymphocytes are more
   sensitive toward these bacterial superantigens than human T cells. (C)

Abstract = {{Antiarrhythmic Drugs and DFT. Introduction: Class III antiarrhythmics
   have been reported to lower defibrillation threshold (DFT); however, the
   mechanism(s) of this effect is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that
   DFT strength DC shocks may terminate reentrant arrhythmias through
   prolongation of action potential duration and refractory periods, Since
   Class III antiarrhythmic drugs prolong repolarization, we examined the
   hypothesis that these drugs enhance shock-induced action potential
   duration extension (APDE), which might contribute to lowering of DFT.
   Methods and Results: In order to investigate the specificity of drug
   effects on action potential repolarization following a shock, an optical
   enantiomer with mixed beta-blocking and class III effects (CK-4000) and
   its enantiomer with `'pure'' Class III antiarrhythmic effects (CK-4001)
   were compared against placebo in a canine defibrillation model (n = 8
   per group). At the 3 mg/kg dose, the enantiomers nonstereoselectively
   lowered DFT voltage by 19 +/- 15\% (CK-4000, P < 0.05 compared to
   placebo) and 25 +/- 12\% (CK-4001, P < 0.05 compared to placebo),
   indicating that Class III antiarrhythmic actions alone were sufficient
   for this effect. Similarly, CK-4000 and CK-4001 at 3 mg/kg enhanced APDE
   (P < 0.01 compared to placebo) by 20 +/- 11\% and 24 +/- 17\%,
   respectively. APDE prolongation significantly correlated with reduction
   in DFT voltage for both CK-4000 (r = -0.55, P < 0.03) and CK4001 (r =
   -0.63, P < 0.01). At 3 mg/kg, the enantiomers stereoselectively
   prolonged action potential duration (APD(75)) by an average of 37 +/-
   14\% (CK-4000, P < 0.001) and 23 +/- 14\% (CK-4001, P < 0.001), and
   ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) by 38 +/- 15\% (CK-4000,
   P < 0.01) and 27 +/- 13\% (CK4001, P < 0.05). Prolongations of APD(75)
   and VERP did not correlate with reductions of DFT in individual dogs.
   Conclusions: These results show that Class III antiarrhythmics and DFT
   strength shocks additively delay repolarization, which suggests that
   drug enhancement of APDE may contribute to their effects on DFT.}},

Abstract = {{DNA sequence polymorphism in the genes encoding HLA class II proteins
   accounts for allelic diversity in antigen recognition and presentation
   and, thus, in the role of these cell surface glycoproteins as
   determinants of the scope of the T-cell repertoire. In addition,
   sequence polymorphism in the promoter-proximal transcriptional
   regulatory regions of these genes has been described, particularly for
   the HLA-DQB1 locus, where these differences may contribute to variation
   in locus- and allele-specific expression. In this study, we measured the
   effect of such regulatory sequence polymorphism on the expression of
   endogenous alleles of DQB1 in heterozygous cells. Quantitative reverse
   transcriptase-mediated PCR analysis showed that expression of the
   DQB1{*}0301 allele responded more rapidly to gamma interferon induction
   than that of DQB1{*}0302. We have analyzed functional effects of a
   prominent allelic polymorphism that consists of a TG dinucleotide
   present between the W and X(1) consensus elements in the DQB1{*}0302
   allele but missing in the DQB1{*}0301 allele. The dominant effect of
   this polymorphism was to introduce a variation in the spacing between
   the W and X(1) elements of these two alleles, A secondary compensatory
   effect was specific for the TG dinucleotide itself, which was essential
   for the binding of a nuclear protein complex to the {*}0302 regulatory
   region immediately 5' of the X(1) element. Derivatives of the DQB1 5'
   regulatory region were used to drive expression of the chloramphenicol
   acetyltransferase gene in transient transfections of human
   B-lymphoblastoid and gamma interferon-treated melanoma cell lines,
   demonstrating that the additional spacing between the W and X(1)
   elements caused by the presence of the TG dinucleotide in the {*}0302
   allele resulted in reduced expression compared with that driven by the
   {*}0301 fragment; this difference overshadowed an up-regulating effect
   on expression which corresponded to the binding of the TG-dependent
   nuclear protein complex. The presence of this polymorphism in multiple
   HLA-DQB1 alleles and in several species suggests selection for two
   alternative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms influencing expression
   of alleles of the same HLA locus.}},

Abstract = {{Although not new, the dropout phenomenon has become a serious social
   problem. Since 1985-86, over 35 \% of students have left school without
   getting a high school diploma. Various programs have been developed in
   order to prevent this problem. Few of them, however, are based on the
   use of extracurricular activities, which strongly relate to factors of
   persistence in school such as self-esteem, perception of the school
   environment, motivation to study, class attendance, and school success.
   The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a prevention
   program designed for potential dropouts. Tested among a group of 5
   students of Secondary III, the preliminary program has proved to be
   feasible and efficient. Following its application, four of the five
   variables under investigation have shown positive changes, i.e.
   self-esteem, perception of the school environment, motivation and class
   attendance. School marks have also improved but for only 3 participants.
   The data suggest that this approach could work with the two major types
   of potential dropouts, provided that the activities are more
   diversified, over a longer period of time, and offered sooner in the
   learning path. Such a program could complement other measures like
   compensatory education or resolution of various psychological, social or
   family problems.}},

Abstract = {{PROBLEM: The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of
   peritoneal lymphocyte and macrophage populations in mild versus severe
   endometriosis.
   METHOD: Using dual staining, antigen expression on peritoneal leukocytes
   from 24 women with endometriosis and 21 control patients was analyzed by
   flow cytometry.
   RESULTS: All groups had CD4:CD8 ratios of 0.6, with subpopulations of
   CD8+ cells ex pressing cytotoxic marker S6F1. Mild and severe
   endometriosis patients had increased CD3/DR+ cells, relative to
   controls. Two populations of macrophages were identified by size in all
   groups, Mild endometriosis patients had increased percentages of small
   macrophages expressing CD14 and HLA DQ, compared to controls and severe
   disease patients. In severe disease patients, antigen expression on
   small macrophages did not differ from controls, but decreased
   percentages of large macrophages expressed CD14 relative to controls and
   mild disease patients.
   CONCLUSION: All women with endometriosis exhibit activated peritoneal
   lymphocytes, whereas macrophage expression of CD14 is differentially
   expressed as a function of disease stage. Alterations in the functional
   capacity of these cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of this
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Horses with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis were challenged with an
   oral dose of potassium chloride, and the prophylactic efficacy of
   phenytoin, acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated, with at
   least three weeks separating the trials of each drug. After the
   administration of potassium chloride without prophylactic medication the
   horses' clinical signs ranged from generalised fine muscle
   fasciculations to gross tremors, and weakness with occasional prolapse
   of the nictitating membrane; plasma potassium concentration increased
   significantly (P < 0.01) from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 6.0 +/- 1.01 mmol
   litre(-1). After treatment with acetazolamide the administration of
   potassium chloride resulted in a significant (P < 0.02) increase in
   plasma potassium from 3.7 +/- 0.3 to 4.5 +/- 0.4 mmol litre(-1) and two
   of five horses showed clinical signs unless the dosage was increased
   from 2.2 to 4.4 mg kg(-1) twice daily. Three of the four horses treated
   with hydrochlorothiazide showed clinical signs but their plasma
   potassium did not rise significantly (3.6 +/- 0.3 to 4.6 +/- 1.0 mmol
   litre(-1)). None of the five horses treated with phenytoin showed
   clinical signs despite a significant increase in plasma potassium from
   3.8 +/- 0.6 to 5.3 +/- 1.1 mmol litre(-1) (P < 0.05). In general the
   clinical signs were not correlated consistently with the plasma levels
   of potassium, and phenytoin appeared to prevent the clinical signs in
   spite of the hyperkalaemia.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has dealt with the local management of aquatic resources as
   an alternative to Hardin's (1968) `'tragedy of the commons.'' In
   communities with no formal management of resources, informal ownership
   of fishing spots or conflicts with outside competitors may determine the
   basis for future local management. In this study, I analyze the use of
   aquatic resources by five fishing communities on the Atlantic Forest
   coast of southeast Brazil: Buzios Island, Puruba, and Picinguaba in Sao
   Paulo State, and Jaguanum and Itacuruca Islands at Sepetiba Bay in Rio
   de Janeiro State. Informal ownership of fishing spots, used for set
   gillnet fishing, is regulated by kin ties at Buzios Island. The
   artisanal fishers of Sepetiba Bay, especially those from Jaguanum
   Island, have a conflict with Bay `'intruders,'' such as the shrimp and
   herring trawlers. Two coastal communities, Puruba and Picinguaba, have
   conflicts with fishing regulations from a State Park (Parque Estadual da
   Serra do Mar), created in 1977. The transformation of populated areas of
   the Atlantic Forest to Extractive Reserves might be a way to avoid
   conflicts with intruders and with governmental agencies, and to involve
   local populations in management. Kinship rules at Buzios Island and the
   territorial behavior of fishers at Sepetiba Bay may form a basis for
   local organization.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess whether an intervention in the
   education of the mother and the support person involves a change in
   health-related behavior and use of health facilities.
   STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in four
   cities or Latin America on pregnant women at risk. Half of them (n =
   1115) received a home intervention of four to six visits dealing with
   psychosocial support and education about health-related habits, alarm
   signs, hospital facilties, antismoking and antialcohol programs, and a
   reinforcement of adequate health services utilization for the pregnant
   woman and a support person. The control group (n = 1120) received
   routine prenatal care.
   RESULTS: The distribution of risk factors and demographic, obstetric,
   and psychologic characteristics at baseline was similar in both groups.
   Women in the intervention group showed a statistically significant
   better knowledge of seven of the nine alarm signs considered and of two
   of the three labor-onset signs required. No differences between groups
   were observed in improvement on diet, cigarette and alcohol consumption,
   maternal physicial strain, lactation at 40 days postpartum, and
   utilization of health facilities.
   CONCLUSIONS: An intervention of psychosocial support and health
   education during pregnancy failed to show any benefit on perinatal
   outcome, health-related behavior, or utilization of health facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 18) were bred artificially to the same
   bull and then slaughtered at times ranging from 190 to 270 d
   postconception to assess accretion of energy, protein, fat, and ash by
   the conceptus. Wet weights, dry weights, and concentrations of energy,
   CP, crude fat, and ash were obtained for the following: fetus, combined
   amniotic and allantoic fluids, fetal membranes, cotyledons, caruncles,
   and uterine tissues. Rates of accumulation of these components in the
   gravid uterus (sum of all uterine contents) and fetus were described by
   linear or quadratic equations. Estimated rates of accretion of energy in
   the gravid uterus (i.e., conceptus) increased from 567 kcal/d at 190 d
   of gestation to 821 kcal/d at 270 d of gestation; corresponding rates of
   accretion of CP were 62 and 117 g/d. These daily rates represent net
   energy and protein requirements for conceptus growth during late
   pregnancy in mature Holstein cows. Conversion of predicted net energy to
   metabolizable energy requirements for conceptus growth, using the
   accepted efficiency factor of.14, yielded estimates that were consistent
   with current NRC recommendations. Factorial estimation of absorbed
   protein requirements is hampered by lack of precise information on the
   efficiency with which absorbed AA are deposited in conceptus tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Successful bidirectional selection for discriminative olfactory learning
   is reported for drone honey bees (Apis mellifera). Learning performance
   was evaluated using a discrimination conditioning procedure that
   required drones to discriminate between an appetitively reinforced
   odorant and one that was followed by punishment, Selective breeding
   produced high - and low - learning-performance lines of worker progeny
   that diverged from performance of workers whose fathers were selected at
   random. Furthermore, we show that levels of sucrose-induced
   sensitization are not correlated to learning performance. These results
   corroborate earlier findings and further demonstrate the power of
   selection on a haploid (drone) genotype, In addition, this study now
   shows that the demonstrated differences in learning performance cannot
   be completely accounted for by alteration of sucrose-induced
   sensitization. Thus, using this technique, it may be possible to select
   for associative conditioning without a pleiotropic increase in
   sensitization, The honey bee will be ideally suited to these types of
   correlation analyses in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The immunocytochemical application of a monoclonal antibody (MAb)
   against the Arg-Arg region at the junction of the C-peptide and the
   insulin beta-chain of the human proinsulin molecule on rat pancreatic
   tissue resulted in positive immunogold labeling over the insulin- as
   well as the glucagon-secreting cells, In the insulin cells, the Golgi
   cisternae and the immature clathrin-coated granules were intensely
   labeled, and in the glucagon cells all the granules were labeled,
   Control experiments using the anti-proinsulin MAb adsorbed with
   proinsulin, insulin, and glucagon have confirmed the crossreactivity of
   this proinsulin antibody with glucagon, Furthermore, the anti-proinsulin
   MAb appears to crossreact not only with rat but also with human glucagon
   and with bovine and porcine insulin and glucagon, Examination of the
   amino acid sequences of proinsulin and proglucagon has shown that both
   molecules display this Arg-Arg dipeptide sequence, which could explain
   the labeling obtained on both cell types, In addition, other propeptides
   also display such a sequence and, indeed, positive cells were detected
   in rat pituitary, These results demonstrate that by immunocytochemistry
   this MAb, although providing very specific results, reveals non-related
   molecules, This is due to the fact that these molecules exhibit similar
   short determinants. MAbs raised against very short amino acid sequences
   can reveal this determinant in various molecules, generating
   false-positive results.}},

Abstract = {{Previously employed non-selective protein kinase inhibitors yielded
   inconclusive results regarding involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in
   phosphorylation of 47 kDa protein (p47 phox) in intact neutrophils
   stimulated with physiologic agonists of superoxide generation. In the
   present study, phosphorylation of p47 phox in formylMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP)
   stimulated neutrophils was potently inhibited in the presence of 0.3 mu
   M RO 31-8220, a selective inhibitor of PKC. These results provide
   experimental evidence in support of the currently considered essential
   involvement of PKC in p47 phox phosphorylation in response to
   physiologic stimulation of neutrophil surface receptors. The
   fMLP-induced phosphorylation of p47 phox was enhanced and prolonged by
   calyculin A, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases of types 1 and
   2A, and such enhanced phosphorylation was also effectively inhibited by
   RO 31-8220. Our results suggest that the extent and duration of p47 phox
   phosphorylation in intact fMLP-stimulated neutrophils is probably
   controlled by a balance between the activities of PKC, on the one hand,
   and of protein phosphatase(s) of type(s) 1 and/or 2A, on the other.
   Effects of RO 31-8220 and of calyculin A on the fMLP-induced p47 phox
   phosphorylation were paralleled by similar effects on superoxide
   release. Calyculin A and RO 31-8220 were also used to study signal
   transduction by a post-receptor agonist of superoxide generation, a
   calcium ionophore A23187. The results of the latter study indicated that
   PKC was activated in A23187-stimulated neutrophils and was essentially
   involved in superoxide generation and p47 phox phosphorylation. Further,
   these results suggested that protein phosphatase(s) of type(s) 1 and/or

Abstract = {{In most supersymmetric models the stability of the proton is ensured by
   invoking R parity. A necessary ingredient to enforce R parity is the
   possibility of distinguishing the lepton superfields from the Higgs
   ones. This is generally achieved either by assuming different charges
   under some matter parity, or by assigning the superfields to different
   representations of a unified gauge group. We want to put forward the
   idea that the replica of the fermion generations, which constitute an
   intrinsic difference between the fermions and the Higgs superfields, can
   give a clue to understanding R parity as an accidental symmetry. More
   ambitiously, we suggest a possible relation between proton stability and
   the actual number of fermion generations. We carry out our investigation
   in the framework of non-Abelian horizontal gauge symmetries. We identify
   SU(4)(H) as the only acceptable horizontal gauge group which can
   naturally ensure the absence of R-parity-violating operators, without
   conflicting with other theoretical and phenomenological constraints. We
   analyze a version of the supersymmetric standard model equipped with a
   gauged horizontal SU(4)(H), in which R parity is accidental. The model
   predicts four families of fermions, it allows for the dynamical
   generation of a realistic hierarchy of fermion masses without any ad hoc
   choice of small Yukawa couplings; it ensures in a natural way the
   heaviness of all the fourth family fermions (including the neutrino),
   and it predicts a lower Limit for the tau-neutrino mass of a few eV. The
   scale of the breaking of the horizontal symmetry can be constrained
   rather precisely in a narrow window around similar to 10(11) GeV. Some
   interesting astrophysical and cosmological implications of the model are
   addressed as well.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the indications for use of surgical gastrostomy
   (SG) and surgical jejunostomy (SJ) as feeding tubes, the complications,
   and the trends in the use of SG and SJ after the introduction of
   percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) at our institution in 1981.
   Design: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of
   residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who received surgically placed
   feeding tubes between 1976 and 1989.
   Material and Methods: The medical records of all Olmsted County
   residents with surgical placement of a feeding tube during the
   designated study period were reviewed, and underlying conditions,
   complications, and survival mere analyzed.
   Results: Of 77 adult patients (mean age, 66 years; 48\% women), 54
   underwent SG and 23 had SJ. General anesthesia was used in 42 patients
   (55\%). The indications for SG or SJ were stroke in 23 patients, cancer
   in 19, other central nervous system-related conditions in 16, and other
   conditions in 19. Among the numerous comorbid conditions, pulmonary
   disease (N = 44) and cardiac disease (N = 32) were most frequent. The
   median duration of follow-up was 181 days. Complications occurred in 31
   of 54 patients (57\%) with SG and in 13 of 23 (57\%) with SJ. Of the 117
   complications, 15\% were considered major. Twenty patients (26\%)
   resumed eating. Survival at 1, 6, and 12 months was 79\%, 49\%, and
   36\%, respectively. Most deaths were due to the disease for which the
   feeding tube had been placed. In a Cox proportional hazards regression
   analysis, only age and hypoxemia mere found to be significantly
   associated with survival. Hypoxemia, type of tube, central nervous
   system disease as indication for procedure, and previous aspiration mere
   associated with failure to resume eating (P<0.05). Survival was similar
   to that for our patients with PEG during the same period. The overall
   incidence of feeding tube placement increased throughout the study
   period.
   Conclusion: Patients who require enteral feeding tubes have multiple
   comorbid conditions that have a major influence on the outcome. The
   overall incidence of feeding tube placement increased after the
   introduction of PEG. In patients who require longterm enteral nutrition
   and are unable to have a feeding tube,placed percutaneously, surgically
   placed feeding tubes have outcomes similar to those reported for
   patients with PEG.}},

Abstract = {{The Ionospheric Focused Heating rocket was launched on May 30, 1992. The
   sounding rocket carried an instrument and chemical payload along a
   trajectory that crossed the intersection of the beams from the 430-MHz
   incoherent scatter radar and the 5.1-MHz high-power radio wave facility
   near Arecibo. The release of 30 kg of CF3Br into the F region at 285 km
   altitude produced an ionospheric hole that acted like a convergent lens
   to focus the HF transmissions. The power density inside the radio beam
   was raised by 12 dB immediately after the release. A wide range of new
   processes were recorded by in situ and ground-based instruments.
   Measurements by instruments flying through the modified ionosphere show
   small-scale microcavities (<1 m) and downshifted electron plasma
   (Langmuir) waves inside the artificial cavity, electron density spikes
   at the edge of the cavity, and Langmuir waves coincident with ion
   gyroradius (4 m) cavities near the radio wave reflection altitude. The
   Arecibo incoherent scatter radar showed 20 dB or greater enhancements in
   ion acoustic and Langmuir wave turbulence after the 5.1-MHz radio beam
   was focused by the artificial lens. Enhancements in airglow from
   chemical reactions and, possibly, electron acceleration were recorded
   with optical instruments. The Ionospheric Focused Heating experiment
   verified some of the preflight predictions and demonstrated the value of
   active experiments that combine high-power radio waves with chemical
   releases.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of bullet caliber becomes increasingly important in
   homicides where the bullet is missing. In cases with entrance wounds to
   bone that are circular and well defined it may be tempting to measure
   the defect and offer suggestions about bullet caliber. For this reason,
   the relationship between wound diameter and bullet caliber was examined
   using cranial bones from autopsy cases. The minimum diameter of 35
   cranial wounds produced by .22, .25, and .38-caliber bullet was
   measured. The relationship of minimum wound diameter to bullet caliber
   was examined using a one way analysis of variance. Fisher's least
   significant difference test revealed no significant difference between
   .22-caliber and .25 caliber wounds, while the .38-calber wounds were
   significantly different (P < .001) from .22-caliber and .25-caliber
   wounds. Variation in wound size resulting from such factors as bullet
   shape, surface treatment, strength characteristics, loss of gyroscopic
   stability, intermediate targets, tangential impacts, and existing
   fractures are discussed. Also, the large variety of calibers available
   are noted as complicating the prediction of caliber from wound size. In
   view of these factors caution is recommended in any attempt to determine
   precise bullet caliber from the minimum dimensions of the cranial
   gunshot entrance wound.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Little is known of the physiological mechanisms that
   control cellular renewal in the pancreatic excretory duct system. This
   study investigated the effects of potential regulatory substances on the
   growth of cultured guinea pig pancreatic duct epithelial monolayers.
   Methods: Pancreatic duct explants were cultured for 3 days on plastic
   and on permeable filters in the presence and absence of different
   substances. Growth of epithelial monolayers from these explants was
   measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and morphometric
   procedures. Results: Epidermal growth factor and insulin both enhanced
   monolayer growth and together had an additive effect. Transforming
   growth factor alpha enhanced and transforming growth factor beta
   inhibited growth, whereas glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic
   polypeptide, secretin, cerulein, bombesin, and dexamethasone had no
   significant effects. Monolayer growth on type I collagen-coated filters
   was enhanced when compared with that of monolayers grown on tissue
   culture plastic. Cell growth from explants on filters coated with type
   IV collagen and fibronectin was comparable with that on plastic, whereas
   growth on Matrigel- or laminin-coated filters was reduced. Conclusions:
   insulin, transforming growth factors, and substrate components modulate
   growth of pancreatic duct epithelial cells in vitro, suggesting that
   they are important regulators of cell division in the excretory duct
   system of the intact pancreas.}},

Journal = {{ACTA METALLURGICA ET MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3247-3260}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of creep transients associated with stress change tests is
   reviewed, with an emphasis on using the results of these experiments to
   characterize the kinetics of deformation under conditions of nominally
   constant structure. In order to develop a common framework for the
   description of results obtained by various authors, operational
   definitions of the characteristic strain rates observed after stress
   changes are adopted.
   The data for aluminum reported by numerous investigators provide a
   consistent picture over a broad range of temperatures and initial creep
   stresses. These results show that transient creep after stress
   reductions occurs by two parallel processes of dislocation glide within
   subgrain interiors and dynamic recovery associated with subgrain
   boundary migration. Following relatively large stress reductions, the
   creep transient is dominated by the subgrain boundary migration
   processes. After relatively small changes in stress, thermally activated
   motion of dislocations within subgrain interiors is the predominant
   mechanism of deformation. In this regime, the creep transients can be
   described by a thermally activated rate law, thereby enabling various
   activation parameters to be evaluated from the data. In particular, the
   true activation areas are found to be equal to the dislocation spacing
   within subgrain interiors, hence are consistent with thermally activated
   cutting of forest dislocations. Limited results for other f.c.c. metals
   and related materials are shown to follow the trends established for
   aluminum. In particular, it is demonstrated that the data for pure
   copper and LiF at high temperatures and after small stress changes are
   also consistent with a description based on thermally activated glide.
   However, the true activation areas in copper are about five times
   greater than the dislocation spacing. This difference between copper and
   aluminum is attributed to the fact that the former has a substantially
   lower stacking fault energy. It is argued that the resulting wider
   separation of partials makes the thermally activated cutting of forest
   dislocations more difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we identified a soluble protein from Hyoscyamos moticus that
   was photolabeled by 5-azido-indole-3-acetic acid. This protein was
   determined to be a glutathione S-transferase (CST; J. Bilang, H.
   Macdonald, P.J. King, and A. Sturm {[}1993] Plant Physiol 102: 29-34).
   We have examined the effect of auxin on the activity of this H. muticus
   CST. Auxins reduced enzyme activity only at high concentrations, with
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic
   acid being more effective than indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and
   naphthylacetic acid. IAA was a noncompetitive inhibitor, whereas
   inhibition by 2,4-D was competitive with respect to
   1-chloro-2,4-dinitro-benzene. We also present the sequence of a
   full-length cDNA clone that codes for a CST and contains all partial
   amino acid sequences of the purified protein. The auxin-binding CST was
   found in high amounts in roots and stems and low amounts in leaves and
   flower buds. The steady-state mRNA level was not regulated by IAA or
   naphthylacetic acid, whereas 2,4-D and 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
   increased mRNA levels. We propose a model in which 2,4-D is a substrate
   for CST, whereas IAA binds at a second site, known as a ligandin-binding
   site for the purpose of intracellular transport.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a tandem automated guided vehicle (AGV) system is
   compared with thar of conventional AGV track systems. in the tandem
   system the track is divided into non-overlapping, single-vehicle closed

   delivery across loops, the tandem system has a higher expected travel
   time per load and thus a greater average time in system. When the loads
   are delivered within the original loop only, the tandem system has a
   lower average time in system than in conventional systems, although the
   difference is modest. Track layout appears to influence the average time
   in system much more than does the dispatching rule invoked. The success
   of the tandem system is highly dependent on approximately even AGV
   utilization, which may be difficult to obtain in practice.}},

Abstract = {{1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP)-induced toxicity was studied in rat
   germ cells from different stages of spermatogenesis, separated by
   centrifugal elutriation, and in Sertoli cells prepared from sexually
   mature and immature animals, The in vitro metabolic activation of 50 to
   250 mu M DBCP, measured as covalent binding of C-14-DBCP to
   macromolecules, was highest in round spermatids, lowest in Sertoli cells
   and elongating/elongated spermatids, and intermediate in spermatocytes.
   High concentrations of DBCP (greater than or equal to 250 mu M) caused a
   decrease in oxygen consumption and mitochondrial rhodamine 123 uptake,
   indicating an effect on mitochondrial function, Altered Sertoli cell
   function, measured as detachment of germ cells in Sertoli-germ cell
   cocultures, was evident at DBCP concentrations greater than or equal to
   300 mu M. DBCP-induced DNA damage occurred at much lower concentrations
   (10 to 30 mu M) when compared to effects on mitochondrial function and
   Sertoli cell function, The extent of single strand DNA breaks and
   alkali-labile sites (ssDNA breaks) measured by the alkaline filter
   elution technique and the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, were
   greatest in the round spermatids > spermatocytes = Sertoli cells >
   elongating/elongated spermatids, The study demonstrates that various
   testicular cell types show differences in their rates of activation of
   DBCP to metabolites that bind to macromolecules, DNA is a more sensitive
   intracellular target in DBCP-induced testicular toxicity than
   mitochondria, Round spermatids appear to be more susceptible to
   DBCP-induced ssDNA breaks than spermatocytes, elongating/elongated
   spermatids, or Sertoli cells.}},

Abstract = {{The field of distributed systems is now entering a stage of maturity
   with work focusing on standards for Open Distributed Processing (ODP).
   However, it is still important that standardization remains responsive
   to new technological demands such as the emergence of distributed

   multimedia computing on formal description within ODP. In particular, a
   framework is proposed for the formal specification and verification of
   quality of service and more general real-time concerns in distributed
   multimedia systems. This framework exhibits a separation of concerns
   between the specification of behaviour and requirements and also between
   the specification of abstract behaviour and real-time concerns. The
   usefulness of this framework is demonstrated by the development of an
   approach based on LOTOS together with a real-time temporal logic, QTL.}},

Abstract = {{Not infrequently, blood pressure measurement by the standard
   auscultatory technique yields a normal systolic pressure with an
   elevated diastolic pressure. The relatively narrow pulse pressure of
   such a measurement raises concern about the accuracy of the blood
   pressure measurement. The purpose of this study was to assess the
   accuracy of auscultatory blood pressure measurements in patients with an
   uncommonly narrow pulse pressure, particularly patients with an elevated
   diastolic but normal systolic pressure, Auscultatory blood pressure
   measurements were compared with an objective noninvasive standard,
   called K2 analysis, which has been shown to be more accurate than the
   auscultatory technique. Blood pressure was measured simultaneously by
   auscultatory and K2 techniques in 175 subjects. Comparisons were
   performed (1) in the group as a whole, (2) in four clinical subgroups
   (normotensive {[}<140/<90 mm Hg, n=69], hypertensive {[}greater than or
   equal to 140/greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, n=53], isolated systolic
   hypertensive {[}greater than or equal to 140/<90 mm Hg, n=38], and
   isolated diastolic hypertensive {[}<140/greater than or equal to 90 mm
   Hg, n=15]), and (3) in two subgroups whose ratio of pulse pressure to
   diastolic hypertensive group and in the group with a pulse pressure
   ratio less than 0.45 were considered to have a narrow pulse pressure. In
   the group as a whole, consistent with previous auscultatory-K2
   comparisons, systolic pressure was slightly higher and diastolic
   pressure slightly lower when measured by K2 versus the auscultatory
   technique (auscultatory, 145/85 mm Hg; K2, 147/83 mm Hg). For diastolic
   pressure auscultatory measurements averaged 7 mm Ng greater than K2 in
   the isolated diastolic hypertensive group (94+/-4 versus 87+/-5 mm Hg)
   but were less than 3 mm Hg (greater) in the other three groups
   (P<.0004). For systolic pressure, differences were less than 3 mm Hg in
   all four clinical groups. Auscultatory-K2 differences of diastolic
   pressure exceeding 5 mm Hg (and 10 mm Hg) were seen in 73.3\% (and
   40.0\%) of isolated diastolic ic hypertensive subjects versus only
   14.5\% (2.9\%) of normotensive subjects, 22.6\% (1.9\%) of hypertensive
   subjects, and 7.9\% (2.6\%) of isolated systolic hypertensive subjects
   (P<.0001). Similarly, the auscultated diastolic pressure exceeded the K2
   measurement by at least 5 mm Hg (and 10 mm Hg) in 62.5\% (29.2\%) of
   subjects with a pulse pressure ratio less than 0.45 versus 13.9\%
   (2.0\%) in subjects with a ratio greater than or equal to 0.45
   (P<.0001). Auscultatory-K2 differences of diastolic pressure were
   strongly and inversely related to the pulse pressure ratio (r=-.68,
   P<.0001) independent of sex, race, or body weight. In conclusion, when
   the pulse pressure is particularly narrow, auscultation frequently
   overestimates the true diastolic pressure by 5 mm Hg or more. The
   treatment implications of this finding, particularly in patients with
   elevated diastolic but normal systolic pressure, merit further study.}},

Abstract = {{The energy separation of several MHz between the nuclear spin substates
   of rare-earth ions in solids considerably exceeds the homogeneous width

   High-resolution laser experiments like coherent Raman scattering or hole
   burning experiments, however, can easily resolve optical transitions
   between individual nuclear spin states. Here, we discuss the calculation
   and experimental verification of the relative oscillator strengths for
   all possible transitions between the nuclear spin substates of the
   H-3(4) ground state and D-1(2) excited state of Pr3+:YAlO3. The
   oscillator strengths depend on the relative orientation of the
   quantization axes of the eigenstates in the ground and excited state. We
   determine the tensor orientation from the orientation dependence of the
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, using Raman heterodyne
   detection and we use spectral hole burning to assign the orientations to
   the two nonequivalent lattice sites of the Pr3+ ions in the host
   lattice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extension of a finite element formulation based
   on a weak form of the necessary conditions to solve optimal control
   problems. First, a general formulation for handling internal boundary
   conditions and discontinuities in the state equations is presented.
   Then, the general formulation Is modified for optimal control problems
   subject to state-variable inequality constraints. Solutions with touch
   points and solutions with state-constrained arcs are considered, After
   the formulations are developed, suitable shape and test functions are
   chosen for a finite element discretization, It is shown that all element
   quadrature (equivalent to one-point Gaussian quadrature over each
   element) may be done in closed form, yielding a set of algebraic
   equations. To demonstrate and analyze the accuracy of the finite element
   method, a simple state-constrained problem is solved, Then, for a more
   practical application of the use of this method, a launch vehicle ascent
   problem subject to a dynamic pressure constraint is solved. The paper
   also demonstrates that the finite element results can be used to
   determine switching structures and initial guesses for a shooting code.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ab in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases have
   been used to identify, characterize, and purify many autoantigens.
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum from a patient (Gel with Sjogren's syndrome
   was used to identify cDNA clones encoding novel autoantigens. This
   patient's serum was chosen for study because it contained antinuclear Ab
   that were different from those frequently detected in patients with
   autoimmune diseases.
   RESULTS: Ge serum identified a cDNA clone encoding part of protein
   Ki-67, a cell proliferation-associated protein. The Ki-67 protein
   (pKi-67) was not previously known to be a target of autoantibodies. To
   investigate the association between Ab directed against pKi-67 and
   autoimmune diseases, sera from autoimmune mice were tested for
   reactivity with a recombinant fragment of pKi-67. Ab were detected in
   serum from MRL/MpJ-+/+ and MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice but not in serum from
   other autoimmune mice or control animals.
   CONCLUSIONS: Protein Ki-67 joins the proliferating cell nuclear Ag
   (PCNA) as an example of a cell proliferation-associated protein that is
   a target of autoantibodies. The presence of anti-pKi-67 Ab in MRL mice,
   but not other autoimmune mice, suggests that anti-pKi-67 Ab may be
   specific markers for the systemic lupus erythematosus-like illness that
   develops in these animals. Further characterization of the immune
   response directed against this Ag may provide clues to the etiology and
   pathogenesis of autoimmune disease in these animals.}},

   framework. Seventy-nine low-income pregnant adolescents enrolled in the
   study in their first trimester. Follow-up data were collected in the
   second and third trimesters (n=64 and 54, respectively) and after
   delivery (n=47). Multivariate analysis, using profile analysis,
   indicated that maternal attachment in adolescent begins in pregnancy and
   increases over time. especially after quickening. Age-related
   differences were noted in the development of maternal-fetal attachment
   behaviors related to giving of self. Results showed a positive
   relationship between attachment in the third trimester and demonstration
   of affectionate behaviors toward the infant after birth. These finding
   are consistent with theoretical framework.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to carry out a study of isolated, unexplained myelopathy which
   avoided as far as possible selection and referral bias. We used a
   prospective design with case ascertainment from both neurological and
   neurosurgical referrals. We wanted to establish the sensitivity,
   predictive value and possible redundancy of currently available tests as
   assessed by the proportion of such patients who finally developed
   clinically definite multiple sclerosis at follow up. Although MRI
   scanning of the spinal cord is now the investigation of choice for
   myelopathy, the case ascertainment for the present studies was
   completed, and follow-up commenced, before MRI became available to
   patients in our catchment region. We believe that this was an important
   factor in the ascertainment of a representative sample of undiagnosed
   myelopathies, Of 2104 patients having myelography in a 36-month period,
   473 had signs of a myelopathy without lower motor neurone involvement.
   Sixty-nine of these 473 patients (15\%, 95\% CI 11.8-18.2) eventually
   satisfied the entry criteria for the prospective trial. Fourteen of the
   69 patients (20\%) presented with acute or subacute cord syndromes,
   while 55 (80\%) had chronic symptoms of more than 3 months duration.
   Approximately two-thirds of the chronic cases were progressive and
   one-third relapsing and remitting. Overall there was a female
   predominance (3 : 2) and a significant excess of HLA-DR2 antigen
   compared with a healthy control population (p < 0.0001). In this series
   the patients with chronic unexplained myelopathy were younger and had
   shorter symptom durations (mean 46.5 months) and less disability (mean
   EDSS 3.0) than cases in other comparable published series. The
   neurological findings, sex distribution and HLA characteristics were
   similar to those found in patients with clinically definite MS.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the porphyrinogenicity of propofol in a rat model. After a
   pilot study had been conducted to determine an optimal dose, 48 fasting
   male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated randomly to six groups. The
   animals in groups 1-3 received saline i,p. In groups 4-6, the animals
   were given allylisopropylacetamide (AIA). Twelve hours later, animals in
   groups 1 and 4 received saline, groups 2 and 5 were given propofol 150
   mg kg(-1) i.p., followed by 75 mg kg(-1) 3 h later, and groups 3 and 6
   received phenobarbitone 50 mg kg(-1) i.p. and 25 mg kg(-1) i.p. The
   animals were anaesthetized and killed 3 h after the second drug bolus
   and we measured the concentration of cytochrome P450, total porphyrin
   content and the activity of delta- aminolaevulinic acid synthase (ALAS)
   in the liver. Urinary delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and
   porphobilinogen (PBG) concentrations were measured. Analysis of variance
   and the t test with Bonferroni's correction were used to compare data.
   The hepatic cytochrome P450 concentration in the non-primed groups
   varied from 28.1 to 31.1 nmol g(-1); administration of AIA decreased
   this to 20.1-20.9 nmol g(-1), Total hepatic porphyrins were between 0.78
   and 1.22 nmol g(-1) in the non-primed groups and between 2.71 and 3.54
   nmol g(-1) in the AIA-primed groups. Hepatic ALAS activity was 29.2 and
   35.5 nmol h(-1) g(-1) in groups 1 and 2. In the primed saline group,
   ALAS activity was measured at 134.5 nmol h(-1) g(-1). There was a
   tendency towards an increase in activity in the primed propofol group
   (169.7 nmol h(-1) g(-1)) when this was compared with the primed saline
   group. The highest values were obtained in the primed phenobarbitone
   group (262.5 nmol h(-1) g(-1)). Corresponding results were obtained for
   measurements of urinary ALA and PBG. We conclude that propofol is a safe
   agent in the porphyric patient when given as a single bolus dose.
   Caution may be necessary, however, when large cumulative doses are
   administered.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sequential fraction collection of peptides and glycopeptides by
   high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) under applied voltage
   has been demonstrated from complex tryptic peptide maps. The collection
   methodology was adapted from a high-resolution glycopeptide mapping
   procedure and, as such, requires active temperature control of the
   sample, electrophoresis vials, and collections vials because the
   electrophoresis buffer system is highly conductive. Resolution was
   compromised in the preparative HPCE separation due to heavy sample
   loading and to reduced voltage. The latter was a requirement for this
   buffer system in order to control Joule heating at the current levels
   employed; collections were routinely performed at approximately 1.5 W/m.
   The collection buffer was optimized by the addition of 12\% methanol
   (v/v), thereby improving collection yields. Tryptic non-glycopeptides
   were group collected; secondary analysis of the HPCE collections agreed
   with analytical separations with respect to the number of peptides
   contained in a given fraction. Sequentially collected peptide fractions
   were analyzed by Edman sequencing and MALDI mass spectrometry to verify
   peptide identity and sequence, Consistent peptide sequence or mass
   measurements were obtained for repeat collections. The isolation of the
   single pure glycopeptide indicates that unique glycopeptide structures
   can be collected by HPCE and then analyzed by other methods. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{In this retrospective study a follow-up of 50 patients, 35 males and 15
   females, aged between 27 and 82 years, with hairy cell leukemia is
   described. Their survival ranged between 1 and 14 years. The symptoms
   were not specific in most of them. Splenomegaly was present in all but
   eight patients. Pancytopenia of various degree and the appearance of
   hairy cells were the main laboratory findings. Neutropenia was present
   in 38 patients (66\%) and monocytopenia in all of them. Using monoclonal
   antibodies, in six cases' B-lymphocyte origin of the hairy cells in the
   peripheral blood was revealed. The bone. marrow biopsy revealed in most
   of the cases diffuse involvement. Hypergammaglobulinemia was present in
   20 patients (in five of them monoclonal paraprotein was also detected);
   monoclonal paraprotein could also be detected. The levels of beta
   2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) and soluble receptors of interleukin-2 (IL2R)
   represented significant prognostic factors. Treatment for these patients
   was splenectomy, interferon alpha-2b (INF) and chlorambucil. Therapy
   with INF turned out to be the most effective. Patients who underwent
   splenectomy had also a relatively good prognosis. Chlorambucil was of
   limited value in the treatment of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-two forensic diplomates and 22 general clinical psychologists
   were asked to review a variety of psychological data from one of four
   cases (two cases of malingering and two cases of legal insanity) to
   determine whether data suggested malingering or insanity. Of the 44
   psychologists who reviewed cases, determined whether their protocol
   malingerer or an insane person. Forensic diplomates and clinical
   psychologists were equally accurate in their determinations; only three
   subjects hom each group misidentified their case. In spite of their
   success, confidence levels for both groups were reported as moderate.
   These results contradict previous studies that have found psychologists
   to not only be poor detectors of malingering, but also overconfident in
   their ability to detect it. It is believed that the success of
   psychologists in this study compared to previous studies was due to
   improved methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies revealed short-term cyclic variations (microcycles) in
   total organic carbon (TOC) and the hydrogen index (HI)in the Kimmeridge
   Clay Formation, Bn organic-rich deposit considered to be a lateral
   equivalent of the main source rocks of the North Sea. In addition, three
   different types of organic matter that all appear to be amorphous when
   observed by light microscopy (AOM) were recognized. Together, these AOM
   types account for over 80\% of total kerogen and their relative
   abundances show large variations along each microcycle. In the present
   work, transmission electron microscopy(TEM) observations were carried
   out on samples (whole kerogens, kerogen subfractions only comprising a
   single type of AOM, selected rock fragments) corresponding to typical
   points within a microcycle and obtained via high resolution sampling.
   The nature and the relative abundances of the products generated by
   Curie-point Py-GC-MS and off-line pyrolyses of isolated kerogens were
   also determined for two selected samples corresponding to the beginning
   and the top of the microcycle. Combination of such ultrastructural
   observations, including some semiquantitative studies, and the analysis
   of pyrolysis products allowed (1) determination of the ultrastructural
   features of the three AOM types thus providing what we believe to be the
   first example of correlations between light microscopy (palynofacies, in
   situ maceral analysis) and TEM observations on `'amorphous'' fossil
   materials; (2) identification of the source organisms and elucidation of
   the mode of formation of the different AOM types in the Kimmeridge Clay;
   (3) explanation of the variations in their relative abundances taking
   place along a microcycle and establishment of tight correlations with
   TOC and HI changes; and (4) explanation of the origin of the microcyclic
   variations in kerogen quantity (TOC) and quality (HI) occurring in the
   Kimmeridge Clay Formation. Interrelationships between primary
   productivity, sulphate reduction intensity, and lipid `'vulcanization''
   likely played a major role in the control of such variations.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied a group of midline cells in the embryonic brain of the
   grasshopper by using immunocytochemical and intracellular dye injection
   techniques. This cluster of midline cells differentiates between the
   pars intercerebralis lobes of the protocerebrum during early
   embryogenesis, and is composed of putative midline progenitors as well
   as neuronal and glial cells. Annulin immunoreactive glial processes
   surround the borders of the midline cell cluster and also form a network
   of processes extending from there to the borders of proliferative
   clusters in the brain hemispheres. Among the cells that derive from the
   midline cluster are two bilaterally symmetrical pairs of identified
   primary commissure pioneer neurons. By navigating along the glial-bound
   borders of the midline proliferative cluster, the axons of these
   pioneers establish an initial axonal bridge across the brain midline.
   This analysis identifies a glial-bound midline proliferative cluster in
   the brain and shows that neuronal and glial cells of this cluster are
   closely associated with neurons pioneering the primary brain commissure.
   Comparable features of midline cells in the ventral ganglia and
   similarities to other proliferative clusters in the brain hemispheres
   are discussed.}},

   Most think that spirit is an adequate replacement. Both terms refer to
   the inner or subjective person, which is not annihilated when the body
   dies. Two definitions of soul emerge: (a) the whole person (with the
   implication that the body is part of the soul), or (b) the inner or
   subjective person in the natural state (whether saved or unsaved). There
   is a holistic slant to biblical anthropology; a blurring of boundaries
   between body, soul, and spirit prior to death. Many theologians say they
   have not thought about the soul, and that theological anthropology is an
   underdeveloped and neglected aspect of evangelical theology.}},

Abstract = {{Two approaches have been adopted in attempting to determine the strength
   of the one-phonon infrared absorption by the B nitrogen aggregate in
   diamond. On the one hand, we have heat treated purely type IaA specimens
   with known infrared absorption strengths (and thus also known nitrogen
   concentrations) to bring about partial aggregation of the A centres to B
   centres, monitoring changes in the strengths of the A, and resultant B,
   one-phonon components by decomposition of the ensuing infrared spectra.
   Secondly, we have made direct chemical assays of nitrogen in diamonds
   that show dominant B absorption features. This approach is complicated
   because diamonds in which the B aggregate is the only point defect also
   contain extended defects that may or may not involve nitrogen. These
   defects may or may not, in turn, contribute to absorption in the
   one-phonon region. Nevertheless, the nitrogen concentrations have been
   measured for two distinct groups of diamonds that both uncritically
   might at first glance be typed together as `IaB'. By taking into account
   subtle differences between the infrared spectra of these groups, and
   making allowance for what is known from electron microscopical
   observations about their defect contents, it is possible, despite
   certain experimental indeterminacies, to arrive at a reasonably
   consistent interpretation of the measurements. A value of 794 +/- 8
   at.ppm/cm(-1) is suggested for the absorption strength, at 1282
   wavenumbers, of the B nitrogen aggregate.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of aquatic toxicology, quantitative structure-activity
   relationships (QSARs) have developed as scientifically credible toot for
   predicting the toxicity of chemicals when little or no empirical data
   are available. A fundamental understanding of toxicological principles
   has been considered an important component to the acceptance and
   application of QSAR approaches as biologically relevant in ecological
   risk assessments. As a consequence, there has been an evolution of QSAR
   development and application from that of a chemical-class perspective to
   one that is more consistent with assumptions regarding modes of toxic
   action. In this review, techniques to assess modes of toxic action from
   chemical structure are discussed, with consideration that toxicodynamic
   knowledge bases must be clearly defined with regard to exposure regimes,
   biological models/endpoints and compounds that adequately span the
   diversity of chemicals anticipated for future applications. With such
   knowledge bases, classification systems, including rule-based expert
   systems, have been established for use in predictive aquatic toxicology
   applications. The establishment of QSAR techniques that are based on an
   understanding of toxic mechanisms is needed to provide a link to
   physiologically based toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models, which can
   provide the means to extrapolate adverse effects across species and
   exposure regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Collective sperm motility is characterized in terms of periodic
   aggregation or cooperation among cells, which are seen under a
   microscope as a continuous wave motion. In this study, sperm motility
   that was made dependent on mitochondrial activity (glycolysis inhibited)
   was significantly inhibited by mM exogenous calcium while
   glycolytic-dependent (mitochondrial respiration inhibited) motility was
   not inhibited under these conditions. At intracellular Ca2+ above 400
   nM, sperm motility was inhibited independently of the source of ATP. At
   {[}Ca2+]i of similar to 110 nM, mitochondrial- or glycolytic-dependent
   motility showed 75 or 0\% inhibition, respectively, indicating higher
   sensitivity of mitochondrial-dependent motility to {[}Ca2+]i in
   comparison to glycolytic-dependent motility. Under the latter
   conditions, intracellular level of ATP was reduced by 16\% only,
   indicating that the 75\% inhibition of mitochondrial-dependent motility
   was not due to reduction in ATP. The inhibition of
   mitochondrial-dependent motility by mM extracellular Ca2+ can be
   prevented by incubating the cells at pH 6.5 instead of 7.6. At pH 7.6,
   calcium probably interacts with negative sites on the cell surface and
   interferes in cell-to-cell interactions, which are important to achieve
   collective motility. At more acidic pH (6.5) these negative sites are
   probably protonated; thus Ca2+ cannot interact with them and no
   inhibition of motility could be seen. Glycolytic-dependent motility was
   not inhibited by extracellular Ca2+, since the pH of the medium becomes
   acidic under these conditions. Like Ca2+, mersalyl, which interacts with
   Ca2+ binding sites on the cell surface, showed significant inhibition of
   mitochondrial-dependent motility without any effect on
   glycolytic-dependent motility. Collective motility was directly
   correlated with fertility. These data are significant for establishing
   better conditions for spermatozoa treatment when artificial insemination
   or in vitro fertilization is concerned.}},

Abstract = {{The Si-28 level scheme up to 14.5 MeV excitation energy is reevaluated
   using information from two preceding papers. It consists of
   approximately 250 levels which are almost completely characterized
   according to the quantum numbers I, pi, T Of the levels. The properties
   of positive-parity states are compared to the predictions of shell model
   calculations within the complete s-d basis space using the unified s-d
   shell Hamiltonian. A spectrum of 48 experimental T=1 states between 9.3
   and 16 MeV is reproduced with a rms deviation of only 150 keV. A
   calculation of radiative widths and gamma-decay modes which uses
   free-nucleon g-factors yields excellent agreement with experiment and
   confirms that quenching of M1 transitions is only marginal in Si-28. The
   detailed shell model analysis of the T=0 spectrum is extended to the
   limiting energy where T=1 wave function admixtures, not contained in the
   theory, become important experimentally. This happens at 6-8 MeV above
   the yrast state, depending on the spin value. Altogether it appears that
   a spectrum of 171 levels below 14.5 MeV, which have positive or
   unassigned parity, is almost completely accounted for by the model.
   Apparent intruder states from outside the s-d shell space are observed
   at E(x)=10 945 keV (I-pi=4(+)) and 12 860 keV (I-pi=6(+)) and are
   interpreted as members of a K-pi=0(+) rotational band.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to quantify p53 expression by flow cytometry.
   A panel of three monoclonal antibodies: NCL-p53-240, NCL-p53-1801 and
   NCL-p53-DO7, was tested on breast cell lines and primary breast cancers.
   The relationships between ploidy, tumour grade and p53 expression for
   each antibody, were examined. Methodology was assessed using a variety
   of breast cell lines. Staining patterns were confirmed and the
   quantification technique qualified. Cytokeratin-positive cells from 58
   samples obtained from patients with breast cancer were assayed for DNA
   content and p53 expression. p53 quantification was performed using
   calibrated fluorescent beads on cytokeratin-positive cells. Bloom and
   Richardson grading revealed 20 grade I and 38 grade II/III breast
   cancers. Examination of fluorescence thresholds showed a positive
   correlation between grade and DO7 (P = 0.003) at a level of 8900
   molecules, 240 (P = 0.005) at a level of 2900 molecules and 1801 (P =
   0.005) at a level of 1850 molecules. These levels equated with 34\%
   (DO7), 43\% (240) and 43\% (1801) of the samples being classified as
   p53-positive. Examination of ploidy revealed 23 diploid and 35 aneuploid
   breast cancers. Application of p53 threshold levels on diploid and
   aneuploid tumours showed correlation between aneuploidy and p53
   expression for DO7 at a level of 9000 molecules, 240 at a level of 1900
   molecules and 1801 at a level of 1800 molecules. These levels equated
   with 34\% (DO7), 52\% (240) and 52\% (1801) of the samples being
   classified as p53-positive. We conclude that measurement of p53 by flow
   cytometry may be of clinical importance by indicating levels of
   positivity using fluorescence thresholds. p53 expression has been shown
   to correlate with both grade and ploidy. Flow-cytometric measurement of
   p53 may be a useful prognostic assay.}},

Abstract = {{Plicodendrocrinus n. gen. is erected for dendrocrinids with solid
   pentalobate columns, strong stellate ridges on the aboral cup plates,
   and highly plicate anal sac plates. Five species are assigned: Middle
   Ordovician; P. proboscidiatus (E. Billings, not W. R. Billings) n.
   comb., from the Trenton of Canada and the Dunleith of Iowa and
   Minnesota. Upper Ordovician; P. casei (Meek) n. comb., from the Richmond
   and Gamachian of the midcontinent; P. rugocyathus (Ramsbottom) n. comb.,
   from the Ashgill of England; P. collapsus (Donovan) n. comb.; and P.
   granditubus (Ramsbottom) n. comb., from the Ashgill of Scotland.
   The Middle Ordovician dendrocrinids from the Dunleith Formation
   (Trentonian) of northern Iowa and southern Minnesota are P.
   proboscidiatus (E. Billings), Dendrocrinus acutidactylus E. Billings,
   and Quienquecaudex springeri (Kolata). Ail species are also known from
   the Middle Ordovician of Ontario and Quebec. In addition, O. springeri
   (Kolata) is recorded from the Platteville Group of Illinois.
   Biogeographically, the Dunleith dendrocrinids are most similar to those
   of the northern Appalachians.
   Plicodendrocrinus casei (Meek) ranges widely in the midcontinent and has
   been obtained from the Maysvillian and Richmondian Maquoketa Formation
   of Iowa and Minnesota, several Richmondian units in the Cincinnati area,
   and the Gamachian Girardeau Limestone of Illinois and Missouri.
   A quantitative cladistic analysis of Ordovician cladid and flexible
   crinoids produces five groups: primitive forms including Aethocrinus,
   Compagicrinus, Ottawacrinus, and Guenprisia; cyathocrinids with
   Carabocrinus, Palaeocrinus, Illemocrinus, and Porocrinus; merocrinids
   with Archaetaxocrinus, Merocrinus, Praecupulocrinus, Polycrinus, and
   Aithriocrinus; dendrocrinids with Esthonocrinus, Eoparisocrinus,
   Dendrocrinus, Quienquecaudex, Plicodendrocrinus and perhaps
   Eopinnacrinus; and Cupulocrinus and the flexibles, Protaxocrinus,
   Clidochirus, and Proanisocrinus. These groups are not consistent with
   the present taxonomy and several suggestions for restructuring are
   presented, notably grouping flexibles with cladids and adjusting the
   taxonomic level of cyathocrinids. The cladograms for early cladids and
   flexibles are poorly correlated with stratigraphic position because of
   numerous unfilled range zones for the taxa or their ancestors. Thus, the
   cladograms generate predictions that can be tested by later finds in the
   Lower and the lower part of the Middle Ordovician. The overall
   evolutionary trends are highly mosaic with numerous parallelisms and
   reversals.}},

Abstract = {{The copper-resistance determinant (pco) of Escherichia coli plasmid
   pRJ1004 was cloned and sequenced. Tn1000 transposon mutagenesis
   identified four complementation groups, mutations in any of which
   eliminated copper resistance. DNA sequence analysis showed that the four
   complementation groups contained six open reading frames, designated
   pco-ABCDRS. The protein product sequences derived from the nucleotide
   sequence show close homology between this copper-resistance system and
   the cop system of a plasmid pPT23D of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.
   The PcoR and PcoS protein sequences show homology to the family of
   two-component sensor/responder phosphokinase regulatory systems. A
   seventh reading frame (pcoE) was identified from DNA sequence data, and
   lies downstream of a copper-regulated promoter. Transport assays with
   Cu-64(II) showed that the resistant cells containing the plasmid had
   reduced copper accumulation during the log phase of growth, while
   increased accumulation had previously been observed during stationary
   phase. Chromosomal mutants defective in cellular copper management were
   obtained and characterized. In two of these mutants pco resistance was
   rendered totally inactive, whilst in another two mutants pco
   complemented the defective genes. These data indicate that plasmid-borne
   copper resistance in E. coli is linked with chromosomal systems for
   copper management.}},

Abstract = {{Three years ago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an
   examination of racial patterns in mortgage denial rates in the Boston
   area. The study was motivated by newly available data on mortgage
   applicants, showing that black and Hispanic applicants were two to three
   times as likely to be turned down for mortgages as white applicants. The
   study gathered all the variables thought to be missing from the HMDA
   analysis, such as the applicants' debt burdens and credit histories, to
   see whether these economic factors explained the racial difference in
   denial rates. Although the additional information did explain much of
   the difference, after taking account of economic factors the applicant's
   race still significantly affected the probability of getting a mortgage.
   The study has been influential and has caused many institutions to
   review their lending practices and supervisory agencies to alter their
   examination procedures. The study has also drawn criticism, with critics
   claiming that variables have been omitted, the model misspecified,
   errors made in the data, and information about racial differences in
   foreclosures ignored. This article provides a detailed rebuttal to these
   criticisms and shows that even after incorporating the concerns of some
   of the study's strongest critics, applicants' race as well as economic
   characteristics affected the probability of getting a mortgage in 1990.}},

   Royal Netherlands Forces while serving in the refugee camps in Goma,
   Zaire, is presented. Post-travel questionnaires were given to 131
   military service men returning from Goma. In addition, routine blood
   investigations were undertaken and stool examined for persons with
   abdominal complaints. A high prevalence (59\%) of diarrheal disease
   associated with the eating of food served by a local hotel was noted.
   Fifty percent of persons who developed diarrhea in this period had
   symptoms persisting for up to 10 days. Pathogens were recovered from the
   stools of five persons, and four of these had Shigella organisms
   isolated. The outbreak of diarrhea among the service men was directly
   linked to the eating of food that was prepared by a local Goma hotel,
   the possible causative agent for this outbreak being Shigella organisms.
   Both military and civilian humanitarians working in areas such as
   refugee camps with a high prevalence of diarrheal diseases should
   carefully consider eating from local restaurants and hotels.}},

   Building upon previous work, we first develop a simple but powerful
   formalism that facilitates a methodical investigation of the types and
   properties of small amplitude BGK plasma waves that can exist near a
   given collisionless plasma equilibrium. Using this formalism, we then
   show that any physically relevant spatially uniform plasma equilibrium
   supports nonlinear spatially periodic BGK waves that are described by
   the Vlasov dispersion relation in the small amplitude limit. We
   demonstrate also that these equilibria are characterized by a discrete
   set of critical velocities v(c)((i)), i = 1,2,..., at which BGK solitary
   waves of vanishingly small amplitude can propagate in the plasma. The
   existence of these exact nonlinear spatially periodic and solitary wave
   solutions illustrates the fundamental incompleteness of the linear
   Vlasov-Landau theory of plasma waves since, by virtue of particle
   trapping, these nonlinear waves neither damp nor grow even when their
   amplitude is arbitrarily small.}},

Abstract = {{In term infants sucrose given by mouth has been reported to reduce
   duration of crying after a heel prick. This study was designed primarily
   to investigate the effect of sucrose administered orally immediately
   before heel lancing on the nociceptive reaction in preterm infants as
   assessed by change in heart rate and duration of crying. A secondary
   objective was to document changes in cerebral blood volume during acute
   pain. We used a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, crossover trial
   in a neonatal intermediate care unit in a level 3 perinatal center. The
   patients studied were 16 preterm infants; birth weight, 900-1900 g;
   gestational wk, 27-34; corrected postmenstrual age at time of
   investigation, 33-36 wk. Each infant was assessed twice receiving 2 mt
   of sucrose 50\% or 2 mt of distilled water in random order immediately
   before heel lance. Heart rate, thoracic movements, and transcutaneous
   blood gases were monitored continuously. Crying during the procedure was
   documented by a video-camera. A change in cerebral blood volume was
   assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy. We found the heart rate
   increased by a mean of 35 beats/min (bpm) after sucrose and 51 bpm after
   placebo (median difference 16 bpm, interquartile range 1-30 bpm, p =
   0.005). Infants cried 67\% of time after sucrose and 88\% after placebo
   (median difference 10\%, interquartile range 3-33\%, p = 0.002).
   Cerebral blood volume decreased in 5 of 14 infants after sucrose and in
   6 of 14 infants after placebo (difference not significant). We concluded
   that sucrose administered orally before a heel lance reduces the pain
   reaction in preterm infants. Response of cerebral blood volume to pain
   does not seem to be altered by sucrose.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Our goal was to identify the CT features of pulmonary
   nocardiosis, specifically in AIDS patients versus other
   immunocompromised hosts.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients with pulmonary nocardiosis
   were identified; medical records, CT scans, and chest radiographs were
   reviewed. Five patients had HIV disease, 17 had other causes of
   immunosuppression, and 2 had normal immunity.
   Results: CT features of pulmonary nocardiosis included one or more
   nodules/masses (20/24 cases, 83\%), cavitation (8, 33\%),
   consolidation/infiltrates (8, 33\%), and pleural thickening (7, 29\%).
   All AIDS patients with nocardiosis had multiple (four or more) nodules
   detected on CT and 80\% (4/5) had cavitation compared with 21\% each of
   non-AIDS patients (p < 0.01 for multiple nodules, p < 0.045 for
   cavitation).
   Conclusion: CT features of pulmonary nocardiosis are varied, and AIDS
   patients are more likely to display cavitation and multiple nodules.
   Although not widely recognized, Nocardia infection should be included in
   the differential diagnosis of an unexplained nodule or progressive
   cavitary process in HIV-positive patients.}},

   these treatments on vascular and cellular inflammatory responses in the
   rabbit eye, several biochemical parameters were considered.
   Anterior chamber paracentesis significantly reduced atropine-induced
   mydriasis and a parallel elevation of proteins, polymorphonuclear
   leucocytes (PMNs), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B-4
   (LTB(4)) levels in the secondary aqueous humour (obtained 120 min later)
   was observed. A significant Increase In PMNs in the aqueous humour and a
   parallel increase in myeloperoxidase activity, a measure of PMN
   infiltration, in the iris-ciliary body were detected. Atropine-induced
   mydriasis was maintained in rabbits treated with either sodium naproxen
   or phenylephrine eye drops. However, only in the former group were the
   inflammatory parameters significantly reduced, with the exception of
   aqueous LTB(4) levels.
   The inhibition of the protein influx in the aqueous humour and of the
   miosis produced by sodium naproxen can be related to the high drug
   levels in the aqueous humour that were effective in inhibiting the
   cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, whereas the
   effects on PMN infiltration appear to be independent of significant
   release of the potent chemotactic agent LTB(4), synthesized via the
   5-lipoxygenase pathway.}},

   majalis, and two sun-type plant species, the C-3-plant, Hordeum vulgare,
   and the C-4-plant, Zea mays. The photosynthetic activity of BL leaves of
   C. majalis was found to be 1.5 times higher than that of RL leaves at
   all the irradiances examined. Unlike the shade-type plant, BL promoted
   photosynthesis in the leaves of the two sun-type plants more strongly
   for saturating irradiance levels (activities 1.4-1.5 times higher than
   in RL) than for the linear part of the light saturation curve (1.1-1.2
   times higher than in RL). The results indicate that the enhancing action
   of BL on the different parts of the photosynthetic apparatus depends on
   the ecological type of plant: in contrast with shade-type plants, BL
   promotes mainly the activity of dark photosynthetic reactions in leaves
   of sun-type plants.}},

Abstract = {{In part II of this study on the application of the interactive Kalman
   filter to higher-dimensional systems, a modification suited to
   periodically forced systems is introduced. As in Part I, the object of
   study here is the ENSO model of Zebiak and Cane, but here the technique
   of quasi-fixed points is applied to certain Poincare maps of that system
   that are related to the forcing period of 1 year. As a result, it is
   possible to search the model systematically for possible periodic
   orbits, no matter whether they are stable or unstable. An unstable
   4-year cycle is found in the model, and it is argued that this cycle can
   be traced back to a 4-year limit cycle, which is known to exist under
   weak atmosphere-ocean coupling. All other quasi-fixed points are related
   to orbits that do not appear to be periodic. The findings are applied to
   the modified version of the interactive Kalman filter, which deals with
   cycles as regimes. Comparing these results with the findings in Part I,
   it is found that the filter performances improve using, in the following
   order, the extended filter, the interactive filter with cycles, a
   seasonal average filter, and the original interactive Kalman filter from
   Part I.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To reduce the risk of needlestick injuries to laboratory
   workers:
   DESIGN: Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) tools were applied to data
   collected on the number of blood gas syringes that arrived in the
   laboratory with needles still attached and to the reasons for these
   occurrences.
   SETTING: A clinical chemistry department within a 900-bed tertiary
   referral university teaching hospital.
   PARTICIPANTS: Clinical chemistry laboratory staff and medical staff
   responsible for sending syringes with needles still attached.
   INTERVENTIONS: Changing to a preheparinized blood gas syringe that
   included a syringe cap within the packaging.
   RESULTS: Fivefold reduction in the number of syringes arriving in the
   laboratory with needles still attached.
   CONCLUSION: The risk of needlestick injury to laboratory workers can be
   reduced by provision to clinical staff of preheparinized blood gas
   syringes that include a syringe cap within the packaging. The techniques
   of CQI provide powerful tools for the identification, solving, and
   monitoring of safety-related issues within the healthcare environment

Abstract = {{A child with Sanfilippo syndrome and 5 potential unrelated marrow donors
   were typed serologically, tested in mixed lymphocyte reaction and typed
   by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in attempt to find
   a suitable donor. All donors were found to be identical with the
   recipient, however these studies were not conclusive in identifying the
   best match donor. Therefore, recipient-donor pairs were examined by
   HLA-DR oligotyping. In addition we have studied the potential of
   cytotoxic T-lymphocytes precursors (CTL-p) analysis as a means of
   selection for matched unrelated donors, Low frequencies (1/10(5)) of
   pretransplant CTL-p correlated with oligotyping identity in all
   donor-recipient pairs evaluated. In one case oligotyping disclosed a
   previously unrecognized HLA-DRB1 disparity, This resulted in high
   frequencies of CTL-p (1/35,000), Based on this experience we can argue
   that CTL-p analysis may be used as an additional tool for selection of
   compatible unrelated marrow donors.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The nursing assessment, and the contribution it makes to the
   identification of an individual's health needs, is often a complex and
   multidimensional process. This is always true when the individual
   concerned has a severe learning disability.
   The nurse should develop the assessment in partnership with individuals
   who may experience major communication difficulties, or have
   unappreciated levels of perceptual or cognitive dysfunction. They may
   also live with the ongoing possibility that their affective or
   behavioural responses may be misinterpreted as `challenging behaviour'.
   This case study focuses upon one particular young man with a severe
   learning disability living in a community home. Drawing upon the
   principles of qualitative research methods, especially those of
   `grounded theory', this study aims to demonstrate how these can be used
   to develop a uniquely person-centred assessment.
   A systematic process of observation, analysis and reflection produces a
   detailed picture of the individual and his or her particular health
   states.
   The strength of this approach is threefold. Firstly, the person is
   considered as an active participant and remains the central focus.
   Secondly, in contrast to many other forms of assessment, the person is
   viewed as dynamic with ever changing needs. Thirdly, the process of
   nursing judgement is made explicit and integrated into the assessment
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorophore 2-aminoacridone has been used to label a number of
   branched oligosaccharides previously released from various
   glycoproteins. Complex glycans were derivatized via their reducing end
   with this fluorophore by a Schiff's base mechanism followed by reduction
   to a secondary amine using sodium cyanoborohydride. This process of
   derivatization was carried out efficiently and in a nonselective manner
   over a period of 30 min at 90 degrees C. The resulting derivatives were
   separated with high resolution by capillary electrophoresis using berate
   buffer, containing taurodeoxycholate, as the separation buffer. The
   method described does not require the removal of sialic acid residues
   prior to derivatization, so that treatment of glycans with N-acetyl
   neuraminidase provided useful and additional structural information.
   Attempts have also been made to relate the electrophoretic mobility of
   branched oligosaccharides with their molecular volume. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{Proactive health visiting refers to a model of health visiting practice
   which involves actively seeking and meeting the health needs of a
   defined community. In Fife a working group was established to draw up an
   operational definition of this concept. Training for health visitors was
   introduced on a patch-by-patch basis in Fife between December 1992 and
   May 1993 and an evaluation was subsequently carried out to assess
   whether or not the proactive concept was being implemented and practised
   throughout Fife. The survey results suggest that the proactive training
   has been successful in bringing about a change in health visitor
   practice over a relatively short time period. With an increasing amount
   of health visiting work taking place in clinic settings it will be
   important to define the relative roles of general practitioners,
   practice nurses and health visitors. A number of operational constraints
   were identified by the survey and these tended to limit the
   implementation of the proactive approach. However, we believe that the
   initiatives which have been successfully introduced should be encouraged
   and supported, and recommend that this approach be more widely adopted.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study was undertaken to identify the content of tobacco
   industry smokers' rights publications and to analyze their major themes.
   Methods. Fifty-eight issues of smokers' rights publications from 1987 to
   1992 were selected at random and analyzed. The number of publications
   per year, number of mentions (sentences) in different thematic
   categories per year, and number of mentions per category per publication
   were examined.
   Results. The number of smokers' rights publications increased rapidly
   from 1987 to 1992. The number of mentions across all thematic categories
   increased over time, with the largest numbers appearing in 1990. 1991,
   and 1992. The category of Political and Social Action comprised the
   highest average number of mentions across years.
   Conclusions. These publications appear to be consistent with past and
   present tobacco industry strategies to counter tobacco control efforts
   and negative public perceptions by attempting to refute scientific
   evidence about the health impact of environmental tobacco smoke.
   Additionally, they serve the industry goals of encouraging smokers to
   take action to protect their rights, mobilizing public opinion, and
   delaying societal rejection of smoking and secondhand smoke and
   acceptance of smoking restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration was carried out using hollow fiber Fresenius F 60 module
   and Sartorius plate-frame laboratory ultrafiltration unit. Experiments
   were performed at constant concentration and in batch UF mode. Skim milk
   powder containing 33.4\% total protein and 0.31\% NPN was reconstituted
   in distilled water. The effect of transmembrane pressure, temperature,
   feed flow rate and reconstituted skim milk concentration on flux was
   investigated.
   With the increase of transmembrane pressure, flux of reconstituted skim
   milk powder by ultrafiltration steadily increased by all investigated
   temperatures (20, 40 55 degrees C) and all inlet flow rates. The
   difference in this effect among samples of various concentrations (8, 10
   and 12\% TS) was more expressed by lower temperatures, what could be
   ascribed to the more intense effect of higher RSM viscosity. The
   dependence of flux from temperature result in straight line, by all
   inlet flow rates and skim milk concentrations. By constant transmembrane
   pressure better flux was obtained by higher pH values of reconstituted
   skim milk (RSM). The experimental data are correlated satisfactorily by
   the Leveque's equation Sh = (Re Sc d/L)(003).}},

   nonbipolar mood disorder (major depressive disorder or dysthymic

   separately). Each of the 16 subjects was observed and interviewed on
   methylphenidate 20 mg daily, desipramine (adjusted to therapeutic
   levels), and a combination of these two treatments, and the findings
   were compared to baseline and placebo. Statistically significant
   improvements were observed for the combination of DMI and MPH, in
   comparison to placebo, beyond those seen with either drug alone,
   However, the clinical improvements with DMI+MPH were modest. There was
   no evidence that stimulant medication and DMI potentiated each other's
   effects in treating symptoms of major depressive disorder or dysthymic
   disorder. Compared to placebo, the combined DMI+MPH treatment was most
   effective at improving self-control and reducing inattention,
   hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. Further, there was no
   differential efficacy of DMI and MPH for treating symptoms of depressive
   disorders. Overall, this study, the first controlled trial of combined

   children with epilepsy fare worse than other children? (3) Do
   demographic background and family structure moderate the apparent

   Demographic and family background moderate only a small part of
   epilepsy's effect; and (4) A combination of family processes and

Journal = {{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{332-338}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: CD60 is a recently described T cell subset marker that is
   expressed on the surface of most T lymphocytes in synovial tissue and
   fluid and on a smaller proportion of peripheral T cells. Activation of T
   lymphocytes can be triggered through CD60. CD60 is also expressed by
   neuroectodermally derived cells in thymic epithelium and in skin.
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistologic analysis of CD60 expression in
   synovium and thymus was performed using formalin-fixed tissue samples.
   Nonlymphoid cell lines grown from similar tissues were analyzed by flow
   cytometry.
   RESULTS: CD60 was readily identified in formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded tissues. Simultaneous examination of CD60 distribution
   and cell morphology demonstrated that, in addition to its presence on T
   cells, CD60 was also expressed by a variety of nonlymphoid cells in
   synovium, including synovial Lining cells, vascular endothelium, and
   dendritic-appearing cells deep within synovial tissue. Synovial tissue
   expression of CD60 was similar in rheumatoid arthritis and in other
   forms of inflammatory arthritis. In addition, it was strongly expressed
   by giant cells in pigmented villonodular synovitis. Surface expression
   of CD60 was detected by flow cytometry on cultured synoviocytes and on
   other CD60+ nonlymphoid cells, thus excluding adsorption of CD60 shed by
   T cells as a sufficient explanation of the immunohistologic findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results define the T cell-activating CD60 determinant
   as a broadly distributed Ag within synovial tissue, with a possible
   functional role in the activation of a variety of cellular populations.
   CD60 may also be a marker for previously undescribed cell subsets in the
   synovial compartment, possibly including a cell population of
   neuroectodermal origin.}},

Abstract = {{Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck induces neovascularization
   to support tumor growth and facilitate the metastatic spread. Others
   have suggested that the density of microvessels within the tumor
   correlates with the neovascularization process and therefore with
   clinical behavior and outcome. To ascertain the value of the microvessel
   count as an independent prognostic indicator for squamous cell carcinoma
   of the head and neck, we studied the primary tumors of 44 patients.
   Histological slides were stained for factor VIII and the individual
   microvessels were counted on a 200 x field (0.49 mm). No statistically
   significant difference was found between the microvessel counts of
   tumors that metastasize or recur locally, as compared with turners that
   did not, The possibility of a beta-error due to the small number of
   cases mandates a larger, possibly multi-institutional, study to better
   ascertain the significance of a microvessel count as an independent
   prognostic indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses the operating characteristics for a
   medium-temperature dehumidifier employing a passive evaporator
   economizer and staged liquid subcooling. The refrigerant was HFC134a and
   the compressor was a compliant scroll with a swept volume of 14.8 m(3)
   h(-1). The measurements were made in a psychrometric calorimeter and the
   data consistency is assessed by applying energy and moisture balance
   criteria. Local energy balance is used to determine the incidental heat
   gain of the evaporator. It is suggested the compressor energy balance
   was affected by refrigerant dissolved in the lubricant at the highest
   evaporating pressures tested (900 kPa). The maximum measured specific
   moisture extraction rate of the dehumidifier was 5.11 kg kWh(-1) at 50
   degrees C dry-bulb temperature and 90\% relative humidity. The results
   illustrate the potential for scroll compressors, and the use of HFC134a,

Abstract = {{Six rodent cell lines (36B10 rat glioma cells, 9L rat gliosarcoma cells,
   V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, EMT6/UW and EMT6/Ro mouse mammary
   sarcoma cells, and RIF-1 mouse fibrosarcoma cells) were tested for
   growth in cylindrical threads of Matrigel. These cells grew in the
   threads with doubling times of 17-23 h, reaching maximum cell densities
   on the order of 10(8) cells/ml. Histological sections of these threads
   showed a heterogeneous cell distribution: cells grew to confluence at
   the thread surface and at somewhat lower cell densities in the thread
   core. {[}H-3]thymidine labeling index and radiation sensitivity were
   measured for 9L and EMT6/UW cells in Matrigel threads. For both cell
   types, the labeling index in Matrigel was lower than observed in cell
   monolayers, with higher labeling indexes at the thread periphery than in
   the thread core. When these threads were grown in stirred medium, lower
   thread diameters, higher cell yields per thread, and higher labeling
   indices were obtained. EMT6 cell monolayers coated with Matrigel were
   less radiosensitive than cells in uncoated monolayers. This protective
   effect was eliminated by irradiating in the presence of 1 mg/ml
   misonidazole. EMT6 cells consume nearly three times as much oxygen
   (mole/cm(3)-sec) as do 9L cells, which are equally radiosensitive in
   monolayers with or without a Matrigel coating. The radiation sensitivity
   of EMT6/UW cells in Matrigel threads was similar to that for monolayers
   of plateau phase cells, whereas for 9L cells, the response in threads
   was more similar to exponentially growing cells. We conclude that
   Matrigel threads provide an alternative in vitro model for studying the
   radiation response of cells in a three-dimensional geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Adherence by bacteria to a surface is critical to their survival in the
   human oral cavity, Many types of molecules are present in the saliva and
   serous exudates that form the acquired pellicle, a coating on the tooth
   surface, and serve as receptor molecules for adherent bacteria. The
   primary colonizing bacteria utilize adhesins to adhere to specific
   pellicle receptor molecules, then may adhere to other primary colonizers
   via adhesins, or may present receptor molecules to be utilized by
   secondary colonizing species. The most common primary colonizing
   bacteria are streptococci, and six streptococcal cell wall
   polysaccharide receptor molecules have been structurally characterized.
   A comparison of the putative adhesin disaccharide-binding regions of the
   six polysaccharides suggests three groups, A representative of each
   group was modeled in molecular dynamics simulations, In each case it was
   found that a loop formed between the galactofuranose beta (Galf beta)

Abstract = {{Aims and background The objective of this study was to investigate the
   detection rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN 3)
   in previously unscreened women, in order to reveal trends over time in
   the prevalence of CIN 3 in the District of Florence, where a
   population-based screening for cervical cancer has been going on since
   1973, Study design: We considered the women, recorded in the
   computerized archives of CSPO, who had had no pap test for at least 10
   years. Trends of CIN 3 (histologically proven) were analyzed within age
   groups; the effect of age, cohort and period were considered by means of
   a Poisson regression model. Results: A total of 648 cases of
   histologically proven CIN 3 were detected in the study period. The
   detection rates of CIN 3 increased steadly within age groups over birth
   cohort and calendar period simultaneously. The Poisson regression
   analysis showed that only the model with age + time trend was
   statistically significant. Conclusions: Although several biases should
   be taken into account, the analysis seemed to indicate a real increase
   in CIN 3 prevalence. An increase in frequency of precancerous lesions
   for cervical cancer in more recent birth cohorts supports the need to
   keep screening coverage and efficiency as high as possible.}},

Abstract = {{A new, time-saving method to determine the diffusion coefficient of
   caesium in sodium borosilicate glass is presented. With low-energy ion
   scattering (LEIS) the diffusion coefficient of caesium in this glass,
   where the main components are the same as those in nuclear waste glass,
   is determined in a wide temperature range (723-849 K). Compared to the
   conventional concentration couple method where the diffusion has to be
   studied over large distances (10(5) nm), it is shown that by using LEIS
   accurate measurements can be performed when diffusion takes place over
   distances of the order of 10 nm. Diffusion coefficients for caesium as
   low as 2.6 x 10(-22) m(2) s(-1) are extracted from the measurements.
   This is a factor of 10(6) smaller than that measured with the
   concentration couple method for the same system and more than a factor
   of 10 smaller than diffusion coefficients for caesium determined in
   nuclear waste glasses by other techniques. At high temperatures the
   results of the different methods are in absolute agreement.}},

   concentrations than its isomers in phloem sap from the lower stem
   indicating better retention in the phloem sieve tubes. After 24 h,
   nicotinic acid had accumulated to a greater extent in the phloem sinks
   than had picolinic or isonicotinic acids. Phloem transport of
   substituted analogues, including dihalopyridinecarboxylic acids and
   imidazolinone herbicides, was measured in short-term tests, and attempts
   made to relate such transport to the lipophilicity and pK(a) of the

   transported than imazapyr itself, and were also much less well taken up
   by barley roots from nutrient solution compared to the herbicidal

Abstract = {{Frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 17
   has been described in breast tumor DNAs by a number of groups, and
   recent fine genetic mapping and cloning of an inherited breast-ovarian
   cancer susceptibility locus (BRCA1) to a small region of 17q12-q21 has
   focused interest on this area. The absence of sporadic mutations in the
   BRCA1 gene in breast tumors studied so far suggests that there may be
   other tumor suppressor genes in the region involved in sporadic breast
   cancer. We studied 28 sporadic breast cancers with 14 highly polymorphic
   markers on chromosome 17 (2 on 17p and 12 on 17q). Most of the 17q
   markers are located within the 17q12-q23 region. We confirmed that 50\%
   of tumors have deletions of at least one locus on chromosome arm 17q,
   and that half the deleted cases probably correspond to monosomies 17 or
   17q. The other half correspond to a partial deletion on 17q and were
   used to identify 2 smallest common deleted regions (SCDR1 and SCDR2) on
   17q12-q23. SCDR1 comprised the THRA1 gene, but not the 2 flanking loci
   tested (D17S250 and D17S800); while SCDR2 was defined by loci GIP and
   GH. BRCA1 was deleted in half the cases but it is outside the SCDR1.
   Moreover, breast tumors in young women frequently showed chromosome 17
   alterations.}},

Abstract = {{Surface mount technology is used widely nowadays in the manufacture of
   printed circuit board assemblies in the electronics industry. The
   occurrence of defective products when this technology is used is mostly
   caused by technological problems, but sometimes it is also caused by
   management problems or human errors. When technological problems are
   being tackled, human interactions will always be involved. This is
   because the quality of a product is related to the quality of the
   material, the design of the product and the manufacturing process, and
   as tasks are subdivided, problems occurring in production cannot be
   solved completely by the sole effort of a single individual. Hence
   improvement of product quality involes man, machine, and material. This
   article explains how quality problems arising from surface mount
   technology are tackled by team effort in an organization via the
   implementation of a process-oriented total quality control system.}},

Abstract = {{Control-flow machines are sequential in nature, executing instructions
   in sequence through control of program counters, whereas data-flow
   machines execute instructions only as input operands are made available,
   a process directed at the parallelism inherent within programs. At the
   architecture level, data-flow machines execute instructions
   asynchronously. In contrast, at the implementation level, the
   synchronous design framework of computer systems which employs globally
   clocked timing discipline has reached its design limits owing to
   problems of clock distribution. Therefore, renewed interest has been
   expressed in the design of computer systems based upon an asynchronous
   (or self-rimed) approach free of the discipline imposed by the global
   clock. Thus, the design of a static MIMD data-flow processor using
   micropipelines is presented. The implemented processor, or the micro
   data-flow processor, differs from processors previously reported insofar
   as the micro data-flow processor is wholly asynchronous at both the
   architectural and the implementation levels.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cell suspensions
   indicated that elicitation of defense response (production of
   phytoalexins) with xylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylanxylanohydrolase; EC
   3.2.1.8) resulted in a dramatic acylation of phytosterols (Moreau et al.
   1994). N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), an acylated derivative of
   phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), was recently demonstrated to be
   synthesized in vivo in plant tissues (Chapman and Moore 1993a). Here we
   report that acylation of PE was increased in elicitor-treated cells.
   NAPE levels increased 3-fold (from 1.6 to 4.8 mol\% of total
   phospholipids) after a 2-h treatment of cell suspensions with xylanase
   (1 pg ml(-1)). Specific activity of NAPE synthase increased in parallel
   with NAPE levels. Levels of NAPE and NAPE synthase activity declined
   during the period of 2-4 h after elicitation while levels of acylated
   sterolglycosides (ASG) continued to increase. Radiolabeling studies with
   {[}2-C-14]-ethanolamine confirmed that three times as much NAPE was
   synthesized in elicitor-treated cells compared to that in unelicited
   cells. Patterns of incorporation of {[}1-C-14]-palmitic acid into
   membrane phospholipids in elicitor-treated cells suggested that
   increased acylation of lipids may be a result of changes in the
   acyl-coenzyme A pool. Treatment of cells with purified ethylene
   biosynthesis-inducing xylanase (EIX; 1 mu g ml(-1) cells) resulted in
   increased levels of NAPE synthase activity comparable to those observed
   with the commercial preparations of xylanase. Boiled xylanase did not
   elicit an increase in the specific activity of NAPE synthase.
   Collectively our results demonstrate that the accumulation of NAPE in
   tobacco cells is attributable to increased activity of NAPE synthase.
   This suggests that NAPE may be specifically synthesized to play a
   protective role in membranes of plant cells as has been suggested for
   membranes of damaged animal cells.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor ligands were studied in
   the rat safety signal withdrawal conflict procedure, an operant paradigm
   sensitive to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds. In this
   procedure, behavioural suppression of lever pressing for food was
   induced by the withdrawal of a conditioned signal for safety without the
   usual presentation of a conditioned signal for danger. The compounds
   tested were selective CCK-B antagonists {[}CI-988 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC),
   L-365,260 (0.0042 mg/kg IF) and LY 262,691 (0.001-1 mg/kg SC)], CCK-B
   agonists {[}CCK-4 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC) and BC 264 (0.004-2 mg/kg IP)] and
   CCK-A antagonists {[}devazepide (0.001-1 mg/kg SC) and lorglumide
   (0.01-1 mg/kg SC)]. None of these drugs induced the expected behavioural
   effects, i.e. an anxiolytic-like release of the behavioural suppression
   with CCK-B and, possibly, CCK-A antagonists and/or a further reduction
   of lever pressing with CCK-B agonists, indicative of an anxiogenic-like
   potential. In contrast, the established anxiolytic lorazepam (0.06-0.25
   mg/kg IP), as well as diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) and buspirone (0.25mg/kg SC)
   used as positive control drugs, released the suppression of pressing for
   food during the period associated with the safety signal withdrawal,
   whereas picrotoxin(1 mg/kg IF), used as an anxiogenic control, further
   reduced responding during this conflict period. The present results
   contrast with a series of published data suggesting the involvement of
   CCK processes in anxiety-related behaviour in rodent models such as the
   elevated plus-maze or the light:dark two compartment test, and in panic
   disorders in humans. They indicate that the behavioural effects of one
   category of drugs might vary considerably, depending on the experimental
   situation. Furthermore, they allow the conclusion that anticipatory
   anxiety generated by withdrawal of conditioned signals for safety does
   not involve CCK-related processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the relative positions of 11 anti-apolipoprotein B
   monoclonal antibodies have been mapped onto the surface of human low
   density lipoproteins by electron microscopy. As the epitopes recognized
   by these antibodies have been previously located on the primary sequence
   of apoB, these data provide a map of the configuration of the protein on
   the surface of the LDL. The first 89\% of apoB-100 may be modeled as a
   thick ribbon that wraps once around the LDL, completing the encirclement
   by about amino acid residue 4050. The thickness of the ribbon is
   sufficient to penetrate the monolayer, so that it makes contact with the
   core. There is a kink in the ribbon beginning almost halfway along its
   length at approximately apoB-48. The C-terminal 11\% of apoB constitutes
   the `'bow,'' an elongated structure of about 480 residues, beginning at
   4050 and stretching back into one hemisphere and then crossing the
   ribbon into the other hemisphere between residues 3000 to 3500, thus
   bringing sequences in the C-terminal portion of apoB-100 near to the
   suggested binding site for the LDL receptor. The C-terminal sequences
   may act as a negative regulator of LDL receptor binding, in agreement
   with Parhofer et al., 1992. J. Clin. Invest. 89: 1931-1937, who reported
   the enhanced clearance from plasma of apoB-89-containing lipoproteins.
   It is proposed that in VLDL the bow could function to inhibit binding to
   the receptor; during lipolysis to form LDL, it is suggested that these
   C-terminal inhibitory sequences forming the bow would move sufficiently
   to allow interaction with the LDL-receptor.}},

   0.052; 0.008 to 0.27, mean 0.042; and 0.004 to 0.31, mean 0.038,
   respectively. There was about a 20\% decrease in mean grain Cd
   concentration from 1982 to 1992-1993. The proportion of samples above
   the World Health Organization's (WHO) limit of 0.12 mg Cd kg(-1) DW was
   4\% for 1982 and 1992 and 2\% for 1993. The geographical distribution of
   these high Cd grain samples corresponded with areas where the total soil
   Cd concentrations were significantly above background concentrations.
   Differences between wheat varieties were small and significant (P <
   0.001) only for 1992. The concentration of Cd in white flour was
   significantly correlated with that in wholemeal hour (r = 0.95), and
   bran Cd was significantly correlated with white hour Cd (r = 0.87). On
   average, the concentration of Cd in bran was twice that in wholemeal
   hour, and white flour contained about 31\% less Cd than wholemeal flour.
   The estimated daily dietary Cd intake in the United Kingdom (UK) through
   the consumption of wheat-based products was about 8 mu g Cd per person
   or about 11\% of the WHO's limit of 70 mu g Cd d(-1). The Cd content of
   the vast majority of British wheat grain would not constitute a health
   hazard to the population of the UK or elsewhere.}},

   characteristics for a periodic focusing channel are found to be
   qualitatively the same as those for a uniform focusing channel. A
   threshold condition is obtained numerically for halo formation in

Abstract = {{This experiment studied the effects of hypophysectomy (HX) and
   ovariectomy (OV) on cancellous bone in the proximal tibia and distal 5th
   lumbar vertebra by dynamic histomorphometry. Forty-eight female
   Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 months of age, were divided into age-matched
   control, HX, OV, and HX + OV (HO) groups. Ten rats were sacrificed at 3
   months of age as baseline controls, and the rest of the animals were
   sacrificed 5 weeks after the surgery. While the age-matched controls and
   OV rats significantly increased in body weight compared with the
   baseline control rats, cancellous bone volumes in the proximal tibia and
   distal 5th lumbar vertebra increased in the age-matched control and
   decreased in the OV rats. In the HX and HO rats, body weight equaled
   baseline control values, and their cancellous bone volumes were
   decreased with a poorer trabecular architecture in both bone sites. In
   all HX, OV, and HO rats, uterine weight and serum estradiol were
   significantly decreased. OV significantly increased longitudinal bone
   growth and the tissue- and surface-based bone formation and bone
   resorption parameters in both the proximal tibia and 5th lumbar vertebra
   (p < 0.05). HX alone or HO significantly decreased longitudinal bone
   growth and the tissue-based bone formation rate without significantly
   affecting surface-based bone formation and bone resorption parameters
   when compared with the age-matched controls. No significant differences
   were detected in any variable between the HX alone and HO rats. In this
   study, HX on OV rats decreased the longitudinal bone growth, cancellous
   bone turnover (tissue-based), and cancellous bone volume in the proximal
   tibia and distal 5th lumbar vertebra in young rats at 5 weeks after
   surgery. We suggest that the bone loss in the HO rats was due primarily
   to pituitary hormone deficiency and that the effect of ovarian hormone
   deficiency on cancellous bone is pituitary hormone dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Iron deficiency in rats produces numerous alterations in brain
   metabolism as assessed by in vitro techniques. We used a new method of
   in vivo microdialysis to study the effect of acute iron deficiency
   anemia on rat brain monoamine metabolism. This method was used to sample
   extracellular fluid from an implanted microdialysis probe in the caudate
   puramen from freely moving animals. Method validation experiments showed
   that steady-state levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and their
   metabolites were obtained only after 5 to 7 days of surgical recovery
   and with prior perfusion of the brain region. Caudate putamen dopamine
   was significantly increased 30\% and 40\% in fasted light-exposed and
   2-hr-fed dark-exposed iron deficient anemic rats (hemoglobin < 6 g/dL),
   respectively, relative to control rats. Dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid and
   homovanillic acid concentrations were unaffected by iron deficiency in
   the fasted stare. These metabolites, along with dopamine, increased
   significantly (50 to 82\%) in iron deficient rats with exposure to
   darkness and food while control rats' metabolites did not change. The
   present study documents that iron deficiency is associated with altered
   in vivo brain monoamine metabolism in the steady stare and in response
   to the environmental stimuli of food and darkness, While these data are
   supportive of the previous in vitro demonstrations of down-regulation of
   dopamine D-2 receptors, they also suggest that uptake and processing of
   monoamines is significantly perturbed by iron deficiency.}},

   to a midforehead approach for operative time, blood loss, length of
   hospital stay, and cosmetic result. There was a trend toward decreased
   operative time and decreased blood loss with the midforehead approach.
   The cosmetic result was acceptable in all patients. We advocate the use

Abstract = {{The authors provide an ethical justification for three indications for
   performing selective termination of multifetal pregnancies. These
   indications are (1) achieving a pregnancy that results in a live birth
   of one or more infants with minimal neonatal morbidity and mortality,
   (2) achieving a pregnancy that results in a live birth of one or more
   infants without antenatally detected anomalies, and (3) achieving a
   pregnancy that results in a singleton live birth. This ethical
   justification is based on two basic approaches to obstetric ethics that
   emphasize that these indications must be established on the basis of
   informed consent. The authors underscore the importance of matters of
   private conscience and demonstrate the consistency of the ethical
   justification with existing public policy in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effects of GABA(B) receptor stimulation on membrane properties of
   rat periaqueductal gray neurones were studied by use of intracellular
   recordings from single neurones in superfused brain slices.
   Intracellular staining with biocytin was used to characterize the
   anatomical location of each impaled neurone.
   2 The GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen, directly hyperpolarized or
   produced an outward current (single electrode voltage-clamp) in all 66
   neurones tested. Baclofen-induced hyperpolarizations were
   concentration-dependent with an EC(50) of approximately 0.6 mu M and
   maximum hyperpolarization with 10 mu M baclofen. Hyperpolarizations
   persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 mu M, n = 2).
   3 2-OH-saclofen, a selective GABA(B) receptor antagonist, competitively
   antagonized baclofen-induced hyperpolarizations (n = 4)with equilibrium
   dissociation constants estimated in two neurones to be 6 and 23 mu M.
   Naloxone (1 mu M) did not prevent hyperpolarizations induced by baclofen
   (n = 34).
   4 Hyperpolarizations induced by baclofen were associated with an
   increased inwardly rectifying potassium conductance. Ba2+ superfusion (5
   to 10 mM) blocked this conductance increase (n = 4). Elevation of
   extracellular potassium concentration (from 2.5 to 6.5 mM) shifted the
   reversal potential in agreement with predictions of the Nernst equation.
   5 Hyperpolarizations produced by baclofen (10 mu M) desensitized (>5\%
   inhibition of the maximum response) in 7/22 neurones during continuous
   superfusion for 5 min. Strong desensitization (>25\% inhibition of the
   maximum response) was observed in only 2/22 neurones in the
   ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. In contrast 6/9 neurones in the
   laterodorsal tegmental nucleus displayed strong desensitization.
   6 These studies demonstrate that baclofen acting on GABA, receptors
   increases potassium conductance in all lateral and ventrolateral
   periaqueductal gray neurones. The neurones hyperpolarized by baclofen
   are likely to be involved in the well-established antinociceptive
   actions of baclofen in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, but might
   also be involved in other functions because many of them. lie outside
   the main `antinociceptive' zone of this region. The cellular mechanisms
   underlying baclofen-induced antinociception presumably differ from the
   postulated antinociceptive action of opioids, thought to be mediated via
   disinhibition of periaqueductal gray neurones which project to the
   ventromedial medulla.}},

Abstract = {{The cytoreductive effects of anti-transferrin receptor (anti-TfnR)
   immunotoxins (ITs) and of ricin toxin against tumour micromasses have
   been evaluated in a multicellular tumour spheroid (MTS) model. More than
   600 (656) MTSs obtained with human breast carcinoma (MCF7) or rat
   glioblastoma (9L) cell lines were treated individually with ITs or toxin
   and the effects induced by the treatment were measured for each MTS as
   volume variation vs time by applying the Gompertz growth model. Two
   dose-dependent patterns of MTS growth were observed in MTSs of both cell
   lines in response to IT or toxin treatment: (1) complete inhibition of
   MTS growth ('sterilisation'); and (2) partial/complete inhibition
   ('heterogeneous response'). Within the range of IT or toxin
   concentrations resulting in partial inhibition of MTS growth, the
   sensitivity of treated MTSs was extremely heterogeneous (the
   cytoreductive effects varying between 0.1 and 4 logs of cells killed for
   a given IT or toxin concentration). Analysis of the post-treatment
   regrowth kinetics indicated that treated non-sterilised and control MTSs
   reached the same final limiting volumes. However, the doubling time
   estimated for the surviving cells of treated MCF7 and 9L MTSs ranged
   between 15 and 50 h, indicating that each MTS had individual growing
   potential. In conclusion, our results indicate that at substerilising IT
   concentrations individual heterogeneity of MTSs may greatly influence
   the cytoreductive potential of ITs. An implication of our study is that
   the efficacy of an IT treatment in eradicating disseminated
   micrometastases may not be predictable a priori. The MTS model that we
   describe in this paper may help in dissecting out factors limiting the
   effect of ITs in three-dimensional tumours.}},

   effective constants of americium(III) extraction <(K)over bar(ex)(Am)>
   have been evaluated; no general correlation between <(K)over

   determined: the direct dependence <(K)over bar(ex)(Am)> increases with
   increasing pK(a) in the case of successive substitution of alkoxy groups
   by phenyl groups, the reverse dependence in the case of successive
   substitution of alkyl groups by phenyl groups, which illustrates the
   `'anomalous aryl strengthening.'' and the direct dependence in the case
   of introduction of substituents in benzene rings bonded to the
   phosphorus atom. It has been found that in the case of the reagent
   containing tert-butyl radicals at phosphorus, <(K)over bar(ex)(HNO3)>
   and <(K)over bar(ex)(Am)> fall out of the linear dependences, probably
   owing to the prevalence of steric factor in the complex formation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for decomposing industrial energy demand using the
   Divisia approach. This method involves decomposition of the aggregate
   energy-intensity index measured in terms of energy consumption per unit
   output. The factors considered are changes in production structure and
   sectoral energy intensities. The effect associated with sectoral energy
   intensities is further decomposed into those associated with fuel
   substitution and real energy intensities. We have applied the
   methodology to data of the Korean manufacturing industry. The results
   obtained show that increases in aggregate intensity for total energy
   consumption since 1988 are due primarily to the effect of increased real
   energy intensities, The contributions from structural changes and
   interfuel substitution were relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{By using the periodic signal present in the frequencies of oscillation
   due to the base of the solar convection zone, Monteiro,
   Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Thompson gave an upper limit to the extent of a
   layer of convective overshooting in the Sun. Alternative studies have
   suggested that it may not be possible to do so since the amplitude of
   the signal does not vary monotonically with the extent of the layer.
   In this work a new more complete set of models is used to compare the
   values of the amplitude obtained from the fitting of the signal with the
   expected amplitudes. These are determined using the assumption that the
   rapid variation occurring at the base of the convection zone and
   creating the periodic signal can be described as discontinuities of the
   sound-speed derivatives. The amplitude of the signal due to the
   discontinuity of the third derivative of the sound speed is then
   proportional to the derivative of the radiative gradient, while the
   amplitude resulting from the discontinuity of the second derivative is
   proportional to the difference between radiative and adiabatic gradients
   at the position where the transition occurs. The latter is non-zero only
   if overshoot is present.
   Asymptotic predictions of the amplitudes of the signal in the p-mode
   frequencies are in good agreement with the values found from fitting
   models with substantial overshoot regions; as was also found by Monteiro
   et al., the observed solar frequencies place Severe limits on the extent
   of overshoot of this nature.}},

   groups {[}Cu(dienSS)Cl-3](-) are linked by single Cl bridges to a highly
   distorted tetrahedral {[}CuCl4](2-) group. The space group is Pbcn, Z =

   potentially pentadentate ligand coordinates to Cu-II as tridentate with
   dangling thiophene residues; it is located normal to the Cu-Cu axis with
   CuN = 2.026(7), 2.021 (7) and 2.024(7) A. The three CuCl bonds
   completing Cu(dienSS) to a pseudooctahedron differ in length and
   position: CuCl = 2.253(2) Angstrom is in the same plane as the three
   CuN; CuCl = 3.029(2) Angstrom is perpendicular to that plane and takes
   part in the double bridge Cu(Cl)(2)CU; CuCl = 3.133 Angstrom takes part
   in a single bridge with the {[}CuCl4](2-) group. The {[}CuCl4](2-) group
   is closer to a planar structure than to a tetrahedron: trans-ClCuCl
   angles are 154.0(2) and 157.2(2)degrees. The CuCl bonds are 2.286(2)
   Angstrom (bridging to two different six-coordinate Cu units) and
   2.226(3) Angstrom (free). Both the elongated pseudooctahedra and the
   planar structure are due to vibronic coupling. Molecular mechanics (MM),
   Austin Model 1 (AM1) and extended Huckel (EH) calculations suggest that
   electron delocalization to the thiophene groups occurs upon
   coordination.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of designing optimal buffer management policies
   in shared memory switches when packets already accepted in the switch
   can be dropped (pushed-out), Our goal is to maximize the overall
   throughput, or equivalently to minimize the overall loss probability in
   the system, For a system with two output ports, we prove that the
   optimal policy is of push-out with threshold type (POT), The same result
   holds if the optimality criterion is the weighted sum of the port loss
   probabilities. For this system, we also give an approximate method for
   the calculation of the optimal threshold, which we conjecture to be
   asymptotically correct, For the N-ported system, the optimal policy is
   not known in general, but we show that for a symmetric system (equal
   traffic on all ports) it consists of always accepting arrivals when the
   buffer is not full, and dropping one from the longest queue to
   accommodate the new arrival when the buffer is full, Numerical results
   are provided which reveal an interesting and somewhat unexpected
   phenomenon, While the overall improvement in loss probability of the
   optimal POT policy over the optimal coordinate-convex policy is not very
   significant, the loss probability of an individual output port remains
   approximately constant as the load on the other port varies and the
   optimal POT policy is applied, a property not shared by the optimal
   coordinate-convex policy.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the cartilaginous preformed bones of the skeleton,
   ossification of human thyroid cartilage begins at the end of the second

   prerequisite for ossification. The aim of the study was to investigate
   the temporal and spatial appearance of cartilage canals in thyroid
   cartilage. Extracellular matrices of cells in cartilage canals were
   characterized immunohistochemically. Corrosion casts indicated that the
   cricothyroid branch of the superior thyroid artery was involved in
   vascularization of the thyroid cartilage. The first cartilage canals
   were detectable at the end of puberty, always lying at certain distances
   to almost ossified areas of the thyroid cartilage. The extracellular
   matrix localized at the border of the cartilage canals reacted with
   antibodies against type I collagen and type III procollagen, as well as
   with antibodies against type II collagen. This finding suggests that
   these cells are intermediate between fibroblasts and chondrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Press cake meals were prepared from previously frozen herring
   immediately following thawing and after storage for 8 or 12 days at 2-5
   degrees C. Each of the raw sources of herring was subjected to two
   processing temperatures, 75 degrees C and 100 degrees C, during meal
   preparation. Also, protein hydrolysates were prepared using ocean perch
   when fresh or after storage at 2-5 degrees C for 4 or 8 days.
   Subsequently, each of the three hydrolysates was dried at 85 degrees C
   or 93 degrees C.
   In two separate experiments, each of the herring press cake meals and
   dried perch protein hydrolysates was blended with a reference diet in a
   30:70 ratio (test protein source: reference diet). All diets contained 5
   g kg(-1) chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. The reference diet and
   all test diets were provided to satiation to chinook salmon in salt
   water and rainbow trout in fresh water, with digestibility of organic
   matter, protein and energy measured by difference. Digestibility of
   protein was also measured by the pH-stat and dilute pepsin solubility in
   vitro techniques.
   The results indicated that variation in processing temperature to a
   maximum of 100 degrees C had little effect on digestibility of marine
   fish protein sources. By contrast, raw material storage for 8 days or
   more at 2-5 degrees C prior to processing was found to reduce organic
   matter digestibility and sometimes nitrogen digestibility in salmonids.
   In vitro measures of digestibility were of little help in predicting the
   nutritive value of the test protein sources. Cadaverine level in herring
   press cake meal was shown to be a good indicator of spoilage in the raw

   cracking on trees from Colt rootstock was significantly reduced from
   63\% on covered trees to 5\% on uncovered trees. However, no significant
   difference in the total number of cracked fruits was observed from
   covered and uncovered trees on F.12/1 rootstock. Susceptibility to
   cracking was greater in fruits from covered trees on F.12/1 rootstock.
   Fruits from covered trees were associated with a 10\% increase in

Abstract = {{Objective. The quest for a unified empirical methodology suitable to all
   social scientists is the basis for the development of an alternative
   method of measuring and evaluating changes in criminal activity for
   individual communities. A coefficient, beta, is derived that relates the
   percentage change in the incidence of a specific crime in a given
   community to the percentage change of all crime in the respective state
   or nation. Methods. Monthly changes in a specific crime are linearly
   regressed against corresponding changes in a state or national crime
   index. Beta is the coefficient of the index variable. This methodology
   eschews the supply of criminal offense approach in favor of a portfolio
   approach employing only one independent variable-changes in the
   aggregate crime index. Problems of multicollinearity and debate over the
   form and specification of the criminal supply equation are thereby
   rendered moot. Results. Betas are calculated for each category I crime
   by state and city (Texas). The derived betas evince stability over time
   and consistency over different indexes. Conclusions. The betas may be
   used to identify those communities experiencing abnormal changes in
   criminal activity and hence candidates for further study.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the role of nymphal versus adult western black-legged ticks
   (Ixodes pacificus) in the epidemiology of Lyme disease, the seasonal
   distribution, abundance, and spirochetal infection rates in these
   stages, and the seasonal occurrence of ticks biting humans and of
   incident cases of Lyme disease were determined in northern California.
   Although their seasonal activity periods overlapped for about one-third
   of the year, nymphs and adults predominated in different seasons, the
   former from late spring to summer and the latter from fall to early
   spring. At one site, four (4\%) of 100 adults from low vegetation
   bordering a hardwood forest and 44 (13.6\%) of 324 nymphs from leaf
   litter in the forest were found to contain Borrelia burgdorferi.
   Biting-collection records revealed that nymphs attach to people more
   commonly than recognized previously; I. pacificus nymphs comprised
   12.5\% of 967 ticks of various species and stages and 42\% of all nymphs
   submitted for identification. Attachments by nymphs occurred primarily
   between April and August, which coincided with the seasonal occurrence
   of most incident cases of Lyme disease. Collectively, these findings
   strongly implicate the nymphal stage of I. pacificus as the primary
   vector of B. burgdorferi to humans in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Many examples of fractal geometry are seen in the field of Astronomy,
   from nearby objects such as our Sun, to phenomena at intermediate length
   scales in our Galaxy such as the distribution of masers. This paper will
   give many examples of various length scales and finally concentrates on
   the largest scales which can be probed in our universe, with analyses of
   locations of galaxies. It has been known for some twenty years that the
   distribution of galaxies on small scales is fractal. This is seen in
   analyses which indicate that both galaxies and their clusters are power
   law correlated (a signature of fractal behavior). At larger length
   scales the distribution is supposed to exhibit a so-called correlation
   length and was thought to then become homogeneous - except for
   occasional fluctuations. More data and subsequent analysis have shown
   that these fluctuations are anything but occasional, as structures are
   seen to exist on length scales up to the maximum scales which can be
   probed with the new data. By reanalyzing the data, with methods that are
   particularly suited to fractal distributions, one finds no correlation
   length at all indicating that the fractal structure may extend up to
   perhaps the largest length scales possible. Analysis also indicates that
   when galaxy masses are considered, the distribution may be multifractal.
   These conclusions have serious implications for many subfields in
   astrophysics today, from galaxy formation to the Robertson-Walker metric
   of spacetime.}},

Abstract = {{How can health professional teams provide patient-centred care in the
   treatment of chronic disease? What education and training is needed to
   achieve this? Patient-centred care means helping people living with a
   condition make informed choices to maximise their quality of life. The
   health professional's role is to facilitate: to ensure patients and
   those around them take effective and appropriate self-management of the
   condition. To achieve this, high quality team working is needed amongst
   people who do not interact in the course of their day-to-day work.
   Education for this should begin with students, expand when staff are
   newly qualified, become a feature of specialist training, and extend
   through continuing professional development. A unified philosophy and
   strategy then is needed for life-long professional education and
   training. Generalised principles are proposed for what should happen and
   who can best provide it, and these can be widely applied in many fields
   of health professional education.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the coherence bandwidth of interplanetary scintillations
   (IPS) made at the Nancay Radio Observatory between 1982 and 1992 have
   been used to estimate the variance of electron density delta N-e(2) at
   solar distances of 5 to 15 R(s). These IPS observations are sensitive to
   scales of the order of 10 km; i.e., they measure the `'microscale
   variance,'' which is a small fraction of the total density variance.
   Measurements in the equatorial region are invariant over the solar
   activity cycle and show the same behavior with distance as the mean
   density, i.e., delta N-e(2) proportional to N-e(2). They do not show a
   statistically significant change in the `'transonic region'' as reported
   by other observers (Lotova et al., 1985). Measurements over the polar
   region show a clear variation with the solar cycle. At solar maximum,
   delta N-e(2) is invariant with latitude, as is N-e (Withbroe; 1988).
   However, the apparent delta N-e(2) measured by IFS is about 10 times
   lower in the polar streams which form during the declining and minimum
   phases of solar activity. Compensation for the line of sight integration
   inherent in the IPS observations indicates that the local value of SN,2
   is actually about 15 times lower in the polar streams. We cannot
   estimate the latitude variation of the `'development'' of the
   compressive turbulence delta N-e/N-e between 5 and 15 R(s) because
   measurements of N-e in the polar hole are lacking.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum coke has become an increasingly important feedstock for
   circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustors since it can be effectively
   utilized in an environmentally sound matter. Despite its relatively high
   sulfur content, petroleum coke can be fired along with sorbent material
   which yields acceptable sulfur capture. However, vanadium in a petroleum
   coke can cause potential agglomeration problems in the combustor or loop
   seal of a circulating fluidized bed due to the formation of molten ash
   compounds. In addition, other constituents in the coke ash and
   calcium-based sorbents can react with vanadium to form complexes with
   low melting temperatures. Simple laboratory techniques were developed
   for assessing the agglomeration potential from petroleum coke firing.
   The results of these tests showed that combustor temperature has a
   strong effect on the formation of low melting vanadium eutectics and the
   rate of agglomeration. Also, defluidization of ash in the loop seal can
   lead to sintering at relatively low temperatures since packing promotes
   particle-to-particle bonding. Magnesium-based solid additives were found
   to reduce vanadium related agglomeration in laboratory tests by
   increasing the melting point of vanadium compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Default risk assessment procedures use threshold models for
   non-carcinogens and a non-threshold model for carcinogens. This a priori
   distinction reflects the fact that the default procedures do not
   consider mechanisms of action of specific chemicals. When mechanisms are
   considered, the distinction is not necessary. Starting with the premise
   that the goal of risk assessment is to identify actual risk for specific
   chemicals, three major, generic components of the overall mechanism
   translating exposure into a response of regulatory interest are
   identified. These are the specific mechanisms linking (1) exposure with
   dose to target tissue, (2) target tissue dose with short-term responses
   such as cytolethality or mutation, and (3) short-term responses with
   ensuing long-term responses such as cancer or cirrhosis. (Short-term
   responses may be regulatory end points of interest, or they may be
   intermediate steps on the way to longer-term sequelae). On-going
   research on formaldehyde and chloroform is described to illustrate how
   these three components of the overall mechanism can be examined
   experimentally and used in specific models. The impact of
   mechanism-based risk assessment on uncertainty is also considered.
   Uncertainty is a function of the extent to which the model used for risk
   assessment misspecifies the actual mechanism of action for the chemical
   in question. There is a trade-off between (a) mechanism-based models
   that may reduce uncertainty but are expensive and time-consuming to
   develop and (b) default models that are not chemical-specific but can be
   used with minimal data sets. Experience with mechanism-based risk
   assessment may allow modification of default procedures to minimize this
   trade-off. A future default procedure for carcinogen risk assessment
   might allow specification of mode of action. For example, while DNA
   reactive-carcinogens would still be assumed to have linear low-dose
   risk,carcinogens acting through purely cytotoxic mechanisms might be
   assumed to have sharply non-linear or even threshold dose-response
   curves.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for performing interim analyses in long term 2 x 2
   crossover trials with serial patient entry. The analyses are based on a
   linear statistic that combines data from individuals observed for one
   treatment period with data from individuals observed for both periods.
   The coefficients in this linear combination can be chosen quite
   arbitrarily, but we focus on variance-based weights to maximize power
   for tests regarding direct treatment effects. The type I error rate of
   this procedure is controlled by utilizing the joint distribution of the
   linear statistics over analysis stages. Methods for performing power and
   sample size calculations are indicated. A two-stage sequential design
   involving simultaneous patient entry and a single between-period interim
   analysis is considered in detail. The power and average number of
   measurements required for this design are compared to those of the usual
   crossover trial. The results indicate that, while there is minimal loss
   in power relative to the usual crossover design in the absence of
   differential carry-over effects, the proposed design can have
   substantially greater power when differential carry-over effects are
   present. The two-stage crossover design can also lead to more economical
   studies in terms of the expected number of measurements required, due to
   the potential for early stopping. Attention is directed toward normally
   distributed responses.}},

Abstract = {{Although insulin resistance and hypertension are commonly associated,
   the underlying cause for this association remains unknown. Plasma
   concentrations of the recently described hormone amylin, which is
   cosecreted with insulin by the pancreatic beta cell, are reported to be
   elevated in various states of insulin resistance: including hypertension
   and obesity. Preliminary studies by our group have suggested that there
   are amylin binding sites in the kidney. In nine healthy humans an
   infusion of human amylin that resulted in steady slate plasma amylin
   levels in the subnanomolar range led to significant increases in plasma
   renin and aldosterone concentrations. These changes occurred in the
   absence of significant changes in plasma electrolytes, catecholamines,
   vasopressin, total renin, or osmolality. Diastolic pressure at 30
   minutes and plasma glucose at 60 minutes rose modestly. Since amylin has
   both metabolic and renal actions, this peptide may be an important link
   between hypertension, insulin resistance, and the renin-angiotensin
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental measurements of forced convection single-phase and boiling
   heat transfer from pin fin arrays were made using fluorocarbon liquid
   FC-72. Liquid flow was directed to and from the pin fin arrays by
   multiple slot nozzles, alternately providing suction and impingement
   flow.
   Rectangular pin fin arrays having equal width and spacing of 0.1 and 0.2
   mm and aspect ratios from 1 to 5 were machined from 1 cm square copper
   blocks, The multiple slot nozzles featured alternating inlet and outlet
   channels 1-mm wide on a 2-mm pitch.
   Flow rates of 1.25 to 10 cm(3)/s (0.075 to 0.6 l/min) were tested,
   resulting in inlet and outlet velocities of 0.05 to 0.4 m/s and pin fin
   array velocities from 0.05 to 4.0 m/s, The range of flow rates and pin
   fin geometries provided a single-phase thermal conductance as high as
   38.5 kW/m(2) . K and critical heat flux as high as 369 W/cm(2).
   At a fixed pin fin aspect ratio and liquid flow rate, reducing pin fin
   width from 0.2 mm to 0.1 mm increased single-phase heat transfer by an
   average of 7\%, while critical heat flux remained constant. Correlations
   of the single-phase heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux as

Abstract = {{THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTROLLED clinical trial was to compare the
   clinical efficacy of 3 treatment modalities in the treatment of deep
   interproximal intrabony defects. Forty-five (45) defects in 45 patients
   were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by blocking to
   prognostic variables. The test group was treated with titanium
   reinforced membranes positioned just apical to the cemento-enamel
   junction and the modified papilla preservation technique; the second
   group received conventional expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)
   barrier membranes applied at the alveolar crest; the third group was
   treated with an access flap procedure. The groups were well balanced
   with respect to all prognostic variables. During the 1-year observation
   period, patients were subjected to a stringent infection control program
   including: professional tooth cleaning every week for the first 6 weeks
   (all groups) and in the 4 weeks following membrane removal (guided
   tissue regeneration groups), then at monthly intervals (all groups). The
   results indicated that: 1) all treatment modalities resulted in clinical
   and statistically significant improvements in clinical attachment level
   (GAL) and probing depths (PD) at 1 year; 2) a significantly greater
   amount of CAL gain(P = 0.0003, analysis of variance) was observed in the
   test group (5.3 +/- 12.2 mm) with respect to both the ePTFE group (4.1
   +/- 1.8 mm) and the flap control group 2.5 +/- 0.8; 3) in the test group
   the 1 year CAL (4.7 +/- 1.8 mm) was located more coronally than the
   baseline position of the interproximal alveolar crest (5.9 +/- 2 mm; P =
   0.0h03, t test). It can be concluded that: 1) the combination of the
   papilla preservation technique with self-supporting barrier membranes
   resulted in significantly greater CAL improvements than conventional GTR
   or access flaps and 2) displacement of clinical CAL coronal to the
   interproximal bone crest is possible.}},

Abstract = {{The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group
   classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the
   following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very
   high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision
   surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface
   ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea
   behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the
   restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors.
   We here extend this result to non-separable training data.
   High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing
   polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the
   performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning
   algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character
   Recognition.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effect of 1.5\% ethacrynic acid (EGA) in ointment on
   intraocular pressure (IOP) and outflow facility following 5 days of
   topical treatment in ocular normotensive cynomolgus monkeys. Twelve
   monkeys received a 1 cm strip of ointment containing EGA in one eye but
   without ECA in the other once daily for 5 days. On Day 1 and Day 5 IOP
   was measured immediately before and 1 and 3 h after treatment. Outflow
   facility (perfusion) was determined 3.5 h after treatment on Day 5. The
   EGA-vehicle IOP differences averaged -2.8 +/- 0.8 (S.E.M) (p < 0.01),
   -1.7 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.02) and -3.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (p < 0.001), equivalent
   to IOP reductions of 21 +/- 6\% (p < 0.01), 13 +/- 5\% (p < 0.02) and 26
   +/- 5\% (p < 0.002) respectively, at 0, 1 and 3 h respectively after
   treatment on Day 5. Facility averaged 40 +/- 15\% higher (p < 0.03) in
   the EGA-treated compared to the vehicle-treated eyes 4 h after treatment
   on Day 5.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine the distribution of neuropeptides in male patients

   Materials and Methods: Bladder neck tissue, obtained from male patients
   with bladder neck dyssynergia (END) and control patients with benign
   prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), was studied immunohistochemically for
   protein gene product 9.5 (a general neuronal marker), vasoactive
   intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide,
   substance P, growth associated protein 43 and nitric oxide synthase.
   Results: In the bladder neck from control patients, the greatest density
   of nerves contained protein gene product 9.5, followed in decreasing
   order by neuropeptide Y; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; calcitonin
   gene-related peptide; nitric oxide synthase; substance P and serotonin.
   The neuropeptides were found in the smooth muscle and were also
   associated with blood vessels. In patients with END there was a
   statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the density of protein
   gene product 9.5- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves in the smooth
   muscle and the base of the mucosa but not in blood vessels in the
   bladder neck, while the density of the other neuropeptides studied,
   nitric oxide synthase and serotonin did not significantly change from
   that of control tissue. Growth associated protein 43-immunoreactive
   nerves were absent from the bladder neck from both groups of patients.
   Conclusion: It is suggested that the increase in density of protein gene
   product 9.5- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves, part of the
   sympathetic contractile system of the bladder neck, may exacerbate
   bladder outlet obstruction and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of
   BND.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{To understand the interaction of the many contextual variables that
   affect parental behavior a number of static optimality models have been
   developed. Among these the one by Lazarus and Inglis (1986) is the only
   one to specifically predict the magnitude of unshared parental
   investment (PI), i.e., of parental care that carries a cost to the
   parent and that benefits all current offspring equally because it cannot
   be divided among them. We investigated specifically how parent great
   tits (Parus major) gear their brood defense, a form of unshared PI, to
   the size of the brood at stake and to the risk incurred as a function of
   the type of predator. The predators used were dummies of the great
   spotted woodpecker (Picoides major) and of the tawny owl (Strix aluco).
   Normally, adults can approach the woodpecker with impunity; it had
   inflicted heavy losses to nestlings of the study populations of great
   tits near Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony. Parent great tits whose brood had
   been artificially reduced to two young responded to the dummy with less
   defense than did a control group with their pre-test brood size left
   intact. The nature of defense was qualitatively the same as that
   elicited by a live woodpecker. Parents confronting the owl near their
   brood decreased their response with an artificial reduction in, brood
   size much less. Because the owl used poses a serious risk to the
   defenders, as compared to the woodpecker, the result lends powerful
   support to the `'total loss'' version of the model of unshared PI; it
   predicts brood size to affect unshared PI more strongly when there is
   less risk to the parent. This interpretation is correct to the extent
   that one premise of the model, namely that of uncompromised parentage,
   can be relaxed; great tit broods contain a sizeable number of extrapair
   young. Males defended their brood more strongly than did females. Sex
   and brood manipulation added up linearly when affecting defense level,
   i.e., there was no interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Current interest in low-loss UHF filters for use in mobile and personal
   communication systems has led to a number of pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and SH
   mode based SAW devices. These filters can operate at higher frequencies
   than SAW-based ones for a given line-width because PSAW and SH mode
   velocities can be significantly higher than corresponding SAW
   velocities. Furthermore for certain orientations the attenuation of the
   PSAW is acceptably small. In this paper the existence of an independent
   high-velocity pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) mode is discussed. The HVPSAW is shown
   to have a phase velocity close to the longitudinal bulk wave velocity
   and to be quasi-longitudinally polarized. The nature of this HVPSAW mode
   is described for both electrically open-circuited and layered metallic
   short-circuited conditions for several piezoelectric materials.
   Numerical and experimental data are presented which discuss the
   existence and properties of these high-velocity pseudosurface waves.}},

Abstract = {{Ingestion of phytoplankton by the copepod community was measured during
   spring (May 1992) and late summer (September 1991) at two sites in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico. During both studies, influence of the
   Mississippi River was more evident at the plume site, located near the
   mouth of the Mississippi River, than at the mid-shelf site, located
   farther from river discharge. With the exception of the plume site
   during spring, the copepod community ingested 14-62\% of the daily
   phytoplankton production. The small transfer (4-5\%) of phytoplankton to
   copepods in spring at the plume site is attributed to high river
   discharge, which stimulates phytoplankton production to very high rates
   before the copepod community can numerically respond sufficiently to
   take advantage of this bloom. This response is also slowed by cooler
   temperatures in the spring (22 degrees C) compared to the late summer
   (29 degrees C). In addition to copepods, larvaceans were abundant at all
   study sites. Indirect estimates of their nutritional demands indicate
   they were important grazers. The copepod community consumes a
   significant fraction of the phytoplankton production that is stimulated
   by riverine nutrient inputs in this region.}},

   (ii) unilateral axotomy close to the cell bodies by an intracortical
   lesion between cell layer V and the corpus callosum, and (iii)
   implantation of a continuous infusion device in the cortical parenchyma
   near the lesion. Two weeks later, coronal sections of the cortex are
   immuno-stained for CTB, and CTB-stained neurons are counted over defined
   section areas and compared to those on the contralateral (nonlesioned,
   noninfused) side. CTB-stainable neurons were 30-40\% of the control side
   when the lesion was about 200 mu m from the deeper face of the cell
   layer, and survival increased with increasing lesion depths. The model
   can be used to assess protective effects of potential CSMN trophic
   factors. The low survival achieved with the more superficial lesions

Abstract = {{Serum levels and serum bactericidal activities of six antipseudomonal
   agents were studied comparatively in 60 patients. Single intravenous
   doses of gentamicin (1.5 mg/kg), piperacillin (4 g), ceftazidime (1 g),
   imipenem (0.5 g), aztreonam (1 g), and ciprofloxacin (200 mg) were given
   over 30 min to 10 patients each, and serum samples were obtained 30 min,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after beginning the infusion. Serum
   bactericidal activity was determined by the broth microdilution method
   against 10 recent isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mean peak serum
   levels were as follows: gentamicin 10.4 mu g/ml, piperacillin 227.5 mu
   g/ml, ceftazidime 43.5 mu g/ml, imipenem 17.3 mu g/ml, aztreonam 42.3 mu
   g/ml, and ciprofloxacin 3.9 mu g/ml. All agents demonstrated effective
   serum bactericidal activity (geometric mean titer >1:2) at peak serum
   levels. Ceftazidime was by far the most potent compound with a mean
   titer of 1:46.5, followed by ciprofloxacin (1:17), imipenem (1:13.7),
   and aztreonam (1:13.4). Ceftazidime also showed the longest duration of
   activity with a mean titer of 1:5.1 at 4 h. Based on our results,
   ceftazidime appeared to be the most potent antipseudomonal agent, while
   gentamicin and piperacillin were the least effective.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Rapoport's concept of choice and game theory was used in
   order to understand the trade-offs home buyers make when choosing an
   affordable house. Cost is a constraint on a home buyer's choices. When
   people have constraints on their choices, what is most critical is what
   they eliminate and in what order. The attributes eliminated first are
   the least important to buyers; the attributes that are present in all
   new houses, including the least expensive, are the most important. Fifty
   model houses featured in The Milwaukee Journal over an eighteen-month
   period were analyzed. The objective was to learn how the more expensive
   houses differ from the less expensive houses. Size is the most important
   predictor of cost but even the least expensive houses are like all the
   others in that they have three bedrooms, one larger than the other two;
   two bathrooms, one with a special relationship to the bigger bedroom;
   two separate eating areas and a two-car garage. They are unlike the
   other houses in that they do not have a separate living room and family
   room, a fireplace, dormers and bay windows, natural materials on the
   exterior, elaborate plumbing fixtures such as a whirlpool bath, and
   extra storage space in the garage. These findings have significance for
   the planning and design of affordable housing because they indicate what

   gathered by their Dynix Library System. The project aimed to produce a
   simple analysis of the use of new acquisitions which would utilize the
   management information existing in the library's automated system and
   set out to achieve 2 aims: to analyze the use made of each book acquired
   in order to determine the proportion of each subject area's new
   acquisitions which circulated in the first full year of shelf life and
   the number of loans per item in each subject area; and to compare the
   library's acquisitions with statistics produced by Loughborough
   University's Library and Information Statistics Unit (LISU). Concludes
   that the data derived from these circulation activity reports can prove
   valuable in collection evaluation, enabling the library to identify high
   and low performing subject areas and examine budget allocations. The
   limitations of this technique, identified in the study, could be easily

Abstract = {{We have studied the effects of phorbol 12,13-diacetate (PDA) and its
   influence on a variety of spasmogenic responses in trachea isolated from
   normal and sensitized guinea-pigs.
   Tracheal preparations were denuded of epithelium, treated with
   indomethacin (2.8 mu M), and cooled to 20 degrees C. In these
   experimental conditions, tracheal strips contracted to PDA (0.1 nM-1 mu
   M). Contractions to PDA (1 mu M) were greater in sensitized tissues. In
   normal trachea, contractions to PDA (0.1 mu M) were depressed by H-7,
   1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazube, (50 mu M), amiloride
   (10 mu M), verapamil (10 mu M) and Ca2+-free exposure. Similar effects
   were obtained in sensitized trachea except that PDA-induced contraction
   was resistant to verapamil and Ca2+-free exposure.
   Cooling (20 degrees C) of normal trachea substantially depressed the
   response to CaCl2 (in K+-depolarized tissues), KCl, histamine and
   5-hydroxytryptamine without affecting the spasm induced by
   acetylcholine. This inhibitory effect of cooling was not observed in
   sensitized trachea. PDA. (0.1 mu M) did not affect spasmogenic responses
   at 37 degrees C but counteracted the inhibitory effect of cooling in
   normal trachea. PDA had no effect on sensitized tissues. PDA (0.1-1 mu
   M) did not alter Ca2+-induced contraction of skinned normal and
   sensitized trachea.
   These results support the hypothesis that intracellularly stored Ca2+
   plays an important role in the activation of sensitized tracheal muscle.}},

Abstract = {{It was previously shown that CD26 (DPP IV, EC 3.4.14.5) is a binding
   site for adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) on T cells and that
   costimulation by some anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and
   anti-CD3 induces CD4(+) T cell proliferation, The CD26 epitopes involved
   in costimulation, the precise sequence of the events preceding
   proliferation, and the response of CD8(+) compared with CD4(+) T cells
   to CD26 were not extensively studied, We therefore compared the effects
   of the novel TA5.9 anti-CD26 mAb, recognizing an ADA-binding epitope,
   and the clearly distinct anti-Ta1 reference anti-CD26 mAb for their
   costimulatory properties in various T cell subsets, Both purified CD4(+)
   and CD8(+) T cells proliferated upon costimulation with anti-CD3 and
   either anti-CD26 mAb, but anti-TA5.9 mAb induced a more potent response
   than anti-Ta1. Either anti-CD26 mAb, together with anti-CD3, caused a
   similar sequential up-regulation of CD69, CD25 (IL-2R alpha), and CD71
   (transferrin receptor) expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, The
   activation markers appeared faster on the CD45R0(+) than on the
   CD45R0(-) subsets, After costimulation, CD4(+) T cell cultures contained
   significant amounts of the Th1 cytokines IL-2, interferon-gamma
   (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In CD8(+) T
   cell cultures relatively more IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha but almost no IL-2
   was measured after triggering of CD3 and CD26, Our data demonstrate that
   the recognition of the ADA-binding epitope is not a prerequisite for the
   costimulatory capacity of anti-CDZ6 mAbs, Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells
   and their CD45R0(-) and CD45R0(+) subsets are sensitive to various
   aspects of activation via CD26, but the magnitude and/or kinetics differ
   according to the anti-CD26 used and the T cell subset studied.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts in feeding habits are expected to occur during adaptation to cave
   life. Dolichopoda cave crickets inhabit both natural and artificial
   caves showing differences in population size, fecundity, phenology and
   age structure. Compared to artificial caves, typically holding a
   seasonal age structure, populations from natural caves maintain a
   constantly heterogeneous age structure. Faecal content analysis of 605
   individuals from 24 natural and artificial cave populations, enabled us
   to characterize their trophic niche and to investigate its variation.
   The results of multivariate analyses and measures of niche breadth and
   niche overlap outlined differences in trophic resource exploitation
   between natural and artificial cave populations. Seasonal variation in
   diet occurred in both types of caves, and it was greater in artificial
   cave populations. However, within any season, differences in feeding
   habits between individuals were much greater in natural caves resulting
   in a wider heterogeneity in trophic resources exploitation. Such
   heterogeneity appears to be mainly due to differences in diet between
   individuals of different developmental stages. In fact, in a sample of
   15 populations we found a positive, statistical significant correlation
   between niche breadth and heterogeneity in age structure. These data are
   discussed in a broader evolutionary context in order to understand the
   role of limited resources availability in shaping and maintaining
   heterogeneity in age structure of Dolichopoda populations.}},

Abstract = {{We present the layout and technical details of a trace gas monitor based
   on photothermal deflection. The operating principle of this instrument,
   i.e., the deflection of a (weak) probe laser beam by the thermal
   refractive index gradient induced by trace gas absorption of an intense
   pump laser beam, allows nonintrusive measurements with good space and
   time resolution. An intra-cavity CO2 laser is used as the pump beam and
   a red HeNe laser as the probe. The latter runs perpendicular to the pump
   beam to optimize spatial resolution. To increase sensitivity, the probe
   laser is incorporated in a multipass setup. The instrument is
   demonstrated by the localization of ethylene emission sites on a cherry
   tomato and by monitoring ammonia production due to nitrogen fixation by
   cyanobacteria. Both C2H4 and NH3 can be detected at the 1-3 ppb level,
   at a spatial resolution of 2 mm (along the pump laser)X0.6 mm
   (perpendicular to it), and a response time of 0.1 s (without background
   correction) or 15 s (including background correction). Sensitivity can
   be increased at the expense of spatial resolution, and vice versa. In
   principle, this instrument is applicable to all those gases possessing a
   characteristic (''fingerprint'') spectrum in the CO2 laser range. The
   great advantage of the photothermal deflection technique with respect to
   other trace gas detection schemes lies in the nonintrusive character of
   the measurements. There is no need to enclose the sample in a vessel or
   to suck large volumes of air into the detector; measurements can be
   performed in open air and in real time. This should prove especially
   useful where sticky (polar) gases, like H2O, NH3, CH3OH, etc., are to be
   detected quantitatively. Main applications include air quality

Abstract = {{Interest in the isolation and characterization of primitive hemopoietic
   cells in both the clinical and research fields has rapidly increased, In
   parallel, different purification systems have been developed to isolate
   these cells.
   We have compared five different methods for separation of CD34(+) cells
   from human umbilical cord blood, normal bone marrow and apheresis
   harvests and analyzed purity, recovery, yield and enrichment of colony
   forming cells (CFC) for each individual system.
   Our results indicate that the most reliable methods of purification for
   all samples were fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic
   activated cell sorting (MACS) which consistently yielded high purities
   (>70\%) and enrichment of CFC. In this respect the enrichment of CFC
   from the MACS was superior to all the other systems including FAGS,
   Similar results (>70\%) for purity mere obtained using avidin affinity
   columns and a biotinylated antibody but neither yield nor CFC enrichment
   approached the values achieved with MACS. On average CFC enrichment
   using these affinity columns mas greater than that observed for FAGS
   while the purity mas comparable.
   Both CELLector flasks and immunomagnetic beads coated with CD34
   antibodies were less effective in our hands in separating purified
   populations of progenitor cells. Both purity and CFC enrichment of
   CD34(+) cells using these methods were at least 50\% lower than obtained
   with either FACS, MACS or affinity columns.}},

Abstract = {{The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria
   offers certain advantages over other bioluminescence systems because no
   exogenously added substrate or co-factors are necessary, and
   fluorescence can be elicited by irradiation with blue light without
   exposing the cells producing GFP to invasive treatments. A mycobacterial
   shuttle-plasmid vector carrying gfp cDNA was constructed and used to
   generate transcriptional fusions with promoters of interest and to
   examine their expression in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium
   bovis BCG grown in macrophages or on laboratory media. The promoters
   stud led were: (i) ahpCfrom Mycoosis and Mycobacterium leprae, a gene
   encoding alkyl hydroperoxide reductase which, along with the divergently
   transcribed regulator oxyR, are homologues of corresponding
   stress-response systems in enteric bacteria and play a role in isoniazid
   sensitivity; (ii) mtrA, an M. tuberculosis response regulator belonging
   to the superfamily of bacterial two-component signal-transduction
   systems; (iii) hsp60 a previously characterized heat-shock gene from M.
   bovis; and (iv) tbprc3, a newly isolated promoter from M. tuberculosis.
   Expression of these promoters in mycobacteria was analysed using
   epifluorescence microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy,
   fluorescence spectroscopy, and flow cytometry. These approaches
   permitted assessment of fluorescence prior to and after macrophage
   infection, and analyses of promoter expression in individual
   mycobacteria and its distribution within populations of bacterial cells.
   Bacteria expressing GFP from a strong promoter could be separated by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cells harbouring the vector
   used to construct the fusion. In addition, the stable expression of
   mtrA-gfp fusion in M. bovis BCG facilitated localization and isolation
   of phagocytic vesicles containing mycobacteria. The experiments
   presented here suggest that GFP will be a useful tool for analysis of
   mycobacterial gene expression and a convenient cell biology marker to
   study mycobacterial interactions with macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics and mechanism of the thermal reduction of NO by H-2 have
   been investigated by FTIR spectrometry in the temperature range of 900
   to 1225 K at a constant pressure of 700 torr using mixtures of varying
   NO/H-2 ratios. In about half of our experimental runs, CO was introduced
   to capture the OH radical formed in the system with the well-known, fast
   reaction, OH + CO --> H + CO2. The rates of NO decay and CO2 formation
   were kinetically modeled to extract the rate constant for the
   rate-controlling step, (2) HNO + NO --> N2O + OH. Combining the modeled
   values with those from the computer simulation of earlier kinetic data
   reported by Hinshelwood and co-workers (refs. {[}3] and {[}4]), Craven
   (ref. {[}5]), and Kaufman and Decker (ref {[}6]) gives rise to the
   following expression:
   K-2 = 10(12.93) (+/-) (0.13) exp{[}-(14,890 +/- 360)/T] cm(3) mol(-1)
   s(-1).
   This encompasses 45 data points and covers the temperature range of 900
   to 1425 K. RRKM calculations based on the latest ab initio MO results
   indicate that the reaction is controlled by the addition/stabilization
   processes forming the HN(O)NO intermediate at low temperatures and by
   the addition/isomerization/decomposition processes producing N2O + OH
   above 900 K. The calculated value of k(2) agrees satisfactorily with the

Abstract = {{Purpose. To examine the existence of novel protein products of the human
   lacrimal gland.
   Methods. cDNA clones corresponding to a highly abundant human lacrimal
   gland mRNA were isolated and sequenced. Tissue distribution of
   expression was studied by Northern blot analysis, RNase protection
   analysis, and in situ hybridization.
   Results. A highly abundant 600-base mRNA was identified, and
   corresponding cDNA clones were isolated. The mRNA has a 134-residue open
   reading frame encoding a secreted protein of 13458 Da. This protein
   shows 45.5\% similarity to human salivary acidic proline-rich protein
   PRP 1 and has a similar domain structure, but, unlike other members of
   the proline-rich protein family, it lacks a conserved repetitive domain.
   The lacrimal proline-rich protein is encoded by a single gene,
   designated as LPRP. Expression of LPRP was also detected in the human
   submandibular, von Ebners, sublingual, and parotid glands. LPRP was
   expressed in the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland, and in the
   submandibular gland expression of the LPRP and PRP 1 genes was localized
   to the serous acini and demilunes.
   Conclusions. The human lacrimal gland produces a previously unknown
   member of the proline-rich protein family. By analogy with other
   proline-rich proteins, this LPRP most likely mediates protective
   functions in the eye, such as modulation of the microflora, in contrast
   to other proline-rich protein genes, LPRP is expressed in the lacrimal
   acinar cells, and other anterior exocrine glands. LPRP should be a
   useful marker for human lacrimal gland acinar cell function in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine if the detection
   by Doppler sonography of blood flow in portal vein thrombi occurring in
   patients with cirrhosis could be used to distinguish benign from
   malignant portal vein thrombi.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Color and duplex Doppler sonographic examinations
   were performed in 47 patients with proven cirrhosis and portal vein
   thrombi, The examinations were directed at the detection of continuous
   or pulsatile flow within the portal vein thrombi. The nature of the
   portal vein thrombi was proven histologically in 27 patients and by CT
   findings and clinical history in 20 patients. The frequency, type, and
   direction of portal vein thrombus flow was evaluated to determine if
   there was any correlation with the benign or malignant nature of the
   portal vein thrombi.
   RESULTS. Of the 47 patients, 26 had malignant portal Vein thrombi and 21
   had benign portal vein thrombi, Blood flow was detected in 22 of the
   malignant and in 15 of the benign portal vein thrombi, The blood flow
   was pulsatile in 16 malignant and three benign portal vein thrombi and
   continuous in six malignant and 12 benign portal vein thrombi. The
   direction of the pulsatile flow in the malignant portal vein thrombi was
   predominantly (13/16) hepatofugal. All continuous flow in both benign
   and malignant portal vein thrombi was hepatopetal. The detection of
   pulsatile flow in portal vein thrombi yielded a 62\% sensitivity and
   95\% specificity for the diagnosis of malignant portal vein thrombus.
   CONCLUSION. The detection by Doppler sonography of pulsatile flow in
   portal vein thrombi occurring in patients with cirrhosis is a moderately
   sensitive but highly specific sign for the diagnosis of malignant portal
   vein thrombus. However, continuous flow can be detected in benign and
   malignant portal vein thrombus and is thus not useful in differentiating
   between the two.}},

Abstract = {{Paralysed muscle, or skeletal muscle which is to be used for cardiac
   assistance, may be given an artificial function if it is electrically
   stimulated to contract and the response can be adequately controlled. To
   design a controller, a model of the muscle or system is usually
   required. The most commonly used models are analogues, originating from
   A.V. Hill's model. However muscles exhibit many nonlinear and
   time-varying phenomena which, if they are to be modelled, make the
   analogue complex and cumbrous to work with. The system may further be
   complicated by pathological changes and secondary effects of
   stimulation. We propose that such a system can be modelled by nonlinear
   networks ('neural networks'). The radial basis function network (RBF)
   has two advantages over the better-known multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
   We describe the use of an RBF network to model rabbit muscle that is
   supramaximally stimulated at irregular interpulse intervals.}},

Abstract = {{An aquatic 24-hour lethality test using Caenorhabditis elegans was used
   to assess toxicity of glucosinolates and their enzymatic breakdown
   products. In the absence of the enzyme thioglucosidase (myrosinase),
   allyl glucosinolate (sinigrin) was found to be nontoxic at all
   concentrations tested, while a freeze-dried, dialyzed water extract of
   Crambe abyssinica containing 26\% 2-hydroxyl 3-butenyl glucosinolate
   (epi-progoitrin) had a 50\% lethal concentration (LC(50)) of 18.5
   g/liter. Addition of the enzyme increased the toxicity (LC(50) value) of
   sinigrin to 0.5 g/liter, but the enzyme had no effect on the toxicity of
   the C. abyssinica extract. Allyl isothiocyanate and allyl cyanide, two
   possible breakdown products of sinigrin, had an LC(50) value of 0.04
   g/liter and approximately 3 g/liter, respectively. Liquid
   chromatographic studies showed that a portion of the sinigrin decomposed
   into allyl isothiocanate. The results indicated that allyl
   isothiocyanate is nearly three orders of magnitude more toxic to C.
   elegans than the corresponding glucosinolate, suggesting isothiocyanate
   formation would improve nematode control from application of
   glucosinolates.}},

Abstract = {{The HLA-B47,DR7 haplotype in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to
   21-hydroxylase deficiency contains a deletion of most of the active
   CYP21 gene and the entire adjacent C4B gene. The C4A gene produces a
   protein which is electrophoretically C4A but anti-genically C4B. In the
   Old Order Amish, the HLA-B47,DR7 haplotype contains no deletion, but is
   immunologically identical to the CAH haplotype in both areas flanking
   the crossover region. We compared some of the genes in the MHC Class II
   and Class III regions in the Amish and CAH-linked haplotypes to define
   further the relationships between the two. The complement factor B (Bf)
   proteins differed, but no Bf RFLPs were identified, The complement
   factor 2 genes exhibited different BamHI RFLPs. Analyses of the tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha genes revealed the same NcoI restriction patterns.
   The RD genes contained microsatellites of the same size. Portions of the
   MHC Class II DR and DQ, and Class III CYP21 and C4 alleles were
   sequenced. The exon 2 sequences of DQ2 and DR7 were identical in the two
   haplotypes. In the Amish haplotype, both CYP21 and C4 gene pairs were
   present and functionally normal. The CAH haplotype had two sequence
   crossovers: from CYP21P to CYP21 in the 7th intron, and from C4A to C4B
   between codons 1106 (exon 26) and 1157 (exon 28). A model is proposed
   which accounts for the CAH-linked mutant haplotype arising from a
   nonmutant homologue via three crossings-over.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to describe a phenomenon of bidirectional
   flow, `'bicolor portal vein'' (BPV), within the right anterior branch of
   the portal vein (RAPV), with color Doppler imaging (CDI). We
   prospectively studied with CDI the intrahepatic portal vein and its
   branches in 316 consecutive patients in search of areas of nonlaminar
   now within the RAPV. Forty patients were excluded from the study due to
   varied conditions that precluded an accurate CDI study. A prospective
   design allowed us to record the frequency of appearance, systematically
   measure a set of parameters in each patient, and establish different
   groups for comparison.
   We found an area of BPV within the RAPV in six patients. Five of them
   had a history of liver disease (8.2\% of the patients with known liver
   disease). The BPV was consistently portrayed as a well-defined blue
   oval-shaped area of flow reversal attached to the medial side of the
   RAPV immediately before its bifurcation, suggesting a rotary motion of
   blood. All six patients presented a transverse diameter of the RAPV
   significantly larger than the rest of the patients (p < 0.05).
   Furthermore, blood flow measurements within the RAPV of the six patients
   with BPV were found to be significantly higher when compared with the
   rest of the patients (<0.05).
   Knowledge of the possible presence of a BPV within the RAPV can prevent
   diagnostic confusion with reversal of flow, a truly pathologic condition
   related to liver disease. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Young people who do nor go ro college after high school face much higher
   unemployment rates than adults, and their failure ro find satisfactory
   employment may impede the growth of self-esteem at a crucial
   developmental stage. The effect of unemployment was studied in a
   subsample from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth whose
   self-esteem was measured in 1980 while still in school and again in
   1987. Unemployment and unsatisfactory employment in 1987 were both
   negatively related to self-esteem in 1987. All groups showed increases
   in self-esteem between interviews, but those satisfactorily employed
   gained most. In a different analysis, the percentage of time unemployed
   since leaving school was also negatively related to self-esteem.
   Although percentage of time unemployed did not add any explanatory power
   to the prediction of 1987 self-esteem by 1987 unemployment, it may
   operate indirectly on self-esteem via 1987 employment status.}},

Abstract = {{A method is proposed to stabilize an intrinsic fiber optic Fabry-Perot
   interferometric sensor embedded in a solid material for the purpose of
   detecting ultrasound. Without stabilization the interferometer drifts
   out of quadrature due to the presence of low-frequency dynamic strains.
   Stabilization is achieved by using active homodyne stabilization which
   tunes the laser frequency to maintain quadrature. A control loop shifts
   the laser frequency by 10 GHz at rates less than 25 Hz in order to
   compensate for induced drifts. The stabilization procedure was tested
   for a sensor embedded in an epoxy plate. Ultrasonic pulses, generated by
   a 5 MHz piezoelectric transducer, were detected with the embedded fiber
   sensor stabilized in the presence of applied low frequency strains.
   Improvements in sensitivity which result from stabilization are
   demonstrated. Additionally, a simulated acoustic emission signal,
   generated by a lead pencil break (Hsu-Neilson source), was detected with
   the sensor stabilized in the presence of dynamic strains.}},

Abstract = {{The reflex actions of medial gastrocnemius (MG) group I afferents on
   soleus motoneurons were examined in 20 normal subjects and 13 patients
   with well-defined chronic spinal cord lesions. In normal subjects,
   stimulation of the MG nerve with near-nerve electrodes at or below the
   threshold of the alpha motoneuron axons resulted in inhibition of the
   soleus H reflex at a condition-test interval of 6 msec. The central
   delay was estimated to be 2.5 msec. This inhibition was attributed to Ib
   afferents. We found that this inhibition was present in patients with
   spinal cord lesions. This contrasts with previous reports that
   stimulation of MG afferents facilitates the soleus H reflex in
   hemiplegic limbs, and it may represent a physiologic difference between
   cerebral and spinal spasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Attention to intracultural diversity in anthropological research has
   increased, but the implications of that diversity for research design
   and data analysis in medical anthropology have not proceeded as far. An
   examination of diversity and its use in guiding data analyses is given
   here, based on the study of blood pressure and its social and
   psychological correlates. It is argued that in the specific ethnographic
   setting of a small West Indian town, social class structures the
   diversity of the meanings of beliefs and behaviors. Diversity of
   meanings, in turn, alters the associations of those beliefs and
   behaviors with blood pressure. Data analyses guided by this orientation
   demonstrate that the social patterning of blood pressure varies between
   and within social class. Specifically, it is shown that one model of
   social and psychological influences on blood pressure applies only to
   middle-class persons in a small Jamaican community and not to
   lower-class persons. Medical anthropologists need to be more sensitive
   to the range of intracultural diversity and to how that diversity can
   influence the results of research.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study we summarize the clinical, serological and genetic
   peculiarities of Greek rheumatoid patients. Initially we demonstrated
   that Greek RA patients have a high frequency of Ro(SSA) antibodies in
   their sera and that these patients present a high incidence of
   D-penicillamine (DP) side effects. In addition, we showed that these
   patients were predominantly female and had an increased incidence of
   positive salivary gland biopsy, compatible with Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
   Subsequently, longitudinal studies showed that this subgroup of Ro(SSA)
   positive RA patients present erosive arthritis in a similar frequency
   compared to Ro(SSA) negative patients. In addition, we evaluated the
   prevalence of secondary SS in RA patients. We found that secondary SS
   was common (31\%), benign, subclinical and required specific tests for
   its diagnosis. To answer the question regarding the existence of
   additional markers of DP toxicity (other than Ro(SSA) antibodies) in RA
   patients, we found that in addition to Ro(SSA) antibodies, circulating
   cryoglobulins were associated with DP side effects.
   All of these observations prompted us to compare the clinical,
   serological and radiological expression of RA in Greek and British
   patients. We found that Greek patients had less inflammatory articular
   disease, fewer extra-articular manifestations, less radiological joint
   destruction, and a high frequency of Ro(SSA) antibodies linked to a
   higher prevalence of secondary SS. Furthermore, a study from our group
   showed a lack of association of RA. with HLA antigens, and only a weak
   association with HLA-DR1 and DR4 antigens.
   To clarify, the clinical, serological and genetic differences between RA
   in Greece and that in other European countries, we examined HLA class II
   DNA polymorphisms in 92 adult creek RA patients and compared them with
   those of 84 healthy ethnically matched control individuals. We showed
   that RA in Greece is associated with the same HLA-DR beta alleles which
   confer susceptibility in northern European caucasoids. However, whereas
   83\% of northern European patients carry the HLA-DR beta motif; this was
   found in 43.5\% of Greek patients.
   In addition, we investigated whether HLA-DR4 is a marker of disease
   severity in Greek RA patients. There was no difference between the DR4+
   and DR4- patients with respect to disease duration, severity of
   arthritis, and the functional and anatomical joint scores. There was no
   statistical difference in the clinical manifestations among patients
   with different HLA-DR4 subtypes. The same was also true when the
   clinical picture was correlated with the `'shared RA epitope''.
   Finally, we investigated the prevalence of antikeratin antibodies (AKA)
   in our RA population. 16\% of the patients had positive AKA antibodies
   These antibodies were correlated with the presence of RF and HLA-DR1
   antigen.
   We conclude that RA in Greece differs on clinical, serological and
   genetic grounds compared to RA in northern European countries.
   Multicenter European studies may provide valuable information regarding
   the differences observed among Greek and northern European RA.}},

Abstract = {{Separate montmorillonite suspensions were treated with CrCl3 to give
   seven Cr(III) concentrations. Each suspension was then titrated with 0.1
   N NaOH to give a NaOH/Cr3+ molar ratio of 2.5. Montmorillonite was an
   effective sorbent for hydroxy-Cr species up to 1200 cmol(+)/kg; above
   that concentration, sorption continued, though less efficiently.
   However, N-2-BET specific surfaces and cation exchange capacity
   measurements indicated that the montmorillonite could sorb significantly
   more than 1200 cmol(+)/kg. There was virtually no exchangeable Cr in any
   of the clays, suggesting that this element was covalently bonded to the
   siloxane surface. Infrared spectroscopy revealed a vibration at
   1015-1020 cm(-1) in the Cr clays which was not present in the control.
   This new absorption band was attributed to an attenuation of the Si-O
   a(1)(1) vibration caused by inner-sphere complexation of the interlayer
   Cr with the siloxane oxygen. Because Cr was strongly held and
   efficiently sorbed, montmorillonite was shown to be an effective sorbent

Abstract = {{In the teleost fish, physiological and biochemical studies suggest that
   glucocorticoids regulate both salt balance and metabolic activities. In
   mammals, however, these functions are divided between glucocorticoids
   and mineralocorticoids. In mammals, separate receptors for these two
   classes of steroid hormone have been cloned and sequenced. To begin to
   understand the regulation in fish of the vital processes ascribed to
   glucocorticoids, we have cloned, sequenced, expressed, and studied the
   steroid-binding and transcriptional activation capabilities of the
   rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) glucocorticoid receptor. Northern
   blot analysis shows a single rainbow trout GR messenger RNA species of
   7.5 kilobases expressed in gill, intestine, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
   liver. The trout GR 2274-nucleotide coding sequence provides for a
   protein of 758 amino acids, with appropriate similarities to mammalian
   GR, with one striking exception. As in other members of the
   steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor family, the DNA-binding domain
   contains two putative zinc fingers. These have high homology with those
   of other GRs. However, between the zinc fingers in the trout GR are
   found 9 more amino acids than are seen in mammalian GRs, raising
   questions as to the functional form of the fish, as opposed to the
   mammalian, GR. It has been proposed that as fish appear to use
   glucocorticoids for both metabolic and salt control, presumably through
   a single GR, GR would prove to be the evolutionary precursor to
   mammalian GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Computer analysis of
   the known sequences of GRs and MRs, however, suggests that the fish GR
   did not give rise to the MR of higher animals, but that both subfamilies
   of receptor arose from some earlier gene.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that to ensure competitive advantage considerable
   effort must be directed at effective Design Coordination (DC) in order
   to achieve optimal product development performance and productivity. The
   DC Framework is presented as the basis upon which to realise this aim by
   providing support to particular aspects of product development namely
   Concurrent Engineering, Decision Support, Design Management, Product
   Management, and Team Engineering. It is suggested that tools/means such
   as DC should be evaluated upon identified requirements to ensure that
   they are capable of meeting the business as well as technical needs of
   the enterprise. From such an evaluation, it is concluded that
   Coordinated Engineering, and in particular Design Coordination within
   engineering design, is the means to achieve effective product
   development.}},

Abstract = {{A purified polyclonal antibody preparation was made against recombinant
   human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in guinea pig and
   characterized for use in immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. The
   anti-BDNF antibodies specifically recognized BDNF in Western blots and
   immunoprecipitation. There was no crossreactivity with the other known
   mammalian members of the neurotrophin family, nerve growth factor,
   neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4/5. In immunohistochemical analysis,
   the anti-BDNF recognized exogenous BDNF injected into the brain of rats,
   whereas no signal was obtained with the other neurotrophins.
   Preabsorption with native BDNF abolished the immunoreactivity in brain
   sections. These studies identify the anti-BDNF as a tool for
   immunocytochemistry and the development of an immunoassay.
   Immunohistochemical analysis revealed widespread neuronal localization
   of BDNF in many brain areas. BDNF was localized in ail subpopulations of
   hippocampal neurons. The distribution in the hippocampus suggests
   localization in the cytoplasm of cell bodies and dendrites.}},

Abstract = {{We present an exact diagonalization study of bilayer clusters of the t-J
   model. Our results indicate a crossover between two markedly different
   regimes which occurs when the ratio J(perpendicular to)/J between
   interlayer and intralayer exchange constants increases: for small
   J(perpendicular to)/J the data suggest the development of
   three-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations without appreciable
   degradation of the intralayer spin order and the d(x2-y2) hole pairs
   within the planes persist. For larger values of J(perpendicular to)/J
   local singlets along the interlayer bonds dominate, leading to an almost
   complete suppression of the intralayer spin correlation and the breaking
   of the intralayer hole pairs. The ground state with two holes in this
   regime has s-like symmetry. We present data for static spin correlation
   function, magnetic structure factor and spin gap. We calculate the
   momentum distribution and electronic spectral function of the `'local
   singlet state'' realized for large J(perpendicular to)/J, and show that
   it deviates markedly from that of a single layer, making it an
   implausible candidate for modeling high-temperature superconductors.}},

Abstract = {{Silver and sodium have qualitatively different diffraction-determined
   ionic distributions in the conduction planes of a beta-alumina host.
   That this can imply different conduction mechanisms in the two cases is
   probed by partially exchanging Cd2+ ions into both compounds, and
   measuring the resulting mixed-ion distributions. The systems
   Ag1.22-yCdy/2Al11O17.11 (for y = 0, 0.10, 0.41 and 1.11) and
   Na1.22-yCdy/2Al11O17.11 for (y = 0, 0.22, 0.45 and 1.22) were
   investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The problematical use
   of diffraction techniques for highly disordered systems of this type is
   discussed; it is also shown how some of these difficulties can be
   reduced through access to additional physical and chemical information.
   Qualitatively different mechanisms are deduced in the two cases,
   suggesting that aliovalent substitution can indeed be a useful general
   tool in studying ionic conduction mechanisms in crystalline systems.}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal mastitis is an uncommon infection. Twenty-one neonates with

   and the other half with breast abscess. The most common pathogen was
   Staphylococcus aureus, which was isolated in 85\% of cases. Antibiotic
   therapy was the initial treatment in all cases except one, and included
   i.v, orbenin or augmentin. Puncture of six breast abscesses followed the
   initial antibiotic course, and another five abscesses were treated
   surgically by incision and drainage. About half the neonates (10 of 21)
   recovered after antibiotic treatment alone, indicating that aggressive
   antibiotic therapy is effective in about 50\% of cases and, if started
   immediately upon diagnosis, no additional surgical treatment is
   necessary. When an abscess was formed, needle aspiration was as
   effective as incision and drainage.}},

   resulting similarity diagrams show some differences, which were compared
   with the results from tests in which human subjects were asked to
   organized line-region relations into groups of similar relations. The

Abstract = {{The gibbon ape leukemia viruses (GaLVs) are primate-derived C-type
   retroviruses with a broad host range. Using an infectious, full-length
   clone of the GaLV SEATO strain, we have determined that this virus
   replicates efficiently in 13 of 17 human cell lines tested. In fact, the
   SB lymphoblast cell line, while resistant to infection by wild-type
   amphotropic mouse leukemia virus (A-MLV), was infected by GaLV-SEATO. We
   constructed vectors containing GaLV components and compared the
   performance of genomes containing an enhancer and promoter derived
   either from the SEATO or SF strains of GaLV. The GaLV vector genomes
   were packaged in a Moloney (Mo)MLV core with either an A-MLV or GaLV
   SEATO envelope. We found that, in some cases, the vector genome appeared
   to be critical in obtaining optimal infection. For example, vectors with
   a GaLV SF-based genome infected the human HL60 cell line, whereas
   vectors with a GaLV SEATO-based genome did not We also found that most,
   but not all, of the human cell lines tested were more susceptible to
   vectors packaged with the GaLV SEATO than A-MLV envelope. The source of
   the viral core was also important, in that some human cells appeared
   susceptible to infection only with GaLV genomes packaged in particles
   composed of a GaLV core and envelope. Our results show that GaLV-based
   packageable genomes can be expressed in target cells not efficiently
   infected by vectors containing MoMLV-based genomes. These results
   suggest that judicious combinations of retroviral genomes and structural
   components can significantly improve gene transfer into human cells.}},

   satisfy the Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules. The model respects
   isospin symmetry and has zero strange sea polarization. Using new values
   for F/D from hyperon beta decay the resulting Q(2)-dependent asymmetries
   A(1) are in perfect agreement with the existing data. Therefore we do
   not see any evidence for a `'spin crisis.'' With two choices for g(2)
   the Q(2) dependence of A(1)(x, Q(2)) and A(2)(x,Q(2))root Q(2)/M is

   from the medical staff(low control). Results indicated that for the most
   severely ill patients, high control over treatment resulted in poorer

Abstract = {{A much simpler and mathematically more precise explanation for the
   concept of `'pseudorotation'' as well as the closely-related class of
   `'fluxional molecules'' is supplied by noting that there are only five
   regular polyhedra and by postulating that a static, stable orientation
   of a molecule with formula AB(n) can be achieved only by positioning the
   n like ligands at the vertices of one of these five polyhedra. In the
   absence of such `'libration points'' molecules will shift around their
   ligands in order to minimize intramolecular forces. This can be
   explained from a strictly geometric perspective-without the need for
   consideration of the shape of orbitals, etc. From this reinterpreted
   perspective, one may make the qualitative conclusion that the
   equilibrium which best approximates the desired equidistance between
   ligands in pseudorotation will be a dynamic, in contradistinction to a
   static, one; i.e., a fluxional one. Furthermore, the trigonal and
   pentagonal bipyramidal models that are traditionally used to describe
   molecules of coordination five and seven, respectively, are shown to be
   based on a bias toward modified octahedral orientation and that, for the
   case of hepta-coordination, better sets of libration points are
   predicted using the largest (in number of vertices) of the regular
   polyhedra (the dodecahedron). Additionally, a speculation about the
   quantitative nature of pseudorotation is supplied using `'Schaeffli''
   angles.}},

   alternative models of the K and L intermediates with retinal in either
   13-cis or 13-14-dicis configuration have been generated by molecular
   dynamics simulations. All models have been submitted to electrostatic
   calculations in order to determine the pK(1/2) values of particular
   residues of interest in the active site. Our pK(1/2) calculations for
   the refined ground state can reestablish our former results, this time
   without adjusting the intrinsic pK of the Schiff base. For the K
   intermediate the electrostatic calculations show no significant change
   in the pK(1/2) values compared to the ground state for most of the
   titrating groups in the active site. For the L intermediate where
   retinal possesses a 13-cis configuration, we found that electrostatic
   factors decrease the pK(1/2) value of the Schiff base by 4-5 pK-units
   compared to the ground state. The calculations suggest that changes of
   the electrostatic environment via a pure 13-cis model are sufficient to
   produce a pK reduction of the Schiff base that will promote subsequent

Abstract = {{Reading-disabled boys, reading- and age-matched controls, and adults
   searched letter arrays for the identity or location of a probe letter.
   Response time (RT) and accuracy were examined as a function of the
   temporal relation between probe and array letters (probe first,
   simultaneous, array first), and array size (1-5 letters). Although
   disabled readers closely resembled age controls in RT, their accuracy
   differed significantly when large letter arrays were tested. In the
   letter identification task, this was only evident when the array letters
   preceded the probe; in the letter location task, it occurred in all
   three probe conditions. Correlational analyses showed that all subjects
   were influenced by the visual, but not the phonological, similarity
   between letters. Thus, a reading-related impairment is evident in both
   letter identification and letter location processes, even when the
   phonological coding of letters has been minimized.}},

Abstract = {{A widespread hypothesis is that man-induced eutrophication, an increase
   in nitrogen and/or phosphorus rather than silicon, gives a competitive
   advantage to the non-silicon using flagellates against the silicon
   dependent diatoms. Some authors suggest that such a mechanism could
   explain the intensification of the Phaeocystis blooms observed in the
   last decades in the coastal zones of the North Sea.
   A mesocosm experiment aiming to investigate this mechanism was performed
   in two 3 m(3) mesocosms. Light climate, mixing regime and nutrient
   concentrations reproduced conditions in Dutch coastal waters. Silicon
   was added to ensure the development of a phytoplankton development
   without Si limitation. Massive blooms of the colony forming
   Prymnesiophycean Phaeocystis sp. developed in both mesocosms and
   outcompeted the diatom community. Nutrients were continuously added and
   no nutrient limitation occurred during the bloom development. After four
   weeks, the Phaeocystis bloom collapsed and diatoms reappeared in both
   tanks. The dominance of Phaeocystis in a non silicon-limited environment
   constitutes an original observation which is in contradiction with the
   conclusions of some previously published works.}},

Abstract = {{A high incidence of bacterial infections has been previously reported
   during interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment, mainly due to catheter-related
   infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been successfully used to
   decrease such infections. The goal of this study was to evaluate an
   alternative way to reduce catheter-related infections in IL-2-treated
   patients by the use of totally implanted catheters. A total of 74
   patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, referred to our
   institution to receive IL-2 from March 1989 to July 1991, were included
   in this prospective study. IL-2 was given on a 2-days-a-week schedule
   (24 x 10(6) IU m(-2) day(-1)) either alone (41 patients) or in
   association with interferon gamma (33 patients). All these patients were
   prospectively evaluated for fever, bacteremia and line-site infection.
   Seven patients (9.5\%) had one (2 patients) or more (5 patients)
   positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotics were
   used only in 5 patients, and the catheter had to be removed in only 2 of
   these patients. In the other patients, no further infection developed
   despite the lack of antibiotics. Moreover, 9 patients had positive blood
   cultures with Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.9\% of total number of blood
   cultures). In conclusion, a totally implanted catheter appears to reduce
   the incidence of infections in IL-2-treated patients, at least on a
   2-days-a-week schedule.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-1 (IL-1) modulates both autocrine and paracrine
   growth-stimulatory mechanisms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell
   proliferation. Recent studies show that blocking the interaction between
   IL-1 and its receptor may suppress this proliferation. Because suramin,
   a polysulfonated naphthylurea originally described as an
   antitrypanosomal agent, was found to inhibit the binding of several
   growth factors to their receptor, we tested its effect on AML progenitor
   proliferation. We first examined the effect of suramin on murine
   EL-4.6.1 cells that express type I IL-1 receptors and found that suramin
   inhibited the binding of IL-1 to its receptor. We then tested the effect
   of suramin on AML progenitors using bone marrow samples from 17 patients
   with AML. In all experiments, suramin inhibited AML blast proliferation
   in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 30 to 240 mu
   M. IL-1 beta (100 U/mL) partially reversed this inhibitory effect.
   Suramin also inhibited normal early and mature hematopoietic
   progenitors, as assessed by both the delta assay and the mixed colony
   culture assay; however, at the same concentration, suramin suppressed
   the colony growth of colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage
   (CFU-GM) by only 45\% compared with an 89\% suppression of AML
   progenitors. IL-1 beta did not negate this inhibitory effect, which
   suggests that another growth inhibitory mechanism might be operative.
   Our data suggest that suramin may inhibit AML progenitor proliferation
   by blocking the interaction of IL-1 and its receptor; therefore, further
   studies are warranted to evaluate suramin's therapeutic potential in
   patients with AML.}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution study of the lower Opalinum Clay (Aalenian, Middle
   Jurassic) of northern Switzerland revealed a pattern of macrobenthic
   diversity and abundance which does not conform with the
   dysaerobic-biofacies models currently in use. The upper dysoxic zone
   contains an association of moderate diversity and moderate abundance
   which, with increasing oxygen depletion, is replaced by an association
   dominated by a few peak opportunists (tiny epibenthic bivalves and
   presumably small annelids) at high abundances but very low diversity. In
   the lower dysoxic zone, abundance drops to very low levels, but
   diversity rises again to guile high values. The rather high diversity of
   the lower dysaerobic biofacies is explained in part by the presence of
   specialized chemosymbiontic species. The pattern documented in the lower
   Opalinum Clay has been calibrated by sedimentologic, taphonomic,
   ichnologic, and microfaunal evidence. It contradicts equilibrium models,
   which postulate gradual or even linear decreases in both abundance and
   diversity with increasing oxygen-depletion of the bottom water. The
   equation of rising diversity with improved oxygenation can be misleading
   and can yield erroneous results in the reconstruction of ancient
   bottom-water oxygenation.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland plant communities in coastal Louisiana are degrading, resulting
   in the loss of live emergent vegetation and subsequent succession to
   open water. Saltwater intrusion has resulted from the construction of
   navigation canals through the marshes; the subsequent salinity increase
   is one of the potential sources of sublethal stress on plants.
   Greenhouse experiments were conducted on Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. to
   compare the usefulness of several indicators for the detection of
   salinity stress. CO2 uptake, leaf expansion, proline concentration and
   live aboveground biomass displayed significant responses to the salinity
   levels employed as treatments (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 ppt.). CO2 exchange
   was the only indicator showing a significant response within 7 days of
   the initiation of treatments (measurements were made at 7, 14 and 42
   days).}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative modification of LDL plays an important role in early
   atherogenesis but the mechanisms, nonenzymatic and/or enzymatic, by
   which LDL is oxidized in vivo remain to be established. Several lines of
   evidence suggest that cellular 15-lipoxygenase (arachidonate
   15-oxidoreductase, EC.1.13.11.13) (15-LO) may contribute to oxidative
   modification of LDL, including recent studies demonstrating that murine
   fibroblasts overexpressing 15-LO have an enhanced capacity to oxidize
   LDL in the medium. The present studies were undertaken to better
   understand the mechanisms by which cells expressing 15-LO bring about
   oxidative modification of LDL. LDL incubated 1-2 h with the
   15-LO-enriched cells showed a much higher lipoperoxide (LOOH) content
   than did LDL incubated with control cells. By far the largest absolute
   increase occurred in cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide (CE-OOH), a much
   lesser increase in free fatty acid hydroperoxides (FFA-OOH), and only a
   very small increase in phospholipid hydroperoxides (PL-OOH). Addition of
   EDTA to the medium abolished these increases in LDL lipid
   hydroperoxides. Enrichment of LDL with probucol or vitamin E also
   prevented CE-OOH accumulation. Incubation of LDL with linoleic acid
   hydroperoxide in the absence of cells also caused a significant increase
   in CE-OOH and this was markedly inhibited by EDTA.
   These findings provide further evidence for the potential of 15-LO to
   participate in LDL oxidation by way of a mechanism involving
   introduction of LOOH into the LDL particle followed by metal-catalyzed
   propagation.}},

   part. The flap is 4 cm wide and stretches toward the lower part of the
   parietal. After a week's delay, the flap is transplanted from the top of
   the head to the frontal part under general anesthesia. Light pressure is
   applied to the transferred flap with a tie-over dressing. With this
   technique the hair grows downward and covers both the front and top
   parts of the head. It is important to choose a case for which this type
   of procedure is appropriate. The authors' technique can be applied to

Abstract = {{The benefits of optimized in situ infrared measurements performed on
   single-crystal platinum electrodes are described in this paper. By using
   a hemispherical window both as a lens and as the IR-transparent wall of

   are achieved: low first-surface reflection losses, near-critical angle
   reflection, and beam collimation. In addition, the physical optics of
   this novel sampling attachment provide interactive tools for positioning
   the electrode in the cell via the evolving interferogram. Thus, both
   sensitivity and reproducibility are improved. The effects of poor
   optical throughput are demonstrated, and a measure of the expected merit
   for in situ reflection/absorption spectroscopy is presented. Examples
   are given of adsorption processes from sulfuric acid solutions and for
   the oxidation of glucose on both Pt(111) and Pt(100) electrode surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{An epidemiological survey of malaria was carried out from September 1992
   to November 1994 in three villages located in the Senegal river delta,
   two villages growing rice in irrigated fields and one practicing
   traditional rain water agriculture. Entomological observations showed
   that Anopheles pharoensis is the main anopheline species caught in the
   area with a high population density in the rice growing villages. The
   population density of species of the An. gambiae complex, represented by
   An. gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis and An. melas is low. Agressivity rates
   and anthropophlic indexes of An. pharoensis females are high but their
   parity rates are low. The malaria transmission is weak and was not
   perceptible in the area as shown by the negative results obtained with
   the ELISA tests and the examination of salivary glands.
   Parasitological indexes, malaria morbidity and incidence rates are low
   and are in agreement with the entomological data. In the Senegal river
   delta, irrigation has, on the whole, increased the An. pharoensis
   density but both malaria transmission and incidence rates did not rise.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the spectrum of radiologic findings in
   crutch-induced axillary artery injury and the effects of its unique
   pathophysiology on diagnostic evaluation and treatment.
   Methods: Three patients with axillary crutch-induced axillobrachial
   injury were studied angiographically acid percutaneous intervention was
   performed in two cases,
   Results: One patient required surgical bypass of a thrombosed axillary
   artery aneurysm. One patient responded to percutaneous transluminal
   angioplasty (PTA) of a focal axillary artery stenosis. One patient with
   an axillary artery aneurysm and distal thromboembolic disease was
   treated by both thrombolysis and surgical thromboembolectomy and later
   by PTA of an axillary artery intimal disruption.
   Conclusion: Chronic axillary crutch use may be associated with axillary
   artery stenosis, aneurysm formation, and secondary axillobrachial
   thromboembolic disease. Mural injury can be successfully treated by PTA
   and thromboembolic disease by thrombolytic therapy. Early identification
   of the axillary artery lesion is critical for long-term therapeutic

Abstract = {{We attempt to provide evidence that the projection from the guinea pig
   auditory cortex (AC) to the inferior colliculus (IC) may contain
   glutamatergic or GABAergic fibers. Seven days after unilateral AC
   aspiration, histological studies indicated almost complete AC
   destruction and preterminal degeneration of fibers and terminal fields
   in the dorsal cortex (DCIC), external cortex (ECIC), and central nucleus
   (CNIC) of the IC ipsilateral to the ablated AC. Contralaterally,
   degeneration appeared in the DCIC. AC ablation depressed the
   electrically evoked Ca2+-dependent release of D-{[}H-3]aspartate
   (D-{[}H-3]ASP) in the ipsilateral DCIC, ECIC, and CNIC, and D-{[}3H]Asp
   uptake in the CNIC, Together with other evidence that the
   corticocollicular pathway is excitatory, these findings suggest that
   this projection may contain glutamatergic and/or aspartatergic
   (Glu/Asp-ergic) fibers. Glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity was
   not apparent in presumed pyramidal cells of layer V of the AC
   retrogradely labeled with biotinylaled dextran injected into the
   ipsilateral IC. Thus, corticocollicular neurons probably do not
   synthesize GABA and may not be GABAergic. However, AC ablation depressed
   {[}C-14]GABA release from the ipsilateral DCIC and ECIC, and
   {[}C-14]GABA uptake in the DCIC. These findings are consistent with the
   atrophy or down-regulation of some subcortical neurons that mediate
   GABAergic transmission in the IC.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
   time-of-night (TOF) techniques in magnetic resonance (MR) angiography of
   renal arteries.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 46 patients, MR angiography was performed with
   3D tilted optimized nonsaturating excitation (TONE),3D fast imaging with
   steady precession (FISP), and 2D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) during
   breath holding. Intraarterial angiography was used as a reference. MR
   angiograms were evaluated for stenoses, length of renal arteries,
   accessory arteries, venous overlap, and image quality.
   RESULTS: The 3D TONE sequence was best for detection of severe stenoses
   (sensitivity, 100\%; specificity, 89\%), delineation of accessory
   arteries, and image quality. Overlap of renal veins was the most
   important disadvantage of 2D FLASH. Decreased saturation effects,
   however, can be advantageous in 2D TOF imaging.
   CONCLUSION: Use of the 3D TONE sequence provided improved image quality
   and diagnostic value compared with 3D FISP technique. The 2D TOF
   sequence can be useful in combination with the 3D TONE sequence.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, it was demonstrated that heat shock protein 70

   radiation (10.6 mu m). To further characterize the stress response after
   laser irradiation, the time course of synthesis and cellular
   localization of hsp70 has been followed. As it had been shown that laser
   irradiation elevated the temperature to about 67 +/- 2 degrees C, the
   authors also attempted to duplicate the response with high temperature
   elevation by dipping cells grown on plastic coverslips into media heated
   in a hot water bath to specified temperatures. Exposure to CO2 laser
   irradiation resulted in a time course and localization response similar
   to that reported for induction of hsp70 by elevated temperature (41-44
   degrees C). However, in contrast to the response to elevated
   temperature, only hsp70 was induced by laser irradiation. Short exposure
   (1-4 s) of cells medium heated to 58 degrees C produced a response
   similar to that obtained with CO2 laser irradiation suggesting that the
   CO2 laser irradiation effect on cells is produced by heating for short

Abstract = {{Although ion microprobes can be used as high power microscopes to select
   a special target site for further investigations, single ion experiments
   often require additional high magnification light microscopy of the
   target, because imaging by ions might spoil the effect to be
   investigated.
   Ideally, the light microscope should be coaxial with the microbeam with
   its objective lens as near as possible to the target. In the past there
   have been various techniques to circumvent this obvious impossibility.
   Some place the microscope objective slightly out of axis, some use
   mirrors, with or without holes far the beam, under 45 degrees to the
   target (or nearly so) and long working distance microscopes. And there
   was even one (D. Heck, Karlsruhe) using a mirror-microscope-objective,
   coaxial with the beam, with a central hole to let the beam pass.
   All these setups have suboptimal resolution, either because only part of
   the target is in focus or because of too long working distance or
   because part of the possible resolution is compromised by the central
   borehole (or because of all these reasons together).
   The best possible resolution is only possible with a high power
   objective near the target. We have therefore designed a microscope which
   flips onto and out of the beam axis with sub-mu m precision. To find the
   spot, where the beam will hit, we first image a test grid with the
   microprobe. Then we flip the light microscope onto the beam axis and
   identify the center of the SIM image with the corresponding point in the
   light microscopic image. This is the point, where the undeflected beam
   will hit.
   Similarly important is the reliable identification of a hit
   independently of target thickness, composition or topography. As any
   separate detector in front of the target would destroy the microfocus,
   the target itself is the only place where the beam can be allowed to
   interact. Moreover this interaction must deliver an effect for every hit
   and this effect must be detectable with 100\% efficiency. The only
   effect that fits to these requirements, is the emission of secondary
   electrons which are produced in large numbers and can be detected with
   high efficiency.
   This work reports about our light microscopic aiming system, about our
   (still not perfect) hit detector, and how various operating conditions
   influence the reliability of hit detection.}},

Abstract = {{A filter cartridge with a low air-flow resistance was designed for use
   on a modified half-face respirator worn during the application of
   alachlor (Lasso(R)) herbicide. The filter trapped large concentrations
   of alachlor while retaining the ability to trap, small respirable
   droplets. Moreover, alachlor could be recovered from the disassembled
   cartridge and analyzed by conventional methods.
   The test cartridges were used in combination with conventional personal
   air samlers to determine whether the filters trapped more alachlor when
   compared with personal samplers and to determine accurately, the amount
   of alachlor reaching the breathing zone. Farmers sprayed alachtor in the
   form of alachlor (N = 7) or alachlor mixed with other herbicides or
   surfactant (N = 15). An average of 4 X 10(-2) mg or 2 X 10(-4) mg/kg of
   applied alachlor reached the respirator filters. This concentration was
   10-fold higher than the alachlor recovered from the personal samplers.
   The new filter cartridge is better for determining the amount of
   alachlor reaching the breathing zone, and there is a low potential for
   significant inhalation exposure to alachlor during normal spraying
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in scanning, networking, compression and video technology-and
   the proliferation of multimedia computers-have led to the generation of
   large on-line collections of images and videos. These collections have
   created a need for new methods to locate specific images or video clips.
   The Query by Image Content (QBIC) project is studying methods to extend
   and complement text-based retrievals by querying and retrieving images
   and videos by content.
   Queries can be performed using attributes such as colors, textures,
   shapes, and object position. Video-specific queries include those on
   camera motion parameters like zoom, pan, and object motion.
   The project has resulted in a prototype system with two major steps:
   database population and query. In population, methods identify objects
   in still images, segment videos into short sequences called shots, and
   compute features describing color, texture, shape, position, or motion
   information. In database query, images and shots can be retrieved by
   example (''Show me images similar to this image'') or by selecting
   properties from pickers such as a color wheel, a sketched shape, a list
   of camera motions, or a combination of these.
   Key QBIC technical issues include a visual query language and a
   graphical user interface that lets users form a query by painting,
   sketching, or selecting graphical elements. Key also are indexing
   techniques for high-dimensional features describing image and video
   content, automatic segmentation techniques for images (to identify
   interesting objects), and videos (to identify shots and interesting
   moving and static objects), and similarity retrieval (to match human
   perception).
   QBIC technology has moved into the Ultimedia and Digital Library
   commercial IBM products.}},

Abstract = {{Many birds and other animals face conflicting priorities on leaving the

   withstand starvation in bad weather. Parents of such animals could hedge
   their bets by adopting a spoilt-brat strategy. This involves feeding the
   whole brood to some adequate but minimal level, and using any excess
   food to spoil one (or more) selected individuals. The corollary,
   runting, is already well established, but it has been widely assumed
   that the heaviest remaining chicks would be the fattest. Analysis of fat
   content in 372 European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) chicks at fledging
   showed great variation within broods, and the heaviest chicks were often
   not the fattest ones. This is evidence that the parents may be
   selectively spoiling an individual chick, not feeding at random or
   allowing the largest chick to dominate. The spoilt-brat strategy should
   be looked for in larger species which could carry more useful quantities
   of fat.}},

   crude oil. Energy of Material Resource (47.4 GJ/1000 kg) accounts for
   85\% of the total energy for the n-paraffins production, which is 55.6
   GJ/1000 kg. 91\% of this energy is supplied by crude oil. Fuel-related
   emissions account for 59\% of solid waste which is 12 kg in total for
   1000 kg of n-paraffins production. Emissions from the production and
   combustion of fuels account for most of the atmospheric emissions. In
   contrast, waterborne emissions arise in fairly similar amounts from both
   process and fuel-related sources. The raw material requirements for the
   production of 1000 kg n-olefins are 659 kg of crude oil and 537 kg of
   natural gas Process energy accounts for 33.6\% of the total energy for
   the n-olefins production, which is 88.4 GJ/1000 kg. Natural gas with
   58.4\% and crude oil with 35.5\% provide most of the energy
   requirements. Fuel-related emissions account for 84.9\% of the total
   solid waste, which is 59.9 kg/1000 kg of n-olefins production. Emissions
   from the production and combustion of fuels account for the majority of
   atmospheric emissions In contrast, the process accounts for most of the
   waterborne emissions. The raw material require ment for the production
   of 1000 kg of benzene is 1136 kg of crude oil. The Energy of Material
   Resource accounts for 80.1\% of the total energy for the benzene
   production, which is 62.3 GJ/1000 kg. 85.2\% of the total energy is
   provided by crude oil. Fuel-related emissions account for 70\% of the
   total solid waste, which is 15.6 kg/1000 kg of benzene production.
   Emissions form the production process of benzene account for most of the
   atmospheric and waterborne emissions. For ethylene, which is mainly
   produced from crude oil and natural gas, the Energy of Material Resource
   (56.3 GJ/1000 kg) represents 79\% of the total energy requirements for
   the product (70.9 GJ/1000 kg) and is provided by natural gas (44\%) and
   crude oil (56\%). Most of the atmospheric emissions arise from the
   production and consumption of fuels, although 40\% of the fossil carbon
   dioxide emissions are process-related 77\% of the solid waste is
   fuel-related. Most the waterborne waste arises from process emissions. A
   comparison of this study with a publication from the Association of
   Plastics Manufacturers in Europe shows close similarity with regards to
   energy and raw material use. For ethylene oxide, the Energy of Material
   Resource (45.3 GJ) accounts for 70\% of the total energy requirement and
   is mainly provided by crude oil (39\%) and natural gas (31\%). Most of
   the atmospheric emissions arise from the production and combustion of
   fuels brit 55\% of the total organics and 48\% of the carbon dioxide are
   process-related 87\% of the solid waste is fuel-related. The waterborne
   wastes are predominantly process-related.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous studies have shown that exogenous ATP induces cell growth
   inhibition in transformed mouse fibroblasts, 3T6 cells, whereas the
   growth of their nontransformed counterparts, Swiss 3T3 cells, is only
   slightly affected. In this study a similar selective, ATP-induced growth
   inhibition was found in Balb/c SV40-3T3 cells and in primary cultures of
   adenovirus-transformed murine fibroblasts. The inhibitory activity was
   found in the conditioned media of ATP-treated cultures. Several lines of
   evidence have shown that ectoprotein kinase (ecto-PK) plays a major role
   in the ATP-induced growth inhibition. (a) There is a good correlation
   between the activity of ecto-PK and the ability of ATP to induce cell
   growth inhibition. (b) The removal of the ecto-PK from the cell surface
   prevents the ATP-induced growth inhibition. (c) Addition of the removed
   enzyme to the cell culture reconstitutes the ability of ATP to induced
   growth inhibition. (d) Serum-containing, or serum-free, conditioned
   media from untreated cultures gain an inhibitory activity after their
   phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation of conditioned media from
   ATP-treated cultures results in the loss of the inhibitory activity. (e)
   Growth medium by itself does not inhibit cell proliferation after its
   phosphorylation. The findings described in d and e indicate, as well,
   that the ATP-induced growth inhibitor is produced by the cells. The
   putative inhibitor was found to be a protein, with an apparent molecular
   mass of 13 kDa. The selectivity of the inhibition for transformed cells
   is due to the higher level of ecto-PK in these cells, as well as to
   their higher susceptibility to the inhibitor, as compared with their
   nontransformed counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a spinning secant-ogive-cylinder-boattail projectile
   in the transonic regime in terms of aerodynamic drag has been analyzed
   numerically in this study. To obtain an accurate prediction of the
   spinning effect on individual drag components and total drag of a
   projectile for the shell design, the implicit, diagonalied, symmetric
   Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme, accompanied by a suitable
   grid, is employed to solve the thin-layer axisymmetric Navier-Stokes
   equations associated with the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. The
   computed results show that, in comparison with the non-spinning case, to
   increase the spin rate can result in increases in viscous drag and nose
   pressure drag, but can cause decreases in boattail drag and base drag.
   The variations of these drag components result in only a small (less
   than 5\%) increase in total drag; thus the performance of the transonic
   projectiles is found to be insensitive to the spin rate.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose Several reports have stated that the
   periventricular abnormalities found on T-2-weighted MRI or CT are
   associated with age and hypertension. However, there have been no
   reports on the effect of hypertension treatment on white matter
   abnormalities. We studied the association between cardiovascular risk
   factors and periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs) on T-2-weighted MRI
   and the differences between treated and untreated hypertensive subjects
   in the extent of PVHs.
   Methods The extent of PVH observed on 238 MRI scans was assessed
   retrospectively in 238 patients older than 40 years with the use of a
   five-point (0 to 4) classification scale. Hypertensive subjects were
   divided into two groups: patients receiving no or irregular treatment
   and patients receiving regular treatment for hypertension.
   Results Age, hypertension, treatment of hypertension, and multiple
   cerebral vascular lesions on MRI correlated significantly and
   independently with the extent of PVH. Sex and diabetes mellitus did not
   correlate with PVH. The Mann-Whitney U test showed significantly more
   extensive PVH in subjects with no or irregular treatment of hypertension
   compared with normotensives (2.5+/-0.7 versus 1.9+/-0.6, P<.0001) and
   compared with subjects receiving regular treatment of hypertension
   (2.5+/-0.7 versus 2.1+/-0.5, P=.0019). The latter patients had more
   extensive PVH than normotensives, but the difference was not
   significant. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure differed
   significantly among the three groups.
   Conclusions Hypertension and age were major predictors of the extent of
   PVH. Regular treatment for hypertension appeared to prevent the
   progression of PVH.}},

Abstract = {{Because a direct effect of GnRH on spermatozoa has been implied in
   clinical studies with subfertile bulls and stallions, we added GnRH to
   in vitro fertilization media to study effects on cleavage rates of
   bovine oocytes obtained from slaughterhouse ovaries. Cleavage rates were
   higher (p < 0.01) in media containing 0.8 mu g/ml GnRH (68\%) than in
   controls (59\%) and were consistent across three bulls. In a second
   experiment, two GnRH agonists also increased cleavage rates. A dose
   response for GnRH was demonstrated in a third experiment with a
   low-fertility bull (p < 0.09): cleavage rates were 37, 36, 43, 48, and
   47\% for 0, 0.16, 0.8, 4, and 20 mu g/ml GnRH, respectively. A GnRH
   antagonist was also shown to abolish the enhancing effect of GnRH on
   cleavage rates. No significant (p > 0.10) effect on percentage
   blastocysts per cleaved ovum was detected in any experiment. No specific
   binding of a GnRH analog to sperm was detected in radioreceptor assays.
   However, mRNA for the GnRH receptor was detected in matured
   cumulus-oocyte complexes by means of reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction and was verified by Southern hybridization with cDNA for
   the ovine GnRH receptor. In summary, GnRH and GnRH agonists enhance
   bovine in vitro fertilization, and detection of mRNA for the GnRH
   receptor in cumulus-oocyte complexes is suggestive that GnRH may act
   through its receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Alessandro Benedetti (about 1445-1525) was Professor of Anatomy and
   Surgery at Padua University. He became famous for the construction of
   the first anatomical theater ever built, where he personally used to
   carry out dissections. He published articles on many subjects, first of
   all on anatomy. His work Anatomice, sive Historia Corporis Humani
   (Anatomy, or the History of the Human Body), first printed in Venice in
   1502, was very popular and influential at that time. Of the many topics
   treated in the book, one is of special interest to plastic surgeons,
   i.e., the description of nasal reconstruction by means of a skin flap
   taken from the arm. The procedure is the same as the one the Branca
   family practiced in Sicily in the middle of fifteenth century. It is
   well known that the Brancas kept secret the operation and never
   published it. Hence, Alessandro Benedetti played an important role in
   the history of plastic surgery because he first reported in the Western
   surgical literature the procedure of nasal repair, later called the
   `'Italian'' method, almost 100 years before Tagliacozzi's publication in
   1597.}},

Abstract = {{1. Inactivation of a cloned Aplysia K+ channel, AKv1.1a, expressed in
   Xenopus oocytes was examined by a cell-attached macropatch recording. A
   fast macroscopic inactivation (the time constant for decay was in the
   range of 20-40 ms) in response to a depolarizing command pulse was
   insensitive to the concentration of external K+ (2-100 mM KCl).
   2. By contrast, recovery from inactivation was extremely slow and
   dependent on external K+. When the concentration of external KCl was 2-3
   mM, a patched membrane had to be held at hyperpolarized potential for
   >40 s for a full recovery. The recovery was greatly accelerated if
   external K+ concentration was increased. A tail current following a
   command pulse long enough to inactivate most of the channels showed a
   marked rising phase.
   3. A consequence of the slow recovery from inactivation was that AKv1.1a
   showed a marked accumulation of the inactivation following repetitive
   pulses, even at low frequency (<0.1 Hz). When two depolarizing pulses
   were applied at a short interval, the current during a second pulse was
   smaller than the current at the end of the preceding pulse. This is a
   phenomenon called `'cumulative inactivation.'' The onset and the extent
   of cumulative inactivation of AKv1.1a were voltage dependent but
   relatively insensitive to external K+ concentration. An amino terminal
   deletion mutant of AKv1.1a that lacks the fast N-type inactivation did
   not show cumulative inactivation.
   4. These results suggest that the inactivation gating by the amino
   terminal region of AKv1.1a has a similarity to open-channel blockade,
   and that the cumulative inactivation can also be dependent on the amino
   terminal cytoplasmic domain of K+ channels.}},

Abstract = {{Resource management is undergoing a shift in paradigms (Kessler 1992;
   Kessler et al. 1992; Franklin 1994; Rowe 1994). A paradigm is `'an
   implicit theory or conceptual framework from which other theories or
   understandings derive their validity'' (O'Donnell 1990); within science
   a paradigm provides researchers with model problems and solutions (Kuhn
   1970). Advances in our understanding of how ecosystems function combined
   with changes in society's expectations are rapidly changing the way we
   perceive, study, and manage our resources. Contributions from the
   relatively new? and broadly integrative, fields of landscape ecology and
   conservation biology emphasize the importance of spatial context in
   planning and managing (Crow 1990; Bunnell and Kremsater 1994),
   Management emphasis is on the maintenance of large, dynamic systems.
   Central to this shift in paradigm is the concept of `'ecosystem
   management''. The term is increasingly being used by scientists,
   managers, policy makers and the general public, but not always with the
   same meaning (Johnson and Agee 1988; Salwasser 1988, 1992; Joyce 1992;
   Scientific Panel for Sustainable Forest Practices in Clayoquot Sound
   {[}CSP] 1994; Grumbine 1994; Franklin 1994). Several authors provide
   historical reviews of the concept's development from different
   perspectives (Franklin 1994; Grumbine 1994; Jensen and Everett 1994). In
   this paper we examine the development of the concept, its implications,
   and the opportunities within a Canadian context.}},

Abstract = {{Femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray
   absorptiometry (DEXA) in 680 normal postmenopausal women. Femoral neck,
   Ward's triangle, and trochanter densities were weakly correlated with
   height (correlation coefficient r = 0.11 to 0.22), but a stronger
   correlation was found with body weight (r = 0.37 to 0.45) and body mass
   index (BMI) (r = 0.36 to 0.43). Bone density showed a negative
   correlation with all ages in all femoral regions (r = -0.14 to -0.27),
   but the correlation with years since menopause (YSM) was higher (r =
   0.23 to 0.35). When femoral bone densities were simultaneously regressed
   on BMI, age, and YSM, the correlation with YSM and BMI remained highly
   significant, while the correlation with age was not significant, In 64
   pairs of postmenopausal women (one woman less than or equal to 60 years
   of age and one >60 years of age; 56.8 +/- 2.6, and 64.8 +/- 2.9 years,
   respectively) matched for YSM (10.3 +/- 2.3 years), femoral bone
   densities were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the younger (femoral
   neck, 0.783 +/- 0.90; Ward's triangle, 0.629 +/- 0.108; trochanter,
   0.643 +/- 0.103 g/cm(2)) than in the older women (femoral neck, 0.826
   +/- 0.105; Ward's triangle, 0.681 +/- 0.138; trochanter, 0.689 +/- 0.108
   g/cm(2)). In conclusion, beside the BMI, the menopausal component of
   bone loss and a younger age at the menopause represent the major factors
   in predicting femoral bone density in women.}},

Abstract = {{The relaxed eddy accumulation method (REAM), a conditional sampling
   technique, provides a potential alternative to the traditional eddy
   correlation method for measuring turbulent flux of chemical trace gases
   in the lower atmosphere, because it does not require a high sampling
   rate that is not feasible with most chemical analyzers. Recent studies
   suggest that the turbulent flux ((\$) over bar w'(\$) over bar c') is
   proportional to the standard deviation of vertical velocity (sigma(w))
   and the difference (Delta c(w)) between mean concentrations
   conditionally sampled during updrafts and downdrafts. The relationship
   of (\$) over bar w'(\$) over bar c' = b(c) sigma(w) Delta c(w) is used
   as the basis for the REAM. This relationship was tested with turbulence
   measurements made at six heights in and above a deciduous forest with
   emphasis on the height dependence of the coefficient b in the forest
   region. Results, based on the analysis of only sensible heat and water
   vapor fluxes with the REAM, show that the (\$) over bar w'(\$) over bar
   c'-sigma(w) Delta c(w), linear relation may hold for different
   atmospheric stabilities and canopy leaf densities. The values of the
   coefficients b(T) and b(q) for both temperature and water vapor density,
   however, change with height, possibly because of the change in the
   efficiency of conditional concentration sampling during updrafts and
   downdrafts associated with the turbulence structure at different
   heights. At about 2.5 times the canopy height, b(T) is approximately
   equal to 0.58, which is close to the value of 0.6 found over a smooth
   surface. However, both b(T) and b(q) decrease as the canopy is
   approached and fall to about 0.51 at the canopy top. Using b(c) = 0.6
   could cause the flux within the forest roughness sublayer to be
   overestimated as much as 18\%. The possible role of organized turbulence
   structures of flow and the scalar fields existing in the lower
   atmosphere near the forest was examined.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial zone separating cement paste and aggregate in mortar and

   the theoretical framework for quantitatively understanding the influence
   of the interfacial zone on the overall electrical conductivity of

   understanding is also used, via an electrical analogy with Darcy's law,
   to make predictions about the effect of the interfacial zone on fluid

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate a method to teach purchasing
   to three students with developmental disabilities and severe behavior
   disorders who had minimal academic skills. To bypass the need for money
   computation skills, the students were taught to discriminate between
   three stimulus classes of frequent purchases (vending machine snack,
   convenience store snack, lunch). To teach the stimulus classes, multiple
   exemplars of each class were utilized with time delay of a response
   prompt and a stimulus prompt (money picture) to facilitate correct
   responding. Visual referents (pictures of the items to be purchased)
   were presented in a massed trial teaching format. Over subsequent phases
   the discrimination was made more difficult by dropping the money picture
   prompt and then withdrawing all visual referents and shifting to
   distributed trial instruction. Two of the participants mastered the
   stimulus classes and generalized these discriminations to making
   community purchases. The third made important gains in both acquisition
   and generalization of the responses before the program ended for summer
   vacation. The results are discussed for their implications in teaching
   purchasing skills to individuals who do not have typical academic
   prerequisites.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the state of activation of T lymphocytes in hemodialysis
   patients with chronic hepatitis C, serum levels of soluble interleukin-2
   receptors (sIL-2R), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and expression of interleukin-a
   receptors (IL-2R) on peripheral T lymphocytes were measured in 30
   hemodialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C, 14 hemodialysis patients
   without hepatitis, 30 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 41 normal
   subjects. A significant increase in sIL-2R levels was noted in all
   patients with chronic hepatitis compared to normal controls. This
   increase was even more significant in hemodialysis patients, while a
   less significant increase was also found in hemodialysis patients
   without hepatitis C viral infection. Expression of IL-2R on T
   lymphocytes was increased only in hemodialysis patients with chronic
   hepatitis. All patients had low levels of serum IL-2. These findings
   show that a T-cell activation involving the IL-2 system is present in
   chronic hepatitis C and that this activation is more prominent in
   hemodialysis patients, probably due to additional extrahepatic factors.}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that frequencies of T cell receptor-V
   (TcR-V)-specific subsets are frequently altered after both allogeneic
   and autologous BMT. The data reported here describe several
   characteristics of altered T cell subsets: (i) their capacity to endure
   peripherally, (ii) their correspondence to clonal donor T cell subsets,
   (iii) the origin of the clone (in one case amenable to analysis) from a
   mature T cell and not from new lymphopoiesis, and (iv) the presence of
   such a clone throughout a year of follow-up in a patient with chronic
   graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in whom it represented up to 1/10th of
   CD3(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and was found to be
   host-reactive. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence
   for the oligoclonality of a large proportion of the peripheral T cell
   repertoire in patients subsequent to bone marrow transplantation,
   possibly accounting for their frequent depressed immune status.
   Moreover, the anti-host reactivity demonstrated in a clone from the
   patient with chronic GVHD strongly suggests that an oligoclonal response
   can be linked to a pathological process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a binary, monotone system whose component
   states are dependent through the possible occurrence of independent
   common shocks, i.e. shocks that destroy several components at once. Such
   systems can be used to model common cause failures in reliability
   analysis. We propose to consider the common shocks as components in a
   new system, thereby obtaining a system of independent components. We
   show how the minimal path and cut sets of the two systems are related,
   and use this to examine the relation between bounds on the reliability
   based on the two systems. By the new approach some bounds are improved.
   We also discuss the problem of deriving a distribution of system
   reliability from a joint prior distribution for the component
   reliabilities, as well as data at the system level. The Marshall-Olkin
   multivariate exponential distribution fits into this framework, and some
   special cases of this model are treated as an example.}},

Abstract = {{The glycoprotein (G) of rabies virus can assume at least three different
   conformations: the native (N) state detected at the viral surface above
   pH 7; the activated (A) hydrophobic state, which is probably involved in
   the first steps of the fusion process; and the fusion-inactive (I)
   conformation. There is a pH-dependent equilibrium between these states,
   the equilibrium being shifted towards the I state at low pH. It has been
   supposed that the transition from the N to the I state mediates membrane
   fusion. By using a lipid-mixing assay, we studied the kinetics of fusion
   and fusion inactivation for two rabies virus strains, PV and CVS. In
   addition, by using electron microscopy and a trypsin sensitivity assay,
   we analyzed the kinetics of the conformational change towards the I
   state for both strains. Although the PV strain fuses faster,
   inactivation and the conformational change of PV G occur more slowly
   than for the CVS strain. This suggests that the structural transition
   towards the I state is irrelevant to the fusion process.
   Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments performed with
   infected cells and two different monoclonal antibodies, one specific for
   the N form of G and one which recognizes both the N and the I states,
   suggest that G is transported in an I state-like conformation through
   the Golgi apparatus and acquires its N structure only near or al the
   cell surface. We propose that the role of the I state is to avoid
   unspecific fusion during transport of G in the acidic Golgi vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature-sensitive and attenuated phenotypes of the Sabin type 1
   vaccine strain of poliovirus result from numerous point mutations which
   occurred in the virulent Mahoney virus parent. One of these mutations is
   located in a 3D polymerase (3D(Pol)) codon (U-6203-->C, Tyr 73-->His)
   and is involved in attenuation in common mice (M. Tardy-Panit, B.
   Blondel, A. Martin, F. Tekaia, F. Horaud, and F. Delpeyroux, J. Virol.
   67:4630-4638, 1993). This mutation also appears to contribute to
   temperature sensitivity in association with at least 1 other of the 10
   mutations of the 3'-terminal part of the genome including the 3D(Pol)
   coding and 3' noncoding regions. To map the other mutation(s), we
   constructed poliovirus mutants by mutagenesis and recombination of
   Mahoney and Sabin 1 cDNAs. Characterization of these poliovirus mutants
   showed that a second mutation in a 3D(Pol) codon (C-7071-->U,
   Thr-362-->Ile) contributes to temperature sensitivity. A mutation in the
   3' noncoding region of the genome (A-7441-->G), alone or linked to
   another mutation (U-7410-->C), also appeared to be involved in this
   phenotype. The temperature-sensitive effect associated with the
   3'-terminal part of the Sabin 1 genome results from the cumulative
   and/or synergistic effects of at least three genetic determinants, i.e.,
   the His-73 and Ile-362 codons of 3D(Pol) and nucleotide G-7441. Sequence
   analysis of strains isolated from patients with vaccine-associated
   paralytic poliomyelitis showed that these genetic determinants are
   selected against in vivo, although the Ile-362 codon appeared to be more
   stable than either the His-73 codon or G-7441. These genetic
   determinants may contribute to the safety of Sabin 1 in vaccinees.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of ozone uptake efficiency in the human respiratory tract
   provide critical information toward understanding ozone dose-response
   characteristics. We measured ozone uptake efficiency by different
   regions of the respiratory tract between the mouth and bronchus
   intermedius in 10 healthy, resting, nonsmoking male and female subjects.
   The distal end of a bronchoscope was sequentially positioned at the
   bronchus intermedius (BI), main carina (CAR), upper trachea, and above
   the vocal cords. Ozone concentration was measured continuously at each
   sight using a rapid-responding ozone analyzer. During sampling subjects
   breathed through a mouthpiece connected to a pneumotachograph at a paced
   rate of 12 breaths/min. Integration of the product of the flow and ozone
   concentrations during inspiration and expiration provided the ozone mass
   passing each anatomic location during each phase of respiration. On
   inspiration the uptake efficiencies of ozone by structures between the
   mouth and each location j (E(m-j)) were 0.176 +/- 0.037 (SE), 0.271 +/-
   0.024, 0.355 +/- 0.030, and 0.325 +/- 0.031 for above the vocal cords,
   upper trachea, CAR, and BI, respectively. A significant effect of
   location on E(m-j) was found by analysis of variance (P < 0.0002).
   Pairwise comparisons showed that E(m-j) increased as the lung
   penetration increased except between CAR and BI, which was not
   significantly different.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical
   utility of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for soluble fibrin in patients
   with clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   Methods and Results. 101 unselected patients with clinically suspected
   DVT underwent blood sampling for measurement of plasma levels of soluble
   fibrin, and objective testing for DVT. According to results of the
   objective tests, patients were classified as DVT-positive (n = 34) or
   DVT-negative (n = 67). Using different cut-points of soluble fibrin
   results, the sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative
   predictive values of the soluble fibrin assay were calculated. A soluble
   fibrin result of less than or equal to 0.75 mg/ml showed a sensitivity
   and negative predictive value of 100\%, and a specificity of 17.9\% for
   DVT, a soluble fibrin result of less than or equal to 1.40 mg/ml showed
   a sensitivity of 91.2\% and a negative predictive value of 93.6\%, and a
   specificity of 65.7\% for DVT, whereas a soluble fibrin result of less
   than or equal to 8.0 mg/ml showed a specificity and positive predicive
   value of 100\% for DVT.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the soluble fibrin assay used
   in the study has potential clinical utility as a diagnostic test in
   patients with clinically suspected DVT and supports further evaluation
   of this assay.}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) (EC 4.1.1.28) catalyses a key
   step in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids in C. roseus by
   converting tryptophan into tryptamine. Hardly any tdc mRNA could be
   detected in hormone-independent callus and cell suspension cultures
   transformed by the oncogenic T-DNA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Supply
   of tryptamine may therefore represent a limiting factor in the
   biosynthesis of alkaloids by such cultures. To investigate this
   possibility, chimaeric gene constructs, in which a tdc cDNA is linked in
   the sense or antisense orientation to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S
   promoter and terminator, were introduced in C. roseus cells by infecting
   seedlings with an oncogenic A. tumefaciens strain. In the resulting
   crown gall tumour calluses harbouring the tdc sense construct, an
   increased TDC protein level, TDC activity and tryptamine content but no
   significant increase in terpenoid indole alkaloid production were
   observed compared to empty-vector-transformed tumour calluses. In tumour
   calluses containing the tdc antisense construct, decreased levels of TDC
   activity were measured. Factors which might be responsible for the lack
   in increased terpenoid indole alkaloid production in the tdc cDNA
   overexpressing crown gall calluses are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied 14 unmedicated sulfur dioxide (SO2)-sensitive asthmatics to
   test the hypothesis that SO2 exacerbates asthma more than other everyday
   respiratory stressors. In Phase I, subjects underwent controlled
   exposures to 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm SO2 with light, medium, and heavy
   exercise (average ventilation 30, 36, and 43 l/min, respectively). Lung
   function, symptoms of asthma, and psychophysical (stamina) changes were
   measured. Function, symptom, and stamina responses correlated modestly.
   Increasing SO2 had stronger unfavorable effects than increasing
   exercise. In Phase II, subjects performed eight different physical tasks
   in SO2-free ambient air while symptoms and stamina were measured. Fast
   stair-climbing evoked symptoms similar to the effects of 0.5 ppm
   SO2/light exercise, while stamina reduction was comparable to 0.5 ppm
   SO2/heavy exercise. In Phase III, subjects recorded time-activity
   patterns, symptoms, and stamina during randomly selected intervals on a
   typical weekday and weekend day. Most reported activities were
   sedentary. Infrequent, strenuous Phase III exercise increased symptoms
   more than did 0.5 ppm SO2/light exercise, but with less effect on
   stamina. We conclude that for typical mild asthmatics, ten-minute SO2
   exposures at concentrations >0.5 ppm and ventilation >30 l/min can cause
   short-term asthma manifestations more intense than those usually
   experienced from everyday stresses without SO2 exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Platelets aggregate in response to an adhesin and the platelet
   aggregation-associated protein (PAAP) expressed on the cell surfaces of
   certain strains of Streptococcus sanguis. We sought to identify the
   corresponding PAAP receptor and accessory adhesin binding sites on
   platelets. Since the adhesin(s) of S. sanguis for platelets has not been
   characterized, an anti-idiotype (anti-id) murine monoclonal antibody
   (MAb2) strategy was developed, First, MAb1s that distinguished the
   adhesin and PAAP antigens on the surface of S. sanguis I 133-79 were
   selected, Fab fragments of MAb1,2 (immunoglobulin G2b {[}IgG2b]; 70
   pmol) reacted with 5 x 10(7) cells of S. sanguis to completely inhibit
   the aggregation of human platelets in plasma, Under similar conditions,
   MAb1.1 (IgG1) inhibited the adhesion of S. sanguis cells to platelets by
   a maximum of 34\% with a comparatively small effect on platelet
   aggregation, Together, these two MAb1s inhibited S. sanguis-platelet
   adhesion by 63\%. In Western immunoblots, both MAb1s reacted with S.
   sanguis 133-79 87- and 150-kDa surface proteins and MAb1.2 also reacted
   with purified type I collagen. The hybridomas producing MAb1.1 and
   MAb1.2 were then injected into BALB/c mice, Enlarged spleens were
   harvested, and a panel of MAb2 hybridomas was prepared. To identify
   anti-ids against the specific MAb1s, the MAb2 panel was screened by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reaction with rabbit polyclonal
   IgG antibodies against the 87- and 150-kDa antigens, The reactions
   between the specific rabbit antibodies and anti-ids were inhibited by
   the 87- and 150-kDa antigens, When preincubated with platelets, MAb2.1
   (counterpart of MAb1.1) inhibited adhesion to platelets maximally by
   46\% and MAb2.2 (anti-MAb1.2) inhibited adhesion to platelets maximally
   by 35\%. Together, both MAb2s inhibited the adhesion of S. sanguis to
   platelets by 81\%. MAb2.2 also inhibited induction of platelet
   aggregation, MAb2.2 immunoprecipitated a biotinylated platelet membrane
   antigen of 170 kDa (unreduced); MAb2.1 precipitated membrane antigens of
   175- and 230-kDa (unreduced). Therefore, platelet binding sites and the
   receptor for the S. sanguis adhesin and PAAP, respectively, are
   distinguished by the anti-id MAb2s.}},

Abstract = {{Zeta-crystallin/quinone reductase (CRYZ) is an NADPH oxidoreductase
   expressed at very high levels in the lenses of two groups of mammals:
   camelids and some hystricomorph rodents. It is also expressed at very

   mechanisms mediating the high expression of this enzyme! crystallin in
   the lens of the Ilama (Lama guanacoe) and the guinea pig (Cavia

   as a lens crystallin in both species and allowed us to elucidate for the
   first time the mechanism of lens recruitment of an enzyme-crystallin.
   The data presented here show that in both species such recruitment most
   likely occurred through the generation of new lens promoters from
   nonfunctional intron sequences by the accumulation of point mutations
   and/or small deletions and insertions. These results further support the
   idea that recruitment of CRYZ resulted from an adaptive process in which
   the high expression of CRYZ in the lens provides some selective

Abstract = {{The in vitro cytopathic effect of Trichomonas vaginalis on epithelial
   cells was explored through the interaction of trophozoites of the
   virulent strain GT-10 with MDCK monolayers. The interaction was analyzed
   through electrophysiology, video microscopy, and transmission and
   scanning electron microscopy. Electrical measurements revealed that
   living parasites produced severe damage to the cell monolayers within 30
   min, manifested as a rapid decrease in transepithelial resistance.
   Microscopic observations demonstrated that when placed in contact with
   epithelial cells, trichomonas formed clumps through interdigitations and
   transient plasma membrane junctions between adjacent parasites. Also,
   attached trophozoites adopted an ameboid shape. The in vitro cytopathic
   action of T. vaginalis on MDCK cells was initially evident by
   modifications of the plasma membrane, resulting in opening of tight
   junctions, membrane blebbing, and monolayer disruption. After 15 min of
   interaction the damage was focal, concentrating at sites where parasite
   clumps adhered to the monolayer. At 30 min practically all MDCK cells
   were dead, whether or not trichomonas were attached to them. These
   events were followed by detachment of lysed cells and complete
   disruption of the monolayer at 60 min. Electron microscopy demonstrated
   a peculiar form of adhesion that appears to be specific for trichomonas,
   in which the basal surface of T. vaginalis formed slender channels
   through which microvilli and cytoplasmic fragments of epithelial cells
   were internalized. The same sequence of lytic events was found with the
   less virulent GT-3 strain. However, the time course of cytolysis with
   GT-3 parasites was much slower, and lysis was limited to areas of
   attachment of T. vaginalis.}},

Abstract = {{Some aspects of the theory of LASIN (laser assisted surface ion
   neutralization) are discussed, with emphasis on the physical origins of
   the so-called double-peak structures found in some calculations of the
   charge-transfer (neutralization) probability, P, as a function of the
   laser frequency eta. These two peaks have been called the first peak at
   eta approximate to eta(m) = epsilon(0) - epsilon(m) (in a.u.), where
   epsilon(0) (epsilon(m)) is the electronic energy level of the ion/atom
   (middle of the solid's valence band) and the second peak, a much larger
   peak at eta approximate to 1.3 eta(m), respectively.
   We show that these double-peak structures are all special cases of
   multiple-peak structures which result from quantum interference effects,
   and that, in fact, the second peak is to be regarded as the main
   resonance peak. This result is interesting in itself, because it is the
   first peak which has heretofore been considered the main resonance peak,
   To simplify the discussion, a two-level model is adapted, which
   represents the solid valence band by a single level at epsilon(m).
   Clarification of the physical reason for the multi pie peaks is based on
   the semiclassical theory of nonadiabatic transitions, in which the peaks
   are due to the phase difference between the two adiabatic paths that
   arise from the diagonalization of the two-level hamiltonian.
   With the electronic hopping potential modelled by V(t) = V(0)sech(lambda
   t), and the laser potential by W(t) = W(0)sech(lambda t) cos(eta t +
   delta), in the usual notation, an approximate analytical expression for
   P(eta) is presented for the case \textbackslash{}W-0/V-0\textbackslash{}
   much less than 1, which covers most of the previous treatments, and is
   in good agreement with the exact results.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of prescribing guidelines on the use of neuromuscular
   blocking agents (NMBs) was studied.
   Voluntary guidelines on the appropriate prescribing of formulary NMBs in
   the operating rooms at a university hospital were approved in January
   1993. Patients who underwent inpatient surgery with neuromuscular
   blockade during a preguideline period (March 1, 1992, through May 31,
   1992) or a postguideline period (March 1, 1993, through May 31, 1993)
   were randomly selected (n = 200 per group) and compared to determine the
   relative appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, and cost of NMB use.
   The preguideline and postguideline groups were demographically similar.
   There were significantly more instances of appropriate NMB use after
   than before the guidelines were established. Neuromuscular blockade was
   maintained in all patients. The overall rates of NMB-associated adverse
   events were 5.5\% and 7.5\% for the preguideline and postguideline
   groups, respectively. The acquisition cost of NMBs and drugs used to
   treat NMB-associated adverse events for the preguideline patients was
   \$4261, versus \$2978 for the postguideline patients. Extrapolated to
   the estimated 10,000 operations per year requiring neuromuscular
   blockade at the institution,the total cost was \$213,000 before
   guideline introduction and \$149,000 afterward, for a
   guideline-associated cost reduction of \$64,000.
   Prescribing guidelines reduced expenditures for NMBs without affecting

Abstract = {{Canine distemper virus (CDV) induces oligodendroglial degeneration and
   multifocal demyelination in the central nervous system. The mechanism of
   oligodendrocyte degeneration is not understood but it has been shown
   that there is a restricted infection of these cells without viral
   protein production. Using a combination of immunocytochemistry and in
   situ hybridization we were able to demonstrate the transcription of the
   entire virus genome throughout the whole observation period (7-35 days
   after infection) in oligodendrocytes in CDV-infected brain cell
   cultures. Therefore, the lack of viral protein and particle production
   can not be explained on the basis of a defective viral transcription.
   The present study also shows that a restricted infection of
   oligodendrocytes with CDV down-regulates the transcription of the major
   myelin genes coding for proteolipid protein, myelin basic protein (MBP)
   and myelin-associated glycoprotein in a very similar way. Using
   densitometry for in situ hybridization products of MBP in populations of
   normal and infected oligodendrocytes, an effect could be observed long
   before morphological changes were detectable. The present results
   strongly suggest that demyelination in distemper is induced by a
   restricted CDV infection of oligodendrocytes which down-regulates the
   expression of a variety of cellular genes, in particular those coding
   for myelin proteins. Consequently, the infected cells are no longer able
   to synthesize all the membrane compounds which are necessary for
   maintaining their structural integrity.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of high density lipoproteins (HDL) on platelet function
   were examined in vivo and in vitro. Intraplatelet, ionised calcium
   concentrations ({[}Ca2+](i)) were measured using the fluorescent dye
   Quin-2.
   In vitro, platelet responses to AVP were measured in the presence or
   absence of HDL. Pre-treating platelets from normal volunteers with HDL
   in vitro lowered the {[}Ca2+](i) response to AVP but did not
   significantly affect basal values.
   In vivo, plasma lipoprotein profiles in normotensive (13 men, 17 women)
   and hypertensive (13 men, 11 women) subjects were compared with basal
   and AVP-stimulated platelet {[}Ca2+](i) values. Plasma {[}HDL] were not
   related to basal or stimulated {[}Ca2+](i). Plasma cholesterol
   concentrations were higher in the hypertensive patients largely because
   low density lipoprotein {[}LDL] were raised in male hypertensive
   patients. Plasma {[}LDL] and total plasma cholesterol correlated
   negatively with basal {[}Ca2+](i) (but not with AVP-stimulated values)
   only in this subgroup. In hypertensive patients, AVP-stimulated
   {[}Ca2+](i) (but not basal values) were lower than normotensive
   controls.
   From in vitro studies, it may be concluded that the anti-atherogenic
   properties of HDL might be mediated by inhibition of platelet
   reactivity. However, ex vivo a negative influence of LDL on basal (not
   stimulated) {[}Ca2+](i) appears to be paramount.}},

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulation methods have been applied to an ionic model and
   used to investigate the enthalpies of formation and reaction of defects
   in the spinel, ZnCr2O4. For the stoichiometric material our results (i)
   suggest that small amounts of exchange disorder are expected and (ii)
   show that the formation enthalpies of Schottky and Frenkel defects are
   sufficiently high that negligible intrinsic disorder of these kinds is
   expected.
   The possibility, suggested by experiment, that large amounts of ZnO may
   dissolve in the ZnCr2O4 lattice has also been investigated. However, the
   results of the calculations presented here rule out straightforward
   dissolution. On the other hand, they show that it is likely that the
   solubility of ZnO is substantially increased when the material is
   simultaneously oxidized. Unfortunately, the methods used to calculate
   the corresponding reaction energies in non-stoichiometric ZnCr2O4 are
   subject to some uncertainty arising from the variable nature of the
   second electron affinity of the oxygen atom. Nevertheless, the
   oxidation-driven mechanism is supported by the calculated variations of
   lattice parameter with composition, which are not subject to the same
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To demonstrate the specific distribution of muscarinic
   receptors in the rat urinary bladder and to investigate the effects of
   afferent and efferent denervation on the density and distribution of
   muscarinic receptors.
   Materials and methods Urinary bladders were obtained from female rats
   which had been injected with vehicle (control), or neonatally with
   capsaicin (NC, afferent denervation) or which had their pelvic plexus
   removed (post-ganglionic denervation, PGD, efferent denervation), Tissue
   sections were used in radioligand-binding studies and for
   autoradiography with the muscarinic receptor ligand
   l-quinuclidinyl{[}phenyl-4-H-3]benzilate (QNB).
   Results Binding of QNB was saturable and specific to a single population
   of binding sites, with a mean dissociation constant (K-d) Of 1.05 +/-
   0.14 nM in controls and 0.90 +/- 0.13 nM in rats with PGD.
   Post-ganglionic denervation caused a 37\% increase in maximal binding
   (B-max) of QNB from 437.1 +/- 39.1 fmol/mg protein (control group) to
   599.1 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg protein (P < 0.02), Autoradiograms revealed
   muscarinic binding sites over the smooth muscle, but none over the
   epithelium. Smooth muscle binding sites were doubled after PGD but were
   unchanged after NC treatment.
   Conclusion Muscarinic receptors were localized over the smooth muscle of
   the rat bladder and were increased after post-ganglionic denervation.
   This increase may be responsible for the increased sensitivity to
   muscarinic agonists reported to occur after bladder denervation.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: An ability to measure inflammatory activity in
   alcoholic hepatitis is desirable for assessing its natural history and
   therapeutic responses, but convenient and simple parameters are lacking.
   To determine whether acute phase proteins could be useful for this
   purpose, we studied serum CRP and several other acute phase proteins in
   a series of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
   Materials and Methods: We examined sequential sera from 72 patients with
   serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dl.
   Results: The short-term mortality during the approximately 30 day study
   period was 18\%. There was moderate to marked elevation of serum
   c-reactive protein, at initial testing in all patients with alcoholic
   hepatitis. In consecutive sera within the first week of testing, a
   further rise in c-reactive protein, was noted significantly more
   frequently among patients that did not survive subsequently. Serum
   c-reactive protein levels gradually declined in, recovering patients but
   were still abnormal at the end of the study period. In. contrast, serum
   haptoglobin, levels were subnormal initially, as well as throughout the
   subsequent short-term course. Among other acute phase proteins, serum
   ceruloplasmin, transferrin, a-1 acid glycoprotein. and a-2
   macroglobulin, re- mained in the normal range. Conclusions: These
   results suggest that the expression. of c-reactive protein but not
   haptoglobin. is upregulated in alcohol-induced acute liver injury.
   Serial measurements of serum c-reactive protein should be useful in
   assessing the clinical activity of alcoholic hepatitis.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that intragastric administration of polyethylene
   glycol-400 (PEG-400) by gavage needle protected the rat gastric mucosa
   from 96\% ethanol-induced lesions in a dose-dependent fashion. The
   inhibitions of the lesions were 10.5, 53.5, 94.6, and 99.2\% at doses of
   275, 1375, 2750, and 5500 mg/kg, respectively. The duration of the
   protective effect was approximately 12 hr. The gastroprotection offered
   by PEG-400 was not modified by pretreatment with either subcutaneous
   indomethacin (25 mg/kg) or iodoacetamide (100 mg/kg). Gastric motility,
   measured by a balloon method, was dose-dependently inhibited by
   intragastric administration of PEG-400. The inhibited gastric motility
   (amplitude gastric contraction) induced by PEG-400 was not modified by
   pretreatment with either indomethacin or iodoacetamide. The gastric
   emptying rate, investigated by measuring the disappearance of
   intragastrically administered {[}Tc-99m]DTPA from the stomach of rats
   treated with PEG-400 (5500 mg/kg) was markedly retarded. There was an
   increase in both the fluid volume and the mucus volume retained in the
   gastric lumen only for PEG-400 (5500 mg/kg) at 1, 2, and 4 hr after
   administration. The rats treated with 0.7 ml of vehicle plus 96\%
   ethanol had significantly less damage than those treated with 0.2 ml of
   vehicle plus 96\% ethanol. These results indicate that intragastric
   PEG-400-protective effect was not mediated by endogenous prostaglandins,
   sulfhydryl compounds of the gastric mucosa, or changes in gastric
   contractile patterns. We conclude that the protective effect of
   intragastric PEG-400 may be the result of retarded gastric emptying
   together with an osmotic pull of fluid into the stomach and the increase
   in gastric mucus volume. However, the possibility that intragastric
   PEG-400 also may have the capacity to stabilize or augment the stomach's
   hydrophobic properties cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adherence and transendothelial migration of circulating
   leukocytes is one of the initial events after vascular injury. This
   process is mediated principally by the expression of integrins
   (CD11/C18) on the cell surface, which interact with their counterparts
   in the vessel wall cells. In order to determine the role of leukocytes
   in the development of neointimal thickening after balloon angioplasty, a
   monoclonal antibody (R15.7) against leukocyte adherence glycoprotein
   CD18 was used.
   Methods: Femoral artery atherosclerotic lesions were induced in 20 New
   Zealand White rabbits, which were subjected to balloon angioplasty 28
   days thereafter. Twelve hours before and 48 h after balloon angioplasty,
   2 mg/kg body weight anti-CD18 or vehicle was randomly injected
   intravenously. Twenty-one days later the rabbits were killed and
   morphometric analysis performed. Measurement of functional activity of
   R15.7 in rabbit sera was performed, analyzing the capacity of the serum
   sample to inhibit aggregation of JY cells.
   Results: The serum obtained from monoclonal antibody-treated rabbits
   showed more than 50\% inhibition of cell aggregation at the time of
   balloon angioplasty. No effect on cell aggregation was seen in the sera
   of control rabbits. By angiography, there was no difference in lumen
   diameter and percentage stenosis at follow-up between the two groups. On
   morphometric analysis, there were no differences in the cross-sectional
   areas of intima, media, and lumen between the two treatment groups. The
   percentage cross-sectional area of intima was also similar in the two
   groups (0.672+/-0.04 versus 0.628+/-0.04).
   Conclusions: Blocking the CD18/CD11 glycoprotein pathway for leukocyte
   adhesion with a specific monoclonal antibody did not decrease the
   restenotic process after balloon angioplasty in the atherosclerotic
   rabbit arterial injury model.}},

   P-B and maximum fluxes J(max) should be correlated with relevant
   physicochemical properties. Methods. Saturated solutions of the
   above-mentioned compounds in a propylene glycol/water mixture were
   applied to the skin using glass chambers which were fixed to the upper
   arms of volunteers. Maximum fluxes were calculated from concentration
   decreases in the vehicle. Results, A linear relationship between the
   logarithms of permeabilities P-B of the penetrants (0.02-0.28 cm h(-1))
   and the corresponding octanol/vehicle partition coefficients PCOct/V
   (166-186,208) was found. Consequently, the influence of aqueous boundary
   layers could be neglected. However, the slope of the resulting straight
   line of 0.38 is considerably smaller than unity indicating that PCOct/V
   does not represent the lipophilicity of the stratum corneum adequately.
   Maximum fluxes range from 0.5 to 130 mu g cm(-2) h(-1). A general
   equation for the calculation of J(max) was derived based on experimental
   data taking into account the PCOct/V and the solubilities c(sV) of the
   respective penetrants in the vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all spongy bone by
   means of suitable preparation techniques. Histologically, these
   structures are immature fibrous bone. Their genesis, frequency, and
   importance are largely unknown. To address these issues, 26 normal human
   spines, 11 osteoporotic spines, and different parts of the skeleton
   (femur head, iliac crest) were investigated for microcallus using a new
   preparation technique-allowing a combined 2- and 3-dimensional analysis,
   According to our analysis, microcallus formation occurs frequently in
   persons older than 45 years of age. These formations are mainly
   localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and are obviously more
   frequent in females than in males. In individuals with a trabecular bone
   volume (BV/TV) in the spine below 11\%, microcallus formations occur
   regularly. But the number of microcallus formations depends more on the
   microarchitecture of the cancellous bone (trabecular bone pattern
   factor, TBPf), than on individual trabecular parameters (trabecular
   number, TbN; trabecular bone volume, BV/TV; and trabecular thickness,
   TbTh), In about 33\% of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the
   center of the microcallus formation, It is unclear whether microcallus
   may be the result of a nontraumatic process, In therapy studies the bone
   mass could be misrepresented due to the amount of microcallus. Although
   it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is
   not only a negative mechanism, but stabilizes and regenerates the bone
   tissue. Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to
   bridges of microcallus between the remnant trabeculae, Osteoporosis is
   not the result of an inability to form microcallus formations.}},

Abstract = {{Surface locomotor activity of root voles (Microtus oeconomus) during
   summer and autumn was recorded with passage-counters in four
   experimental populations in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures. Populations
   differed considerably with respect to density, geographical origin and

   characteristics of diel activity patterns, however, were very similar
   among populations. Root voles were generally more active during daytime
   than during the night, and high activity always occurred around sunrise
   and sunset. The most prominent feature of the activity patterns was a
   clear-cut ultradian rhythm at both day and night, resulting in seven
   activity bouts per 24 h. Pattern adjustment to changing daylength was
   achieved by an interaction between endogenous ultradian rhythmicity and
   resetting of the ultradian rhythm at both sunrise and sunset. The
   daytime rhythm had a period length of 3.0 to 3.5 h, while the nighttime
   rhythm had a significantly longer period length of 3.5 to 4.0 h. Data in
   the literature suggest that this mechanism of triggering activity may
   also occur in other microtine species.}},

Abstract = {{The expression and localization of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1
   were investigated in human prostatic tissues with or without benign

   demonstrate that prostatic tissues with benign hyperplasia expressed a
   significantly higher level of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 mRNA
   than normal prostatic tissues (P < 0.01 by Anova). Western blot analysis
   using an antiserum against the receptor gave 2 bands with molecular
   weights of about 140 kDa and 80 kDa; these correspond to the expected
   sizes of the long and secreted forms of the fibroblast growth factor
   receptor-1, respectively. An immunohistochemical study using the same
   antiserum further demonstrated that the immunoreactive staining occurred
   mainly in the basal cells of the glandular epithelium and occasionally
   in the stromal cells. These results suggest that fibroblast growth
   factors may influence, at least in part, the proliferation of the
   epithelial cells seen in benign hyperplasia of human prostate. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{This article argues that working at a distance (that is, work done in
   the home at a physical distance from the employer, using

   become an increasingly significant phenomenon towards the twenty-first
   century. This development can bring benefits to both the employer and
   the individual, although other concerns regarding remote work for the
   individual and the organisation are discussed fully. Since the
   literature to date has considered working at a distance mainly from the
   employer's perspective, and largely in respect of professional and
   computing staffs, the article presents evidence from some empirical
   research undertaken as part of a larger study into labour flexibility:
   the analysis of secretarial employees' attitudes towards the flexibility
   of their work location and possible teleworking from home. The results,
   including the preferred option of working part of the week at home, are
   reviewed and their potential importance set within the wider labour

Abstract = {{As part of a continuing investigation of the role of spinal delta opioid
   receptors in antinociception, this study characterized the ability of
   7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX), a selective delta-1 opioid receptor
   antagonist, to antagonize the antinociception produced in the rat by
   intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the respective delta-1 and delta-2
   opioid receptor agonists, DPDPE and {[}D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]deltorphin
   (DELT), or the mu receptor agonist DAMGO. In the tail flick test, 10-min
   pretreatment with 1 mu g of BNTX, increased the ED(50) value of DPDPE
   from 27.5 mu g (42.6 nmol) to 114.8 mu g (177.8 nmol), but did not
   increase the ED(50) values of either DELT or DAMGO. Increasing the dose
   of BNTX to 3 mu g did not produce a significantly greater antagonism of
   the antinociceptive effects of DPDPE and did not antagonize the
   antinociceptive effects of DAMGO. However, it did enhance the
   antinociceptive effects of DELT decreasing its ED(50) from 5.3 to 0.18
   mu g in the tail flick test. In the hot plate test, 10 min pretreatment
   with 1 mu g Of BNTX selectively antagonized the antinociceptive effects
   of DPDPE, but did not antagonize the actions of DAMGO or DELT.
   Increasing the dose of BNTX to 3 mu g also did not produce a
   significantly greater antagonism of the antinociceptive effects of DPDPE
   in the hot plate test, but did antagonize both the increase in hot plate
   latency and the modest decrement in motor function produced by 30 mu g
   i.t. of DELT. However, the antagonism of these effects of DELT occurred
   much later in time than BNTX's antagonism of the antinociceptive effects
   of DPDPE. In addition, although 3 mu g of BNTX did not increase the
   ED(50) of DAMGO as compared to control, it did shift the dose-response
   relationship of DAMGO 4-fold to the right as compared to rats pretreated
   with 1 mu g of BNTX, suggesting some antagonism of mu-mediated
   antinociception at this dose. Taken together, these findings indicate
   that BNTX distinguishes between subtypes of the delta opioid receptor
   after i.t. administration in the rat and that it is a selective
   antagonist of the delta-1 opioid receptor at a dose of 1 mu g. These
   findings also confirm the pharmacologic specificity of the
   antinociception produced by i.t.-administered DPDPE and provide further
   support for a role of spinal delta-1 receptors in antinociception.}},

   after intestinal resection. Data were obtained from medical records and
   answers to a medical questionnaire. Forty patients replied to the
   questionnaire. Mean length of stay in the department of surgery was 16
   +/- 9 days. Length of stay was positively correlated to non-elective
   surgery, colonic resection, presence of fistulae or abscesses, and to
   the creation oi a stoma. Main interval between surgery and resumption of
   work was 11 +/- 8 weeks. Only one patient was unable to return to work
   because of the disease. Seventy per cent of the patients who went back
   to work said that their quality of life was improved after surgery in
   comparison with their preoperative status. in conclusion, this study
   suggests that most of the patients undergoing intestinal resection for
   Crohn's disease can go back to work without particular difficulties, and
   consider that their quality of life has been improved by surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular genetic analysis is used to characterize the AGT1 gene
   encoding an alpha-glucoside transporter. AGT1 is found in many
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains and maps to a naturally
   occurring, partially functional allele of the MAL1 locus. Agt1p is a
   highly hydrophobic, postulated integral membrane protein. It is 57\%
   identical to Mal61p, the maltose permease encoded at MAL6, and is also a
   member of the 12 transmembrane domain superfamily of sugar transporters.
   Like Mal61p, Agt1p is a high-affinity, maltose/proton symporter, but
   Mal61p is capable of transporting only maltose and turanose, while Agt1p
   transports these two alpha-glucosides as well as several others
   including isomaltose, alpha-methylglucoside, maltotriose, palatinose,
   trehalose and melezitose. AGT1 expression is maltose inducible and
   induction is mediated by the Mal-activator. The sequence of the upstream
   region of AGT1 is identical to that of the maltose-inducible MAL61 gene
   over a 469 bp region containing the UAS(MAL) but the 315 bp sequence
   immediately upstream of AGT1 shows no significant homology to the
   sequence immediately upstream of MAL61. The evolutionary origin of the
   MAL1 allele to which AGT1 maps and the relationship of AGT1 to other
   alpha-glucoside fermentation genes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a newly
   discovered neuropeptide that is present in high amounts in hypothalamic
   neuroendocrine neurons and potently stimulates the accumulation of cAMP
   within cells of the anterior pituitary. We have employed several
   specific antisera recognizing different parts of the PACAP precursor to
   elucidate the distribution of PACAP-Like immunoreactivities in the
   hypothalamic components of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenocortical axis
   in sections obtained from normal and colchicine-treated rats. Using
   immunohistochemistry with avidinbiotin-coupled peroxidase as a reporter
   system, high numbers of PACAP-immunoreactive perikarya were found in
   colchicine-pretreated rats in many of the parvicellular subdivisions of
   the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). A few cells were also
   found in the magnocellular subdivisions of the nucleus, and a similar
   small population of cells was observed in the dorsolateral aspect of the
   supraoptic nucleus. Using indirect immunofluorescence, the relation
   between CRF- and PACAP-containing neurons in the various parvicellular
   subnuclei of the PVN was studied, and a high degree of colocalization
   was demonstrated in the neurons of the medial parvicellular part of PVN.
   To further study the functional implications of PACAP in the
   hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, we examined the expression of
   PACAP messenger RNA (mRNA) in the PVN in response to five different
   stimulatory paradigms that previously have been shown to stimulate CRF
   mRNA expression in the medial parvicellular part of the PVN. The
   stimulatory challenges of adrenalectomy, restraint stress, ip injection
   of hypertonic saline, ether stress, and intracerebroventricular
   injection of colchicine induced significant elevations of CRF mRNA
   expression in the medial parvicellular part of the PVN. In contrast, the
   expression of PACAP mRNA, which is hardly detectable within the medial
   parvicellular part of the PVN, was induced only by colchicine treatment
   (from undetectable levels to 177 +/- 21 dpm/g; mean +/- SEM), whereas
   PACAP mRNA remained undetectable in this region of the PVN after
   exposure to any of the other stimulatory paradigms. The onset of
   colchicine-induced PACAP mRNA expression in the PVN was rapid (3 h), and
   PACAP mRNA levels remained elevated throughout the 48-h observation
   period. Considering the different topography and connections of the
   parvicellular subnuclei of the PVN, the current observations suggest
   that PACAP present in parvicellular neurons of the PVN may act not only
   as a neuroendocrine transmitter/modulator in the
   hypothalamopituitary-adrenocortical axis, but also as transmitter
   mediating neurotransmission conveyed from the PVN to preganglionic
   neurons of the autonomic system. However, the physiological stimuli
   triggering the increased demand for PACAP synthesis within these neurons
   remain to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Many hazardous waste sites in the south Louisiana Gulf Coast have been
   emplaced in sediments of Plio-Pleistocene to Recent age. Because of the
   fining upward nature of these regressive-transgressive fluvial-deltaic
   sequences and the purported confining capabilities of the shallow clay
   layers within them, this area would seem to be ideal for the location of
   surface waste landfills. However, detailed geologic mapping at a site in
   southeastern Louisiana documents how the three-dimensional distribution
   of sediment types and early diagenetic features, both of which were
   ultimately controlled by depositional history, can increase effective
   vertical permeability of fine-grained sequences. Many bodies of sand
   that appear to be isolated in standard geotechnical cross sections can
   be shown to be part of spatially complex three-dimensional distributary
   networks, with fine-grained sediments representing overbank and
   backswamp deposits. Some clay layers are actually a composite of thinner
   clay beds, each subjected to subaerial exposure and the development of
   secondary porosity related to soil formation. There has been documented
   leakage of wastes down through the clays, and a recent study indicates
   that the effective vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers
   exceeds 10(-5) cm s(-1), or from one to four orders of magnitude higher
   than values measured on samples-from cores of the same sediment. An
   understanding of the depositional framework, facies architecture, and
   diagenetic history of geologic materials underlying waste disposal sites
   in Louisiana is required for rational development of monitoring and
   remediation plans.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Although Helicobacter pylori has already been
   declared a human carcinogen, the exact nature of the association with
   gastric cancer remains to be explored, The aim of this study was to
   determine if the association is confined to specific types of gastric
   cancer. Methods: The prevalence of H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibodies
   (HM-CAP immunoassay; Enteric Products Inc., Westbury, NY) was determined
   in prospectively collected sera from 279 patients with gastric cancer,
   Results: The overall prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity was 77\%.
   The prevalence of H. pylori infection was significantly lower among
   patients with tumors of the gastric cardia compared with those with
   other gastric locations. Age-adjusted H. pylori seroprevalence among
   patients with the intestinal type of gastric cancer tended to be higher
   than among those with the diffuse type according to Lauren (P > 0.05),
   In both histological types, the seroprevalence decreased with increasing
   age, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high age and
   proximal tumor location were independent predictors of absence of H.
   pylori. Conclusions: The association with H. pylori infection is similar
   regardless of the histological features of the tumor, whereas it is
   stronger for noncardiac gastric cancer than for cardiac cancer, The
   apparent loss of H. pylori seropositivity among patients with gastric
   cancer is determined by age rather than tumor stage.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to see the relationship between changes in
   pulmonary venous flow velocities and those in transmitral flow
   velocities during the first day of life. A serial Doppler
   echocardiography was performed in 24 normal neonates at 2, 12, and 24
   hours of age. The size of the ductus arteriosus was 4.3 +/- 0.5 mm at 2
   hours and 2.1 +/- 0.7 mm at 12 hours, and closed in 21 of 24 neonates at
   24 hours. The peak systolic pulmonary venous flow (peak S), peak
   diastolic pulmonary venous flow (peak D), peak D/S, peak velocity at
   early diastolic filling (peak E), and peak E/A, which were high at 2
   hours, decreased significantly at 12 hours but remained constant
   thereafter. The size of the ductus arteriosus was found to be correlated
   with peak S, peak D, and peak D/S. There was a direct correlation
   between peaks E and D (r: 0.64, p < 0.01) as well as a direct
   correlation between peaks E/A and D/S (r: 0.36, p < 0.05). These results
   indicate that the diastolic pulmonary venous flow is determined by the
   same factors that influence the transmitral flow. These waveforms may
   reflect the increase in pulmonary circulatory volume by left-to-right
   shunting through the ductus arteriosus. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons,

Abstract = {{We examine the origins of metal impurities in Czochralski (Ct)
   single-crystal silicon in order to develop improved crystal purification
   techniques. We calculate the mass of metal impurities incorporated into
   molten silicon from each origin during crystal growth and estimate the
   concentration of impurities in the molten silicon and single-crystal
   silicon. To confirm these results, we analyze a sample of the residual
   melt after crystal growth. By comparing the calculated and experimental
   results, it is shown that the main origins of Al and Ni are probably the
   quartz crucible and polysilicon, respectively, while Fe originates from
   both. The calculated concentration of Fe and Ni in single-crystal
   silicon is 10(8)-10(9) cm(-3), and that of Al is 10(11)-10(12) cm(-3).
   We confirm that the concentrations of Fe and Ni can be reduced by using
   high-purity silicon as a raw material.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of mesangial IgA deposits in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains
   obscure. A significant proportion of deposited immunoglobulin is dimeric
   (J chain-positive). Previous studies of J chain expression within
   lymphoid tissue in IgAN have utilized antibodies which other
   investigators have found to be non-specific. To address this problem, we
   have developed an in situ hybridization (ISH) method for the detection
   of J chain mRNA within IgA plasma cells. Tonsils from 12 patients with
   IgAN and 12 controls were studied using (i) non-isotopic ISH for J chain
   mRNA, and (ii) combined immunofluorescence (IF) and fluorescent ISH. J
   chain mRNA-positive cells were identified in germinal centres, and
   within the subepithelial and interfollicular zones. A greater number of
   J chain mRNA-positive cells were found in the germinal centres of
   patients (mean 57.7 +/- 4.6 cells/10(5) mu m(2)) compared with controls
   (mean 36.9 +/- 3.5 cells/10(5) mu m(2)) (P < 0.001). Combined IF and
   fluorescent ISH showed a greater proportion of J chain mRNA-positive
   interfollicular IgA cells in patient tonsils (32 +/- 3.4\%) compared
   with controls (21 +/- 2.3\%; P < 0.02). These results indicate a shift
   towards dimeric IEA production in the tonsils in IgAN. In addition, the
   finding of excess numbers of J chain-positive IgA-negative cells within
   germinal centres suggests that an abnormality may be present at the B
   cell differentiation stage before IgA switching. These results further
   highlight immune abnormalities within the tonsil as a central feature of
   abnormal polymeric IgA biology in this common form of
   glomerulonephritis.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between concepts of disability, group membership and

   level. Findings from studies of self-concept have shown little evidence
   of a sense of belonging. It was suggested that people with learning
   difficulties may prefer not to identify with this social group because
   of the negative effect it may have on their self-esteem. The analysis
   based on intergroup and social identity theories proposed that people
   with learning difficulties may be encouraged in creating a positive
   self-concept by abandoning the IQ criterion for social categorisation;
   softening the boundaries between disabled and non-disabled people; and

   cirrus clouds MCLD 123.5+24.9 and MCLD 126.6+24.5. The emission is quite
   intense and extends over several arcmin. Since the SO (N-J = 1(0) -->
   0(1)) line is most likely optically thick, we can only derive a lower
   limit for the cloud averaged column densities N(SO) > 10(13) cm(-2).
   Both cores have also been mapped in the (CO)-C-13 (J = 3 --> 2)
   transition using the KOSMA 3 m telescope. Applying an escape propability
   model to match the observed line strength of this transition and of
   already published (J = 1 --> 0) data gives column densities in the range
   2.0 10(15) cm(-2) less than or equal to N((CO)-C-13) +/- 6.010(15)
   cm(-2) and volume densities in the ran ge of 0.5 10(4) cm(-3) less than

   the SO column densities with the Hz column densities derived from these

Abstract = {{We have used monoclonal antibodies to perform confocal light microscopic
   immunolocalization of KRP((85/95)), a heterotrimeric plus-end-directed
   microtubule motor protein, in dividing cells of sea urchin embryos,
   Embryos were stained during the first division cycle, and dissociated
   blastomeres were stained at the 32- to 64-cell stages. Double labeling
   of the dividing cells with anti-tubulin and anti-KRP((85/95) showed a
   clear concentration of the motor protein in the mitotic apparatus;
   KRP((85/95)) appeared to associate with pericentriolar regions during
   prophase, with kinetochore-to-pole microtubules during metaphase, and,
   in a striking fashion, with the spindle interzone during anaphase.
   KRP((85/95)) began to accumulate in the interzone immediately following
   chromosome separation and the area of concentration expanded with the
   lengthening of the interzonal region during anaphase, During telophase
   KRP((85/95)), appeared to disperse with the establishment of the
   cleavage furrow and did not concentrate in the midbody. KRP((85/95)))
   Staining in the mitotic apparatus was punctate and detergent-sensitive,
   suggesting an association with membranous vesicles, but unlike kinesin,
   KRP((85/95)) did not appear to codistribute with
   calsequestrin-containing endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, KRP((85/95))
   appears to be present in dividing blastomeres up to at least the
   blastula stage, but, unlike kinesin, it is not expressed in terminally
   differentiated, nonmitotic coelomocytes of the adult animal. These
   results suggest that the expression and targeting of KRP((85/95)), and
   kinesin differ and that KRP((85/95)) may play a role in vesicle
   transport during embryonic cell division. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Threshold values are of prime importance in providing a sound basis for
   public health decisions. A key issue is determining threshold or maximum
   exposure values For pollutants and assessing their potential health
   risks. Environmental epidemiology could be instrumental in assessing
   these levels, especially since the assessment of ambient exposures
   involves relatively low concentrations of pollutants. This paper
   presents a statistical method that allows the determination of threshold
   values as well as the assessment of the associated risk using a
   retrospective, longitudinal study design with a prospective follow-up.
   Morbidity data were analyzed using the Fourier method, a time-series
   analysis that is based on the assumption of a high temporal resolution
   of the data. This method eliminates time-dependent responses like
   temporal inhomogeneity and pseudocor-relation. The frequency of calls
   for respiratory distress conditions to the regional Mobile Medical
   Emergency Service (MMES) in the city of Leipzig were investigated. The
   entire population of Leipzig served as a pool for data collection. In
   addition to the collection of morbidity data, air pollution measurements
   were taken every 30 min for the entire study period using sulfur dioxide
   as the regional indicator variable. This approach allowed the
   calculation of a dose-response curve for respiratory diseases and air
   pollution indices in children and adults. Significantly higher
   morbidities were observed above a 24-hr mean value of 0.6 mg SO2/m(3)
   air for children and 0.8 mg SO2/m(3) for adults. Using the derived
   threshold value, the attributable risk for respiratory disease for
   children exposed to an increase, for example, from 0.6 to 1.2 mg
   SO2/m(3) air (24-hr mean) (i.e., a doubling of the threshold level) was
   30/10,000. For adults this risk was 2/10,000.}},

Abstract = {{When mice were infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
   by the intra-tracheal route, there was an early phase of adrenal
   hyperplasia, histologically resembling the adrenocorticotropic
   (ACTH)-driven changes seen in Cushing's disease. This was followed at 3
   weeks by progressive atrophy until the weight of the adrenals was
   similar to 50\% of that seen in control uninfected mice, in spite of the
   fact that the adrenals were not infected. All layers of the adrenal
   cortex were affected, but the medulla was normal. Electron microscope
   studies revealed apoptosis. The switch from adrenal hyperplasia to
   adrenal atrophy corresponded to onset of an IgG1 response recognising a
   wide range of mycobacterial components in Western blots. Delayed type
   hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were seen throughout, but differed in
   their sensitivity to TNF alpha. Thus if TNF alpha was injected at 24 h
   into DTH sites elicited during the phase of adrenal hyperplasia, there
   was no increment in swelling at 48 h. However similar injections of TNF
   alpha resulted in a doubling of the swelling in DTH sites elicited
   during the phase of adrenal atrophy. This may be relevant to the
   pathogenesis of cytokine-mediated tissue damage in the human disease. If
   2 months before mice received the intratracheal infection, they were
   pre-immunised with 1 X 10(7) autoclaved Mycobacterium vaccae, a stimulus
   previously shown to induce a Th1 pattern of response, the early increase
   in adrenal weight was attenuated and delayed, and the subsequent atrophy
   did not occur. In sharp contrast, pre-immunisation with 1 x 10(9)
   autoclaved M. vaccae, known to prime a mixed pattern of cytokine release
   (IFN gamma and IL-4), resulted in adrenal atrophy that began within 4
   days of infection, and was complete by day 14. These results suggested
   that the pattern of cytokine release provoked by the infection,
   modulated the adrenal changes, perhaps in synergy with products derived
   from the organisms themselves. Since we have already shown that profound
   adrenal changes also occur in human tuberculosis, we now propose that a
   change somewhere in the cytokine-hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may
   underlie the T cell dysfunction and immunologically-mediated tissue
   damage in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses local policy restructuring as a direct response to
   economic change. Using capital expenditure on local economic development
   initiatives by nine cities in England and Germany for the period 1980 to
   1990, a general, if varying shift towards locality-specific measures
   could be observed. These findings support arguments elsewhere in favour
   of more diverse and flexible modes of regulation. The international
   comparison revealed th relatively stronger impact of local policy-makers
   on the type of policy responses than the national policy-making
   environment. Thus, similarities between favoured policy initiatives went
   across international boundaries, suggesting a distinct role for the
   local state in a `flexible' economic world.}},

Abstract = {{(CaxBay)F-2(x:y=7:3, 1:1 and 3:7)/n-type InP (100)
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures were investigated by
   means of capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) to study the effect of the molar ratio (x:y) of the
   fluoride films on the quality of the interface between the fluoride and
   InP. The fluoride films were deposited on the InP substrates by
   co-evaporating CaF2 and BaF2 powders in a vacuum of about 1-2 x 10(-6)
   Torr. The best C-V characteristics were obtained fur the lattice-matched
   (CaBa)F-2 (Ca:Ba= 1:1 in molar ratio)/InP and the next-best, for the
   (CaBa)F-2 (Ca:Ba=7:3)/InP MIS structures, On the other hand, poor C-V
   characteristics were obtained for the (CaBa)F-2 (Ca:Ba=3:7)/InP and the
   SrF2/InP structures, though their lattice matchings were better than
   that of the (CaBa)F-2 (Ca:Ba=7:3)/InP structure, It is therefore
   concluded that the lattice matching: between the fluoride film and the
   InP substrate is probably the most important factor for obtaining a
   good-quality interface; however, the presence of a fair amount of the
   `'stable'' Ca-P bonds is also effective to obtain a stable interface
   between fluoride and InP. The XPS data indicated that fluoride films
   with distinct and uniform chemical compositions were formed from the top
   surface to the interface with the InP substrate even by the conventional
   vacuum evaporation technique. The peak binding energy of the XPS signal
   from the Ba 3d core level shifts to the lower energy side, while that
   from the Ca 2p core level shifts to the higher energy side with increase
   in the ratio of Ba to Ca, These shifts are nearly linear with the change
   of the mixed molar ratio. These findings can be explained by a
   difference in ionic radii between Ba and Ca in the fluorite structure
   and indicate that the molar ratios in the fluoride films are the same as
   the mixed molar ratios of the source powders. Native oxides of InP such
   as In2O3; InPO3 and InPO4 were found to be removed or reduced by the
   fluoride films during or after deposition of these films. A small amount
   of oxygen was included in the fluoride film, indicating that the
   fluoride film reduced the native oxide of InP and became oxidized
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-one monkeys were randomly divided into three groups to undergo
   baseline cerebral angiography followed by induction of subarachnoid
   hemorrhage by placement of autologous blood clot along the right-sided
   arteries of the anterior circle of Willis (Day 0). The monkeys were then
   given drug vehicle or one of two endothelin (ET) antagonists, BQ-123 (6
   mg/kg/day) or bosentan (5 mg/kg/day) intracisternally. The BQ-123 was
   administered by continuous infusion from a subcutaneous pump and the
   bosentan was given by twice-daily injections into an Ommaya reservoir in
   the subcutaneous space with a catheter along the right middle cerebral
   artery (MCA). Seven days later (Day 7), angiography was repeated and the
   animals were killed. Comparison of arterial diameters shown on
   angiograms between Day 0 and Day 7 groups given placebo and bosentan
   showed significant reductions in the diameters of the right intradural
   internal carotid (28\% +/- 6\% and 30\% +/- 6\%, respectively, paired
   t-test, p < 0.05), anterior cerebral artery (29\% +/- 8\% and 32\%, +/-
   6\% respectively +/- 6\%, respectively) and MCA (34\% +/- 6\% and 46\%
   +/- 4\%, respectively). Animals injected with BQ-123 had significant
   narrowing of the right extradural internal carotid artery (7\% +/- 6\%)
   and the basilar artery (11\% +/- 3\%), but not of the right MCA.
   Comparison of arterial diameters between groups at Day 7 showed
   significant variance in the right extradural internal carotid, both
   intradural internal carotid, right middle cerebral, and left anterior
   cerebral arteries; the animals injected with BQ-123 developed
   significantly less arterial narrowing these those receiving bosentan and
   placebo. Bosentan was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid aspirated
   from the cisterna magna on Day 7, whereas BQ-123 was detected in two
   animals. We can infer from these results that BQ-123 prevents vasospasm
   following subarachnoid hemorrhage in monkeys, that further
   investigations of ET antagonists are warranted, and that ET may be an
   important pathophysiological mediator of vasospasm. The lack of efficacy
   of bosentan may be related to inadequate cerebrospinal fluid levels
   obtained by administration twice-daily through an Ommaya reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The decrease in diffusive conductance of a leaf exposed to water stress
   or to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) was smaller in leaves of sunflower
   plants (Helianthus annuus L. cv. NK285) that had been grown in a
   phytotron in humid air than in leaves of sunflowers grown outdoors.
   Stomata of the phytotron-grown plants were slower to close after
   detachment of a leaf than those of the outdoor plants. When stomata
   closed rapidly, as they did in detached leaves and after treatment with
   ABA, the extent of closure was varied over the leaf's surface, in
   particular in the case of phytotron-grown plants, and the extent of the
   heterogeneity was greater in the phytotron-grown plants than in the
   outdoor plants. When stomata closed gradually, for example, under
   conditions of limited moisture in the soil, closure occurred uniformly
   over leaves of plants of both types. The smaller decrease in diffusive
   conductance of leaves from phytotron-grown plants after treatment with
   ABA resulted from the presence of patches on the surface in which
   stomata remained open. The smaller decrease of diffusive conductance in
   the phytotron-grown plants under conditions of limited moisture in the
   soil resulted from the uniformly lower responsiveness of stomata on a
   leaf to the decrease in water potential. When estimates are made of the
   intercellular concentration of CO2 (Ci) from gas-exchange measurements,
   heterogeneity in stomatal closure should be monitored when stomata close
   rapidly, in particular in plants grown in humid air, because
   heterogeneous stomatal closure can lead to overestimates of Ci.}},

Abstract = {{We have evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of the xanthine
   derivatives HWA 138 (1-(5 hydroxy-5-methylhexyl)-3-methylxanthine) and A
   80 2715(1-(5 hydroxy-5-methylhexyl)-3-methyl-7-propylxanthine) on acute
   lung injury in endotoxemic pigs when administered following the septic
   insult. Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin (LPS) was given as a
   continuous intravenous infusion of 2 mu g/kg/h over a period of 8 h. 1 h
   after the start of the LPS infusion the animals received a bolus
   injection followed by continuous infusion of A 80 2715 (3 mg/kg + 1.5
   mg/kg/h; n = 6), HWA 138 (3 mg/kg + 1.5 mg/kg/h; n = 6), or saline (LPS
   control; n = 6). Treatment with A 80 2715 or HWA 138 inhibited the
   LPS-induced increases in the pulmonary artery pressure (p < .05; ANOVA)
   and in lung wet/dry weight ratio (p < .05), and ameliorated the
   LPS-induced deterioration in lung mechanics (decreased lung dynamic
   compliance (p < .05); increased peak airway pressure (p < .05)).
   Xanthine treatment, however, failed to significantly improve arterial
   Po-2 and did not affect peripheral leukopenia. The results of this study
   suggest a potential therapeutic role for HWA 138 and A 80 2715 in
   attenuating endotoxin-induced acute lung injury.}},

   presence of any PR increased the likelihood of other neurological
   findings (e.g. bradykinesia). Vascular dementia (VD) cases were more
   likely to have unilateral primitive PR than probable Alzheimer's disease
   (Pro AD) and Parkinson's dementia (PD) cases. PD cases were more likely
   to have glabellar and traction responses. While more common among the
   demented, PR lacked sufficient sensitivity to be an early diagnostic

Abstract = {{In low-cost integrated circuit (IC) packaging, a thin layer of adhesive
   is often used to bond the die to a leadframe or substrate, Because of
   the poor thermal conductivity of the adhesive, a thick layer wilt result
   in elevated chip temperatures. However, due to the differential
   expansion between the silicon and metal, a thin layer will result in
   high shear stress, in the adhesive, and along the bonded surfaces.
   In this study, first order thermal and thermostructural analytical
   relations for shear stress are used to determine the appropriate
   thickness of the adhesive layer between a die and a leadframe paddle, as
   encountered In PDIP packages, Numerical simulation, with finite element
   (FE) models, Is used to examine the assumptions underpinning the
   analytical relations and to verify the analytical results, Using a
   filled-epoxy with an adhesion strength of 25 MPa, adhesive layer
   thicknesses between 0.027 and 0.2 mm are found to be suitable for this
   application, Assuming equal loss of reliability, due to chip temperature
   increases and shear stress increases, an optimum die-bond thickness of
   0.16 mm is found, The FE computations appear to support the assumption
   that elevated shear stress is the most likely cause of die-bond
   structural failure for this subject package.}},

Abstract = {{In these studies, platelet ageing during in vitro at 22 degrees C was
   compared with in vivo ageing using isotope labelling. Paired fresh and
   5-d-stored platelets had a mean residual life-span (MRL) of 4.8 +/- 0.7
   d and 3.2 +/- 0.9 d, respectively. After 2.1 +/- 0.4 d in vive
   circulation, the MRL of the fresh platelets was equivalent to that of
   the 5-d-stored in vitro platelets. This suggests that platelet ageing
   for 5 d in vitro at 22 degrees C corresponds to 2.1 d in vivo ageing at
   37 degrees C. Thus, the relative ageing at 22 degrees C in vitro was
   (2.1 d/5 d) = 0.42 of that at 37 degrees C in vivo. A similar ageing
   ratio (0.44) was obtained by measurement of the decrease in MRL during
   storage at 22 degrees C of platelets stored for 1, 5, 7, 10 and 14 d
   relative to the decrease in MRL of fresh platelets in vive, ATP turnover
   rate at 22 degrees C was compared to the rate of 37 degrees C by
   measurement of the rates of platelet oxygen consumption and lactate
   production in vitro. In vitro ATP turnover at 22 degrees C versus 37
   degrees C, was found to be 10.5 +/- 1.0 versus 21.6 +/- 1.4 mu
   mol/10(12) plts/min, respectively. Thus, the ATP turnover ratio (0.48)
   at these two temperatures suggests that the relative decrease in ageing

   decrease in metabolic rate at this temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of a 7-day pilot monitoring study on the anionic surfactant,
   LAS, at the Yorkshire Water Service's Owlwood activated sludge sewage
   treatment works (STW) is described. The average concentration of LAS
   found in daily flow related composites of raw sewage was 15.1 mg l(-1)
   (range 11.8-18.2 mg l(-1)). The calculated per capita use of the
   surfactant at Owlwood of 4.5 g/d/person agrees closely with the
   predicted use of LAS in Western Europe (ca 4.0 g/dip). Distinct diurnal
   variations in the raw sewage LAS concentrations were observed (3.7-31.8
   mg l(-1)) and were apparent to a lesser degree in the treated effluent.
   The removal of the organic load (measured as BOD) and LAS at the works
   were both very high, 98 and 99.9\% respectively. Hence, very low
   concentrations of LAS were discharged to the associated Sheffield Beck
   in the treated effluent (average daily composite of 10.4 mu g l(-1)).
   Unexpectedly, the river upstream of the discharge was found to
   contribute a higher load of LAS to the river downstream than the Owlwood
   effluent. The average daily composite LAS concentration in the river
   below the mixing zone of the STW was 27 mu g l(-1) (range 9.4-47 mu g
   l(-1)). The concentrations of LAS found on sediments in the immediate
   vicinity of the STW were very small (< 1 mu g g(-1)). The implications
   of the study findings for the Standing Committer of Analysts (SCA)
   methodology used for the analysis of LAS and the design of further
   monitoring exercises on surfactants are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the reported study was to investigate the reproducibility of
   the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay in the determination of
   DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and to estimate the statistical
   requirements when the SCGE assay is used for the detection of
   genotoxicity in humans. In human peripheral mononuclear leukocytes
   (PMLs), we repeatedly measured the rate of SSBs after in vitro
   incubation of cells for 1 h at 4 degrees C in phosphate buffered saline
   (PBS, basal) or 10 mu M or 50 mu M H2O2 (induced). Intra-assay variation
   was determined from cryopreserved PMLs of a single donor. To assess
   intrasubject and intersubject variation, PMLs of ten healthy, nonsmoking
   subjects (aged 19-37 years) were tested 5-9 times. Cryopreserved cells
   revealed a mean coefficient of variation of 18\% (PBS) and 7\%-9\%
   (H2O2). There were statistically significant differences between
   individuals in the rate of SSBs after incubation in PBS (P < 0.01), 10
   mu M H2O2 (P < 0.001), and 50 mu M H2O2 (P < 0.001). The range of
   interindividual variability was 26\% for basal and 12\%-13\% for induced
   SSBs, and the coefficient of intra-individual variation was 18\%-72\%
   (PBS) and 7\%-23\% (H2O2). Neither basal nor induced rates of DNA damage
   were related to gender or age. Estimates of the minimum detectable
   effects were based on these observed sources of variability (power 90\%,
   level of significance 5\%, assumed sample size 50). With two different
   groups, a difference of 31\% in basal SSBs or 12\% in induced SSBs would
   be detectable. Repeated measurement within one group could detect a
   difference of 26\% in basal and 9\% in induced SSBs. In summary, the
   SCGE assay appears to be suitable for the detection of single-strand
   breaks, e.g., in biomonitoring or environmental medicine, and the
   statistical requirements could be derived from our analysis of the
   sources of variability.}},

Abstract = {{We prospectively followed 68 patients diagnosed as idiopathic
   interstitial pneumonia (IIP) over a period of 1-11 years. Thirteen
   patients (19\%) subsequently developed systemic manifestations of
   collagen vascular diseases (CVD) and were diagnosed as having had
   interstitial pneumonia as the sole presentation of CVD (CVD-IP).
   Compared with the 55 IIP patients, the 13 CVD-IP patients were
   relatively younger, predominantly female, and had a lower incidence of
   dust inhalation in their history. They also had a higher erythrocyte
   sedimentation rate, higher incidence of the x-ray finding of discoid
   atelectasis in the lower lung fields, and a better prognosis than the
   IIP patients. However, these features did not clearly distinguish the
   two groups. We conclude that the patients clinically and/or
   histologically defined as suffering from IIP cannot be distinguished
   from CVD-IP patients before systemic signs of CVD appear in the latter
   group.}},

Abstract = {{A pooled analysis of 10 studies was undertaken to compare the efficacy
   of azithromycin with that of other oral antimicrobial agents in the
   treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Data from a
   total of 430 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia were
   analyzed; 222 received azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg once
   daily for 4 days), and 208 received other antimicrobial agents
   (cefaclor, erythromycin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or
   josamycin) at approved dosages. Clinical success (cure or improvement)
   was recorded in 88.2\% of patients treated with azithromycin and 87.7\%
   of assessable comparator patients. In patients >60 years of age,
   clinical success rates were lower than rates in patients less than or
   equal to 60 years for both treatment groups. Radiologic data also showed
   similar efficacy in the two treatment groups, with clearing or
   improvement of radiologic appearance recorded in 90.0\% (171 of 190
   patients) and 91.9\% (158 of 172 patients) of azithromycin- and
   comparator-treated patients, respectively. Both treatment groups had
   similar bacteriologic efficacy, with eradication rates of 88.1\% in the
   azithromycin-treated patients and 86.6\% in the comparator-treated
   patients. Relatively low mortality rates were recorded in both groups;
   mortality was 0.5\% (1 of 212 patients) in the azithromycin patients,
   and 1.5\% (3 of 195 patients) in the comparator patients. All comparator
   patients who died were >60 years of age and taking cefaclor; no patient
   died as a result of pneumonia. Pneumococcal bacteremia occurred in 5
   patients receiving azithromycin and 4 patients receiving comparators;
   clinical cure was achieved in 4 of 5 azithromycin patients and in 4 of 4
   patients receiving comparators. In conclusion, azithromycin is effective
   in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are
   candidates for treatment with oral antibiotics. A 5-day course of
   azithromycin offers equivalent efficacy to 7- to 10-day, multiple daily
   dose treatment with other oral antimicrobial agents.}},

Abstract = {{A prototypic Ca2+-mobilizing hormone receptor, alpha(1)-adrenergic
   receptor (alpha(1)AR), stimulates cAMP accumulation. The mechanism
   underlying this phenomenon was previously suggested to be secondary to
   phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis-protein kinase C activation in some
   cells. We transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells with hamster
   alpha(1B)AR cDNA and isolated cells stably expressing alpha(1B)AR (CHO
   alpha(1B) cells). We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the
   alpha(1)AR-mediated cAMP production in the CHO alpha(1B) cells.
   Norepinephrine (NE) stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization and
   cAMP production through alpha(1B)AR. Pretreatment with a phospholipase C
   inhibitor, U-73,122 (10 mu M), abolished the NE-induced intracellular
   calcium response, whereas it did not affect the NE-stimulated cAMP
   production. Treatment with various agents (protein kinase C inhibitors,
   calcium ionophore, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, or pertussis toxin) had
   little effect on the NE-induced cAMP production. The parent CHO and CHO
   alpha(1B) cells contained similar amounts of G(s alpha) (42 and 45 kDa,
   respectively), as detected with immunoblot analysis, and exhibited
   similar extents of cAMP synthesis with cholera toxin and forskolin.
   Adenylyl cyclase activity in the CHO alpha(1B) cell membranes was also
   enhanced by NE. Furthermore, incubation of CHO alpha(1B) cell membranes
   with antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of G(s
   alpha) inhibited the NE-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Taken
   together, the results indicate that the alpha(1B)AR-mediated cAMP
   synthesis in CHO alpha(1B) cells reflects direct stimulation of
   G(s)-adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, the alpha(1)AR-stimulated cAMP
   production observed in some native tissues may involve the multiple
   mechanisms of the direct activation of G(s)-adenylyl cyclase and a
   secondary effect through activation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac output (CO) during exercise can be determined noninvasively by
   using the indirect Fick CO2-rebreathing technique. CO2 measurements for
   this technique are usually performed with an infrared analyzer (IA) or
   mass spectrometer (MS). However, IA CO2 measurements are susceptible to
   underreading in the face of high O-2 concentrations because of collision
   broadening. We compared an IA (Ametek model CD-3A) with a MS (Marquette
   model MGA-1100) to see the effect this would have on mixed venous PCO2
   (PVCO2) and CO measurements. After calibration with room air and a gas
   mixture of 5\% CO2-12\% O-2-83\% N-2, both devices were tested with
   three different gas mixtures of CO2 in O-2. For each gas mixture, IA
   gave lower CO2 values than did the MS (4.1\% CO2: IA, 3.85 +/- 0.01\%
   and MS, 4.13 +/- 0.01\%; 9.2\% CO2: IA, 8.44 +/- 0.07\% and MS, 9.19 +/-
   0.01\%; 13.8\% CO2: IA, 12.57 +/- 0.15\% and MS, 13.82 +/- 0.01\%).
   Warming and humidifying the gases did not alter the results. The IA gave
   lower values than did the MS for eight other medical gases in lower
   concentrations of O-2 (40-50\%). Equilibrium and exponential rebreathing
   procedures were performed. Values determined by the IA were > 10\%
   higher than those determined by the MS for both rebreathing methods. We
   conclude that all IAs must be checked for collision broadening if they
   are to be used in environments where the concentration of O-2 is >21\%.
   If collision broadening is present, then either a special high O-2-CO2
   calibration curve must be constructed, or the IA should not be used for
   both arterial PCO2 and PVCO2 estimates because it may produce
   erroneously low PVCO2 values, with resultant overestimation of CO.}},

   modules are infinitely generated, torsion free, but not free. These
   examples stand in stark contrast to R(3) whose (2, infinity)-skein
   module is free on one generator. To each of these manifolds we associate
   a subgroup G of the rationals which may be interpreted via wrapping
   numbers. We show that the skein module of M has a natural filtration by

   representation into the standard form so that we are able to compute the
   explicit forms of the important quantities in the bicovariant
   differential calculus on SUq(N), such as the q-deformed structure
   constant C-IJ(K) and the q-deformed transposition operator Lambda. From
   the q-gauge covariant condition we study the generalized q-deformed
   Killing form and construct the mth q-deformed Chern class P-m for the
   quantum groups SUq(N). In terms of the q-deformed homotopy operator we
   are able to compute the q-deformed Chern-Simons Q(2m-1) by the condition
   dQ(2m-1)=P-m. Furthermore, the q-deformed cocycle hierarchy, the
   q-deformed gauge covariant Lagrangian, and the q-deformed Yang-Mills
   equation are derived. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a data set from 164 permanent sample plots, an age-independent
   individual tree diameter increment model is presented for white spruce
   (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) grown in the boreal mixed-species stands in
   Alberta. The model is age independent in that it does not explicitly
   require tree or stand age as input variables. Periodic diameter
   increment is modelled as a function of tree diameter at breast height,
   total tree height, relative competitiveness of the tree in the stand,
   species composition, stand density, and site productivity. Because data
   from permanent sample plots are considered time series and cross
   sectional, diagnostic techniques were applied to identify the model's
   error structure. Appropriate fit based on the identified error structure
   was accomplished using weighted nonlinear least squares with a
   first-order autoregressive process. Results show that (1) all model
   parameters are significant at alpha = 0.05 level, and (2) the plot of
   studentized residuals against predicted diameter increment shows no
   consistent underestimate or overestimate for diameter increment. The
   model was also tested on an independent data set representing the
   population on which it is to be used. Results show that the average
   prediction biases are not significant at alpha = 0.05 level, indicating
   that the model appropriately describes the data and performs well when
   predictions are made.}},

Abstract = {{For the past 20 years, the gender treatment team formed under the
   auspices of the University of Texas Medical Branch Hospitals has treated
   121 male individuals with gender identification disorders. The age of
   this group ranged between 18 and 71 years, with an average of 32.3
   years. While all of them were seen regularly for 6 months after surgery,
   only 68 were followed for a year or longer.
   The regimen of surgical treatment that consisted of procedures of
   bilateral orchiectomy, penectomy with relocation of the urethral meatus,
   labial reconstruction, and neovaginoplasty was used for all patients.
   The castration procedure used between 1972 and 1977 included removal of
   both the testes and the spermatic cord. The corpora cavernosa were
   transected at the pubic symphysis. For vaginal reconstruction, a
   partial-thickness skin graft was used frequently, in conjunction with a
   skin flap fashioned from the penile skin, to line the neovaginal vault.
   Modifications and changes in technique were, however, introduced in
   1978. Skin flaps mobilized from the inguinoperineal area instead of a
   partial-thickness skin graft were used to line the vaginal cavity. A
   proximal segment of the corpora cavernosa was retained to reconstruct a
   clitoris. In addition, the spermatic cord was incorporated into the
   reconstruction of labia majora. These technical modifications
   substantially reduced the incidence of vaginal stenosis and improved the
   external appearance of the genitalia. The experience accumulated from
   managing this group of patients forms the basis of this report.}},

   zigzag lines and dissociation of main domain walls are observed. A
   statistical analysis of the different magnetic domain patterns has been
   made. An evolution in three distinct linear stages of the superficial
   densities of main and secondary structures is shown. Domain wall spacing
   of the main structure markedly decreases between 0 and 3\% of strains
   and monotonous fall of domain wall spacing of the transverse patterns
   occurs. These experimental results establish that the transverse domain
   structure allows a compensation of the increase of the magnetoelastic

Abstract = {{As part of the Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS), 6096 adults from a
   representative sample of community residents completed a standardized
   questionnaire which elicited psychiatric symptoms - the General Health
   Questionnaire (GHQ-30) of Goldberg (1972). Their survival status at 7
   years was determined, and 474 had died. Respondents whose GHQ score was
   above the conventional threshold (4/5), used when screening for
   psychiatric disorder, were 60\% more likely to die over the 7-year
   interval than respondents whose GHQ score was below threshold (risk
   ratio 1.64 for men and 1.58 for women). The differences were
   statistically significant for both sexes when the effects of age,
   physical disorder, social class and smoking behaviour were taken into
   account. Personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion) were not related
   to mortality, neither was self-reported difficulty in sleeping. However,
   a low subjective rating of one's general health was associated with
   increased mortality. We explored a range of cut-points and found
   reliable effects for both sexes at all cut-points from 3/4 to 6/7.
   Possible differences related to natural versus unnatural causes of death
   were explored and found not to explain the results. The findings from
   this general population study confirm that it is not only psychiatric
   disorders, but also psychiatric symptoms, which are associated with
   subsequent mortality, and thereby reinforce the importance of
   appropriate intervention to alleviate these symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{This study reviews significant state and federal laws that can be used
   to protect karst, caves, and associated unique minerals and biota. The
   first state cave protection act was passed in Colorado in 1883;
   unfortunately it was repealed in 1971. From that modest beginning there
   are now a total of 22 states, Puerto Rico, and the Cherokee Nation that
   have specific cave protection acts. Most of these have been legislated
   during the last 20 years. There are a number of laws on the federal
   level that can be used for cave protection. The most important of these
   is the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988, which mandates
   cave conservation for many federal land management agencies. The
   Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Federal Archaeological Resources
   Protection Act of 1976 can also be of significant use in the
   conservation of caves on federal land. The effects of these acts are
   variable. One factor is how important agency officials and law
   enforcement officers regard caves. It has not been unusual that little
   was done in the way of protection or prosecution even when the
   perpetrators have been apprehended. This attitude is changing rapidly
   primarily because those involved in enforcing the laws have been
   educated to the uniqueness and values of caves and their contents.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is formed in the cornea after injury as
   well as by infiltrating inflammatory cells. We have studied the effects
   of PAF on the release and metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) in the
   rabbit cornea. Corneal lipids were labeled in vivo by injecting
   {[}H-3]AA and subsequently incubated in vitro with 100 nM PAF in the
   presence or absence of 10 mu M BN50727, a PAF antagonist. The AA and
   eicosanoids released by incubated corneas were analyzed by
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Tissue lipids were
   examined by mono- and bidimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
   Within 5 min, PAF stimulated AA release to 76\% above control levels.
   BN50727 inhibited the AA release elicited by PAF at all time points
   studied. The decreased content of {[}H-3]AA in phosphatidylcholine (PC),
   phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) following
   PAF exposure and the lack of stimulation by PAF on the release of
   {[}H-3] linoleic acid suggest that the cytosolic phospholipase A(2) was
   activated. PAF also stimulated depletion of AA from the inositol lipids,
   phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) and
   phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and increased content of
   {[}H-3]AA into diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA). This
   reaction indicates that PAF could also mediate activation of other
   phospholipases in the cornea. In addition, PAF preferentially stimulated
   the cyclooxygenase pathway. The PAF antagonist BN50727 mainly suppressed
   the PAF-stimulated release of PGE(2). The antagonist did not inhibit

Abstract = {{The breakdown of a magnetically enhanced microwave discharge in a
   metallic waveguide has been studied in argon plasmas depending on
   magnetic field, microwave power and gas pressure. A sharp transition
   between a localized discharge and a so-called running discharge has been
   observed on increasing the pressure in the pascal range at 100 W
   microwave input. The structure of the running discharge has been
   determined as a spatially limited plasma package of some 10 cm in
   length. It was possible to distinguish a primary ignition zone of about
   0.5 m and a running zone which was limited by the set-up at 3.0 m. The
   running velocity of the plasma package (about 10(4) m s(-1)) remains
   constant over all the running zone, while it increases with increasing
   microwave power and/or gas pressure. The running discharge has been
   employed as a novel thin -film deposition process for inner coating of
   metal tubes by means of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
   (PECVD). Amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) films were deposited over
   a length of 2.5 m on the inner wall of an assembled waveguide system.
   The average deposition rate from a running discharge in methane was 0.27
   Angstrom s(-1). An increase in the average deposition rate to 2.6
   Angstrom s(-1) was achieved using acetylene as process gas, while the
   H-to-C ratio in the a-C:H films remains nearly constant at one.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of macrophages (M phi) by low-dose irradiation (4cGy) was
   examined. The irradiated M phi were obtained from mice exposed to a low
   dose of gamma-rays. The addition of excess irradiated M phi suppressed
   more the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of splenocytes than that
   of unirradiated M phi. This was attributed to large nitric oxide (NO)
   production from irradiated M phi. In addition, low-dose irradiation
   augmented NO production and glucose consumption in M phi treated with
   interferon-gamma alone or interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide.
   Furthermore, low-dose-irradiated M phi showed a higher cytolytic
   activity against P-815 mastocytoma cells than unirradiated M phi,
   indicating that the NO production was involved in the activity. On the
   other hand, the M phi irradiated with a low dose in vitro did not
   enhance the NO production. These findings suggest that whole-body
   irradiation with a low dose of gamma-rays activates M phi indirectly and
   consequently enhances NO production from M phi, by which the
   self-defense systems such as the tumoricidal activity will be augmented.}},

Abstract = {{Growth (assessed from intermolt period and molt increment) and
   metabolism (oxygen consumption) of the post-larva of Euphausia pacifica
   from the southern Japan Sea were determined at seven graded temperatures
   ranging from 1 to 25 degrees C. The intermolt period shortened
   progressively as temperature increased from 1 to 20 degrees C, but an
   effect of temperature on molt-to-molt growth increment was not seen.
   Oxygen consumption rates were accelerated by the increase in temperature
   up to 20 degrees C. Beyond 20 degrees C, E.pacifica exhibited reduced
   oxygen consumption and died within 1 day without molting. After removing
   the effect of body size, the relationships between growth rate and
   temperature, and between oxygen consumption rate and temperature, were
   established. The carbon budget was calculated as a function of
   temperature. Because of differential effects of temperature on growth
   and metabolism, the net growth efficiency {[}K-2: growth x 100/(growth +
   metabolism)] changed with temperature. The optimum temperature at which
   Epacifica attained the maximum K-2 was 11.4 degrees C, which was derived
   from calculation of cumulative carbon invested in growth and metabolism
   in this animal. Tn an alternative method, the optimum temperature was
   obtained mathematically by solving a set of differential equations. The
   biological and ecological significance of the optimum temperature which
   leads to the maximum K-2 is discussed.}},

   improving most of the mechanical properties significantly The present

   These results were confirmed by autoradiographs showing that the INF

Abstract = {{Attaching and effacing adhesion to epithelial cells is a pathognomonic
   feature of infection by both enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)
   and certain strains of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC), EPEC
   adhesion to tissue culture epithelial cells results in activation of the
   phosphatidylinositol pathway, with elevated levels of inositol
   1,4,5-triphosphate and cytosolic free calcium. In this report, we show
   that VTEC also activate this signal transduction pathway in infected
   epithelial cells. Specifically, increased levels of inositol
   1,4,5-triphosphate and intracellular free calcium were observed in HEp-2
   cells infected with VTEC of serotype O157:H7, VTEC of serotypes O157:H7
   and 0113:H21 also induced increases in intracellular calcium levels in
   the human intestinal crypt-like cell line T84, even with minimal or no
   attaching and effacing activity as monitored by transmission electron
   microscopy. In contrast to EPEC, VTEC failed to induce tyrosine
   phosphorylation of epithelial cell proteins in HEp-2 and T84 cells, as
   determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. These findings
   suggest that signal transduction responses to VTEC, including elevated
   levels of inositol triphosphates and intracellular free calcium, are
   independent of formation of the attaching and effacing lesion. Our
   findings also show that VTEC pathogenesis may involve signal
   transduction pathways that are distinct from those induced by EPEC
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{During the first 10 days after birth in the rat there are a succession
   of major developmental stages in the retinotectal pathway. During most
   of this time, the only recordable event in the superior colliculus is
   spontaneous activity. We studied and characterized this spontaneous
   activity, hypothesizing that it could play an important role in pathway
   development. The spontaneous discharges are detectable on postnatal day
   5 (P5). After P5, the number of spontaneously active cells per
   penetration increases up to P10, after which they decrease to adult-like
   levels by P14-P15. Between P5 and P10, the spontaneous discharges
   exhibit several patterns of activity, from constant firing to
   intermittent bursts with periods of quiescence, without any bearing to
   age. We isolated the retina and superior colliculus by injecting
   xylocaine onto the optic nerve and found no change in collicular
   activity. While this suggests that the spontaneous activity in the
   colliculus is independent of the retina at the ages studied, the
   opposite experiment, i.e., electrically stimulating the optic nerve,
   resulted in increased firing by collicular neurons, perhaps via
   nonclassical synaptic transmission. Finally, we compared interval
   histograms for spontaneously active cells between P5 and P15. The
   histograms suggest that at certain ages, spontaneous firing is more
   regular; moreover, these ages precede major functional advances, e.g.,
   onset of numerous spontaneously firing cells at P6, the first response
   to optic nerve stimulation at P10, and the first light-evoked response
   at P12-P13. Our results support the hypothesis that spontaneous activity
   in the neonatal superior colliculus has a role in development of the
   retinotectal pathway, but the data also indicate that classical synaptic
   transmission is not involved.}},

Abstract = {{Lysozyme was purified from the homogenate of the whole body of house fly
   (Musca domestica) larvae by standard chromatographic techniques. The
   purified lysozyme was sequenced and its enzymatic properties were
   examined. This lysozyme was a chicken-type lysozyme composed of 122
   amino acids, showing about 75\% identity with fruit fly lysozymes and
   38\% with human lysozyme. This enzyme was inactive towards Micrococcus
   luteus under the physiological conditions of pH 7.0 and ionic strength
   0.1, but was as active towards glycol chitin as was hen lysozyme, The
   pH-dependent profile of lytic activity towards M. luteus showed that
   house fly lysozyme has an acidic pH optimum and shows no enzymatic
   activity above pH 7. These features are analogous with those of ruminant
   stomach lysozymes which have evolved for the digestive function,
   suggesting that this lysozyme does not function as a self-defense
   protein, like hen and human lysozyme, but as a digestive enzyme,
   probably in the gut of the insect body, Although a similar functional
   conversion to digestive enzyme was reported in fruit fly, phylogenetic
   tree analysis indicates that the evolutionary change of lysozyme to a
   digestive enzyme occurred similarly in fruit fly and house fly, but the
   events are not related and occurred independently in each strain. This
   observation is in contrast with the case of ruminant stomach lysozymes,
   which were recruited before the divergence of each species of ruminants.}},

   (0.64\%) units, of which 181 (57\%) were positive for HCV RNA. The cold
   activation of complement was detected in 170 (0.35\%) units, and HCV RNA

   combination of intermittent reperfusion and preischemic administration
   of L-NAME (10 mg/kg) resulted in a 65\% reduction in infarction size (p

Abstract = {{With the goal of examining the functional diversity of human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env genes within the peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells of an asymptomatic individual, we substituted
   four complete env genes into the replication-competent NL4-3 provirus,
   Despite encoding full-length open reading frames for gp120 and gp41 and
   the second coding exon of tat and rev, each chimera was replication
   defective. Site-directed mutagenesis of codon 78 in the Rev activation
   domain (from a hitherto unique Ile to the subtype B consensus Leu)
   partially restored infectivity for two of three chimeras tested.
   Similarly, mutagenesis of rev codon 78 of NL4-3 from Leu to Ile
   partially attenuated this virus. Ile-78 was found in all 13 clones
   examined from samples taken from this asymptomatic subject 4.5 years
   after infection, including 9 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
   4 from a virus isolate, as well as 4 additional clones each from
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampled 37 and 51 months later. We
   next examined conservation of the Rev activation domain within and among
   long-term survivors (LTS) and patients with AIDS, as well as
   T-cell-line-adapted strains of HIV-1. Putative attenuating mutations
   were found in a minority of sequences from all five LTS and two of four
   patients with AIDS. Of the 11 T-cell-line-adapted viruses examined, none
   had these changes. Among and within LTS, virus populations had
   marginally higher levels of diversity in Rev than in Env; patients with
   AIDS had similar levels of diversity in the two reading frames; and
   T-cell-line-adapted viruses had higher levels of diversity in Env. These
   results are consistent with the hypothesis that asymptomatic individuals
   harbor attenuated variants of HIV-1 which correlate with and contribute
   to their lack of disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{The hy4 mutant of Ar Arabidopsos thaliana (L.) Heynh. was previously
   shown to be impaired in the suppression of hypocotyl extension
   specifically by blue light. We report here that hy4 is altered in a
   range of blue-light-mediated extension-growth responses in various
   organs in seedlings and mature plants: it shows greater length of bolted
   stems, increased petiole extension and increased leaf width and area in
   blue light compared to the wild type. The hy4 mutant shows decreased
   cotyledon expansion in both red and blue light compared to the wild
   type. Anthocyanin formation and the expression of several flavonoid
   biosynthesis genes is stimulated by blue light in the wild type but to a
   much lower extent in hy4. The results indicate that the HY4 gene product
   is concerned with the perception of blue light in a range of
   extension-growth and gene-expression responses in Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMD) in suppressing the
   dynamic response of base excited structure for first mode vibration is
   investigated. The effectiveness of the MTMD is expressed by the ratio of
   the root mean square (RMS) displacement of the structure with MTMD to
   corresponding displacement without MTMD. The frequency content of base
   excitation is modelled as a broad-band stationary random process. The
   MTMD's with uniformly distributed natural frequencies are considered for
   this purpose. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the
   fundamental characteristics of the MTMD's and the effect of important
   parameters on the effectiveness of the MTMD's. The parameters include:
   the fundamental characteristics of the MTMD system such as damping, mass
   ratio, total number of MTMD, tuning frequency ratio, frequency spacing
   of the dampers and frequency content of the base excitation. It has been
   shown that MTMD can be more effective and more robust than a single TMD

Abstract = {{Purification of the lens fiber cell membrane proteins MP20 and MP26, and
   the partial co-purification of the lens connexin-related proteins MP70
   and connexin 46 has been achieved using anion- and cation-exchange
   chromatography of lens fiber cell membrane proteins solubilized in
   n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside). The apparent molecular
   weights of the solubilized protein-detergent complexes were
   significantly greater than that expected for the monomeric proteins. The
   purified proteins retained their ability to be phosphorylated by
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and to bind calmodulin in a calcium and
   magnesium dependent manner. The heterobifunctional covalent chemical
   crosslinking agent N-5-azido-2-nitro-benzoyloxysuccinimide (ANB-NOS),
   and the thiol oxidant cupric phenanthroline were used to identify the
   oligomeric states of these proteins. Crosslinking of either the purified
   proteins or native lens membranes generated a ladder of crosslinked MP20
   or MP26 homo-oligomers. The largest detectable crosslinked homo-oligomer
   of MP20 was at least a hexamer, while for MP26 the largest crosslinked
   homo-oligomer was at least a tetramer. The possible oligomeric states of
   MP70 and connexin 46 could not be determined with the crosslinking
   reagents used in this study. The procedure described here for the
   purification of detergent-solubilized major lens proteins should provide
   a valuable approach in future studies aimed at clarifying the roles of
   these different lens membrane proteins.}},

   The MHHP was a 13-year research and demonstration project involving 6

   factors for cardiovascular disease, MHHP weight control activities
   included adult education classes for weight control, exercise, and
   cholesterol reduction, a worksite weight control program, a home
   correspondence course for weightless and a weight gain prevention
   program. Inseparate component evaluation studies each of the programs
   was shown to facilitate favorable changes in weight among individuals
   choosing to participate in them. Compared to more intensive
   interventions, weight changes produced by these methods were modest in
   magnitude, but the number of individuals participating in some of them
   was quite large. The overall effects of the MHHP program on population
   levels of obesity were disappointing. Over 7 years of intervention there
   was a strong upward trend in weight in all communities, independent of
   age, demographics, smoking habits, or other potential confounding
   variables. This trend was not different in communities receiving
   education than in comparison communities. Possible reasons for these

   processes has been greatly aided by the development of single molecule
   methods for recovering de novo mutants, and of techniques for exploring
   allele structure in detail. Application of these approaches to man has
   shown that minisatellites do not primarily mutate by processes such as
   replication slippage and unequal crossover intrinsic to the tandem
   repeat array. Instead, germline repeat instability is largely regulated
   by cis-acting elements near the array and involves unexpectedly complex
   processes of gene conversion, of potential relevance to the biology of
   meiosis. These processes can be explored both in humans and, in
   principle, in transgenic mouse models of human repeat instability.}},

Abstract = {{New technology is a major determinant of total healthcare costs. The
   assessment of alternative technologies from a cost-effectiveness
   perspective is important, although other considerations may finally
   determine which technology is used. The alternatives of extracorporeal
   shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL)
   for the treatment of renal stone disease were compared by studying 1000
   cases of ESWL and 133 cases of PCNL using a noncontemporaneous cohort
   study with PCNL representing the earlier cohort. The effectiveness,
   defined by success and stone-free rates, was higher with PCNL than with
   ESWL (96\% success vs. 70\%); PCNL was also accompanied by a lower
   burden of additional therapy, whereas ESWL had a higher retreatment
   rate. From the perspective of a third-party payer, total costs per case
   of ESWL (\$2,746) were lower than those of PCNL (\$4,087), but the
   figure varies with the annual volume. These represent the costs for
   complete treatment of a patient, including the costs of alternative
   technology such as PCNL or ureteroscopy that may ultimately be necessary
   in a patient initially managed by ESWL. The cost for a single ESWL
   treatment was \$2,226 (at a volume of 1000 cases per year), but this
   increased to \$2,746 when costs of retreatment and alternative treatment
   were prorated to each patient treated. The relative contribution of
   capital costs to the total cost of ESWL was always less than total
   professional fees and was only 12\% at a volume of 2000 cases/year.
   Therefore ESWL is less expensive but it is also less effective in
   rendering patients stone-free.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, islands off the Northwestern coast of Baja California
   hosted large breeding colonies of seabirds. Three decades ago DDT and
   DDE achieved such high levels in the region as to cause reproductive
   failure of brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis; Jehl 1973, Anderson
   et al. 1975) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus; Gress
   at al. 1973). In 1981-82 pintails (Anas acuta) collected in San Quintin,
   Baja California, and terns (Sterna elegans and S. caspia) at San Diego
   Bay still had detectable levels of pp'-DDE (Mora al al. 1987; Ohlendorf
   et al. 1985), but the mobility of these species did not allow for
   precise determination of the origin of the pesticides. Since the early
   1970's the level of bioaccumulation of DDT and its metabolites in birds
   in Northwestern Mexico has been unknown.
   To document the current accumulation of pesticide residues in the
   region, we decided to study a species that: (a) did not have any current
   conservation problems, (b) reproduced widely throughout the study area,
   and (c) whose eggs could be used to monitor local conditions. The
   Western gull is abundant in the region, has breeding colonies on many of
   the islands, and does not face any conservation problems. Individuals of
   this species remain near an area where food and breeding conditions are
   optimum (Spear 1988) and exhibit strong nesting-area and group fidelity
   (G. Hunt pers, comm. and L. Spear pers. comm.).
   The objective of this work was to determine the concentration of DDT and
   its metabolites in eggs of Western Gulls (L. occidentalis), from the
   southern coast of California and the Northwestern coast of Baja
   California.}},

Abstract = {{The history of the abundant repeat elements in the bovine genome has

   (deer) and apparently predates the Bovidae. However, the other
   components of the bovine satellites were amplified after the divergence
   of the cattle and the Caprinae (sheep and goat). A 23-bp motif, which as
   subrepeat of two major satellites occupies 5\% of the cattle genome,
   emerged only after the split of the water buffalo and other cattle
   species. During the evolution of the Bovidae the satellite repeat units

Pages = {{892-901}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In asthmatic and control subjects, we examined the changes in
   ventilatory capacity (VE(Cap)), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and
   degree of flow limitation during three types of exercise: 1)
   incremental, 2) constant load (50\% of maximal exercise capacity; 36
   min), and 3) interval (alternating between 60 and 40\% of maximal
   exercise capacity; 6-min workloads for 36 min). The VE(Cap) and degree
   of flow limitation at rest and during the various stages of exercise
   were estimated by aligning the tidal breathing flow-volume (F-V) loops
   within the maximal expiratory F-V (MEFV) envelope using the measured
   EELV. In contrast to more usual estimates of VE(Cap) (i.e., maximal
   voluntary ventilation and forced expiratory volume in 1 s x 40), the
   calculated VE(Cap), depended on the existing bronchomotor tone, the lung
   volume at which the subjects breathed (i.e., EELV), and the tidal
   volume. During interval and constant-load exercise, asthmatic subjects
   experienced reduced ventilatory reserve, higher degrees of flow
   limitation, and had higher EELVs compared with nonasthmatic subjects.
   During interval exercise, the VE(Cap), of the asthmatic subjects
   increased and decreased with variations in minute ventilation, due in
   part to alterations in their MEFV curve as exercise intensity varied
   between 60 and 49\% of maximal capacity. In conclusion, asthmatic
   subjects have a more variable VE(Cap) and reduced ventilatory reserve
   during exercise compared with nonasthmatic subjects. The variations in
   VE(Cap), are due in part to a more labile MEFV curve secondary to
   changes in bronchomotor tone. Asthmatics defend VE(Cap), and minimize
   flow limitation by increasing EELV.}},

Abstract = {{It was previously shown by others that Pseudomonas sp. strain JS150
   metabolizes benzene and alkyl- and chloro-substituted benzenes by using
   dioxygenase-initiated pathways coupled with multiple downstream
   metabolic pathways to accommodate catechol metabolism, By cloning genes
   encoding benzene-degradative enzymes, we found that strain JS150 also
   carries genes for a toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase. The gene cluster
   encoding a 2-monooxygenase and its cognate regulator was cloned from a
   plasmid carried by strain JS150. Oxygen (O-18(2)) incorporation
   experiments using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that carried the cloned
   genes confirmed that toluene hydroxylation was catalyzed through an
   authentic monooxygenase reaction to yield ortho-cresol. Regions encoding
   the toluene-2-monooxygenase and regulatory gene product were localized
   in two regions of the cloned fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the
   toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase locus was determined, Analysis of this
   sequence revealed six open reading frames that were then designated
   tbmA, tbmB, tbmC, tbmD, tbmE, and tbmF. The deduced amino acid sequences
   for these genes showed the presence of motifs similar to well-conserved
   functional domains of multicomponent oxygenases. This analysis allowed
   the tentative identification of two terminal oxygenase subunits (TbmB
   and TbmD) and an electron transport protein (TbmF) for the monooxygenase
   enzyme. In addition to these gene products, all the tbm polypeptides
   shared significant homology with protein components from other bacterial
   multicomponent monooxygenases. Overall, the tbm gene products shared
   greater similarity with polypeptides from the phenol hydroxylases of
   Pseudomonas putida CF600, P35X, and BH than with those from the toluene
   monooxygenases of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 and Burkholderia
   (Pseudomonas) pickettii PKO1. The relationship found between the phenol
   hydroxylases and a toluene-2-monooxygenase, characterized in this study
   for the first time at the nucleotide sequence level, suggested that DNA
   probes used for surveys of environmental populations should be carefully
   selected to reflect DNA sequences corresponding to the metabolic pathway
   of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The advantage of radionuclide angiographic techniques used
   to measure right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) is geometry
   independence, but the weakness is right atrial (RA) overlap. To minimize
   the effect of RA counts on right ventricular time activity curve (TAC),
   two regions of interest (ROI), one drawn for the end-diastolic image and
   one for the end-systolic image, are used for the calculation of RVEF
   from equilibrium gated blood pool scans (GBPS) and from gated first-pass
   studies with an Anger camera. A multicrystal camera offers both temporal
   separation of the bolus to the right side of the heart and good count
   statistics; therefore first-pass studies performed on a multicrystal
   camera theoretically should yield the most accurate measurements of
   RVEF, but few studies have been performed to validate RVEF against a
   reliable gold standard.
   Methods and Results. To develop and validate an accurate method to
   measure RVEF from multicrystal first-pass data, 25 patients underwent
   sequential cine-MRI, first-pass radionuclide angiography, and gated
   equilibrium imaging. Five additional healthy volunteers underwent
   cine-MRI alone. Right and left ventricular volumes were measured from
   serial short axis cine-MRI views according to Simpson's rule. Three
   methods were used to calculate RVEF from first-pass data: a single ROI
   method, a dual ROI method, and a method in which a single ROI is applied
   to RA subtracted first-pass dynamic data. Five additional healthy
   volunteers underwent cine-MRI alone. When right ventricular stroke
   volume was plotted versus left ventricular stroke volume for the 5
   volunteers and the 15 patients without valvular regurgitation, the
   regression line was not significantly different from the line of
   identity, supporting the accuracy of cine-MRI to measure RVEF. The RVEF
   by cine-MRI ranged from 33\% to 59\%; first-pass RVEF with a single ROI
   from 26\% to 48\%; first-pass RVEF with two ROIs from 31\% to 59\%;
   first-pass RVEF with RA subtracted single ROI from 29\% to 60\%; and
   RVEF from GBPS with multiple ROIs from 28\% to 55\%. The regressions for
   all three of the first-pass methods versus cine-MRI were significant (p
   < 0.01) as was the regression for the equilibrium GBPS versus cine-MRI
   but the correlation was weaker. The regressions for the 2-ROI method and
   for the RA subtracted single ROI method were not significantly different
   from the line of identity, whereas the regressions for both the single
   ROI method and for equilibrium GBPS were significantly different from
   the line of identity (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions. Cine-MRI can be used to validate radionuclide algorithms.
   Of the four radionuclide methods for measuring RVEF that were assessed,
   the first-pass 2-ROI method and the first-pass RA subtracted single ROI
   are the most accurate, the first-pass single ROI method underestimates
   RVEF, and the RVEF values measured from GBPS are less accurate.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of two essential genes of infectious laryngotracheitis virus
   (ILTV), glycoprotein D (gD) and the immediate early gene, herpes simplex
   virus homologue ICP27, was performed with the equivalent gene homologues
   from several alphaherpesviruses. Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis
   revealed that these ILTV genes shared limited homology to other
   alphaherpesvirus equivalents and were distinct from the two other avian
   herpesviruses, Marek's disease virus (MDV) and herpesvirus of turkeys
   (HVT). Simplex and varicella group viruses are clearly separate from the
   avian group. The amino acid sequences of these ILTV genes will be
   presented with comparisions to the homologues from other
   alphaherpesviruses, contributing further evidence of the evolution of
   this group of viruses from a common progenitor and that ILTV could be an
   ancient example of the Alphaherpesvirinae.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were undertaken to determine if the reciprocity rule is
   valid for gravitropic responses of oat coleoptiles in the acceleration
   region below 1 g. The rule predicts that the gravitropic response should
   be proportional to the product of the applied acceleration and the
   stimulation time.
   Seedlings were cultivated on 1 g centrifuges and transferred to test
   centrifuges to apply a transverse g-stimulation. Since responses
   occurred in microgravity, the uncertainties about the validity of
   clinostat simulation of weightlessness was avoided. Plants at two stages
   of coleoptile development were tested. Plant responses were obtained
   using time-lapse video recordings that were analyzed after the flight.
   Stimulus intensities and durations were varied and ranged from 0.1 to
   1.0 g and from 2 to 130 min, respectively. For threshold g-doses the
   reciprocity rule was obeyed The threshold dose was of the order of 55 g
   s and 120 g a, respectively, for two groups of plants investigated.
   Reciprocity was studied also at bending responses which are from just
   above the detectable level to about 10 degrees. The validity of the rule
   could not be confirmed for higher g-doses, chiefly because the data were
   more variable.
   It was investigated whether the uniformity of the overall response data
   increased when the gravitropic dose was defined as (g(m) X t), with
   m-values different from unity. This was not the case and the reciprocity
   concept is, therefore, valid also in the hypogravity region. The concept
   of gravitropic dose, the product of the transverse acceleration and the
   stimulation time, is also well-defined in the acceleration region
   studied. With the same hardware, tests were done on earth where
   responses occurred on clinostats. The results did not contradict the
   reciprocity rule but scatter in the data was large.}},

Abstract = {{Small GTPases of the rab family are involved in the regulation of
   vesicular transport. It is believed that cycling between the GTP- and
   GDP-bound forms, and accessory factors regulating this cycling are
   crucial for rab function. However, an essential role for rab nucleotide
   exchange factors has not yet been demonstrated, In this report we show
   the requirement of nucleotide exchange factor activity for Ypt1 GTPase
   mediated protein transport. The Ypt1 protein, a member of the rab
   family, plays a role in targeting vesicles to the acceptor compartment
   and is essential for the first two steps of the yeast secretory pathway.
   We use two YPT1 dominant mutations that contain alterations in a highly
   conserved GTP-binding domain, N121I and D124N. YPT1-D124N is a novel
   mutation that encodes a protein with nucleotide specificity modified
   from guanine to xanthine, This provides a tool for the study of an
   individual rab GTPase in crude extracts: a xanthosine triphosphate
   (XTP)-dependent conditional dominant mutation. Both mutations confer
   growth inhibition and a block in protein secretion when expressed in
   vivo. The purified mutant proteins do not bind either GDP or GTP.
   Moreover, they completely inhibit the ability of the exchange factor to
   stimulate nucleotide exchange for wild type Ypt1 protein, and are potent
   inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport in vitro at the vesicle targeting
   step, The inhibitory effects of the Ypt1-D124N mutant protein on both
   nucleotide exchange activity and protein transport in vitro can be
   relieved by XTP, indicating that it is the nucleotide-free form of the
   mutant protein that is inhibitory. These results suggest that the
   dominant mutant proteins inhibit protein transport by sequestering the
   exchange factor from the wild type Ypt1 protein, and that this factor
   has an essential role in vesicular transport.}},

   the increase in thermotolerance, after an osmotic upshift, showed a very
   rapid initial response(<2 min) followed by a more gradual increase
   whereby cells, after 4 h exposure at 30 degrees C, became nearly as heat
   resistant as those grown for 48 h under the same conditions. Cells grown
   in media with 0.09 mol 1(-1) NaCl subjected to a short osmotic up-shock
   in media containing 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mol 1(-1) NaCl showed a 1.3, 2.5 and
   8-fold increase in thermotolerance, respectively. Osmotic adaptation,
   signified by growth at the higher NaCl concentration, however, resulted
   in a 2- to 3-fold additional increase in thermotolerance. An osmotic
   down-shock caused a very rapid loss of thermotolerance (< 5 min).
   Osmotic shock and adaptation experiments were also performed in minced
   beef where similar changes in thermotolerance were observed. Cell
   morphology was markedly affected by the osmolarity of the growth medium.
   Cells grown in media containing 1.5 mol 1(-1) NaCl became up to 50 times

Abstract = {{Ignition of methane/hydrogen and air streams in a supersonic mixing
   layer was investigated numerically with the C-1 chemistry for interests
   in aerospace application. Attention was paid to ignition delay times and
   ignition processes with the addition of methane to hydrogen and the
   addition of hydrogen to methane involving elementary reactions. In the
   first case, results showed that the addition of methane to hydrogen
   dramatically affected the ignition time. Three stages, an
   chain-branching inhibition stage, a transition stage and a reaction
   competition stage, were identified. During the first stage, endothermic
   reaction, CH4 --> CH3 + H, resulted in a slow development of
   temperature; and reaction, H + CH4 --> CH3 + H-2, scavenged radical H.
   As a result, ignition time increased quickly. During the second stage,
   production of new H radical through reaction CH4 --> CH3 + H, leveled
   off this rapid increase of ignition time. During the third stage, the
   increase of concentration of H radicals induced a fast procession of H +
   CH4 --> CH3 + H-2, which suppressed the two key reactions, H + O-2 -->
   OH + O and H + O-2 + M --> HO2 + M, and then led to a second rapid
   increase of ignition time. In the second case, results showed that the
   characteristic time of chemical heat release of methane/air was much
   longer than that of its chain-branching process. It was found that the
   addition of hydrogen to methane significantly accelerated the ignition
   of methane/air. Furthermore, this ignition enhancement was shown to be
   proportional to the amount of hydrogen added to methane.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in the methylation patterns of male and female gamete DNA
   are likely to be involved in genomic imprinting. However, little is
   known of the mechanisms that regulate de novo methylation and
   demethylation during gametogenesis. We report here that the
   well-characterized M(r) 190 000 form of DNA methyltransferase erase (the
   only known form) is present in isolated mitotic, meiotic, and
   postmeiotic male germ cells, with the exception of meiotic pachytene
   spermatocytes, where the protein is undetectable by immunoblot analysis
   and a novel 6.2-kb DNA methyltransferase transcript is present. Whereas
   replication and methylation are coupled in somatic cells, the presence
   of DNA methyltransferase in postreplicative male germ cells is
   consistent with previously observed de novo methylation events in these
   cells. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that DNA
   methyltransferase is localized to the nuclei of male germ cells, with a
   subset of spermatogonia and postreplicative leptotene/zygotene
   spermatocytes displaying prominent nuclear foci that are strongly
   enriched in DNA methyltransferase. The data suggest that down-regulation
   of DNA methyltransferase expression during the pachytene stage of
   meiosis utilizes an unusual mechanism that is associated with the
   production of a larger mRNA, and that de novo methylation in
   leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes may take place in spatially restricted
   nuclear domains that are enriched in DNA methyltransferase.}},

Abstract = {{The nutrient fluxes between sediment and water column in Kertinge Nor, a
   tidal inlet, during the period following a major reduction of nutrient
   loading, were determined by means of the numerical, hydrodynamic model
   `'MIKE11''. The fluxes of the nutrients total-N and total-P were
   simulated over the two year period 1991 and 1992.
   The model results were verified through direct measurements of total-P
   transport at the outlet and through total-P and total-N exchange
   experiments on sediment cores. The advantages of the presented numerical
   simulation of flux rates are: 1) that the fluxes represent the
   integrated effect of the entire sediment area, and 2) that extraordinary
   release events can be simulated with an adequate resolution in time (1-2
   days), which is high compared to the simulation period of almost two
   years.
   Sediment fluxes determined from the model indicate that during the
   biologically important summer periods in 1991 and 1992 the sediment was
   the dominant source for both total-N and total-P.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Injuries to the portal tried are a rare and complex challenge
   in trauma surgery. The purpose of this review is to better characterize
   the incidence, lethality, and successful management schemes used to
   treat these injuries.
   Design: A retrospective review of the experience of eight academic level
   I trauma centers over a combined 62 years.
   Results: Ninety-nine patients sustained 118 injuries to the anatomical
   structures of the porta hepatis: 55 extrahepatic portal vein injuries,
   28 extrahepatic arterial injuries, and 35 injuries to the extrahepatic
   biliary tree. Sixty-nine percent of the injuries were by penetrating
   mechanism and 31\% were by blunt mechanism. All patients had associated
   injuries with a mean Injury Severity Score of 34 in blunt trauma
   patients. Overall mortality was 51\%, rising to 80\% in patients with
   combination injuries. Sixty-six percent of deaths occurred in the
   operating room, primarily from exsanguination; 18\% of deaths occurred
   within 48 hours of injury from refractory shock, coagulopathy, or
   cardiac arrest; 16\% occurred late. Ten percent of patients undergoing
   portal vein ligation survived, compared to 58\% managed by primary
   repair. Survival after hepatic artery ligation was 42\%, compared to
   14\% after primary repair. Survival after biliary-enteric anastomosis as
   treatment of extrahepatic bile duct injury was 89\%, compared to 50\%
   after primary repair and 100\% after ligation of lobar bile duct
   injuries. Missed bile duct injuries had a high (75\%) severe
   complication rate.
   Conclusions: Injuries to the anatomical structures of the portal triad
   are rare and often lethal. Intraoperative exsanguination is the primary
   cause of death, and hemorrhage control should be the first priority.
   Bile duct injuries should be identified by intraoperative
   cholangiography and repaired primarily or by enteric anastomosis; lobar
   bile ducts can be managed by ligation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of
   cocaine-associated thrombocytopenia.
   STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study was conducted in an inner-city prenatal
   center. A total of 1907 patients were screened by the Mother's Project,
   which is an intervention project for inner-city cocaine-abusing
   parturients. Platelet counts were grouped by illicit drug usage.
   RESULTS: Platelet counts were available in 37\% (709) of subjects; there
   were no differences between subjects with available platelet counts and
   those without on illicit drug use or other demographic measures. Five
   groups were defined: drug-free group (n = 331), cocaine group (n = 104),
   cocaine and opiates group (n = 11), opiates group (n = 18), and
   other-drug group (n = 236). Nineteen subjects had a low platelet count
   (<150 x 10(9)/L). The medical records of all subjects with a low
   platelet count were reviewed for any medical condition known to be
   associated with thrombocytopenia, and two subjects were excluded. The
   rate of thrombocytopenia in the drug-free group was 1.5\%, whereas the
   rate in the cocaine group was 6.7\% (relative risk 4.4, p < 0.05).
   Because of the reported association of thrombocytopenia with
   seropositive human immunodeficiency virus status, seropositive women
   were excluded from the analysis. Even after human immunodeficiency virus
   status adjustments for the estimated rate, the cocaine-using group
   continued to have a significantly higher rate of thrombocytopenia (5.4\%
   to 7.2\% vs 1.23\% to 1.26\%, p < 0.05 to p < 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cocaine use is an independent
   risk factor for thrombocytopenia in an inner-city parturient population.}},

Abstract = {{We performed histochemical studies on normal human and rat tissues using
   anti-Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (alpha 2,6-ST)
   antibody and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA). alpha 2,6-ST and its
   products were detected in almost all tissues examined. However, the
   staining intensities varied significantly with different cell types,
   Some secretory epithelial cells, such as hepatocytes and choroid plexus
   cells, were vividly stained with either anti-alpha 2,6-ST or SNA. In
   several cell types the intensity of alpha 2,6-ST staining did not always
   correlate with SNA stainability. Neurons and gastrointestinal epithelia
   were rarely stained with SNA, even though they were positive for alpha
   2,6-ST, In contrast, the endothelial cells of blood vessels strongly
   reacted with SNA despite their weak alpha 2,6-ST expression, The precise
   physiological roles played by alpha 2,6-linked sialylated
   glycoconjugates have been unclear. However, the findings described here
   lend further support to their important role in cell growth and
   differentiation, since immature blood cells, including megakaryocytes in
   bone marrow, were intensely stained with anti-alpha 2,6-ST and SNA, and
   SNA reaction products were primarily observed in the basal and
   suprabasal layers of the stratified epithelia rather than in the more
   differentiated upper layers. In view of the vivid reactivity of
   anti-alpha 2,6-ST in the decidual cells of the placenta, it seems likely
   that alpha 2,6-ST expression is under hormonal control.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To study the effects of taurine (Tau) and tetrodotoxin (Tet) on
   cesium chloride (CsCl)-induced triggered activity and arrhythmia in
   anesthetized rabbits. METHODS: With a cuffed endotracheal tube, the
   rabbit ventilation was maintained by a respirator. A Franzy's contact
   electrode catheter was advanced into the right ventricle through the
   right external jugular vein and positioned against the anteroapical
   endocardial surface to record the monophasic action potential (MAP). A
   catheter was placed into femoral vein for systemic drug administration.
   RESULTS: CsCl (1 mmol L(-1) iv) produced a decrease in the amplitude of
   MAP from 42.2 +/- 2.1 to 37.0 +/- 3.8 mV (P < 0.01), a prolongation of
   MAPD(50) (156 +/- 22 to 209 +/- 26 ms, P < 0.01) or MAPD(90) (205 +/- 25
   to 250 +/- 120 ms, P < 0.01) and an early afterdepolarization (EAD)
   developed within 30 s after CsCl injection. The ventricular premature
   (VP) resulted from EAD triggered by CsCl. In the Tau (100 mg kg(-1))- or
   Tet (10 mu g kg(-1))-pretreated group, not only was the amplitude of EAD
   decreased (Tau, 4.2 +/- 2.7; or Tet, 5.2 +/- 2.6, respectively vs 16.1
   +/- 8.6 mv, P < 0.01), but also the duration of EAD was shortened (Tau,
   695 +/- 164; or Tet, 492 +/- 172, respectively, vs 1068 +/- 166 ms, P <
   0.01). The severity of triggered arrhythmia (TA) was alleviated and the
   incidence of TA was lowered within 30 min after iv CsCl by either Tau or
   Tet. CONCLUSION: The depressant effects of Tau and Tet on EAD and VP
   induced by CsCl were involved in an increase of outward current or a
   decrease of an inward current.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Research has not examined organizational members' responses to detected
   premature sign-off behavior. Formal policies in auditing fins prohibit
   premature sign-off behavior and require detected instances to be
   formally reported. An ambiguous organizational culture, however, may
   suggest that compliance is discretionary.
   This paper presents the results of an experiment in which audit seniors
   read a hypothetical scenario describing their discovery of an audit
   staff member prematurely signing-off an audit step and indicated their
   intentions to formally report their discovery. The experiment
   manipulated the step necessity (e.g., necessary vs. unnecessary) of the
   task prematurely signed-off as well as the work history (e.g., good vs.
   poor) of the audit staff member engaging in the premature sign-off
   behavior.
   The results show that audit seniors' reporting intentions were
   significantly stronger under a necessary audit step or under a poor
   staff audit work history. For these two conditions, examination of the
   descriptive results indicated a large minority of participants were
   either uncertain of their reporting intentions or likely not to report.
   A similar pattern of results was also found for participants' overall
   performance rating of the staff auditor. However, the strength of their
   performance rating responses were lower than their reporting intentions,
   suggesting that while participating audit seniors do not condone
   premature sign-off behavior they appear less convinced that the behavior
   should translate into negative outcomes under their personal control.}},

Abstract = {{After a successful launch of a new communications satellite, it is
   essential to test the communications subsystem while the spacecraft is
   in orbit so as to compare with prelaunch data in order to ensure that no
   impairment has resulted from the stress of the launch and to verify that
   the spacecraft payload is compliant with the specifications sought.
   The thrust of in-orbit test technology has stemmed from the fact that
   the spacecraft has to be operational very quickly while not sacrificing
   the number of tests that have to be performed and increasing their
   measurement accuracies.
   Thus, in order to respond favourably to the cited criteria, microwave
   measurement techniques with more powerful computers and software
   technology have been used to automate the measurements.
   The paper is geared to the history, design, implementation and operation
   of EUTELSAT's in-orbit test (IOT) facilities, and mostly reflects
   technological advances in communications satellite payload testing. The
   paper will first detail the hardware/software novel concepts of the
   measurement environment. Then new measurements are summarized. New
   spacecraft antenna mapping procedures are detailed both in measurement
   and spacecraft attitude aspects.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   reported physical activity and optimism. A secondary purpose was to
   determine whether physical self-efficacy and trait anxiety mediate the
   relationship between exercise and optimism. Participants (N = 188) were
   administered a battery of questionnaires assessing optimism, pessimism,
   physical self-efficacy, trait anxiety, and extent and nature of
   involvement in physical activity. Demographic information was also
   collected. The results indicated that high active individuals were
   significantly more optimistic and less pessimistic than inactive/low
   active individuals. In addition, the moderately and high active groups
   reported significantly higher physical self-efficacy and lower trait
   anxiety than the inactive/low active group. Hierarchical regression
   analyses indicated that trait anxiety and physical self-efficacy
   accounted for significant unique variation in optimism. The findings are
   consistent with previous research indicating that optimists engage in
   exercise significantly more often than pessimists.}},

Abstract = {{Body and horn morphology of two rhinoceros beetle species (Chalcosoma
   caucasus F. and C. atlas L.) was observed in six allopatric (one of the
   two species occurs within the same geographical area) and three
   sympatric (both of them occur) locations. Across allopatric locations,
   the ranges of elevational distribution partially overlapped between the
   two species. In sympatric locations, C. caucasus occurred at higher
   elevational range than C. atlas with little overlap of elevational
   distribution between the two species. Both species showed a clear male
   dimorphism in all locations, that is, a minor morph with smaller body
   and rudimentary horns and the major morph with larger body and
   disproportionally large horns. Across allopatric locations, the sizes of
   the corresponding morphs partially overlapped between the two species.
   In sympatric locations, die sizes of each morph of C. caucasus were
   greater than those of its corresponding morph in allopatric locations,
   whereas those of C. atlas were smaller than those in allopatric
   locations. Thus, in sympatric locations, the size of each morph of C.
   caucasus was distinctly larger than that of the corresponding morph of
   C. atlas and there were little dimensional overlaps between the
   corresponding morphs of the two species. It is possible that the two
   species responded behaviorally to the presence of each other and the
   resultant elevational habitat shift caused the morphological
   differences. The magnitudes of intraspecific variation in body size and
   male dimorphic divergence of die two species did not differ
   significantly between allopatry and sympatry. These results suggest that
   habitat shift and phenotypic body size displacement in sympatry of these
   species took place in response to the presence of the other species
   avoiding interspecific competition without changing intraspecific
   variability.}},

   Xxx-Yyy(1)cys-Zzz-D-Trp-Lys(Orn)(5)-Thr-Pen-Thr(8)-NH2, where Xxx, Yyy,

   present evidence that NMR data are compatible with beta II'-, gamma- and
   gamma' -turns for the central tetrapeptide Tyr-D-Trp-Lys/Orn-Thr. Based
   on detailed structural and topographical considerations, we suggest that
   the mu-opioid receptor selectivity of 2 is due to a particular spatial
   arrangement of aromatic side chains of D-Tic(1) and Tyr(3) (7.5
   Angstrom), and that the opioid receptor recognition domain is located in
   the N-terminal part of the peptide while the somatostatin receptor
   recognition domain is determined by the central, turn forming part of
   this class of cyclic peptides. A model for a mu-poioid selective ligand
   has emerged from these studies that shows excellent structural
   similarities to rigid opioid alkaloids. (C) Munksgaard 1995.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that adults of the
   black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), undergo both a spring and
   autumn migration in the United States. This migration activity involves
   the Corn Belt and southern regions, including the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Because of the importance of coastal influences on migration and because
   Texas is a probable source of moths migrating into the Midwest in April
   and May, the Texas coastline was chosen as a study area likely to
   produce winter-time data on black cutworm moth activity. In 1987-91,
   wing-style pheromone traps were used for short-term trapping of black
   cutworm moths along the Texas coastal region in an attempt to observe
   black cutworm moth premigratory activity from January to mid- to
   late-February. Texas-style cone traps monitored at locations on and near
   the Texas coast provided longer-term data on black cutworm moth
   activity. Data from moth captures along the coastal areas indicated some
   possible trends. Black cutworm moths were active throughout the winter
   months; however, greatest captures of moths tended to occur within a
   rather narrow time window in February. Black cutworm moths begin their
   well-documented northward transport approximately one month after major
   mid-winter coastal capture periods. If, as the weather patterns suggest,
   the source for moths captured in mid-winter in coastal areas is interior
   south-central and southeastern Texas, a study of the coastal populations
   during this behavior transition period may provide better prediction
   capabilities for the onset of the spring transport of black cutworm
   moths northward to the Corn Belt.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to reduce the level of presensitization in patients on our
   heart and lung transplant waiting list, ten patients with random panel
   reactivity persistently above 10\% on monthly screening for durations of
   2 to 59 months were given low-dose azathioprine (25 to 75 mg/day) for 1
   to 22 months. All patients had positive T-cell panel reactivity (10\% to
   70\%) against specific (n = 6), multispecific (n = 1), or undefined (n =
   3) HLA loci, and four additional patients had positive B-cell panel
   reactivity (5\% to 40\%). No effect of azathioprine on panel reactivity
   was seen in four of ten patients (40\%), whereas a significant and
   sustained reduction in panel reactivity occurred in six patients (60\%),
   all within 2 months of commencing azathioprine. All nonresponders had
   antibodies with class I (A locus) specificity, whereas all six
   responders had multispecific or undefined antibody specificities. A
   formal trial of low-dose azathioprine in presensitized recipients is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomic innervation of the prostate gland supplies the acini, and
   non-vascular and vascular smooth muscle. The activity of each of these
   tissues is enhanced by sympathetic outflow, whereas the role of the
   parasympathetic nervous system in this organ is unclear. In the present
   study, a range of methods was applied in rats to determine the location
   of autonomic neurons supplying this gland, the immunohistochemical
   properties of these neurons, the spinal connections made with the
   postganglionic pathways and the distribution of various axon types
   within the gland. Injection of the retrograde tracer, FluoroGold, into
   the ventral gland visualised neurons within the major pelvic ganglion
   and sympathetic chain. Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies on the
   labelled pelvic neurons showed that most were noradrenergic (also
   containing neuropeptide Y, NPY), the others being non-noradrenergic and
   containing either vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or NPY.
   Sympathetic dye-labelled neurons were identified by the presence of
   varicose nerve terminals stained for synaptophysin on their somata
   following lesion of sacral inputs. Parasympathetic innervation of
   dye-labelled neurons was identified by continued innervation after
   hypogastric nerve lesion. Most noradrenergic prostate-projecting neurons
   were sympathetic, as were many of the non-noradrenergic VIP neurons.
   Parasympathetic prostate-projecting neurons were largely
   non-noradrenergic and contained either VIP or NPY. All substances found
   in retrogradely labelled somata were located in axons within the
   prostate gland but had slightly different patterns of distribution. The
   studies have shown that there are a significant number of
   non-noradrenergic sympathetic prostate-projecting neurons, which contain
   VIP.}},

Abstract = {{Hemocyanin (Hc) synthesis was compared at three different levels: in
   vivo, after injection of {[}S-35]methionine and in vitro, by incubating
   hepatopancreas (HEP) tissue fragments or by translating RNA extracted
   from HEP. The HEP of male Penaeus semisulcatus contains mRNA specific
   for Hc. Poly(A(+))RNA was used as a template for cell-free translation
   assays. Two polypeptides of 64 and 73 kDa were immunoisolated from these
   in vitro translation lysates using antiserum prepared against purified
   Hc. The two polypeptides exhibited similar mobility to the polypeptides
   of Hc purified from the hemolymph. Hc was not precipitated from
   translation products when immunoisolation was performed using the
   polyclonal antisera that were prepared against two crustacean
   lipoproteins (LP1 from the hemolymph and vitellin from the ovary). The
   same polypeptides were immunoisolated from HEP fragments that were
   incubated in vitro with {[}S-35]methionine. In order to verify that the
   immunoisolated proteins from the in vitro labelled HEP were indeed Hc,
   immunoisolation was conducted in the presence of purified Hc. The
   labelled Hc was displaced by the unlabelled Hc. In contrast, no
   precipitate was isolated after using non-immunized rabbit serum. The
   method of Hc isolation determined the number of protein bands that were
   visualized after immunoisolation from hemolymph samples removed from
   males injected in vivo with {[}S-35]methionine. After coagulation, two
   of the visualized bands were found to have an electrophoretic mobility
   similar to that of purified Hc.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been recognized that urban systems are a subset of human
   activity systems, where decision making entails dealing not only with
   planning and engineering elements but also with political and social
   entities. The latter two entities have been neglected in the past,
   because engineers and planners have drawn heavily from the methods and
   practice of operations research, systems engineering, and the power of
   quantitative methods to `'solve'' practically all urban-planning-related
   problems. The overall results of the use of these `'hard systems''
   methodologies (HSM) have not been uniformly successful, except in
   dealing with the simpler cases. In this paper the `'soft systems''
   methodology (SSM) is explained in detail, showing how it can be applied
   to problems concerned with rational intervention in human activity
   systems; SSM is an inquiring system used for tackling ill-structured,
   messy problem situations in engineering and planning. In practice, HSM
   and SSM complement and supplement each other. An example applied to a
   transportation planning situation is included. This methodology has
   proven to be effective and easy to use.}},

Abstract = {{For the application of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy to larger
   proteins, it would be useful to perform selective labeling of one of the
   20 amino acids. For some amino acids, however, amino acid metabolism
   drastically reduces the efficiency and selectivity of labeling in in
   vivo expression systems. In the present study, a cell-free protein
   synthesis system was optimized, so that highly efficient and selective
   stable isotope labeling of proteins can be achieved in the absence of
   amino acid metabolism. The productivity of the E. coli cell-free coupled
   transcription-translation system was first improved, by about fivefold,
   by using the T7 RNA polymerase for transcription and also by improving
   the translation conditions. Thus, about 0.1 mg protein per 1 ml reaction
   mixture was synthesized. Then, this improved cell-free system was used
   for Asp- or Ser-selective N-15-labeling of the human c-Ha-Ras protein.
   With a 15 ml cell-free reaction, using less then 1 mg of N-15-labeled
   amino acid, 1 mg of the Ras protein was obtained. H-1-N-15 HSQC
   experiments confirmed that the Ras protein was efficiently labeled with
   high selectivity. These results indicate that this cell-free protein
   synthesis system is useful for NMR studies.}},

Abstract = {{Data were collected prospectively over a 10-yr period from 53 subjects
   with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) to provide a profile
   of impairment and disability. Manual muscle testing (MMT) indicated
   greater involvement of proximal musculature, although a subgroup
   demonstrated early weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors. Asymmetry of
   upper extremity musculature was noted, with greater weakness of selected
   dominant limb muscle groups. Weakness, in general, was relatively mild,
   with an overall mean MMT score of 3.7 units. The rate of strength loss
   was quite slowly progressive, a decline of only -0.22 MMT units per
   decade of age. An early age of onset was associated with greater
   likelihood of more severe and progressive weakness. Isometric and
   isokinetic quantitative strength testing revealed that all muscle groups
   were 36-68\% weaker than a control population. Although nearly 50\% of
   the subjects had vital capacity evidence of restrictive lung disease,
   only 13\% had severe involvement, and only 22\% had a history of
   pulmonary complications. There was no age or disease duration effect on
   pulmonary function measurements or complications. As with the other
   neuromuscular diseases, maximal expiratory pressure measurements were
   more sensitive than other pulmonary function tests. Abnormal
   electrocardiogram findings were rare and minor and not related to overt
   cardiac disease. Contractures were rare and mild. Thirty-five percent of
   the patients had spine deformity; however, most had hyperlordosis.
   Intellectual function was normal, and there were few abnormalities on
   personality tests. Functional testing demonstrated wide variation in
   disability with FSHD, but motor weakness uniformly translated into
   impaired motor performance skills. This profile demonstrates the
   clinical heterogeneity of FSHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose With advanced imaging techniques, infarctions
   occurring in the medulla are now more easily identified. To date,
   however, only approximately 30 cases of medial medullary infarction
   syndrome (MMS) have been reported, and the clinical and radiological
   characteristics of MMS remain to be studied.
   Methods We studied 18 patients (15 men, 3 women; mean age, 62 years) who
   had compatible clinical and MRI findings of MMS and reviewed the
   previously reported cases.
   Results Seventeen patients had a unilateral lesion usually involving the
   upper medulla, and 1 had bilateral lesions. Fifteen patients had
   unilateral sensorimotor stroke, while 2 presented with pure motor
   stroke. The face was usually but not always spared. The degree of
   hemiparesis varied, and a tingling sensation with decreased vibration
   and position sense was the most common sensory manifestation. Two
   patients had lingual paresis, and none suffered respiratory
   difficulties. One patient presented with bilateral gait ataxia without
   sensorimotor dysfunction. Angiography or MR angiography performed in 9
   patients showed vertebral artery disease in 6. Three patients had
   concurrent lateral medullary infarction, and 1 had a previous history of
   lateral medullary syndrome. The prognosis was generally good, although
   residual hemiparesis remained in patients with initially severe
   hemiparesis. Review of 26 previously reported cases showed that they
   frequently had bilateral lesions, often presenting with quadriplegia,
   lingual paresis, respiratory symptoms, and a grave prognosis.
   Conclusions Our data illustrate that MMS is most often manifested as
   benign hemisensorimotor stroke frequently associated with tingling
   sensation acid impaired deep sensation. This benign form of MMS should
   be much more common than MMS with poor prognosis and may have been
   frequently misdiagnosed as capsular or pontine stroke before the era of
   MRI.}},

   Room-temperature current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements
   clearly revealed a metal-insulator-semiconductor behavior for the
   samples with a BaTiO3 insulator gate, the interface state densities at
   the BaTiO3/p-Si were approximately in the low 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at
   the middle of the Si energy gap, and the dielectric constant determined

Abstract = {{Contaminants on large astronomical reflecting surfaces (hereafter
   `'mirrors'') can significantly degrade their reflectivity, IR
   emissivity, and Light-scattering properties. We will show data that the
   emissivity and scattering can degrade appreciably after just a few days
   or weeks. A safe, effective, and inexpensive cleaning technique,
   preferably one that can be used in situ, is especially important for 4-
   to 8-m class mirrors. Two cleaning methods CO2 snow and pulsed
   ultraviolet (UV) lasers, offer the potential to satisfy these needs. Our
   primary purpose is to compare the two methods, and highlight their
   advantages and problems. Also, since the UV-laser cleaning technique is
   a new one, we describe how it works and how it may be implemented. We
   found that UV-laser cleaning removes contaminants that standard
   CO2-snow-cleaning techniques do not remove as well or not at all. After
   2-4 weeks of exposure, Al-coated-mirror samples placed under the mirror
   covers of the UKIRT telescope on Mauna Kea and the 4-m telescope on Kitt
   Peak were cleaned about twice as effectively by the UV laser than the
   CO2 snow, based upon the amount of contamination left on the mirrors.
   For long exposure times, the laser cleaning also restores the thermal
   emissivity better than the CO2 snow. While a CO2-snow delivery system
   can be less expensive than a UV-laser-cleaning system, the operation
   costs for cleaning a large-diameter mirror with CO2 snow can be
   substantially greater than the costs to run the laser. Unlike CO2 snow,
   laser cleaning can be applied no matter what the local humidity. The
   ease of both methods facilitates frequent use; however, the cost of the
   CO2 may eventually limit its usage.}},

   salicylates.
   Design: Prospective, blinded human protocol with subjects serving as
   their own controls.
   Setting: Urban Level I medical center.
   Participants: Ten male and two female volunteers with negative urine
   toxicologic screen results before the start of the study.
   Interventions: Each participant ingested 975 mg of nonenteric coated
   aspirin. Serum and urine samples were collected before ingestion and 2
   and 4 hours after ingestion. Three emergency physicians and a toxicology
   technician independently performed Trinder spot tests. Results were
   recorded as positive or negative for salicylate on the basis of color
   change (a purple reading was considered positive).
   Results: All postingestion urine specimens were detected by all testers
   with 100\% sensitivity. Two false positives occurred in the preingestion
   samples. Serum quantitative assays confirmed the presence of salicylates
   in all postingestion specimens.
   Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that emergency physicians can use
   the Trinder spot test as a sensitive bedside salicylate screen,
   potentially saving time and quantitative assay expense.}},

Abstract = {{The present study tested the hypothesis that some subjects may not
   readily show habituation of adrenocortical stress responses to repeated
   psychological stress. Twenty healthy male subjects were each exposed
   five times to the same, brief psychosocial stressor (public speaking and
   mental arithmetic in front of an audience) with one stress session per
   day. Salivary cortisol levels were assessed as an index of
   adrenocortical stress responses. For the total group, cortisol levels
   were significantly elevated on each of the 5 days. The mean response
   decreased hem day 1 to day 2; however, no further attenuation could be
   observed on the remaining days. Cluster analysis revealed two groups of
   subjects who showed completely different response kinetics. In the first
   group (N = 13), termed `'low responders,'' cortisol levels were elevated
   on day 1 only. Day 2 to 5 cortisol levels were unaltered. In contrast,
   subjects in the second group (''high responders'') displayed large
   increases to each of the five experimental treatments. This group had no
   significant response decrement from day 1 to day 2 to 4 and only a
   marginal response difference between day 1 and day 5. Discriminant
   analysis revealed that a combination of five personality scales plus the
   scores on a symptoms checklist significantly discriminated between high
   and low responders. With this discriminant function, all 20 subjects
   were correctly classified to the two groups. These results are discussed
   with a focus on the possible impact of adrenocortical response types on

   contracts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), followed by
   establishment of the National Science Foundation and the General

   of gastroenterology included: (1) the increasing body of scientific
   knowledge; (2) innovative technological advances; (3) philanthropic,
   pharmaceutical, and governmental (NIH) support of research; (4) emphasis
   on controlled clinical and laboratory studies; and (5) the enlarging

   refined employing the restrained least-squares method using X-ray data
   collected on an area detector to R = 0.173 for 15 326 observed
   reflections in the 10-1.5 Angstrom resolution shell and R = 0.176 for
   8534 observed reflections in the 10-1.8 Angstrom shell, respectively.
   The comparison of these structures with those of the native, the
   phosphate-bound and the sulfate-bound forms demonstrates that the
   mobility of the ribonuclease A molecule involves hinge-bending movement
   of the two domains and local flexibility within them, particularly at
   the termini of regular secondary structures and in loops. The comparison
   also leads to the identification of 31 invariant water molecules in the
   hydration shell of the enzyme, many of which are involved in holding
   different parts of the molecule together and in stabilizing local
   structure. The conformational changes that accompany the partial removal
   of the surrounding water, particularly those observed in the 79\% form,
   could be similar to those that occur during enzyme action.}},

   called SEC - S(e/b)EL codes. This type of codes is very suitable for an
   application to memory systems constructed from byte-organized memory
   chips because this corrects random single-bit errors induced by
   soft-errors and also indicates the position of the faulty memory chips.
   This paper also gives a construction method of the proposed codes using
   tenser product of the two codes, i.e., the single b-bit byte error
   correcting codes and the single-bit error correcting and e-bit error
   detecting codes. This clarifies lower bounds and error control

Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the tensile and shear
   bond strengths of one experimental and four commercially available resin
   cements following the ISO document TR 110405 for bond measurement.
   Methods. Tensile and shear bond tests were performed using bovine enamel
   and dentin as the tooth substrate with each of the resin cements. Resin
   composite rods were cemented to the prepared tooth surfaces. The bond
   strengths were obtained 24 h after cementation, and mode of failure was
   classified after fracture of the bonds, both visually and by SEM
   observation.
   Results. Significant differences existed between the two bond test
   methods for all materials with enamel and th ree of the five cements
   when bonded to dentin. The shear test results were always the higher of
   the two test methods. Mode of fracture varied little for the visual
   classification, but the morphology from SEM observations showed
   considerable differences.
   Significance. Although there are deficiencies in the current test
   methods, these may be outweighed by substrate variables. A test model
   should be designed to determine which stresses, tensile or shear, are
   the greatest for different types of restorations. With this information,
   the type of test selected could provide appropriate information before
   clinical trials are commenced.}},

Abstract = {{Opioid agonists inhibit adenylyl cyclase in brain through G(i)-coupled
   receptors. One potential biological role for this reaction would be to
   decrease pro-enkephalin mRNA synthesis by decreasing intracellular cAMP
   levels and preventing stimulation of gene expression via the cAMP
   regulatory element (CRE). To determine whether such effects occur in
   vivo, rats were injected i.c.v. with a water-soluble analog of
   forskolin, 7-beta-deacetyl-7 beta{[}gamma-(morpholino)-butyryl]
   forskolin (DMB-forskolin), to stimulate the CRE. Pro-enkephalin mRNA
   levels were assayed in striatum by Northern blot analysis. The treatment
   with the forskolin analog increased striatal pro-enkephalin mRNA levels
   approximately 2-fold in 4 h. When rats were injected with morphine (20
   mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before DMB-forskolin administration, the stimulation of
   pro-enkephalin mRNA levels was eliminated. This acute effect of morphine
   was blocked by co-administration with 10 mg/kg naloxone. When rats were
   chronically treated with morphine for 8 days, then injected with
   morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before DMB-forskolin administration, the
   inhibitory effect of morphine was lost (i.e. DMB-forskolin increased
   pro-enkephalin mRNA levels by 2 fold in either control and
   morphine-treated rats). These data not only demonstrate the in vivo
   relevance of opioid-inhibited adenylyl cyclase in the control of
   pro-enkephalin mRNA levels, but also show that this model is useful for
   studying how this signal transduction system is attenuated during the
   development of tolerance.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The time-mean response over the tropical Pacific region to a quadrupling
   of CO2 is investigated using a global coupled ocean-atmosphere general
   circulation model. Tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) rise
   by about 4 degrees-5 degrees C. The zonal SST gradient along the equator
   decreases by about 20\%, although it takes about one century (with CO2
   increasing at 1\% per year compounded) for this change to become clearly
   evident in the model. Over the central equatorial Pacific, the decreased
   SST gradient is accompanied by similar decreases in the easterly wind
   stress and westward ocean surface currents and by a local maximum in
   precipitation increase.
   Over the entire rising branch region of the Walker circulation,
   precipitation is enhanced by 15\%, but the time-mean upward motion
   decreases slightly in intensity. The failure of the zonal overturning
   atmospheric circulation to intensify with a quadrupling of CO2 is
   surprising in light of the increased time-mean condensation heating over
   the `'warm pool'' region. Three aspects of the model response are
   important for interpreting this result. 1) The time-mean radiative
   cooling of the upper troposphere is enhanced, due to both the pronounced
   upper-tropospheric warming and to the large fractional increase of
   upper-tropospheric water vapor. 2) The dynamical cooling term, -(\$)
   over bar omega partial derivative (\$) over bar theta p, is enhanced due
   to increased time-mean static stability (-partial derivative (\$) over
   bar theta/partial derivative p). This is an effect of moist convection,
   which keeps the lapse rate close to the moist adiabatic rate, thereby
   making -partial derivative (\$) over bar theta/partial derivative p
   larger in a warmer climate. The enhanced radiative cooling and increased
   static stability allow for the enhanced time-mean heating by moist
   convection and condensation to be balanced without stronger time-mean
   upward motions. 3) The weaker surface zonal winds and wind stress in the
   equatorial Pacific are consistent with the reduced zonal SST gradient.
   The SST gradient is damped by the west-east differential in evaporative
   surface cooling (with greater evaporative cooling in the west than in
   the east). This evaporative damping increases with increasing
   temperature, owing to the temperature dependence of saturation mixing
   ratios, which leads to a reduction in the SST gradient in the warmer
   climate.}},

   a direct-coupled amplifier topology, A nominal gain of 22.5 dB and a

   while consuming less than 55 m W of de power through a 5 V supply, This
   result benchmarks the lowest noise figure so far reported for a
   direct-coupled HBT amplifier at X-band frequencies, In addition, an
   approximate expression for the amplifier noise figure is given that
   predicts the noise figure to within 0.3 dB over bias and frequency, The
   amplifier can be compacted into a 0.3 x 0.3 mm(2) area and can yield as
   many as 30 000 die per 3-in. GaAs wafer. The broadband gain and noise

Abstract = {{Rotational symmetries of macromolecules are most clearly perceived in
   the en face projection and may be assessed by inspection of rotational
   power spectra calculated from electron micrographs of individual
   particles. However, if the symmetry is not contrasted strongly, this
   procedure may be inconclusive since the relevant peak may not be
   convincingly higher than other spectral components. To some extent, this
   is a sampling problem since the number of repeating elements involved is
   usually small. We have devised more sensitive statistical tests for
   rotational symmetry that pool the information contents of entire
   populations of particles. Both tests involve combining the rotational
   spectra of many particles and comparing them with the spectra of
   surrounding background areas. One method is based on the well known
   t-test which estimates whether two populations differ at a given
   significance level. In the second test, the ratio between the intensity
   of each component of the rotational spectrum and the average
   corresponding intensity for background areas is calculated, and thence,
   the cumulative product of these ratios over all particles in the data
   set. If a symmetry is present, this product gradually diverges;
   otherwise, it converges to zero. As a practical trial, the tests were
   applied to micrographs of negatively stained hexons of herpes simplex
   virus and confirmed their 6-fold symmetry. Applied to negatively stained
   `'connector'' proteins of bacteriophage T7 purified from a plasmid
   expression system, both algorithms detected polymorphism with distinct
   subpopulations of both 13-fold and 12-fold connectors.}},

Abstract = {{The beneficial effects of coronary vasodilators on exercise capacity in
   patients with angina pectoris are well known. However, their effects on
   oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics at the onset of exercise have not been
   elucidated. The present study was undertaken to determine the acute
   effects of nicorandil, a newer coronary vasodilator, on the kinetics of
   VO2 at the onset of exercise in patients with ischemic heart disease.
   Ten patients with significant coronary stenosis performed constant
   mild-intensity cycle exercise (32 +/- 3 W) for 6 minutes after oral
   administration of 10 mg of nicorandil or an identical placebo in a
   double-blind, crossover manner. Nicorandil had no effect on resting
   heart race, blood pressure, or VO2. However, the time constant for the
   increase in VO2 during constant work rate exercise was significantly
   shorter (the kinetics of VO2 were faster) after administration of
   nicorandil than after placebo (46.5 +/- 13.3 vs 51.1 +/- 11.9 seconds; p
   = 0.039). The increase in VO2 at 6 minutes compared with 3 minutes of
   constant work, which reflects the VO2 kinetics, also was reduced with
   nicorandil (3.8 +/- 37.9 vs 27.5 +/- 27.1 ml/min; p = 0.022). Nicorandil
   was found to increase the rate of VO2 increase during the onset of
   constant work rate exercise, probably as a result of an improved
   response in cardiac output. Analysis of VO2 kinetics provides new and
   useful parameters for the evaluation of circulatory adjustments at the
   onset of exercise in patients with ischemic heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Retinoids stimulate tissue-type plasminogen-activator (t-PA) gene
   expression in human endothelial cells, and are likely to do so by
   binding to one or more nuclear retinoid receptors. The present study was
   initiated to identify the retinoid receptor(s) involved in this process.
   Expression and regulation of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid
   X receptors (RXRs) were analyzed by Northern-blot analysis of total or
   poly(A)-rich RNA prepared from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVEC). Prior to any exposure to retinoids, HUVEC express two
   transcripts for RAR-alpha (3.6 kb and 2.8 kb), and low levels of
   transcripts for RAR-beta (3.4 kb and 3.2 kb) and RAR-gamma (3.3 kb and
   3.1 kb). Two RXR subtypes were identified, RXR-alpha (4.8 kb) and, at a
   much lower concentration, RXR-beta (2.4 kb); no evidence for the
   presence of RXR-gamma was found. Furthermore, HUVEC express cellular
   retinol-binding protein I (CRBP-I) and cellular retinoic-acid-binding
   protein I (CRABP-I) mRNA. Exposure of HUVEC to 1 mu M retinoic acid or
   the retinobenzoic acid, Ch55, led to the induction of the two RAR-beta
   mRNAs, RXR-alpha mRNA and CRBP-I mRNA, whereas the expression of the
   other receptor and CRABP-I transcripts did not change appreciably. Using
   retinoid analogues that bind preferentially to one of the RAR or RXR
   subtypes, we found evidence that RAR-alpha is involved in the
   retinoid-induced t-PA expression in HUVEC. This conclusion was
   strengthened by experiments in which blocking of RAR-alpha with a
   specific RAR-alpha antagonist, Ro 41-5253, was demonstrated to suppress
   the induction of t-PA by retinoids.}},

Abstract = {{Stress-relaxation processes of tetrafluoroethylene-propylene (TFE-P)
   elastomer compositions (including crosslinked and carbon-black-filled
   samples) were studied within the temperature range from 298 to 573 K in
   air over times ranging from 10(1) to 3 x 10(5) s. Using the
   Tobolsky-Murakami method, discrete spectra of the relaxation times
   (tau(i)) were determined. In the high elastic state, lambda-relaxation
   region transitions proceed by segmental motion, with activation energies
   up to 55kJmol(-1). These processes are related to the rearrangement of
   domains formed by different microstructures of the fluoroelastomer
   chain, the so-called `soft' rubber component. The activation energy,
   U(p)hi, of the phi-transition corresponds to a rearrangement of the
   carbon black filler network, i.e. `hard' rubber component. Three
   relaxation processes were registered in crosslinked elastomers, which
   are associated with changes in the chemical network. They consist of
   several transitions: the delta(1)-process has the lowest activation
   energy (U-delta 1 = 64 kJ mol(-1)) and can be related to the
   rearrangement of the dense sections of the chemical network, whereas the
   mu(F)-transition can be connected with decomposition and recombination
   of cross-pseudo-hydrogen bonds between fluorine and hydrogen atoms. This
   energy is close to the viscous flow activation energy in the
   pseudo-plastic region in terms of the de Waele-Ostwald equation. The
   other delta-process can be assigned to the high-temperature destruction
   of C-C bonds in the chemical network. By dynamic mechanical experiments,
   the principal alpha-relaxation and three beta-transitions below T-g were
   also registered.}},

Abstract = {{Time course accumulations of organic acids and proline were measured in
   soybean (Glycine max Merr, cv. Maple Arow) seeds. Seeds were soaked and
   germinated either in control Knop solution (C solution), in buffered C
   (from pH 4 to pH 7.8), or in C supplemented with -0.11 MPa isoosmotic
   salts (KCl, NaCl, NH4Cl, CaCl2, mannitol). Solute analyses were carried
   out during imbibition (from 0 to 12 h) or 5 days after radicle
   emergence. Soaking seeds as well as seedlings (at the stage of radicle
   emergence) were transferred from C into NaCl or mannitol media, or from
   NaCl into C solution. During imbibition, KCl, NaCl and mannitol caused a
   50\% increase of the organic acid pool (mainly succinate), while proline
   increased only slightly. Conversely, pH solutions did not exert changes
   in organic acids, proline levels decreasing only at a pH value about 8.
   NaCl-treated seeds previously soaked for 1 h in C solution displayed
   increased organic acid contents compared with seeds continuously soaked
   in C solution. Yet, no change in organic acids was detectable in seeds
   soaked in NaCl solution or transferred into C after 1 or 6 h of exposure
   to NaCl. In NaCl-imbibed seeds, the proline synthesis began after a 7-h
   lag phase and was independent from external osmolarity. Growth of
   NaCl-treated seedlings decreased by 55\% compared with C seedlings. Dry
   matter production, organic acid and proline levels remained comparable
   either in seedlings stressed by 1-h imbibition in NaCl before transfer
   into control solution, or in salt tolerant seedlings imbibed in control
   medium before transfer into NaCl medium. The relationships between
   proline and organic acid accumulation, NaCl-sensitivity of seeds and
   NaCl-tolerance of seedclings are discussed.}},

   500 mu M range of external NO3- {[}NO3-](o). The V-max of this system
   was 0.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), and the K-m was approximately 15 mu M.
   Following exposure to NO3- for 3 d, this CHATS activity was increased

   Saalian sequence at Belchatow is underlain by Holsteinian and overlain
   by Eemian sequences, both palaeobotanically analysed. The Chojny
   Formation contains deposits of meandering (lower member) and braided
   (upper member) rivers, with occasional aeolian deposits. The lower
   member of the formation contains numerous organic layers. Pollen
   analysis indicates temperate (sub-boreal) to cold (sub-arctic) climatic
   conditions, with coniferous to mixed forests in the optimum phase of the
   interstadial. The interstadial floras of the Chojny Formation are
   interpreted as representing the intra-Saalian Pilica Interstadial.
   Profiles from Belchatow are designated as the stratotype profiles of

   and 2A (PP-1 and PP-2A), significantly slowed channel rundown. Removal
   of Mg2+ from the bath also slowed the rundown process. Incubation of
   cells with OA in the absence of Mg2+ or with orthovanadate in ATP-free
   solution maintained channel activity at levels of similar to 70\% of
   control values for 3 min after membrane excision. In contrast, Ca2+ (0.1
   mM) and calmodulin (1 mu M) in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, a condition in
   which PP-2B is stimulated, had no significant effect on the channel
   activity that persisted in the presence of OA and orthovanadate.
   Application of exogenous PP-2A (1 U/ml) to the cytosolic side of
   membrane in inside-out patches significantly inhibited channel activity
   to 35.0\% of control, but the inhibitory effects of PP-1 (1 U/ml) and
   PP-2B (20 mu g/ml) were minor. These results suggest that rundown of the
   renal K-ATP channel after membrane excision results mainly from
   dephosphorylation of the channel or an associated protein by
   membrane-bound phosphatases. Our data suggest that at least two types of
   phosphatases, OA-sensitive PP-2A and a Mg2+-dependent phosphatase,
   possibly PP-2C, are involved in this dephosphorylation process.}},

   inheritance should be used just to model a generalization/specialization
   relationship (i.e., an IS-A). This analysis/design guideline is too
   permissive. Some researchers thus advocate that a subclass should
   inherit the full behavior of its superclass. Behavior inheritance,
   however, is far too restricted. In this paper, we establish a formal
   model that can clearly differentiate IS-A from behavior inheritance.
   Under this model, IS-A and behavior inheritance can be decomposed into
   more fundamental concepts: subset and abstraction/concretization. Also,
   we are able to develop a set of refined guidelines regarding the use of
   inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an expensive, widely
   used device for severe ventricular arrhythmias. Marginal
   cost-effectiveness analysis is a technique to examine the incremental
   cost of treatment strategy in relation to its effectiveness. In this
   study, we used this technique to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the
   ICD compared with that of electrophysiology (EP)-guided drug therapy and
   examined ways in which it may be improved. We analyzed Michigan Medicare
   discharge abstracts (1989 to 1992) and local physician visit, test, and
   ICD charges. Effectiveness was from 218 previously described patients
   with ICDs in whom the time of first event (first appropriate shock or
   death) was determined and presumed to represent `'control'' (EP-guided
   drug therapy) mortality. We assumed a 4-year life cycle for the ICD
   generator and 3,4\% operative mortality and used a 5\% discount to
   present value. Data were analyzed in a 1-month cycle Markov decision
   model over a 6-year horizon, and results were updated to 1993 dollars.
   ICD effectiveness was an increase in discounted mean life expectancy of
   1.72 years. Cost-effectiveness was \$31,100/year of life saved (YLS).
   Results were minimally or modestly sensitive to variations in
   preoperative mortality; resource use; consideration only of patients
   with ICDs who were receiving any antiarrhythmic drug or specifically
   amiodarone; and to a decrease in the percentage of first shocks that
   would equal death without the ICD until the assumed percentage decreased
   to < 38\%. At ejection fraction of < 0.25 and greater than or equal to
   0.25, cost-effectiveness was \$44,000/YLS and \$27,200/YLS,
   respectively, and without preimplant EP study was \$18,100/ YLS.
   Cost-effectiveness of the endocardial ICD in preliminary analysis was
   \$25,700/YLS. Sensitivities were similar to those of the epicardial ICD,
   as was improvement in value in patients with ejection fractions greater
   than or equal to 0.25 and without preimplant EP study, for whom
   cost-effectiveness was \$14,200/ YLS. In conclusion, use of
   first-discharge data provides a method of determining ICD
   cost-effectiveness, which is consistent with that of other techniques.
   The endocardial ICD, which is now the device predominantly used, is
   somewhat more cost-effective than the epicardial, but becomes highly so
   in patients with ejection fractions greater than or equal to 0.25 and in
   particular when hospital length of stay is reduced by elimination of the
   preimplantation EP test. Recent reductions in length of stay with
   routine implantation of the endocardial device appear also to bring
   cost-effectiveness to this rather favorable level.}},

Abstract = {{The allele e4 (ape e4) of apolipoprotein E (ape E) has been associated
   with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in
   cross-sectional studies in middle-aged subjects. We investigated the
   risk of CHD and stroke with respect to the number of apo e4 alleles in a
   prospective study of a Finnish nondiabetic cohort including 1067
   subjects 65 to 74 years old at baseline. During the 3.5-year follow-up,
   CHD mortality was 2.8\%, total CHD incidence 6.9\%, and the cumulative
   occurrence of CHD (prevalence at baseline and the 3.5-year incidence
   combined) 17.0\%. The incidence of stroke was 3.4\%, and the cumulative
   occurrence of stroke was 6.0\%. The CHD mortality was 3.4\% in subjects
   with no apo e4 allele (n = 734), 1.7\% in those with one apo e4 allele
   (n = 296), and O\% in subjects with two apo e4 alleles (n = 37) (P = NS
   between the three groups). The incidence of CHD according to the number
   of apo e4 alleles was 6.9\% (no apo e4 alleles), 7.4\% (one apo e4
   allele), and 2.7\% (two apo e4 alleles), and the cumulative occurrence
   of CHD was 16.5\%, 18.6\%, and 13.5\%, respectively (P = NS). The
   incidence of stroke was 3.8\% in subjects with no apo e4 allele, 2.7\%
   in those with one apo e4 allele, and 0\% in those with two apo e4
   alleles (P = NS). The cumulative occurrence of stroke was 6.0\%, 6.4\%,
   and 2.7\%, respectively (P = NS). In conclusion, in contrast to
   middle-aged subjects, the risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly
   subjects with apo e4 is not increased. Consequently, the allele e4 of
   apo E cannot be regarded as an important risk factor for CHD or stroke
   in the elderly.}},

Abstract = {{The nematode C. elegans naturally develops as either an XO male or XX
   hermaphrodite, The sex-determining gene, tra-2, promotes hermaphrodite
   development in XX animals, This gene encodes a predicted membrane
   protein, named TRA-2A, which has been proposed to provide the primary
   feminising activity of the tra-2 locus, Here, we show that transgenic
   TRA-2A driven from a heat shock promoter can fully feminise the somatic
   tissues of XX tra-2 loss-of-function mutants, which would otherwise
   develop as male. TRA-2A is thus likely to provide a component of the
   tra-2 locus that is both necessary and sufficient to promote female
   somatic development, Transgenic TRA-2A driven by the heat shock promoter
   can also transform XO animals from male to self-fertile hermaphrodite,
   This result establishes the role of tra-2 as a developmental switch that
   controls somatic sexual cell fate, We show that a carboxy-terminal
   region of TRA-2A, predicted to be intracellular, can partially feminise
   XX tra-2 loss-of-function mutants and XO tra-2(+) males, We suggest that
   this intracellular domain of TRA-2A promotes hermaphrodite development
   by negatively regulating the FEM proteins.}},

   inverted microstrip line has been carried out in order to validate the
   model, in the 5 MHz-3 GHz bandwidth and in the 10 K-85 K temperature
   range. Experimental results are presented and a good agreement is
   observed with modeling data. It is shown that the two-fluid model is
   applicable over a wide range of temperatures below the critical
   temperature. The comparison of the bipolaron model and the classical
   London model is carried out. In addition, different thin film deposition
   techniques have been investigated. Other important issues such as
   accurate analytic expression of the kinetic inductance are addressed for
   these structures.}},

Abstract = {{Castleman's disease (also called giant lymph node hyperplasia or
   angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a clinicopathological entity
   of unknown etiology. Two histologic patterns of lymph nodes are
   classically recognized: the hyaline-vascular and plasma-cell variants.
   Recently, multicentric Castleman's disease has emerged as a separate
   clinical entity manifested primarily by generalized lymphadenopathy and
   systemic manifestations, such as thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia,
   hepatosplenomegaly, altered liver function tests, central nervous system
   alterations, and autoimmune manifestations. A number of renal
   alterations have been described in association with the two pathological
   variants of Castleman's disease, but thrombotic microangiopathy has been
   previously reported only once in a patient with Castleman's disease, No
   renal biopsy was performed in that patient, although there was evidence
   of renal dysfunction. We report two cases of biopsy-proven renal
   thrombotic microangiopathy associated with multicentric Castleman's
   disease. In addition to having lymph node pathology characteristic of
   Castleman's disease, both patients presented with generalized
   lymphadenopathy and systemic manifestations, including acute renal
   failure, hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
   hypoalbuminemia. Autoantibodies were present in both patients, including
   antiphospholipid antibodies in one patient. The renal biopsies, examined
   by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, were diagnostic
   for renal thrombotic microangiopathy. The simultaneous development of
   two rather uncommon syndromes, multicentric Castleman's disease and
   renal thrombotic microangiopathy, suggests a possible link between
   Castleman's disease and renal thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore,
   we propose that the production of autoantibodies, in particular
   antiphospholipid antibodies, may lead to the development of thrombotic
   microangiopathy in some patients with multicentric Castleman's disease.}},

   Survey, matched with Reserve Components Common Personnel Data System
   files for 1985 to 1991, are analyzed to estimate the probability of
   reenlistment. The estimates reveal that reenlistment probability
   increases with an increase in reserve earnings, preferably as these
   match or surpass civilian wage opportunities. The attitudinal and
   affective variables, such as a spouse's favorable attitude toward the
   reservist's reenlistment, or a reservist's satisfaction with military
   life, or his/her job satisfaction, also increase reenlistment
   intentions. Reenlistment probability is, however, reduced if the
   reservist's primary job requires 45 or more hours per week, if a
   reservist's spouse is working for pay, or if a reservist spends a
   smaller percentage of time in the Primary Military Occupational
   Specialty (PMOS) for which he/she is trained. Policy implications of
   these results are discussed in the context of increasing reenlistment.}},

   a surgical diagnosis of elastofibroma who had had CT and/or MR scans. CT
   and MR imaging were compared to histologic findings in two patients. CT
   was available in three patients and demonstrated periscapular
   soft-tissue tumor with an attenuation similar to that of adjacent
   muscle. In one patient, the tumors appeared homogeneous. In two
   patients, the tumor showed strands of low density similar to that of
   adjacent subcutaneous fat on CT. On MR imaging, all five tumors showed
   predominantly low-signal intensity on both T-1 and T-2-weighted images.
   The tumors contained focal areas with high-signal intensity on
   T-1-weighted scans that showed intermediate to high-signal intensity
   with T-2-weighting. The areas of low-signal intensity on both T-1 and
   T-2-weighted images corresponded histologically to fibroelastic tissue.
   The areas of high signal intensity on T-1-weighting and intermediate to
   high-signal intensity on T-2-weighting reflected focal areas of fat
   within the tumor. Although CT and MR imaging findings are not specific,
   the presence of a soft-tissue tumor along the chest wall in a
   periscapular location that shows predominantly low intensity on all
   sequences reflecting fibrous tissue with interspersed focal areas of
   fatty tissue is highly suggestive of elastofibroma.}},
