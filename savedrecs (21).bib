Abstract = {{Water controls the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems directly, as a
   resource for the biota, and indirectly, as a driver for abiotic
   processes on the Earth's surface, in the atmosphere, and belowground The
   biota, in turn, modulate several hydrological processes and the rate of
   the water cycle Here we review recent advances related to fundamental
   processes and feedbacks emerging from the interactions among hydrologic
   processes and ecosystems, with a particular focus on soil moisture
   dynamics and river flow Most terrestrial vegetation interacts with
   hydrological processes through the soil water balance which is affected
   by soil properties, random climate drivers and feedbacks with the biota
   River flow enhances the ecohydrological connectivity of the landscape,
   spreading sediments, nutrients propagules and waterborne disease through
   waterways}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), are
   the leading cause of death among humans. Adhesion proteins, owing to
   their involvement in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic

   decided to conduct a preliminary investigation of adhesion protein gene
   expression in ACS patients as well as in healthy subjects by making use
   of oligonucleotide microarray technology. Analysis of eight microarrays
   revealed ten upregulated genes differentiating between the two groups:
   intercellular adhesion molecule-2, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
   molecule-1, zyxin, integrin-linked kinase, calcium and integrin binding
   protein-1 (calmyrin), integrin beta 2, integrin beta 3 (ITGB3), integrin

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a vibration-based damage identification method that
   utilises a ``damage fingerprint{''} of a structure in combination with
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural network techniques to
   identify defects. The Damage Index (DI) method is used to extract unique
   damage patterns from a damaged beam structure with the undamaged
   structure as baseline. PCA is applied to reduce the effect of
   measurement noise and optimise neural network training. PCA-compressed
   DI values are, then, used as inputs for a hierarchy of neural network
   ensembles to estimate locations and seventies of various damage cases.
   The developed method is verified by a laboratory structure and numerical
   simulations in which measurement noise is taken into account with
   different levels of white Gaussian noise added. The damage
   identification results obtained from the neural network ensembles show
   that the presented method is capable of overcoming problems inherent in
   the conventional DI method. Issues associated with field testing
   conditions are successfully dealt with for numerical and the
   experimental simulations. Moreover, it is shown that the neural network
   ensemble produces results that are more accurate than any of the
   outcomes of the individual neural networks.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{148}},

Abstract = {{In the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis, systemic chemotherapy is
   not quite effective due to the poor penetration of cytotoxic agents into
   the peritoneal cavity, whereas intraperitoneal administration of
   chemotherapeutic agents is generally accompanied by quick absorption of
   the free drug from the peritoneum. Local delivery of drugs with
   controlled-release delivery systems like liposomes could provide
   sustained, elevated drug levels and reduce local and systemic toxicity.
   In order to achieve an ameliorated liposomal formulation that results in
   higher peritoneal levels of the drug and retention, vesicles composed of
   different phospholipid compositions (distearoyl {[}DSPC]; dipalmitoyl
   {[}DPPC]; or dimiristoylphosphatidylcholine {[}DMPC]) and various
   charges (neutral; negative, containing distearoylphosphatidylglycerol
   {[}DSPG]; or positive, containing dioleyloxy trimethylammonium propane
   {[}DOTAP]) were prepared at two sizes of 100 and 1000 nm. The effect of
   surface hydrophilicity was also investigated by incorporating PEG into
   the DSPC-containing neutral and charged liposomes. Liposomes were
   labeled with Tc-99m and injected into mouse peritoneum. Mice were then
   sacrificed at eight different time points, and the percentage of
   injected radiolabel in the peritoneal cavity and the tissue distribution
   in terms of the percent of the injected dose/gram of tissue (\%ID/g)
   were obtained.
   The ratio of the peritoneal AUC to the free label ranged from a minimum
   of 4.95 for DMPC/CHOL (cholesterol) 100 nm vesicles to a maximum of
   24.99 for DSPC/CHOL/DOTAP 1000 nm (DOTAP 1000) vesicles. These last
   positively charged vesicles had the greatest peritoneal level; moreover,
   their level remained constant at approximately 25\% of the injected dose
   from 2 to 48 h. Among the conventional (i.e., without PEG) 100 nm
   liposomes, the positively charged vesicles again showed the greatest
   retention. Incorporation of PEG at this size into the lipid structures
   augmented the peritoneal level, particularly for negatively charged
   liposomes. The positively charged PEGylated vesicles (DOTAP/PEG 100) had
   the second-greatest peritoneal level after DOTAP 1000; however, their
   peritoneal-to-blood AUC ratio was low (3.05).
   Overall, among the different liposomal formulations, the positively
   charged conventional liposomes (100 and 1000 nm) provided greater
   peritoneal levels and retention. DOTAP/PEG100 may also be a more
   efficient formulation because this formulation can provide a high level
   of anticancer drug into the peritoneal cavity and also can passively
   target the primary tumor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human senses play an important role in people's understanding and
   experience of products. The overall aim of this explorative study was to
   further investigate users' haptic product experiences in respect of how
   they are verbalised and how they relate to visual product experiences.
   The pilot studies revealed an important result, showing the
   participants' difficulty in verbalising product experiences. A mediating
   tool was therefore introduced to trigger the information. The main
   results of the study are that haptic product experiences appeared to
   contribute to all experience dimensions, but especially those concerning
   the dimensions ``interface qualities{''} and ``objective/measurable{''}.
   The results indicate that the information received from one sense
   created expectations for experiences through other senses and the
   information perceived through the second sense was used to confirm or
   modify anticipated experiences. The less prior knowledge participants
   had of the particular product, the more important the additional
   information delivered through the second sense appeared to be. Finally,
   haptic product experiences appeared to be related to a few haptic
   product properties, but more systematic studies need to be carried out
   to confirm these results and to identify the effect of the product
   properties on the intensity of different haptic product experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Human cerebral malaria causes neurological and behavioral deficits which
   persist long after resolution of infection and clearance of parasites
   with antimalarial drugs. Previously, we demonstrated that during active
   infection, mice with cerebral malaria demonstrated negative behavioral
   outcomes. Here we used a chloroquine treatment model of cerebral malaria
   to determine whether these abnormal outcomes would be persistent in the
   mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA,
   and treated for ten days. After cessation of chloroquine, a
   comprehensive assessment of cognitive and motor function demonstrated
   persistence of abnormal behavioral outcomes, 10 days after successful
   eradication of parasites. Furthermore, these deficits were still evident
   forty days after cessation of chloroquine, indicating persistence long
   after successful treatment, a hallmark feature of human cerebral
   malaria. Thus, cognitive tests similar to those used in these mouse
   studies could facilitate the development of adjunctive therapies that
   can ameliorate adverse neurological outcomes in human cerebral malaria.

Abstract = {{A novel experiment is used to show that the effect of a policy on the
   level of cooperation is greater when it is chosen democratically by the
   subjects than when it is exogenously imposed. In contrast to the
   previous literature, our experimental design allows us to control for
   selection effects (e.g., those who choose the policy may be affected
   differently by it). Our finding implies that democratic institutions may
   affect behavior directly in addition to having effects through the
   choice of policies. Our findings have implications for the
   generalizability of the results of randomized policy interventions. (JEL

Abstract = {{Resume
   L'auteur examine la culture materielle de la migration en attachant une
   attention particuliere aux projets de construction de maison des
   migrants dans leur pays natal. Il examine en particulier les maisons
   construites ou renovees par des Albanais dans leur pays natal, qui n'est
   plus leur lieu de residence permanente. Ce phenomene, tres repandu en
   Albanie, apparait egalement souvent chez d'autres migrants dans le
   monde. Pourquoi des migrants vivant en dehors de leur pays
   construisent-ils des maisons dans celui-ci alors qu'ils n'ont pas
   l'intention d'y revenir ? L'auteur cherche a repondre a cette question,
   dans le cas de l'Albanie, en se concentrant empiriquement sur le
   processus de construction de ces maisons et non simplement sur l'entite
   materielle que constitue la maison. Il suggere que ` faire une maison `
   n'est pas seulement la construction d'une maison pour les migrants
   albanais : c'est aussi un moyen de s'assurer un lieu de residence
   permanent et une presence ` par procuration ` dynamique dans leur
   communaute d'origine. Ces observations ethnographiques sont egalement
   riches d'enseignement pour l'etude anthropologique des maisons aussi
   bien que des migrations internationales.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive management of wild populations requires good knowledge of the
   population status. The main way to evaluate management performance is
   through recurring surveys, which often also serve as a decision basis
   for harvest quotas. We evaluated the effect of different survey
   reliabilities and frequencies during 1-4 years on management performance
   using a stochastic age and stage-specific population model for an
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx population. As a proxy for management
   performance, we looked at the proportion of time that the population
   remained within a preferred interval, the proportion of time with no
   harvest, the average harvest number and the total number of surveys
   during the 50-year period in the simulation. In general, management
   performance increased with increased monitoring accuracy. More
   interestingly, a more reliable survey performed less frequently
   performed better than a less reliable survey performed every year. The
   management performance was not perfect even with complete knowledge of
   the population size at the survey, as annual variation in reproduction
   and survival between the survey (decision based on year t) and harvest
   (performed in year t+1) sometimes cause the population to be outside the
   preferred interval. If financial resources are limited, we recommend
   managers to minimise the error in the survey rather than to increase the
   frequency of surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a recent communication by the present authors the question of
   energy dissipation in magnetohydrodynamical waves in an inflating
   background in general relativity is examined. It is found that the
   expanding background introduces a sort of dragging force on the
   propagating wave such that, unlike the Newtonian case, energy gets
   dissipated as it progresses. This loss in energy having no
   special-relativistic analogue is, however, not mechanical in nature as
   in case of an elastic wave. It is also found that the energy loss is
   model dependent and also depends on the number of dimensions.}},

   growth-promoting activity of P. elgii was seen in tobacco in a specially
   designed gnotobiotic setup indicating its capability to promote growth
   of at least groundnut and tobacco. Metabolite changes in the bacteria,

Abstract = {{Binding of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides to guanylyl
   cyclase-A/natriuretic peptide receptor-A produces second messenger cGMP,
   which plays an important role in maintaining renal and cardiovascular
   homeostasis. Mice carrying a targeted disruption of the Npr1 gene coding
   for guanylyl cyclase-A/natriuretic peptide receptor-A exhibit changes
   that are similar to those that occur in untreated human hypertension,
   including elevated blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and congestive
   heart failure. The objective of this study was to determine whether
   disruption of the Npr1 gene in mice provokes kidney fibrosis,
   remodeling, and derangement. We found that systemic disruption of the
   Npr1 gene causes increased renal tubular damage characterized by
   dilation, flattening of epithelium, and expansion of interstitial spaces
   in Npr1(-/-) (0-copy) mice. Significant increases occurred in the
   expression levels of TNF-alpha (4-fold), IL-6 (4.5-fold), and TGF-beta 1
   (2-fold) in 0-copy null mutant mice compared with 2-copy wild-type mice.
   An increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition indicated by increased
   expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, was observed in Npr1(-/-) mouse
   kidneys. Treatment with captopril and losartan showed a 38 and 46\%
   attenuation in fibrosis and 30 and 42\% reduction in alpha-smooth muscle
   actin immunoexpression, respectively, in 1-copy and 0-copy mice compared
   with 2-copy mice. Although bendroflumethiazide treatment did not show
   any effect. The present results demonstrate that the disruption of Npr1
   gene activates proinflammatory cytokines leading to fibrosis,
   hypertrophic growth, and remodeling of the kidneys of mutant mice.

Abstract = {{Nowadays subsidy payments on electrical energy have to be managed and
   controlled to prevent any side effect particularly in developing
   countries. Effects of some external factors on Energy consumption and
   electricity distribution indices are analyzed in this paper. External
   factors are classified into three categories of social behavior,
   governance and urban planning. MC (Marginal Cost) of electricity in
   distribution is considered as the main index to be analyzed. Also, ANN
   (Artificial Neural Network) is applied to simulate effect of the
   mentioned factors on MC of distribution sector. Numerical investigation
   on the indices for a sample DISCO (Distribution Company) in Iran is
   made, results indicate that the more subsidies are allocated to
   consumers the more MC is increased. AGA (Asset Governance Assessment),
   which is proposed as a kind of governance decision, could improve the
   performance efficiency and avoid lose of activities done by DISCOs
   through subsidy management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P>Several proteins encoded by the cellulose synthase-like (CSL) gene
   family are known to be processive glycan synthases involved in the
   synthesis of cell-wall polysaccharides. These include CSLA proteins,
   which synthesize beta-(1 -> 4)-linked mannans found in the walls of many
   plant species, and CSLC proteins, which are thought to synthesize the
   beta-(1 -> 4)-linked glucan backbone of xyloglucan, an abundant
   polysaccharide in the primary walls of many plants. CSLA and CSLC
   proteins are predicted to have multiple membrane spans, and their
   products (mannan and xyloglucan) accumulate in the Golgi lumen. Knowing
   where these proteins are located in the cell and how they are orientated
   in the membrane is important for understanding many aspects of mannan
   and xyloglucan biosynthesis. In this study, we investigate the
   subcellular localization and membrane protein topology of CSLA9 and
   CSLC4, the members of these two families that are most highly expressed
   in Arabidopsis. CSLA9 and CSLC4 are found predominantly in Golgi
   membranes, based on co-localization with the known ER/Golgi marker
   ERD2-YFP. The topology of epitope-tagged proteins was examined using
   protease protection experiments. Experiments were designed to determine
   the positions of both the protein termini and the active loop of the CSL
   proteins investigated. The topology of CSLA9 is characterized by an odd
   number of transmembrane domains (probably five) and an active site that
   faces the Golgi lumen. In contrast, CSLC4 has an even number of
   transmembrane domains (probably six) and an active site that faces the
   cytosol. The implications of these topologies on various aspects of
   hemicellulose biosynthesis are discussed.}},

   Combining Accelerometry and HR for Assessing Preschoolers' Physical
   Activity. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 42, No. 12, pp. 2237-2243, 2010.
   Purpose: With rising obesity and rapidly decreasing levels of physical
   activity (PA) in young children, accurate PA measurement is needed for
   early screening and intervention evaluation. Although the combination of
   accelerometry (ACC) with HR recordings is accurate in assessing PA
   intensity in older children, its utility in correctly classifying PA in
   preschoolers is unknown. Methods: Thirty-three children (64\% were boys)
   were recruited from four German preschools. Data included direct
   observation and Actiheart (CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) monitoring during
   2.5 perpendicular to 0.7 h (derivation data) and 1.5 perpendicular to
   0.3 h (validation data). Observers assessed PA using the Children's
   Activity Rating Scale (CARS). Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined
   by a CARS score of 4 or 5, and sedentary behavior (SB) was defined by a
   CARS score of 1 or 2. Actiheart recordings were linked to CARS level,
   with means and 95\% confidence intervals calculated for ACC and HR at
   each observed CARS level and for MVPA/SB. Using receiver operating
   characteristic analysis, gender-specific ACC and HR cutoffs for
   correctly classifying MVPA and SB were first determined in a derivation
   data set and then tested in a separate validation data set of
   observations. Results: By combining HR and ACC cutoffs, 91\% and 87\% of
   the 15-s intervals observed as MVPA were correctly classified in girls
   and boys, respectively. Although generally lower, correct classification
   rates for SB were highest when only ACC cutoffs were applied (69\% for
   girls and 67\% for boys) rather than when combined cutoffs were used.
   Conclusions: Devices that combine HR and ACC data yield an accurate
   classification of MVPA in preschoolers but perform less well for
   classifying SB. These differences underscore the need to match
   evaluation methods with the objectives of future PA interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline silicon is the most important semiconductor material in the
   electronics industry. However, silicon has poor optical properties
   because of its indirect bandgap, which prevents the efficient emission
   and absorption of light. The energy structure of silicon can be
   manipulated through quantum confinement effects, and the excitonic
   emission from silicon nanocrystals increases in intensity and shifts to
   shorter wavelengths (a blueshift) as the size of the nanocrystals is
   reduced. Here we report experimental evidence for a short-lived visible
   band in the photoluminescence spectrum of silicon nanocrystals that
   increases in intensity and shifts to longer wavelengths (a redshift)
   with smaller nanocrystal sizes. This higher intensity indicates an
   increased quantum efficiency, which for 2.5-nm-diameter nanocrystals is
   enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to bulk silicon. We
   assign this band to the radiative recombination of non-equilibrium
   electron-hole pairs in a process that does not involve phonons.}},

   Umweganregung pattern measured at 1003 K. Owing to the high density of
   multiple diffraction peaks in the indexing of the pattern, contrasting
   with the low density of experimental peaks, a procedure to correctly
   index peaks has first been applied. After the correct indexing, the
   peaks were selected taking into account their quality (adequate
   intensity and definition) and then classified in accordance with their
   suitability for the determination of a or c. The azimuthal angular
   positions of classified peaks were applied to indexing diagrams in order
   to obtain sets of values for both a and c. Weighted means of the sets
   give final values for a and c. In order to obtain more reliable final
   values an iterative process has been employed. A statistical analysis of
   data has also been employed to calculate uncertainties for the mean
   values found in the iterative process. After 12 cycles of iteration, the

Abstract = {{Very little research has been conducted on the swimming capacity of
   Neotropical fish. The few studies available have focused on large
   migratory species. The present study used fixed and increasing velocity
   tests to determine prolonged and sustained speeds of the ``pequira{''},
   Bryconamericus stramineus Eigenmann, 1908, a small, abundant species
   found in fish passages implemented at the Parana basin, Brazil. The
   results of increasing velocity tests showed significant relationships
   between critical speeds, total and standard lengths, and body weight.
   When compared with other Neotropical fish, the ``pequira{''} is able to
   swim faster than individuals of other species of similar length. The
   point of change from sustained to prolonged swimming was found to occur
   at an approximate speed of 8.7 lengths per second. These data provide
   guidance and criteria for design and proper maintenance of structures
   such as fishways, fish screens and other systems that aim to facilitate
   or avoid upstream passages as part of management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Infection by pathogenic microorganisms is a source of biological stress
   in plants. Understanding the interaction between plants and microbial
   infection at molecular level might contribute to our understanding for
   the effective control of the disease. Here, we isolated a novel putative
   receptor kinase-like protein (Citrus limon P5) that is the first
   Lec-receptor kinase-like protein isolated in lemon during a pathogen
   infection. C. limon P5 cDNA fragment was detected by differential
   display assay in C. limon during Capnodium citri (sooty mold) infection.
   The deduced amino acid sequence of P5 full-length cDNA revealed a 83\%
   sequence homology with a receptor kinase-like protein from Arabidopsis
   thaliana characterized by a N-terminal lectin domain and C-terminal
   serine/threonine conserved domain. The inhibition of the
   pathogen-responsive P5 by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and
   by a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (PD 98059) indicated a
   defense mechanism in C. limon against pathogens mediated via signal
   transduction pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that
   C. limon uses this putative defense mechanism against pathogens. The
   role of this protein is discussed as a starting point to understanding
   the molecular mechanisms in the C. limon in response to C. citri
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{During visual pursuit of a moving target, expected changes in its
   trajectory often evoke anticipatory smooth pursuit responses. In the
   present study, we investigated characteristics of anticipatory smooth
   pursuit decelerations before a change or the end of a target trajectory.
   Healthy humans had to pursue with the eyes a target moving along a
   circular path that predictably or unpredictably reversed direction and
   then retraced its movement back to the starting position. We found that
   anticipatory eye decelerations were often evoked in temporal expectation
   of target reversal and of the end of the trajectory. The latency of
   anticipatory decelerations initiated before target reversal was
   variable, had poor temporal accuracy and depended on the history of
   previous trials. Anticipations of the end of the trajectory were more
   accurate, more precise and were not influenced by previous trials. In
   this case, subjects probably based their estimate of the end of the
   trajectory on the duration just experienced before target motion
   reversal. These results suggest that anticipatory eye decelerations are
   based on the characteristics of the current or preceding trials
   depending on the most reliable information available.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is growing demand for a simple accurate scoring model
   to evaluate the quality of trauma care. This study compared different
   trauma survival prediction models with regard to their performance in
   different trauma populations.
   Methods: The probability of survival for 10 777 trauma patients admitted
   to hospital was calculated using the formulas of the following models:
   the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS), the Trauma Audit and Research
   Network (TARN) and the Base Excess Injury Severity Scale (BISS). Updated
   coefficients were calculated by logistic regression analysis based on a
   Dutch data set. Different models were compared for several subsets of
   patients, according to age and injury type and severity, using the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
   Calibration for the updated models was presented graphically.
   Results: Most of the models had an AUC exceeding 0.8. For the total
   population, the TARN Ps07 model with updated coefficients had the
   highest AUC (0.924); for the subset of patients in whom all parameters
   were available, the BISS model including the Glasgow Coma Scale had the
   highest AUC (0.909). All of the models had high discriminative power for
   patients aged less than 55 years. However, in older or intubated
   patients and in those with severe head injuries the discriminative power
   of the models dropped. The TARN model showed the best accuracy.
   Conclusion: The investigated models predict mortality fairly accurately
   in a Dutch trauma population. However, the accuracy of the models
   depends greatly on the patients included. Severe head injuries and
   greater age are likely to lead to a decrease in the accuracy of survival
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is a painful tooth condition
   affecting a large proportion of the world population. While DH is not a
   direct cause of tooth loss, it does cause discomfort and stress. DH
   treatment methods include desensitizers, such as fluoride compounds;
   polycyanoacrylate coating; low intensity laser therapy; and surgery as a
   last resort. In Cuba, a fluoride varnish, Profilac, is widely used with
   acceptable results. Tisuacryl, an N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate-based tissue
   adhesive is licensed in Cuba as a medical device used for closing wounds
   and as a protective covering or dressing for oral tissues. Experimental
   use of Tisuacryl in DH treatment has begun recently with good results.
   Objective Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tisuacryl in treating
   dentin hypersensitivity.
   Methods An experimental, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter,
   non-controlled clinical investigation was conducted using the licensed
   medical device Tisuacryl. The study universe consisted of patients with
   DH symptoms who sought treatment at three dental clinics in Havana
   Province between May 2007 and February 2009. The sample consisted of 152
   patients who met inclusion and diagnostic criteria for the study. DH was
   classified as severe, moderate, or mild. Remission of dentinal pain was
   the principal variable for evaluating effectiveness. Safety variables
   were mucosal irritation and burning sensation at the treatment site.
   Treatment was considered successful if DH was cured, defined as
   remission of pain and relief of discomfort (irritation or burning
   sensation) with no other adverse events by the final evaluation on day 6
   after treatment initiation.
   Results Tisuacryl treatment was successful in 96.7\% of patients (81.5\%
   with severe DH and 100\% with mild to moderate DH). Mucosal irritation
   was observed in only 1 patient at first evaluation on day 2 but
   disappeared by the second evaluation. No other adverse events were
   reported.
   Conclusions Tisuacryl was shown to be an effective, safe treatment of
   dentin hypersensitivity, especially moderate and mild cases.}},

Journal = {{AUTISM RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Conversational or ``co-speech{''} gestures play an important role in
   communication, facilitating turntaking, providing visuospatial
   information, clarifying subtleties of emphasis, and other pragmatic
   cues. Consistent with other pragmatic language deficits, individuals
   with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are said to produce fewer
   conversational gestures, as specified in many diagnostic measures.
   Surprisingly, while research shows fewer deictic gestures in young
   children with ASD, there is a little empirical evidence addressing other
   forms of gesture. The discrepancy between clinical and empirical
   observations may reflect impairments unrelated to frequency, such as
   gesture quality or integration with speech. Adolescents with
   high-functioning ASD (n = 15), matched on age, gender, and IQ to 15
   typically developing (TO) adolescents, completed a narrative task to
   assess the spontaneous production of speech and gesture. Naive observers
   rated the stories for communicative quality. Overall, the ASD group's
   stories were rated as less clear and engaging. Although utterance and
   gesture rates were comparable, the ASD group's gestures were less
   closely synchronized with the co-occurring speech, relative to control
   participants. This gesture speech synchrony specifically impacted
   communicative quality across participants. Furthermore, while story
   ratings were associated with gesture count in TD adolescents, no such
   relationship was observed in adolescents with ASD, suggesting that
   gestures do not amplify communication in this population. Quality
   ratings were, however, correlated with ASD symptom severity scores, such
   that participants with fewer ASD symptoms were rated as telling higher
   quality stories. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms
   of communication and neuropsychological functioning in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{We put to the test the hypothesis that the Fornax cluster dwarf galaxies
   are mostly a relatively recently acquired population, of which the
   star-forming, late-type members are converted into quiescent, early-type
   ones by ram-pressure stripping while being on orbits that plunge inside
   the inner few hundred kiloparsecs of the cluster. We construct dynamical
   models with different anisotropy profiles for the dwarf galaxy
   population and show that only extremely radially anisotropic orbital
   distributions are in agreement with the available morphological,
   positional, and kinematical data, especially with the radially
   increasing late-to-early-type ratio. This corroborates the idea that the
   Fornax cluster dwarfs are an infall population and that environmental
   factors, in this case ram-pressure stripping, play a prominent role in
   converting late-type dwarfs into early-type ones.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We sought to verify the cortical thickness and presence of
   tooth roots and inferior alveolar canal where miniplates are placed
   using the Champy technique to treat parasymphyseal fractures between the
   canine and premolar. We also studied these anatomic features at the same
   level anteriorly and posteriorly to the mental foramen.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 80 dry, normal adult dentate human
   hemimandibles (40 male and 40 female) were studied. Verification was
   performed at 3 levels above (S), below (I), and at the same height as
   the mental foramen (F). At each level, the thickness and proximity of
   the tooth roots and inferior alveolar canal were checked at 4 points;
   two anteriorly (4.5 and 9 mm) and 2 posteriorly (4.5 and 9 mm) to the
   mental foramen.
   Results: The cortical bone was significantly thicker at level F (Fa2,
   2.37 mm; Fa1, 2.43 mm; Fp1, 2.86 mm; Fp2, 2.89 mm) than the
   corresponding level S points (Sa2, 2.00 mm; Sal, 2.11 mm; Sp1, 2.30 mm;
   Sp2, 2.45 mm) and level I points (Ia2, 2.11 mm; Ia1, 2.17 mm; Ip1, 2.39
   mm; Ip2, 2.43 mm). Regarding the thickness and risk of injury, no
   difference was found between the points at levels S and I, where the
   miniplates are normally fixed with monocortical screws. No relationship
   was seen between the points at level F and the tooth roots or inferior
   alveolar canal. In contrast, a relationship between the points at level
   S and the tooth root and between the points at level I and the inferior
   alveolar canal was found.
   Conclusions: Above and below the mental foramen, the cortical bone for
   miniscrew anchorage was up to 3 mm thick. At the level of the foramen,
   the cortical plate will provide better anchorage and the insertion of
   miniscrews will be free of any risk of injuring the tooth roots or
   inferior alveolar canal. (C) 2010 American Association of Oral and

Title = {{Readout-power heating and hysteretic switching between thermal
   quasiparticle states in kinetic inductance detectors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A model is presented for readout-power heating in kinetic inductance
   detectors. It is shown that the power dissipated by the readout signal
   can cause the temperature of the quasiparticle system in the
   superconducting resonator to switch between well-defined states. At low
   readout powers, only a single solution to the heat balance equation
   exists, and the resonance curve merely distorts as the readout power is
   increased. At high readout powers, three states exist, two of which are
   stable, and the resonance curve shows hysteretic switching. The power
   threshold for switching depends on the geometry and material used but is
   typically around -70 dBm for Aluminum resonators. A comprehensive set of
   simulations is reported, and a detailed account of the switching process
   is given. Experimental results are also shown, which are in strong
   qualitative agreement with the simulations. The general features of the
   model are independent of the precise cooling function, and are even
   applicable for resonators on suspended, thermally isolated, dielectric
   membranes, where an increase in quasiparticle lifetime is expected. We
   discuss various extensions to the technique, including the possibility
   of recovering the cooling function from large-signal measurements of the
   resonance curve. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{262-268}},

Abstract = {{Objective: An unusual pattern of responding by a woman with aphasia was
   analyzed with respect to cognitive neuropsychologic models of language
   processing.
   Background: Spontaneous spelling aloud in spoken naming tasks has been
   reported in a small number of earlier cases. C.P. exhibited this
   behavior and, in addition, produced attempts at assembled phonologic
   naming that reflected errors in oral spelling.
   Method: Assessment on a variety of single word-processing tasks and
   analysis of variables' underlying performance were carried out.
   Results: The assessment revealed greater impairment to phonologic than
   to orthographic output lexical representations, and a less errorful
   route to spoken responses by spelling aloud and by assembling responses
   from grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. C.P.'s skills changed over time,
   and when written naming ceased to hold an advantage over spoken naming,
   the use of orthographic information in spoken naming ceased.
   Conclusions: C.P.'s performance supports the existence of separate
   orthographic and phonological lexicons, argues against the phonological
   mediation of spelling, and, as orthography in spoken naming seemed to be
   used strategically, shows some limits on the interaction of components
   within models of single word processing.}},

Abstract = {{The article examines European paintings, photographs, prints, popular

   French realist Gustave Courbet's Charity of a Beggar at Ornans (1868),
   British Pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti's The Beloved (1865-6),
   and Expressionist Otto Muller's Gypsy Encampment (1925). I seek to
   problematize the concept of Gypsy identity in these images as a stable,
   homogeneous ``Other{''} category that is clearly separate from the white
   population, by pointing out a variety of interpretations for the artist
   and his audience. Contrary to traditional Orientalist scholarship that
   views images of ``Others{''} as strengthening and defining white
   identity while denying agency to the depicted subject, this essay argues
   the more nuanced view that these images endow the Gypsy with a certain
   level of agency and demonstrate a less stable conception of white power.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the microstructure and photoluminescence (PL) properties of
   Nd-doped SiO2 thin films containing silicon nanoparticles (Si-np) as a
   function of the annealing temperature and the Nd concentration. The thin
   films, which were grown on Si substrates by reactive magnetron
   co-sputtering, contain the same Si excess. Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectra show that a phase separation occurs during the annealing
   due to the agglomeration of the Si excess resulting in the formation of
   Si-np. Besides, after annealing, the films exhibit PL from excitonic
   states confined in Si-np. We showed that the intensity of the PL of Nd3+
   ions that occurs at similar to 0.92, 1.06, and 1.4 mu m is maximal at
   low Nd concentration and while well-passivated Si-np are formed. FTIR
   and x-ray measurements showed that the increase in the Nd incorporation
   has detrimental effects on the PL of Nd3+ because of the formation of
   Nd2O3 nanocrystals and inherent disorder in the SiO2 host matrix. PL
   excitation measurements demonstrate that the PL of Nd3+ ions is
   nonresonant and follows the excitation of Si-np giving new evidence of
   the energy transfer from Si-np toward the rare earth ions. (C) 2010

   that it was in a post main sequence status. Being a 1.3M(circle

   phase. The mu-gradient left by the withdrawal of this core bears
   information about the processes of transport at the boundary of the

   brain is still debated, and is an important issue for correctly modeling
   extracellular potentials. Here, we first show theoretically that if the
   medium is resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for
   electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low
   frequencies (< 10 Hz). To test this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum
   of simultaneous EEG and MEG measurements in four human subjects. The
   frequency scaling of EEG displays coherent variations across the brain,
   in general between 1/f and 1/f (2), and tends to be smaller in
   parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although the variability
   of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared to EEG,
   both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some
   cases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio
   of the MEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for
   environmental and instrumental noise were tested, and they all increased
   the difference between EEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a
   significant difference in frequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which
   can be explained if the extracellular medium (including other layers
   such as dura matter and skull) is globally non-resistive.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and inconsistent features in the
   data-mining model results in poor predictions and high computational
   overhead. This paper proposes a novel information theoretic-based
   interact (IT-IN) algorithm, which concerns the relevance, redundancy,
   and consistency of the features. The proposed IT-IN algorithm is
   compared with existing Interact, FCBF, Relief and CFS feature selection
   algorithms. To evaluate the classification accuracy of IT-IN and
   remaining four feature selection algorithms, Naive Bayes, SVM, and ELM
   classifier are used for ten UCI repository datasets. The proposed IT-IN
   performs better than existing above algorithms in terms of number of
   features. The specially designed hash function is used to speed up the
   IT-IN algorithms and provides minimum computation time than the Interact
   algorithms. The result clearly reveals that the proposed feature
   selection algorithm improves the classification accuracy for ELM, Naive
   Bayes, and SVM classifiers. The performance of proposed IT-IN with ELM
   classifier is superior to other classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Metastasis of the inner auditory canal is a really rare event.
   Clinically, it usually presents with rapid worsening cranial nerve
   palsy. Authors present a review of the literature reporting clinical
   features, radiological findings, intraoperative aspects of an
   illustrative case. A 56-year-old female patient presented with a
   peripheral facial nerve palsy. MRI showed two left p-fossa tumors whose
   one into the inner canal. Rapid worsening of facial damage despite
   corticosteroid treatment and the possibility to remove both tumors in
   the same surgical step suggested authors to operated on the patient.
   Intraoperatively, inner canal tumor looked totally involving the VII-VHI
   nerve complex so surgical extirpation was only partially feasible.
   Posterior wall drilling of the meatus was performed which improved
   facial palsy. Leptomeningeal spinal seeding occurred and spinal
   irradiation was performed. The case highlights the importance of
   maintaining a high degree of awareness of the auditory canal metastasis
   in patients with a previous history of malignancy who develop a rapid
   progressive peripheral VII nerve palsy. Furthermore, our case and
   literature data suggest that inner canal metastasis is a distinct entity
   from temporal bone and pontocerebellar angle metastasis on the base of
   the peculiarity of clinical features, prognosis, therapeutic strategies.
   In fact, inner canal metastases usually arise in patients apparently
   cured, and they imply a better prognosis even if with an higher risk of
   leptomeningeal seeding. Moreover, surgery rarely allows the removal of
   the lesion, also if symptoms relief may be achieved, as in our case.}},

Abstract = {{Dellal, A, Keller, D, Carling, C, Chaouachi, A, Wong, DP, and Chamari,
   K. Physiologic effects of directional changes in intermittent exercise
   in soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 24(12): 3219-3226, 2010-The aim
   of the present study was to compare the physiologic impact of
   intermittent exercise in specific shuttle running (IS), which requires
   180 degrees directional changes, and traditional in-line (IL) running.
   Ten elite male adult soccer players performed different intermittent
   exercises according to their maximal aerobic velocity (nu(V) over
   dotO(2)max): 30-30 seconds at 100\% (30 s of runs at 100\% of nu(V) over
   dotO(2)max alternated with 30-s recovery period), 105\%, and 110\% of
   nu(V) over dotO(2)max with active recovery, 15-15 seconds at 105\%,
   110\%, and 115\% of nu(V) over dotO(2)max, and 10-10 seconds at 110\%,
   115\%, and 120\% of nu(V) over dotO(2)max with passive recovery. Each
   exercise was performed in the IL and IS format in a randomized order.
   Heart rate (HR) expressed in percentage of HR reserve (HRres),
   postexercise blood lactate concentration {[}La], and ratings of
   perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded. The different 30-30 seconds
   showed significantly higher HRres responses in IS compared with IL (p <
   0.01). The {[}La] and RPE results indicated higher values in IS. In
   conclusion, the physiologic impact of specific IS is substantially
   higher than in traditional IL. The changes of direction induce an
   increase in the anaerobic metabolism solicitation and consequently
   create different responses compared with traditional IL running. This
   information can aid coaches in the design of intermittent training
   programs using classical (IL) or a specific form (IS) of running to
   induce different physiologic responses.}},

   address concerns that the industrial discharge of dioxin like compounds

   analysis of 597 vegetation samples predominantly grass and weeds from
   residential properties selected through a multistage probabilistic
   sample design in the Midland area and in Jackson and Calhoun Counties
   (Michigan) as a background comparison for 29 polychlorinated dibenzo p
   dioxins (PCDDs) polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) The mean toxic equivalent (TEQ) of the
   house primeter vegetation samples ranged from 4 2 to 377 pg/g The ratio
   of TEQs (vegetation to soil) was about 0 3 with a maximum of 3 5 Based
   on a calculation of the similarity of the congener patterns between the
   soil and the vegetation it appeared that the source of the contamination
   on the vegetation was the surrounding soil This conclusion was supported
   by linear regression analysis which showed that the largest contributor
   to the R(2) for the outcome variable of log 10 of the vegetation
   concentration was log 10 of the surrounding soil concentration Models of
   vegetation contamination usually focus on atmospheric deposition and
   partitioning The results obtained here suggest that the deposition of
   soil particles onto vegetation is a significant route of contamination
   for residential herbage Thus the inclusion of deposition of soil
   particles onto vegetation is critical to the accurate modeling of
   contamination residential herbage in communities impacted by historic

Abstract = {{In the search for new metal-based drugs for the treatment of Chagas
   disease, the most widespread Latin American parasitic disease, novel
   complexes of the bioactive ligand risedronate (Ris,
   (1-hydroxy-1-phosphono-2-pyridin-3-yl-ethyl)phosphonate),
   {[}M-II(Ris)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O, where M Cu, Co, Mn and Ni, and
   {[}Ni-II(Ris)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot H2O were synthesized and
   characterized by using analytical measurements, thermogravimetric
   analyses, cyclic voltammetry and infrared and Raman spectroscopies.
   Crystal structures of {[}Cu-II(Ris)(2)]4H(2)O and
   {[}Ni-II(Ris)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot H2O were solved by single crystal
   X-ray diffraction methods. The complexes, as well as the free ligand,
   were evaluated in vitro against epimastigotes and intracellular
   amastigotes of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas
   disease. Results demonstrated that the coordination of risedronate to
   different metal ions improved the antiproliferative effect against T.
   cruzi, exhibiting growth inhibition values against the intracellular
   amastigotes ranging the low micromolar levels. In addition, this strong
   activity could be related to high inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate
   synthase enzyme. On the other hand, protein interaction studies showed
   that all the complexes strongly interact with albumin thus providing a
   suitable means of transporting them to tissues in vivo. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{An important issue in consumer behavior is whether affect created by
   low-level processes, such as evaluative conditioning, will influence
   brand choice when consumers have also been exposed to relevant product
   information. To examine this issue, in two experiments implicit
   attitudes were created by evaluative conditioning where the participants
   were unaware of the contingencies. This creates an ``I like it, but I
   don't know why{''} effect. The participants also had conflicting product
   information available in memory. We find that the participants rely on
   their implicit attributes when making a brand choice if they have not
   formed an explicit evaluation based on the product attribute
   information. This occurs even when the attribute information is
   available in memory and the participants are highly motivated to
   retrieve it. These findings provide evidence that implicit attitudes can
   have a significant influence on behavior, despite conflicting product
   information, and increased levels of motivation and opportunity.}},

Abstract = {{Izmir, the third largest city and one of the major economic centers in
   Turkey, has more than three million residents and one-half million
   buildings. The city, located in a seismically active region in western
   Anatolia, was a subject of the 1997 RADIUS (Risk Assessment Tools for
   Diagnosis of Urban Areas against Seismic Disaster) project. In this
   paper, the seismic hazard of Izmir is investigated through probabilistic
   seismic hazard assessment. First, the seismic setting of Izmir is
   presented. Considering the statistics of earthquakes that took place in
   the region during the period 1900-2005, a simple seismic hazard model is
   used to facilitate the assessment. To account for modeling uncertainties
   associated with the values of seismicity parameters, a logic tree
   procedure is employed in carrying out the seismic hazard computations.
   The resulting weighted average seismic hazard, presented in terms of
   peak ground acceleration and associated probability of exceedence, could
   be considered the ``best estimate{''} of seismic hazard for Izmir.
   Accordingly, for a return period of 475 years, for rock sites, a PGA
   value of 0.34 g is calculated. This PGA hazard estimate is close to the
   current code-recommended design acceleration level for Izmir.}},

Abstract = {{Porcini (Boletus section Boletus: Boletaceae: Boletineae: Boletales) are
   a conspicuous group of wild, edible mushrooms characterized by fleshy
   fruiting bodies with a poroid hymenophore that is ``stuffed{''} with
   white hyphae when young. Their reported distribution is with
   ectomycorrhizal plants throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Little
   progress has been made on the systematics of this group using modern
   molecular phylogenetic tools because sampling has been limited primarily
   to European species and the genes employed were insufficient to resolve
   the phylogeny. We examined the evolutionary history of porcini by using
   a global geographic sampling of most known species, new discoveries from
   little explored areas, and multiple genes. We used 78 sequences from the
   fast-evolving nuclear internal transcribed spacers and are able to
   recognize 18 reciprocally monophyletic species. To address whether or
   not porcini form a monophyletic group, we compiled a broadly sampled
   dataset of 41 taxa, including other members of the Boletineae, and used
   separate and combined phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the
   nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA, the largest subunit of RNA
   polymerase II, and the mitochondrial ATPase subunit six gene. Contrary
   to previous studies, our separate and combined phylogenetic analyses
   support the monophyly of porcini. We also report the discovery of two
   taxa that expand the known distribution of porcini to Australia and
   Thailand and have ancient phylogenetic connections to the rest of the
   group. A relaxed molecular clock analysis with these new taxa dates the
   origin of porcini to between 42 and 54 million years ago, coinciding
   with the initial diversification of angiosperms, during the Eocene epoch
   when the climate was warm and humid. These results reveal an unexpected
   diversity, distribution, and ancient origin of a group of commercially
   valuable mushrooms that may provide an economic incentive for
   conservation and support the hypothesis of a tropical origin of the
   ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{River bed sediments are often colonized by microorganisms which can
   produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   forming biofilms that may increase the resistance of the bed sediment
   towards erosion and affect the nutrient and pollutant exchange between
   water and sediments. The objective of this work was to study the
   influence of organic carbon, ionic concentration (NaCl) and N/P ratio on
   the growth of autochthonous biomass and the production of EPS in
   autotrophic biofilms by measuring the extracellular carbohydrates
   produced, a specific component of the EPS.
   For this purpose, an incomplete 3(3) factorial design was carried out to
   study the influence of the ionic concentration, ranging between 0 and 25
   mg/l NaCl; organic carbon concentration, ranging between 0 and 10 mg/l
   glucose and N/P ratio, ranging between 5 and 20, on the following
   dependent variables: chlorophyll a and carbohydrate concentration at a
   microcosms laboratory scale. Heterotrophic density was also included as
   a third dependent variable.
   The ionic and carbon concentrations in the ranged tested were the most
   influential variables in the production of carbohydrates and chlorophyll
   a. The biofilm formation was stimulated in a medium with a 1:5 ratio for
   N/P and 10 mg/l of glucose and 25 mg/l of ionic concentration. The
   extracellular concentration of carbohydrates increased in parallel with
   the accumulation of chlorophyll a, which suggests that the autotrophic
   biomass may be an important component for the biofilm formation.
   This work demonstrates that it is possible to develop empirical models
   that describe the interrelationship between organic carbon, ionic
   concentration (NaCl) and N/P ratio and the extracellular carbohydrates
   as well as chlorophyll a, contained in the biofilm developed over river
   bed sediments. It can be concluded that concentrations of 25 mg/l of
   NaCl and 10 mg/l of carbon improve the biofilm formation from river bed
   sediments, whereas N/P ratio higher than 5 produced a negative effect in
   the production of carbohydrates and chlorophyll a and consequently in
   the production of biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{Five experiments investigated the encoding retrieval match in
   recognition memory by manipulating read and generate conditions at study
   and at test. Experiments 1A and 1B confirmed previous findings that
   reinstating encoding operations at test enhances recognition accuracy in
   a within-groups design but reduces recognition accuracy in a
   between-groups design. Experiment 2A showed that generating from
   anagrams at study and at test enhanced recognition accuracy even when
   study and test items were generated from different anagrams. Experiment
   2B showed that switching from one generation task at study (e.g.,
   anagram solution) to a different generation task at test (e.g., fragment
   completion) eliminated this recognition advantage. Experiment 3 showed
   that the recognition advantage found in Experiment 1A is reliably
   present up to 1 week after study. The findings are consistent with
   theories of memory that emphasize the importance of the match between
   encoding and retrieval operations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effect on pain, function, and
   ultrasonographic findings of ultrasonography-guided Baker's cyst
   aspiration followed by corticosteroid injection in a group of patients
   with Baker's cyst secondary to knee osteoarthritis.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Results: Twenty-six subjects participated in this study. Clinical and
   instrumental evaluations were performed at baseline (T0), 1 wk (T1), and
   4 wks (T2) after procedure. Mean Visual Analog Scale scores
   significantly dropped after the procedure (T0 = 6.2 {[}1.2]; T1 = 4.48
   {[}1.5]; T2 = 4.32 {[}1.3]; T0 vs. T1 and P < 0.0001). A significant
   difference between preprocedure and postprocedure Western Ontario and
   McMaster Universities scores was found for pain (P < 0.0001) but not for
   joint stiffness (P = 0.7239) and disability (P = 0.6318).
   Ultrasonographic evaluation showed a significant reduction for both
   axial (P = 0.006) and sagittal (P = 0.01) areas of Baker's cyst, but no
   correlation was found between pain relief and Baker's cyst volume
   reduction.
   Conclusions: Cyst aspiration with corticosteroid injection give pain
   relief and cyst volume reduction in patients with Baker's cyst and
   concomitant knee osteoarthritis. However, when compared with current
   literature, our results are similar to those obtained with
   intra-articular knee corticosteroid injection.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was carried out in order to study the occurrence of plant
   parasitic nematodes in fruit crops in the Northwest of Parana, from
   December 2007 to February 2009. A hundred and twenty four soil and roots
   samples were collected from 19 species of fruit crops in 15 different
   municipalities. Nematodes were extracted from the samples and identified
   under an optical microscope. Nine genera of plant parasitic nematodes
   were found. In citrus, the most abundant species was Tylenchulus
   semipenetrans, but it was also recovered Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus,
   Helicotylenchus, Xiphinema, Trichodorus, Mesocriconema and Dolichodorus.
   In the other fruit crops, Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, Helicotylenchus and
   Hemicycliophora were recovered. Pratylenchus brachyurus was the most
   abundant in pineapple crops, Meloidogyne incognita in fig and persimmon,
   and Helicotylenchus dihystera and H. multicinctus in banana. The main
   plant parasitic nematode genera were found in approximately 50\% of the
   samples collected, which may represent a possible threat to regional
   fruit production if not managed adequately.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid desiccant systems have received significant attention as a way to
   reduce latent loads. Tests of liquid desiccant systems in humid climates
   have shown significant reductions in energy consumption. As moisture in
   the air is absorbed at the dehumidifier, the temperature of the liquid
   desiccant increases due to the addition of heat from the enthalpy of
   condensation of the water vapor. Thus, the coupled effects of heat and
   mass transfer are relevant for these applications. A two-dimensional
   mathematical model of the transient heat and mass transfer for an
   absorber where a thin film of liquid desiccant flows down its walls and
   dehumidifies the air in parallel-flow configuration is developed and the
   dynamics of the modeled system are analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{It is often the case that the value of a number of somewhat similar

   number of units in order to form a unit value price and these unit value
   prices are compared over two periods in order to form a unit value price
   index This unit value price index or Drobisch price index can then be
   compared with other standard index number formulae and the bias in the
   index can be determined The present paper presents most of the known
   results on this bias (and derives some new ones) in a coherent framework
   using a simple identity from the statistics literature A related
   question first considered by Parniczky (1974) is also considered does
   disaggregation of a unit value into more homogeneous subgroups reduce
   the unit value bias? The answer seems to be probably yes}},

Abstract = {{This study provides quantitative ecological targets for restoring
   degraded peat-based Carolina Bays in the Carolina Flatwoods Ecoregion.
   Cluster analysis of vegetation data from three Carolina Bay reference
   sites in Bladen County, North Carolina, indicated four plant communities
   present: pond pine (Pin us serotina) woodland, non-riverine swamp forest
   dominated by swamp gum (Nyssa biflora), high pocosin dominated by
   evergreen shrubs with scattered pond pine, and bay forest dominated by
   loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus). We classified bay soils according to
   surface organic layer thickness (OLT) into mineral, histic, shallow
   organic, and deep organic types. We monitored the water table of each
   soil type in one bay throughout one growing season. The soil types with
   corresponding water table regimes were: mineral (9.4 cm mean OLT with a
   rooting zone water table {[}RZWT] 39\% of the monitoring period), histic
   (27.5 cm OLT and 76\% RZWT), shallow organic (63.9 cm OLT and 84\%
   RZWT), and deep organic (102.5 cm OLT and 57\% RZWT). Pearson residual
   analysis and correspondence analysis revealed that pond pine woodland
   was positively associated with mineral and histic soils, non-riverine
   swamp forest with shallow organic soil, bay forest with deep organic
   soil, and high pocosin with deep organic soil. We concluded that
   peat-based Carolina Bay restoration in the Carolina Flatwoods Ecoregion
   should be gauged against reference data which suggests: 1) pond pine
   woodland be established on mineral and histic soils; 2) non-riverine
   swamp forest be established on shallow organic soils; and 3) high
   pocosin and bay forest be established on deep organic soils.}},

Title = {{Effect of aspirin and NSAIDs on risk and survival from colorectal cancer}},
Journal = {{GUT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1670-U114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Previous studies have shown that aspirin and other
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lower colorectal cancer
   (CRC) risk. However, the lowest effective NSAID dose, treatment
   duration, and effects on survival are not defined. In a large
   population-based case-control study, we have explored the relationship
   between NSAID dose and duration, CRC risk and overall CRC-specific
   survival.
   Methods The relationship between NSAID use and CRC risk was examined in
   2279 cases and 2907 controls. Subjects completed food-frequency and
   lifestyle questionnaires. NSAID categories were low-dose aspirin (75
   mg), non-aspirin NSAIDs (NA-NSAIDs) and any NSAID. Users were defined as
   taking >4 tablets/week for >1 month. ORs were calculated by logistic
   regression models and adjusted for potential confounding factors. Effect
   of NSAID use on all-cause and CRC-specific mortality was estimated using
   Logrank tests and Cox's hazard models.
   Results In all, 354 cases (15.5\%) were taking low-dose aspirin compared
   to 526 controls (18.1\%). Low-dose aspirin use was associated with
   decreased CRC risk (OR 0.78 95\% CI 0.65 to 0.92, p=0.004), evident
   after 1 year and increasing with duration of use (p(trend)=0.004).
   NA-NSAID and any NSAID use were also inversely associated with CRC.
   There was no demonstrable effect of NSAIDS on all-cause (HR 1.11,
   p=0.22, 0.94-1.33) or CRC-specific survival (HR 1.01, p=0.93,
   0.83-1.23).
   Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate a protective effect
   against CRC associated with the lowest dose of aspirin (75 mg per day)
   after only 5 years use in the general population. NSAID use prior to CRC
   diagnosis does not influence survival from the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Dune reed (DR) and swamp reed (SR) are two ecotypes of reed (Phragmites
   communis Trin.) that displayed differences in stress tolerance. To
   uncover the molecular basis for such difference, the effects of heat
   stress were studied using the calli derived from the two ecotypes. Heat
   stress caused increased ion leakage, inhibited growth, decreased cell
   viability, and elevated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde
   (MDA) contents in the calli of both ecotypes, but DR callus showed
   better heat tolerance than SR callus. In DR callus, heat stress caused
   significant increase in the endogenous ABA content but not in SR callus.
   Application of fluridone (an ABA synthesis inhibitor) aggravated the
   heat stress damages on the DR callus whereas it had only minimal impact
   on the SR callus. Exogenous application of ABA alleviated the heat
   stress symptoms in the calli of both ecotypes. ABA treatment increased
   the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase
   and peroxidase, and also decreased H2O2 and MDA contents. These results
   indicate that the ability of ABA synthesis under heat stress is a key
   factor attributing to the higher heat tolerance of DR than SR.}},

Abstract = {{For quenched and tempered wrought steels it has been known for a long
   time that the prior austenite grain size plays a major role for the
   mechanical properties. Especially austenitizing for long times at high
   temperatures can cause a dramatic growth of the grains, resulting in
   high retained austenite content and poor mechanical properties.
   The behaviour of PM steels is not as well known, which is in part a
   consequence of the difficulties to clearly reveal the prior austenite
   grain boundaries. Especially for chromium containing low alloyed PM
   steels, it is a difficult task to visualize the austenite grains in a
   martensitic structure.
   In this work a simple method for revealing the grain boundaries by a
   thermal treatment exactly at the desired conditions was tested.
   Especially for sinter hardened samples, i.e. steel specimens that are
   gas quenched directly from the sintering temperature, which thus
   experience the same heat treatment for hardening that is necessary for
   the visualization, it is a very simple and reliable method to avoid any
   artefacts without any possible changes of the structure.
   The factors influencing the austenite grain size in sinter hardened
   steels as e.g. sintering temperature and time and the particle size of
   the starting powders were investigated for a low alloyed martensitic PM
   steel (Fe-3\%Cr-0,5\%Mo-0,5\%C).}},

Abstract = {{Exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease are characterized by
   increased inspissation of abnormally viscid pulmonary secretions with
   resultant plugging of small airways, worsened ventilation/perfusion
   mismatch, and increased physiological deadspace. In this circumstance,
   hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation can be
   life-threatening. We present such a case of CF lung disease poorly
   responsive to conventional mechanical ventilatory strategies, in which
   high-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) using volumetric diffusive
   respiration mobilized copious amounts of inspissated pulmonary
   secretions and improved refractory hypoxia. Subsequent transient
   hypercarbia necessitated titrating ventilator parameters to return the
   PaCO2 to baseline; the voluminous clearance of secretions and
   improvement in oxygenation were sustained. HFPV appears unique in its
   ability to function as a methodological continuum from noninvasive
   percussion to invasive percussive ventilation for airway clearance, a
   fundamental tenet of the CF treatment paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetoresistive response of as-grown and nano-structured thin Nb
   films was studied by transport measurements performed in a
   rotating-current scheme at different temperatures. Epitaxial Nb(110)
   oriented thin films have been prepared by DC magnetron sputtering onto
   a-plane (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire substrates. Periodically arranged
   unidirected Co stripes have been deposited onto the substrates using
   focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) which represents a
   direct nanofabrication tool with a lateral resolution down to several
   tens of nanometres. A pronounced eight-shaped form of polar diagrams of
   the magnetoresistivity rho(T, alpha) and the critical current density
   j(c)(T, alpha) has been observed for the nano-structured films with

   This eight-shaped form of rho(T, alpha) and j(c)(T, alpha) proves that a
   washboard pinning potential is invoked in the films by the unidirected
   Co stripes. The FEBID process is demonstrated to provide a new pathway
   towards mask-less nano-patterning by ferromagnetic decoration of a
   superconducting film, which is promising with regard to controlling its
   resistive response in the mixed-state.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hierarchical classification method based on the use
   of various types of AdaBoost classification algorithms is proposed for
   automatic classification of marble slab images according to their
   quality. At first, features are extracted using the sum and difference
   histograms method and, at the second stage, different versions of the
   AdaBoost algorithms are used as classifiers together with those
   extracted features in a proposed hierarchical fashion. Performance of
   the proposed method is compared against performances of different types
   of neural network classifiers and a support vector machine (SVM)
   classifier. Computational results show that the proposed hierarchical
   structure employing AdaBoost algorithms performs superior to neural
   networks and the SVM classifier for classifying marble slab images in
   our large and diversified data set. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) is a diagnostic challenge because it is
   often indistinguishable from Cushing's disease. We describe our series
   of EAS patients referred to us during 1992-2009. Among 16 cases (9
   females / 7 males), with mean age of 58.4 +/- 19.0yr, the ectopic source
   was identified in ten (proven EAS), whereas unidentified in six
   (occult/unknown EAS). Their salient clinical manifestations included
   Cushingoid feature (88\%), skin pigmentation (88\%), profound
   hypokalemia (88\%), hypertension (75\%), diabetes/impaired glucose
   tolerance (75\%), hyperlipidemia (69\%), and severe infection (44\%).
   Dynamic endocrine tests revealed markedly elevated plasma ACTH levels
   (211 +/- 116pg/mL) and cortisol levels (60.9 +/- 30.1 mu g/dL) which
   showed resistance to overnight high-dose (8mg) dexamethasone suppression
   test in 15 (94\%) and unresponsiveness to CRH stimulation in 12 (75\%).
   No ACTH gradient during inferior petrosal sampling was noted in 13 of 15
   (87\%). Imaging tests by CT/MRI identified the tumors in 8 of 16 (50\%),
   in 4 of 11 (36\%) and 4 of 6 (66.7\%) octreotide-responders by
   somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, but in only one of 9 (11.1\%) by
   FDG-PET scan. Six cases deceased, including small cell carcinoma (2) and
   adenocarcinoma (1) of lung, neuroendocrine carcinoma of pancreas (I) and
   stomach (1), and olfactory neuroblastoma (1), whereas 4 cases survived
   after removal of the tumors, including bronchial carcinoid tumor (3) and
   thymic hyperplasia (1). Six occult/unknown EAS patients survived for
   67.5 months after medical treatment with metyrapone to control
   hypercortisolism. Thus, various endocrine tests combined with imaging
   studies are required to correctly localize the tumors. Control of
   hypercortisolemia by metyrapone, even if tumor is unrecognized, is
   critical for better prognosis, and the long-term follow-up by repeated
   endocrine and imaging tests is mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is still being explored as a therapeutic
   option after traumatic brain injury (TBI) but clinical data has not
   supported its efficacy. Experimental approaches were promising, but
   clinical data did not support its efficacy in the treatment of TBI. A
   novel approach of pharyngeal selective brain cooling (pSBC), recently
   introduced by our group, has been accompanied by superior
   neurofunctional, sensorimotor, and cognitive outcomes. This work is now
   extended by data on histomorphological and physical outcomes after pSBC
   in a model of experimental TBI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected
   to lateral fluid-percussion (LFP) brain injury, and randomized to the
   following experimental groups: (1) TBI with pSBC, (2) TBI without pSBC,
   and (3) sham animals. On day post-injury (DPI) 14, the animals were
   sacrificed and their brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry
   using the following antibodies: (1) glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (GFAP), (2) neurofilament (NF), and (3) synaptophysin (SY). In pSBC
   animals brain temperature was selectively lowered to 33 +/- 0.5 degrees
   C within 15 min post-injury, and maintained for 180 min after induction,
   while keeping rectal temperatures at physiological levels. Animals that
   had undergone pSBC showed a significantly faster recovery of body weight
   starting on DPI 3, and had gained substantially more weight than
   TBI-only animals on DPI 14 (p<0.001), indicating superior physical
   recovery. Areas of cortical damage were significantly smaller in pSBC
   animals compared to TBI-only animals (p<0.01). pSBC was associated with
   preservation of cortical tissue ipsilateral to the lesion, and superior
   physical recovery after experimental TBI. These results complement
   earlier reports in which pSBC was associated with superior
   neurofunctional and cognitive outcomes using the same experimental
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescent Gd2O2S:Tb3+ phosphor thin films were grown on Si ( 100)
   substrates, using the pulsed laser deposition technique. The films were
   grown in 100 to 300 mTorr oxygen gas (O-2) atmospheres when the
   substrate temperature was kept constant at 400 or 600 degrees C. The
   effect of the O-2 ambient on the structure and morphological properties
   of the films were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   respectively. Spherical nanoparticles deposited on the Si (100)
   substrates were shown to crystallize in the hexagonal structure of
   Gd2O2S. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all the films were

Abstract = {{This article follows two papers recently published in the International
   Review of Social Psychology about the internality-norm theory and its
   measurement (Beauvois \& Dubois, 2009a; Delmas, 2009). Firstly, we
   discuss some recurrent amalgams between two theoretical approaches: The
   Locus of control approach and the internality-norm theory Secondly, we
   draw attention to some methodological difficulties that may have
   promoted these amalgams. Finally we propose to take into account these
   methodological difficulties by redefining the status of the measurement
   and by choosing a unit of analysis more adapted to the study of the norm
   of internality: causal explanations rather than individuals. This change
   of units of analysis leads us to propose a new method more adapted to
   the study of the normativity of causal explanations: by randomly
   sampling the items included in these questionnaires.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-on-metal total hip replacement has been targeted at younger
   patients with anticipated long-term survival, but the effect of the
   production of metal ions is a concern because of their possible toxicity
   to cells. We have reviewed the results of the use of the Ultima hybrid
   metal-on-metal total hip replacement, with a cemented polished tapered
   femoral component with a 28 mm diameter and a cobalt-chrome (CoCr)
   modular head, articulating with a 28 mm CoCr acetabular bearing surface
   secured in a titanium alloy uncemented shell.
   Between 1997 and 2004, 545 patients with 652 affected hips underwent
   replacement using this system. Up to 31 January 2008, 90 (13.8\%) hips
   in 82 patients had been revised. Pain was the sole reason for revision
   in 44 hips (48.9\%) of which 35 had normal plain radiographs.
   Peri-prosthetic fractures occurred in 17 hips (18.9\%) with early
   dislocation in three (3.3\%) and late dislocation in 16 (17.8\%).
   Infection was found in nine hips (10.0\%).
   At operation, a range of changes was noted including cavities containing
   cloudy fluid under pressure, necrotic soft tissues with avulsed tendons
   and denuded osteonecrotic upper femora. Corrosion was frequently
   observed on the retrieved cemented part of the femoral component.
   Typically, the peri-operative findings confirmed those found on
   pre-operative metal artefact reduction sequence MRI and histological
   examination showed severe necrosis.
   Metal artefact reduction sequence MRI proved to be useful when
   investigating these patients with pain in the absence of adverse plain
   radiological features.}},

Abstract = {{Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) is one of the main etiologic agents
   responsible for periodic epidemics of hand-foot-andmouth disease (HFMD).
   The prevention and control of EV71 epidemics with effective anti-viral
   agents and vaccines is very important for public health. Because the
   pathogenesis of EV71 in the human body is not completely clear and
   genetic variations in the virus during its replication are difficult to
   control, we have focused on the development of an inactivated
   whole-virus vaccine. In this study, we screened 16 strains isolated from
   different areas of China and selected one strain for the development of
   an inactivated EV71 vaccine. The results of our study suggest that the
   FY-23K-B strain, which is a candidate strain for an EV71 inactivated
   vaccine, satisfied the requirements of vaccine production in terms of
   genetic stability, biological activity and good immunogenicity. The
   experimentally inactivated vaccine produced using this strain was
   capable of inducing an immune response and offered protection to rhesus
   monkeys against future virus attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Neurons in the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the
   amygdala (CeC), which is known as the nociceptive amygdala,' receive
   glutamatergic inputs from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) and the
   basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA), which convey nociceptive
   information from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and polymodal
   information from the thalamus and cortex, respectively Here, we examined
   the ultrastructural properties of PB- and BLA-CeC synapses identified
   with EGFP-expressing lentivirus in rats In addition, the density of
   synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) on CeC neurons was studied by using
   highly sensitive SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling (SDS-FRL)
   Afferents from the PB made asymmetrical synapses mainly on dendritic
   shafts (88\%), whereas those from the BLA were on dendritic spines
   (81\%) PB-CeC synapses in dendritic shafts were significantly larger
   (median 0 072 mu m(2)) than BLA-CeC synapses in spines (median 0 058 mu
   m(2), P = 0 02) The dendritic shafts that made synapses with PB fibers
   were also significantly larger than those that made synapses with BLA
   fibers, indicating that the PB fibers make synapses on more proximal
   parts of dendrites than the BLA fibers SDS-FRL revealed that almost all
   excitatory postsynaptic sites have AMPARs in the CeC The density of
   AMPAR-specific gold particles in individual synapses was significantly
   higher in spine synapses (median 510 particles/mu m(2)) than in shaft
   synapses (median 427 particles/mu m(2), P = 0 01) These results suggest
   that distinct synaptic impacts from PB- and BLA-CeC pathways contribute
   to the integration of nociceptive and polymodal information in the CeC J

Abstract = {{This study explores the impact on government taxation revenue from
   increasing excise on cigarettes in Vietnam. A dynamic population model
   is used to estimate future patterns (both prevalence and consumption) of
   tobacco use in Vietnam, with and without changes to tobacco excise for
   the period 2006-2016. Three increases in the base case excise tax rate
   of 55\% are modelled: 65\%, 75\% and 90\%. Various price elasticities
   are used to examine variations in cigarette consumption while cross
   price elasticities are used to explore shifts from cigarette to other
   forms of tobacco. Revenue implications for the period 20062016 are
   reported as discounted net present values (NPV) in 2006 values. The
   model predicts that smoking rates in 2016, for both males and females,
   are marginally lower than base case estimates for all taxation excise
   options with higher price elasticities generating greater reductions in
   prevalence. In all cases, compared to base case estimates, the results
   indicate a fall in number of smokers, a reduction in amount of tobacco
   consumed and an increase in overall taxation revenue. The additional
   gain in government revenue, expressed in NPV terms, ranges from a low of
   VND 69,579 billion (or USD \$4.35 billion) to a high of VND 108,492
   billion (or USD \$6.79 billion). Increases in tobacco excise provide an
   opportunity for the Vietnamese government to increase revenue at the
   same time as reducing tobacco consumption. Further research into the
   wider social and economic consequences of increasing tobacco excise in
   Vietnam is warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:
   This study aimed to assess the association between the quality and
   quantity of peer social networks and toothbrushing behaviours of Iranian
   adolescents in Mashhad. The second objective was to examine whether peer
   social networks go some way to explain the sex difference in
   toothbrushing behaviours in Iranian adolescents in Mashhad.
   Methods:
   A representative stratified random sample of 1132 sixth grade Iranian
   students in Mashhad, with an average age of 12.4 (SD = 0.8) years,
   answered a 37-item questionnaire. The questionnaire had items on
   sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex and parents' education
   level), education achievement (last year's final average mark),
   frequency of toothbrushing behaviours and peer social networks (number
   of close friends, frequency of meeting friends, club membership and
   quality of peer groups). Binary logistic regression analysis was
   employed to test the association between toothbrushing frequency and
   peer social networks.
   Results:
   Adolescents who met their friends moderately often and had stronger ties
   with their friends were more likely to brush their teeth twice or more a
   day; P = 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively. Club membership and number of
   close friends were not associated with toothbrushing frequency. Girls
   were significantly more likely to brush their teeth twice or more a day.
   They had weaker peer social networks than boys (P < 0.001). When
   adjusted for sex and father's education level, all peer social networks
   variables were significantly associated with toothbrushing frequency.
   However, the interaction between sex and peer social networks variables
   was not significant.
   Conclusions:
   Peer social networks are related to toothbrushing frequency among
   Iranian adolescents in Mashhad but do not explain the differences in
   toothbrushing frequency between sixth grade Iranian boys and girls.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles
   in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Aberrant expression and
   structural alternation of miRNAs are considered to participate in
   tumorigenesis and cancer development. Recently, different genotypes of
   miR-196a polymorphisms (SNP, rs11614913) were found to be associated
   with the survival of patients with lung cancer and increased risk of
   breast cancer. To further investigate whether this polymorphism may
   influence glioma risk or not, we examined the SNP allele frequency in
   Chinese population. Our data shows the genotype CC of miR-196a
   (rs11614913) polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of glioma in
   the Chinese population (OR = 0.74, 95\% CI:0.56-0.98). Furthermore, a
   significant association was observed between this genotype and glioma
   risk in the subgroups of adult glioma (OR = 0.73, 95\% CI:0.55-0.98),
   male glioma (OR = 0.69, 95\% CI:0.48-0.99) and patients with
   glioblastoma (OR = 0.58, 95\% CI:0.37-0.91). This was the first study
   investigating the association between the miR-196a rs11614913 and glioma
   risk. Compared with the results from previous studies in lung cancer and
   breast cancer, our data suggest a different genotype association in
   glioma. This may be related to the diversity on the tissue origin, tumor
   type, tumorigenesis, and developing process.}},

Title = {{Retinal arteriolar geometry is associated with cerebral white matter

Abstract = {{Background Cerebral small vessel disease (lacunar stroke and cerebral
   white matter hyperintensities) is caused by vessel abnormalities of
   unknown aetiology. Retinal vessels show developmental and
   pathophysiological similarities to cerebral small vessels and
   microvessel geometry may influence vascular efficiency.
   Hypothesis Retinal arteriolar branching angles or coefficients (the
   ratio of the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the two daughter
   vessels to the cross-sectional area of the parent vessel at an
   arteriolar bifurcation) may be associated with cerebral small vessel
   disease.
   Methods We performed a cross-sectional observational study in a UK
   tertiary referral hospital. An experienced stroke physician recruited
   consecutive patients presenting with lacunar ischaemic stroke with a
   control group consisting of patients with minor cortical ischaemic
   stroke. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess the
   recent infarct and periventricular and deep white matter
   hyperintensities. We subtyped stroke with clinical and radiological
   findings. We took digital retinal photographs to assess retinal
   arteriolar branching coefficients and branching angles using a
   semi-automated technique.
   Results Two hundred and five patients were recruited (104 lacunar
   stroke, 101 cortical stroke), mean age 68-years (standard deviation 12).
   With multivariate analysis, increased branching coefficient was
   associated with periventricular white matter hyperintensities (P=0.006)
   and ischaemic heart disease (P<0.001), and decreased branching
   coefficient with deep white matter hyperintensities (P=0.003), but not
   with lacunar stroke subtype (P=0.96). We found no associations with
   retinal branching angles.
   Conclusions Retinal arteriolar geometry differs between cerebral small
   vessel phenotypes. Further research is needed to ascertain the clinical
   significance of these findings.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 266 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been isolated from minced

   Sequencing of their 16S rRNA gene along with presence of the katA gene
   demonstrated dominance of the LAB microbiota by Leuconostoc spp. during
   aerobic storage at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C, as well as during MAP (-) and
   MAP (+) storage at 10 and 15 degrees C; Lactobacillus sakei prevailed
   during aerobic storage at 0 degrees C, as well as at MAP (-) and MAP (+)
   storage at 0 and 5 degrees C. The sporadic presence of other species
   such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Weisella viridescens, Lactobacillus
   casei and Lactobacillus curvatus has also been determined. Pulsed-Field
   Gel Electrophoresis of high molecular weight genomic DNA revealed the
   dynamics of the isolated LAB strains. Prevalence of Leuconostoc spp. was
   attributed to one strain only. On the other hand, packaging conditions

Abstract = {{Although advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have suggested
   attractive treatment strategies, delivery of agents to motor neurons
   embedded within the spinal cord is problematic. We have designed a
   strategy based on the specificity of botulinum toxin, to direct entry of
   viral vectors carrying candidate therapeutic genes into motor neurons.
   We have engineered and expressed fusion proteins consisting of the
   binding domain of botulinum toxin type A fused to streptavidin (SAv).
   This fusion protein will direct biotinylated viral vectors carrying
   therapeutic genes into motor nerve terminals where they can enter the
   acidified endosomal compartments, be released and undergo retrograde
   transport, to deliver the genes to motor neurons. Both ends of the
   fusion proteins are shown to be functionally intact. The binding domain
   end binds to mammalian nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions,
   ganglioside GT1b (a target of botulinum toxin), and a variety of
   neuronal cells including primary chick embryo motor neurons, N2A
   neuroblastoma cells, NG108-15 cells, but not to NG CR72 cells, which
   lack complex gangliosides. The streptavidin end binds to biotin, and to
   a biotinylated Alexa 488 fluorescent tag. Further studies are in
   progress to evaluate the delivery of genes to motor neurons in vivo, by
   the use of biotinylated viral vectors.}},

Title = {{Local factors control the community composition of cyanobacteria in
   lakes while heterotrophic bacteria follow a neutral model}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Neutral community models are derived from the proposition that basic
   probabilities of species loss (extinction, emigration) and gain
   (immigration, speciation) explain biological community structure, such
   that species with many individuals are very likely to be widespread.
   Niche models on the other hand assume that interactions between species
   and differential resource use mediate species coexistence, thus invoking
   environmental factors to explain community patterns.
   2. In this study, we compared neutral and niche models to test how much
   of the spatial variability of assemblages of heterotrophic bacteria and
   phytoplankton in 13 lakes they could explain. Analysis of phytoplankton
   was restricted to cyanobacteria, so that they could be studied with the
   same molecular fingerprinting method, automated ribosomal intergenic
   spaces analysis (ARISA), as heterotrophic bacteria. We determined local
   biotic and abiotic lake variables as well as lake age, glacial history
   and distance between sites.
   3. The neutral community model had a good fit to the community
   composition of heterotrophic bacteria (R-2 = 0.69), whereas it could not
   produce a significant model for the community composition of
   cyanobacteria.
   4. The community composition of cyanobacteria was instead correlated to
   environmental variables. The best model, a combination of total organic
   carbon, biomass of eukaryotic phytoplankton, pH and conductivity, could
   explain 8\% of the variation. In contrast, variation in the community
   composition of heterotrophic bacteria was not predicted by any of the
   environmental variables. Historical and spatial variables were not
   correlated to the community composition of either group.
   5. The pattern found for heterotrophic bacteria suggests that stochastic
   processes are important. The correlation of cyanobacteria with local
   environmental variables alone is consistent with the niche model. We
   suggest that cyanobacteria, a group of organisms containing
   bloom-forming species, may be less likely to fit a neutral community
   model, since these blooms are usually triggered by a particular
   combination of environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We present a prospective, non-comparative, non-randomized
   case series study of 179 consecutive transcanalicular laser
   dacryocystorhinostomy (TCL-DCR) procedures in 176 patients. We analyzed
   the success rate, complications and causes of failure of this procedure.
   Patients and methods: 176 patients with functional nasolacrimal duct
   stenosis or complete obstruction were included in the study. The
   procedure was performed under general anaesthesia, and the nasal mucosa
   was anaemised. The site of osteotomy was determined by transillumination
   of the lateral nasal wall from the lacrimal sac. We achieved osteotomy
   by applying laser light via an optic fibre. We used a 980 nm diode laser
   with power of 20 W. We inserted a silicone stent as the last step.
   Procedure success was determined by the absence of epiphora
   (subjective), or by patency of the lacrimal drainage system on
   irrigation (objective).
   Results: Since December 2005, we performed 179 successive EL-DCR with
   silicone stent intubation in 176 patients. The average procedure time
   was 12 minutes, and 245 J of laser energy on average was needed. The
   silicone stents were removed 3-6 months after surgery. We observed
   absence of epiphora and a patent nasolacrimal duct on irrigation in 146
   out of 179 treated eyes. This yields a success rate of 82 \% at an
   average follow-up time of 16 months.
   Conclusions: The 980 nm EL-DCR with silicone stent intubation is a new
   contribution to the developments in the field of lacrimal surgery. It is
   a minimally invasive, and quick procedure, yielding results comparable
   to classic DCR, and is better than other endoscopic DCR procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Single specimens of the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis H. Milne
   Edwards, 1853, have been regularly reported along the western and
   eastern coasts of Sweden since the 1930's. The crab has most likely been
   brought from overseas via the transfer of ship's ballast water or
   secondarily introduced from its key European distribution areas. Since
   2001 a sharp increase in the occurrence of the mitten crab has been
   noticed in Swedish inland waters, but the dispersal routes and
   distribution of the species into Sweden remain poorly known. Here we
   document the current and historical distribution of the Chinese mitten
   crab in Sweden and assess possible invasion routes. A special focus is
   put on the historical occurrence of crabs in Lake Vanern, which empties
   into the Skagerrak/North Sea and Lake Malaren, which connects to the
   Baltic Sea. The existing time series available for the mitten crab from
   the two lakes shows a large variation in dispersal pattern between
   different areas within each lake. In order to detect and monitor
   outbreaks of the mitten crab in Sweden, an internet based reporting
   system was created in 2007. Museum collections and reports from the
   general public throughout Sweden were compared with the known occurrence
   of mitten crabs in Lake Vanern and Lake Malaren. During the study, the
   web-based reporting system was not advertised and the general public did
   not get paid for reporting the information. Population densities of the
   crab occurred ``in peaks{''} and unevenly over the last decade In both
   lakes, suggesting a pulse invasion instead of a constant supply by
   migration. Significant difference in male and female occurrence together
   with few transport possibilities between lakes suggests different
   invasion routes for the crabs. Reports from the general public
   throughout Sweden coincide with the observations from local fishermen in
   Lake Malaren and Lake Vanern. Data on occurrence and abundance arc
   discussed in relation to a potential reproduction area on the western
   coast of Sweden.}},

Abstract = {{P>Escherichia coli FtsK is a large 1329 aa integral membrane protein,
   which links cell division and chromosome segregation through the
   respective activities of its 200 aa amino-terminal domain, FtsK(N), and
   its 500 aa carboxy-terminal domain, FtsK(C). A long 600 aa linker,
   FtsK(L), connects these two domains. Only FtsK(N) is essential for cell
   division. However, previous observations suggested that the cytoplasmic
   part of FtsK also participates in the process of septation. Here, we
   identify two distinct regions within FtsK(L), FtsK(179-331) and
   FtsK(332-641), which together with FtsK(N), are required for normal
   septation. We discuss how the implication of multiple regions along the
   FtsK protein in cell division could participate in the co-ordination of
   this process with the last stages of chromosome segregation.}},

Title = {{The corticoperiosteal medial femoral supracondylar flap: anatomical
   study for clinical evaluation in mandibular osteoradionecrosis}},

Abstract = {{Purpose An ideal way to treat osteoradionecrosis of the jaws is to
   transfer an osteogenic, appropriately vascularized flap to the affected
   site. The corticoperiosteal femoral medial supracondylar flap is being
   used increasingly in the treatment of complex pseudarthrosis of long
   bones, but is yet to find robust indications for use in the treatment of
   osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, the reasons being a lack of anatomical
   data concerning its vascular supply and the local constraints of its
   routine harvest. This study presents an anatomical study and literature
   review to explore its potentials in clinical practice.
   Materials and methods A total of 25 legs were dissected following
   vascular injection of colored neopren. The descending genicular artery
   (DGA) and veins were studied with particular attention paid to
   anatomical variations found in their branches. Calibers and length of
   the vessels were recorded.
   Results Many anatomical variations of the DGA were found and a
   classification proposed. The mean caliber of the DGA at the origin was
   1.9 mm, and for the vein, 1.8 mm. The mean useful length of the pedicle
   was 7.9 cm. A case is reported.
   Conclusion A clear anatomical knowledge (and, therefore, a sound
   classification system to grade flap harvesting potential) is the key
   first step prior to extensive clinical use of this flap. Various
   anatomical patterns of the pedicle are frequently encountered; branches
   can be elusive when raising the flap. Vascular imaging is therefore a
   critical step in identifying types and subtypes before surgery.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a reading of Vicente Huidobro's early works that
   examines how they anticipate the author's poem, Altazor, published in
   1931. In particular, it analyses how the linguistic, semantic and
   conceptual features of Huidobro's inaugural texts laid the imaginative
   foundations on which both the figure of Altazor and the poem itself was
   to be constructed. This is an archeological reading of Huidobro's work
   that establishes an Altazorian genealogy consisting of earlier
   incarnations of the figure of the poet who anticipate the mythic
   dimensions of Altazor. This genealogical analysis reveals not only a
   pre-history but a history of the text as a work in progress through a
   process of writing and re-writing. It is a process which gives the work
   its unique and original meaning, and which can also be seen as a complex
   projection of the writer in search of an identity.}},

Abstract = {{The warming trend over the last century in the northern hemisphere (NH)
   was interrupted by cooling from ad 1940 to 1975, a period during which
   the southern hemisphere experienced pronounced warming. The cause of
   these departures from steady warming at multidecadal timescales are
   unclear; the prevailing explanation is that they are driven by
   non-uniformity in external forcings but recent models suggest internal
   climate drivers may play a key role. Paleoclimate datasets can help
   provide a long-term perspective. Here we use tree-rings to reconstruct
   New Zealand mean annual temperature over the last 550 years and
   demonstrate that this has frequently cycled out-of-phase with NH mean
   annual temperature at a periodicity of around 30-60 years. Hence,
   observed multidecadal fluctuations around the recent warming trend have
   precedents in the past, strongly implicating natural climate variation
   as their cause. We consider the implications of these changes in
   understanding and modelling future climate change.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an inhibitor of multiple-receptor
   tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis, which can be
   advantageously administered orally. Initially used as monotherapy in
   advanced renal cell carcinoma, sorafenib was proven to increase
   progression-free survival while enhancing disease control. Clinical
   trials on sorafenib are at present ongoing for the treatment of various
   malignancies, including thyroid cancer (TC).
   Summary: Specifically, in two phase II studies recently conducted on
   papillary TC, although the respective results were not entirely
   compatible as regard partial response rate and progression-free
   survival, sorafenib demonstrated a relatively favorable benefit/risk
   profile. In another more recent phase II study, whose primary endpoint
   was the reinduction of radioactive iodine uptake at 26 weeks, although
   no reinduction of radioactive iodine uptake was observed, 59\% had a
   beneficial response and 34\% had stable disease. Sorafenib hence appears
   to be a valid alternative to conventional treatment of metastatic
   papillary TC refractory to radioiodine therapy.
   Conclusions: Further prospective investigations are required to define
   the characteristics of tumor response to the drug and the factors
   inducing resistance to treatment. A major issue demanding immediate
   attention involves optimization of sorafenib treatment: this concerns
   multidrug combination with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors or
   immunomodulating agents with the aim of reducing doses and thereby
   improving drug tolerability and antineoplastic capability.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive metabolome analysis using mass spectrometry (MS) often
   results in a complex mass spectrum and difficult data analysis resulting
   from the signals of numerous small molecules in the metabolome. In
   addition, MS alone has difficulty measuring isobars and chiral,
   conformational and structural isomers. When a matrix-assisted laser
   desorption ionization (MALDI) source is added, the difficulty and
   complexity are further increased. Signal interference between analyte
   signals and matrix ion signals produced by MALDI in the low mass region
   (< 1500 Da) cause detection and/or identification of metabolites
   difficult by MS alone. However, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled
   with MS (IM-MS) provides a rapid analytical tool for measuring subtle
   structural differences in chemicals. IMS separates gas-phase ions based
   on their size-to-charge ratio. This study, for the first time, reports
   the application of MALDI to the measurement of small molecules in a
   biological matrix by ion mobility-time of flight mass spectrometry
   (IM-TOFMS) and demonstrates the advantage of ion-signal dispersion in
   the second dimension. Qualitative comparisons between metabolic
   profiling of the Escherichia coli metabolome by MALDI-TOFMS,
   MALDI-IM-TOFMS and electrospray ionization (ESI)-IM-TOFMS are reported.
   Results demonstrate that mobility separation prior to mass analysis
   increases peak-capacity through added dimensionality in measurement.
   Mobility separation also allows detection of metabolites in the
   matrix-ion dominated low-mass range (m/z < 1500 Da) by separating matrix
   signals from non-matrix signals in mobility space. Copyright (c) 2010

Abstract = {{The influence of cooling rate in the process of thermal treatment on the
   formation of the microstructure of 13KhMF heat-resistant steel is
   investigated. The relationships between the microstructure, strength
   characteristics, crack-resistance characteristics, and creep resistance
   of the material are determined. The transformations of the structure are
   modeled by the changes in the duration of tempering. The
   bainite-martensite structure is characterized by the best combination of
   properties and the largest period of transformation of the structure.
   The comparison of the results of laboratory and long-term in-service
   degradation and their influence on the structure, strength, and
   crack-resistance characteristics shows that they are similar.}},

Abstract = {{Application inconvenience is one popular explanation for why many
   individuals do not receive the social benefits for which they are
   eligible. Applications take time and some individuals may decide that
   the financial benefits do not outweigh these time costs. This paper
   investigates this explanation using cross-state variation in
   administrative changes that made applying for unemployment insurance
   (UI) benefits substantially more convenient over the past decade. We
   find that the introduction of phone- and Internet-based claiming did not
   have an appreciable impact on overall UI take-up, nor did it lead to a
   shift toward recipients that are higher income or likely to be receiving
   the maximum benefit amount. These findings are inconsistent with a time-
   and transaction-cost explanation for low take-up, since remote UI
   claiming is less time intensive. This suggests that reducing application
   barriers alone may not be an effective tool for increasing program
   participation. (C) 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis

Abstract = {{Web systems, Web services, and Web-based publish/subscribe systems
   communicate events as XML messages and in many cases, require composite
   event detection: it is not sufficient to react to single event messages,
   but events have to be considered in relation to other events that are
   received over time. This entails a need for expressive, high-level
   languages for querying composite events. Emphasizing language design and
   formal semantics, we describe the rule-based composite event query
   language XChange(EQ). XChange(EQ) is designed to completely cover and
   integrate the four complementary querying dimensions: event data, event
   composition, temporal relationships, and event accumulation. Semantics
   are provided as a model theory with accompanying fixpoint theory, an
   approach that is established for rule languages but has not been applied
   to event queries so far. Because they are highly declarative, thus easy
   to understand and well suited for query optimization, such semantics are
   desirable for event queries.}},

Abstract = {{We previously showed that plasminogen (Plg) isolated from the plasma of
   normal human subjects contains 1-2 moles of oxidized phosphatidylcholine
   (oxPtdPC) adducts/mole of protein. Moreover, we suggested that these
   species are generated at the hepatic site and speculated that they may
   play a role in the reported cardiovascular pathogenicity of Plg. We
   aimed to determine whether mouse Plg also harbors linked oxPtdPCs and
   whether these molecules are metabolized by lipoprotein-associated
   phospholipase A(2)/PAF acetylhydrolase (Lp-PLA(2)/PAF-AH), an enzyme
   specific for hydrolysis of oxPtdPCs. We determined the total
   concentration of Plg in plasma samples from control (WT) and
   Lp-PLA(2)-deficient (KO) mice, we isolated Plg, and assessed its content
   of oxPtdPCs by immunoblot analyses. We also evaluated whether human
   recombinant Lp-PLA(2) metabolized Plg-linked oxPtdPCs in vivo and in
   vitro. WT and KO mice expressed comparable levels (14.4-15.8 mg/dL) of
   plasma Plg, as determined by ELISA. We observed no differences in the
   content of oxPtdPC in Plg isolated from the two mouse strains and in
   parallel no changes in oxPtdPC content in mouse Plg following incubation
   with pure recombinant Lp-PLA(2). Plg from mouse plasma contains oxPtdPC
   adducts that are not affected by the action of Lp-PLA(2), suggesting
   that linkage to Plg protects oxPtdPCs from metabolism during their
   transport in the plasma. This modification may have important
   physio-pathological implications related to the function of Plg,
   oxPtdPCs, or both.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of static magnetic fields on the budding of single yeast
   cells was investigated using a magnetic circuit that was capable of
   generating a strong magnetic field (2.93 T) and gradient (6100 T(2)
   m(-1)). Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells were grown in an aqueous
   YPD agar in a silica capillary under either a homogeneous or
   inhomogeneous static magnetic field. Although the size of budding yeast
   cells was only slightly affected by the magnetic fields after 4 h, the
   budding angle was clearly affected by the direction of the homogeneous
   and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In the homogeneous magnetic field,
   the budding direction of daughter yeast cells was mainly oriented in the
   direction of magnetic field B. However, when subjected to the
   inhomogeneous magnetic field, the daughter yeast cells tended to bud
   along the axis of capillary flow in regions where the magnetic gradient,
   estimated by B(dB/dx), were high. Based on the present experimental
   results, the possible mechanism for the magnetic effect on the budding
   direction of daughter yeast cells is theoretically discussed.

Abstract = {{Synaptic plasticity, especially structural plasticity, is thought to be
   a basis for long-lasting memory. We previously reported that, in rat
   hippocampus slice cultures, repeated induction of long-term depression
   (LTD) by application of a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)
   agonist led to slowly developing, long-lasting synaptic suppression
   coupled with synapse elimination. We referred to this phenomenon as LOSS
   (LTD-repetition-operated synaptic suppression) to discriminate it from
   conventional single LTD and proposed it as a model for analyzing
   structural plasticity. Recently, proneurotrophin-activated p75(NTR)
   signaling has been gaining attention as a possible pathway for the
   regulation of both neuronal apoptosis and synaptic plasticity. In this
   study, we examined whether this signaling has a role in the
   establishment of LOSS. The application of anisomycin indicated that, for
   LOSS to occur, novel protein synthesis is needed within 6 hr after the
   induction of mGluR-dependent LTD, which demonstrates that LOSS is an
   active process and therefore is not due to withering in response to a
   shortage of trophic factors. Furthermore, we found that pro-BDNF (a
   species of proneurotrophins) is newly synthesized within 6 hr after the
   induction of LTD. We therefore exogenously applied a cleavage-resistant
   form of pro-BDNF, finding synaptic suppression similar to LOSS. LOSS
   could be abolished by the application of an antibody that binds to and
   neutralizes p75(NTR) following repeated LTD induction. These results
   suggest involvement of the p75(NTR) signaling pathway in the for
   g-lasting decremental form of synaptic plasticity. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{We characterize sputter-deposited aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al)
   thin films on glass and silicon substrates by variable-angle
   spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range of 240 nm to 1700 nm.
   The model dielectric function includes the excitonic effects of direct
   band-gap semiconductors in the presence of high carrier densities as
   well as the scattering of free carriers by ionized donors. We show that
   an energy-dependent broadening term of the band-gap model avoids an
   extended absorption tail below the absorption threshold as it usually
   results from Lorentzian broadening. Uniaxial anisotropy takes account of
   the oriented growth of hexagonal crystalline ZnO:Al thin films. All the
   parameters derived from the optical measurements such as surface
   roughness, free-carrier concentration and mobility agree with the
   results of independent thin-film characterization methods such as
   atomic-force microscopy. Hall and four-point probe measurements. In the
   case of the glass samples, we need an additional interface layer which
   is confirmed by transmission-electron microscopy as an intermix layer of
   ZnO and glass. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of
   endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) performed in children with
   posterior fossa tumors and hydrocephalus in an attempt to classify the
   selected cases who could benefit from ETV as a permanent CSF diversion
   procedure.
   During the period between January 2008 and December 2008, 40 patients
   with posterior fossa tumors and associated hydrocephalus were treated
   inside the Children's Cancer Hospital, Egypt (CCHE)-with ETV in order to
   relieve the increased intracranial pressure while awaiting their
   definite tumor surgery.
   ETV was successful in relieving hydrocephalus clinically and
   radiologically in 26 patients with different posterior fossa
   pathologies, with the highest success rate in glioma (100\%), followed
   by 50\% in ependymoma and 47.6\% in medulloblatoma. In the other 14
   cases, preoperative ETV failed in permanently resolving hydrocephalus
   and patients required the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt
   after their posterior fossa surgery and during their follow-up period.
   ETV should be considered as an alternative procedure to VP shunt in
   controlling severe hydrocephalus related to posterior fossa tumors, to
   relieve symptoms quickly during the preoperative period while patients
   await their definite tumor excision. Patients with ependymomas and
   gliomas, with totally excised tumors, are better candidates for ETV than
   those with medulloblastomas. However, ETV cannot always prevent
   postoperative hydrocephalus in all cases of posterior fossa tumor, the
   thing that makes using postoperative VP shunt an alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Tissue engineering of mandibular articular condyles encounters
   many challenges, especially restoring adequate mechanical strength that
   is correlated to matrix production by the tissue-engineered mandibular
   condyles (TEMCs). Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been shown
   to enhance cell expansion, differentiation, and matrix production by
   different cells.
   Objective: This study evaluated effect of daily LIPUS treatment (in
   vitro and in a pilot in vivo study) for 4 weeks on matrix production and
   functional integration of the TEMCs in rabbits.
   Methods: Bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from the femoral bones
   of skeletally mature New Zealand rabbits, expanded, and differentiated
   into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Animals employed in the in
   vivo study were divided into four groups: (1) TEMCs and LIPUS treatment;
   (2) TEMCs without LIPUS treatment; (3) empty scaffold and LIPUS
   treatment, and (4) empty scaffolds without LIPUS treatment.
   Results: In vitro results showed that LIPUS enhanced chondrogenic and
   osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells. The in vivo
   study showed that LIPUS led to better structural formation (namely, new
   osteogenic and chondrogenic tissue formation) and integration of the
   newly formed tissues and original condylar bone than those without LIPUS
   treatment. LIPUS resulted in a small amount of tissue regeneration in
   the empty scaffolds, whereas empty scaffolds without LIPUS treatment
   showed no signs of repair.
   Conclusions: The preliminary results of this pilot study suggest that
   LIPUS can enhance TEMCs both in vitro and in vivo.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1079-1087}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The potential value of celecoxib was compared to a standard
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac in the
   adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in rats as a model of chronic
   inflammation under the influence of ionising radiation.
   Material and methods: Various inflammatory mediators and biochemical
   parameters were measured in the arthritic rats under the influence of
   ionising radiation.
   Results: Exposure of the animals to a radiation dose of 2 Gy before
   inoculation of the adjuvant led to a marked increase in the paw volume
   reaching ca. 70\% more than that in non-irradiated ones as well as a
   significant increase in the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6),
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumour necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) as an index of cyclooxygenase-2
   (COX-2) activity, thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) as an index of
   cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) activity and plasma level of malondialdehyde
   (MDA). The blood glutathione (GSH) level was not affected by the dose of
   irradiation used while superoxidedismutase (SOD) activity was reduced.
   Treatment with celecoxib in a dose of 5 mg/kg was effective in
   decreasing the elevated levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, PGE(2)
   whereas it lacked any effect on TXB(2) level since it had hardly any
   effect on COX-1 enzyme. Both drugs at the selected dose levels showed no
   effect on level of MDA, GSH and SOD activity.
   Conclusion: Irradiation of animals caused a marked change in the
   inflammatory response in AIA model of inflammation. Both celecoxib and
   diclofenac were nearly equipotent in suppressing the inflammatory
   response in both normal and irradiated rats. Accordingly, since the
   inhibition of COX-1 by traditional NSAID is thought to have undesirable
   side-effects on proliferating tissues, it would seem preferable to use
   selective COX-2 inhibitors to limit such deleterious effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the degree of stability of the viscosity of
   Chitosan/gelatin mixtures having viscosity from 1 mm(2)/s to 161
   mm(2)/s. The kinematic viscosity of the five liquids, was determined at
   20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. To test the stability of the viscosity of
   these oils, we have repeated the measurements of the kinematic and
   dynamic viscosity at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, several times for a
   period of two years. The measurements were carried out using standard
   viscometers and water bath, where temperature stability was about +/-
   0.02 degrees C. The variations of the viscosity for the oils under test
   during two years interval were within the ranges of uncertainty of
   measurements. The results obtained show that these oils can be used for
   a period of two years with stable physical and chemical composition and
   in turn their measured viscosity values. These recommended viscosity
   standards will be of great importance for many applications e. g.,
   thickeners, food, textile, sizings, petrol and medical industries
   because they verify a wide calibration ranges of viscosity values for
   different industries.}},

Abstract = {{It is now common knowledge that the simple quadratic ARCH process has a
   regularly varying tail even when generated by a normally distributed
   noise, and the tail behaviour is well-understood under more general
   conditions as well. Much less studied is the case of beta-ARCH-type
   processes, i.e. when the conditional variance is a 2 beta-power function
   with 0 < beta < 1. Opting for a little more generality and allowing for
   asymmetry, we consider threshold beta-ARCH models, driven by noises with
   Weibull-like tails. (Special cases include the Gaussian and the Laplace
   distributions.) We show that the process generated has an approximately
   Weibull-like tail, too, albeit with a different exponent: 1 - beta times
   that of the noise, in the sense that the tail can be bounded from both
   sides by Weibull distributions of this exponent but slightly different
   constants. The proof is based on taking an appropriate auxiliary
   sequence and then applying the general result of Kluppelberg and Lindner
   (2005) for the tail of infinite MA sequences with light-tailed
   innovations. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Different types of dietary fiber can be distinguished considering their
   rate of fermentability, thus determining the location of the large
   intestine where they exert their beneficial effect. Their combination
   could be interesting to obtain health-promoting effects throughout the
   entire colon. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
   synergistic effect of two dietary fibers with different fermentation
   patterns, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) (Beneo (R)-95) and resistant
   starch (Fibersol (R)-2), after their administration to healthy rats or
   in trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid-(TNBS) colitic rats, with an altered
   colonic immune response. In healthy rats, the administration of the
   combination of FOS and resistant starch induced changes in the
   intestinal microbiota, by increasing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in
   caecum and colonic contents. Furthermore, its administration
   up-regulated the expression of the trefoil factor-3 and MUC-2 in
   comparison with untreated rats, thus improving the intestinal barrier
   function. The beneficial effects observed with this combination were
   confirmed in the TBNS model of rat colitis, since it was able to exert
   intestinal anti-inflammatory effect, associated with an increase of
   protective bacteria and up-regulation of epithelial defense mechanisms.
   In conclusion, the combination of two different dietary fibers may
   result in a synergistic prebiotic effect, and may confer greater health
   benefits to the host. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for

Abstract = {{Objective. To map parent-child associations for eating behaviours
   including both parents and considering body size and sex as moderators.
   Methods. In this study 1258 Swedish families (mother, father and their
   12-year-old child) had eating behaviour measured by the Dutch Eating
   Behaviour Questionnaire covering restrained, emotional and external
   eating. Results. Most parent-child associations for eating behaviours
   were significant in relation to the mother and the father. The strongest
   associations were seen for external eating. Overweight children had a
   stronger parental link for external eating than normal weight children,
   and higher levels of restrained eating. The only moderating effect seen
   for the child's sex was a stronger mother-son link for external eating
   in normal weight boys. Girls had higher levels of restrained eating, and
   boys had higher levels of external eating. Conclusion. Most family links
   for eating behaviour in pre-adolescents are seen in relation to both
   parents and for daughters and sons alike. In particular, eating in
   response to external food cues is most strongly shared by parents and
   children, and overweight children are more likely to adopt their
   parents' external eating.}},

Abstract = {{The steel industry is characterised by large amounts of CO2 emissions,
   but there is no easy means to reduce these emissions. One interesting
   option for the reduction of CO2 emissions could be the utilisation of
   steelmaking slags for carbon dioxide mineralisation. In this option CO2
   is bound with the calcium of the slag material, producing stable
   carbonate as an end product. The utilisation of steelmaking slags as the
   raw material for carbon dioxide mineralisation will change the quality
   of the slags. If, however, this change degrades the slags it could
   prevent the use of slags in carbon dioxide mineralisation or make it
   very expensive.
   The purpose of the research presented here is to evaluate this issue
   with the help of a case study where the quality of the residual slag
   from the recently suggested carbonation method was experimentally
   investigated. The CO2 mineralisation method, based on steelmaking slags
   and ammonium salt solutions, was found to change the quality of the
   slags: the calcium content was reduced, the CaO and Ca(OH)(2) phases
   were completely dissolved, and the solubility of the V and Cr increased
   notably. This residual slag would presumably have to be handled as
   waste. Currently, the steelmaking slag used in the case study is defined
   as a by-product, but if it is used for CO2 mineralisation instead of
   liming its legal status will be re-evaluated. Subsequently, the CO2
   mineralisation process could possibly be defined as an end-of-waste
   procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   we conducted a genome-wide association study of 589 individuals with cHL

Abstract = {{We present spatially resolved integral field spectroscopic K-band data
   at a resolution of 0.13 `' (60 pc) and interferometric CO(2-1) line
   observations of the prototypical merging system NGC6240. Despite the
   clear rotational signature, the stellar kinematics in the two nuclei are
   dominated by dispersion. We use Jeans modelling to derive the masses and
   the mass-to-light ratios of the nuclei. Combining the luminosities with
   the spatially resolved Br gamma equivalent width shows that only 1/3 of
   the K-band continuum from the nuclei is associated with the most recent
   star forming episode; and that less than 30\% of the system's bolometric
   luminosity and only 9\% of its stellar mass is due to this starburst.
   The star formation properties, calculated from typical merger star
   formation histories, demonstrate the impact of different assumptions
   about the star formation history. The properties of the nuclei, and the
   existence of a prominent old stellar population, indicate that the
   nuclei are remnants of the progenitor galaxies' bulges.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of
   infarction (AHTI) is common, but its risk factors and relationship with
   functional outcome are poorly defined.
   Methods-The analyses used data from the Tinzapararin in Acute Ischaemic
   Stroke Trial, a randomized controlled trial assessing tinzaparin (low
   molecular weight heparin) versus aspirin in 1484 patients with acute
   ischemic stroke. CT head scans (baseline, day 10) were adjudicated for
   the presence of hemorrhagic transformation. Stroke subtype was
   classified according to modified Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke
   Treatment (small vessel, large vessel, cardioembolic) and the
   Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (total anterior, partial anterior,
   lacunar, and posterior circulatory syndromes). Modified Rankin scale and
   Barthel Index were measured at 3 and 6 months. Analyses were adjusted
   for age, sex, severity, blood pressure, infarct volume, and treatment.
   Symptomatic hemorrhage was excluded.
   Results-At day 10, AHTI did not differ between aspirin (300 mg; 32.8\%)
   and medium-dose (100 IU/kg; 36.0\%) and high-dose (175 IU/kg; 31.4\%)
   tinzaparin groups (P = 0.44). Relative to lacunar stroke, AHTI on
   follow-up CT was significantly increased in total anterior circulation
   syndrome (odds ratio, 11.5; 95\% CI, 7.1 to 18.7) and partial anterior
   circulation syndrome (odds ratio, 7.2; 95\% CI, 4.5 to 11.4) stroke.
   Similarly, relative to small vessel disease, AHTI was increased in large
   vessel (odds ratio, 15.1; 95\% CI, 9.4 to 24.3) and cardioembolic (odds
   ratio, 14.1; 95\% CI, 8.5 to 23.5) stroke. After adjustment for infarct
   volume, the presence of AHTI was not associated with outcome at 3 or 6
   months as measured by the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index.
   Conclusions-AHTI is increased in ischemic stroke with cortical syndromes
   and of large vessel or cardioembolic etiology. Heparin does not increase
   AHTI. AHTI is not associated with functional outcome. (Stroke.

Abstract = {{Economic theory indicates that firms can match workers to jobs and
   promote productivity-enhancing specialization better than markets, yet
   few data exist. We empirically test whether firms enhance matching and
   specialization in the context of obstetrics. We then examine whether
   consumers benefit from this. We find that high-risk patients in group
   practices match with specialists more than patients of solo physicians,
   and this improves patients' health outcomes. Matching based on a
   patient's clinical need for a cesarean section delivery and a
   physician's cesarean section skill also occurs, but less extensively.
   These results support the hypothesis that firms facilitate matching and
   specialization.}},

Abstract = {{Are the standards of reasoning and rationality in divination, religious
   practice, and textual exegesis different from those in the sciences? Can
   there be different standards of reasoning and rationality at all? The
   intense ``rationality debate{''} of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s focused
   on these questions and the related problems of relativism across
   cultures and systems of practice. Although philosophers were at the
   center of these debates at the time, they may appear to have abandoned
   the question in recent years. On the contrary, I discuss recent
   developments in philosophy that approach the issue from a number of new
   directions, changing our understanding of reasoning and rationality. I
   argue that, in comparing the diviner with the scientist, focusing on
   reasoning is likely to be a red herring. Instead, I argue that a careful
   treatment of rationality, paying particular attention to its context
   dependence, untangles longstanding confusions. Moreover, it points the
   way forward to investigating modest but interesting ways for there to be
   alternative standards of rationality.}},

Abstract = {{The vitamin D hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) {[}1,25(OH)(2)D(3)],
   the biologically active form of vitamin D, is not only essential for
   mineral metabolism but may have important functions beyond calcium
   homoeostasis. By gene targeting, we have recently generated mice
   expressing a functionally inactive mutant vitamin D receptor (VDR).
   After a change in environmental conditions from specific pathogen free
   (SPF) conditions to a modified barrier system, a high percentage of aged
   mutant, but not wild-type, mice developed a haematological disorder
   characterized by splenomegaly, granulocytosis, thrombocytosis and
   dysplastic changes with displacement of erythropoiesis in bone marrow
   during the following months. All cases were associated with very high
   serum levels of the acute phase reaction protein serum amyloid A (SAA).
   Serological testing of affected mice revealed antibodies against murine
   hepatitis virus (MHV). However, electron microscopy of spleen and bone
   marrow cells did not reveal virus particles, and clinical signs of
   infectious diseases were absent. We hypothesize that a non-functioning
   VDR is associated with a latent defect in the regulation of myeloid cell
   differentiation and proliferation. Under the conditions of environmental
   stress, this latent defect may predispose to a deregulation of
   myelopoiesis in the form of a leukaemoid reaction accompanied by
   dysplastic changes. Thus, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may be an important inhibitory
   factor in the onset and progression of myeloproliferative and
   myelodysplastic diseases. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers can rely either on retrospectively reported or on
   prospectively measured health changes to identify and quantify recent
   changes in respondents' health status. The two methods typically do not
   provide the same answers. We compare the validity of prospective versus
   retrospective measures of health changes by investigating their
   predictive power for subsequent mortality. Data from a cohort study
   conducted in the Netherlands are used to compare the ability of changes
   in self-assessed health (SAH) - either reported retrospectively or
   measured prospectively in three waves (1991, 1993 and 1995) - to predict
   survival until 2004. We examine the relationship between health changes
   and mortality with a proportional hazard models controlling for
   individual unobserved heterogeneity, with and without control for
   pre-existing chronic conditions and the onset of new chronic diseases.
   For a high proportion of reports (39.8\%), prospectively measured health
   changes in SAH do not concur with retrospectively reported health
   changes. Our results show that both measures of health changes are
   predictive of mortality in the model controlling for levels of SAH and
   socioeconomic characteristics only. Controlling for SAH, prior presence
   of chronic conditions, the onset of new conditions and unobserved
   characteristics, we find that prospectively reported health changes
   still predict longevity, whereas retrospective changes do not. These
   results suggest that the collection of longitudinal information on
   health changes has advantages over the - easier and cheaper - option of
   retrospective collection of the same information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{An enzymatic one-pot route in bulk was used to synthesize tetraallyl
   ether (tAE) functional oligomers based on divinyl adipate,
   1,4-butanediol and trimethylolpropane diallyl ether. By using lipase B
   from Candida antarctica as catalyst and varying the stoichiometric ratio
   of monomers, it was possible to reach targeted molecular weights (from
   1300 to 3300 g mol(-1)) of allyl-ether functional polyesters. The enzyme
   catalyzed reaction reached completion (>98\% conversion based on all
   monomers) within 24 h at 60 degrees C, under reduced pressure (72 mbar)
   resulting in similar to 90\% yield after filtration. The tAE-functional
   oligoesters were photopolymerized, without any purification other than
   removal of the enzyme by filtration, with thiol functional monomers
   (dithiol, tetrathiol) in a 1: 1 ratio thiol-ene reaction. The
   photo-initiator, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, was used to improve
   the rate of reaction under UV light. High conversions (96-99\% within
   detection limits) were found for all thiol-ene films as determined by
   FT-Raman spectroscopy. The tAE-functional oligoesters were characterized
   by NMR, MALDI, and SEC. The UV-cured homopolymerized films and the
   thiol-ene films properties were characterized utilizing DSC and DMTA.

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between
   balance performance as measured by the Balance Error Scoring System and
   functional performance in football players. Twenty-two football players
   from University League Final Group in Turkey (age 23.05 +/- 1.65 years,
   height 176.58 +/- 6.99 cm, weight 68.80 +/- 7.00 kg) volunteered to
   participate in the study. Postural performance was measured by the
   Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). For functional performance,
   standing broad jump, triple-hop, vertical jump, four-line sprint and
   three-corner run test were used. There was not a statistically
   significant relationship among the all BESS scores and triple-hop in
   non-dominant leg, power, four-line sprint, and three-corner run
   performances (p<0.05). Triple-hop in dominant leg performance correlated
   with foam surface, tandem leg and total BESS score (r = 0.755, p < 0.01;
   r = 0.664, p < 0.05; r = 0.713, p< 0.01, respectively). Standing broad
   jump performance correlated with foam surface, tandem leg and total BESS
   score (r = 0.737, p < 0.01; r = 0.692, p < 0.05; r = 0.617, p< 0.05,
   respectively). There was a statistically significant relationship among
   the single leg BESS score and vertical jumping performance (r = -0.596,
   p<0.05). In conclusion, the activities requiring explosive power may
   reflect the ability of managing a balanced posture but the activities in
   which time period is longer may not.}},

Abstract = {{In Waiting for an Angel, Helon Habila criticizes African Marxists for
   holding that despotism in postcolonial Africa is largely consequent on
   the lingering effects of colonialism and on neocolonial exploitation. He
   also rejects their view that revolution is capable of ending political
   oppression and engendering an egalitarian order. For Habila,
   postcolonial despotism is coextensive with the will to power of the
   national rulers, and efforts aimed at countering it through
   revolutionary activism cannot but prove futile given the formidable
   means of violence available to the state. I argue in this article that
   Habila's disagreements with African Marxists are largely informed by the
   critique postmodernism levels at Marxism. Like many postmodernists, he
   is impatient with the primacy Marxism accords economics over politics
   and regards the calls of Marxist revolutionaries for radical change to
   be reckless.}},

   conditions that prevent workers from engaging in employment are
   prevailing issues in the area of work disability. Vocational
   rehabilitation (VR) programs aim to facilitate return-to-work process
   but there is no universal description of functioning for patients who
   participate in VR. Our objective is to develop a Core Set for VR based
   on the international classification of functioning, disability, and
   health (ICF). An ICF Core Set is a short list of ICF categories with
   alphanumeric codes relevant to a health condition or a health-related
   event. Methods development process consists of three phases. First is
   the preparatory phase which consists of four parallel studies: (1)
   systematic review of the literature, (2) worldwide survey of experts,
   (3) cross-sectional study, and (4) focus group interview. Patients with
   various health conditions are to be recruited from five VR centers
   located in Switzerland and Germany. The second phase is a consensus
   conference where findings from the preparatory phase will be presented
   followed by a multi-stage consensus process to determine the ICF
   categories that will comprise the Core Set for VR. The final phase
   consists of validation studies in several health conditions and
   settings. Conclusions we expect the first version of the ICF Core Set
   for VR to be completed in 2010. The Core Set can serve as a guide in the
   evaluation of patients and in planning appropriate intervention within
   VR programs. This Core Set could also provide a standard and common
   language among clinicians, researchers, insurers, and policymakers in
   the implementation of successful VR.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Congress passed the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act in 1913, giving the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) authority to prevent the importation or
   interstate shipment of worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful
   veterinary biological products. The passage of this act marked the
   beginning of regulatory requirements for veterinary biological products
   in the United States. In 1913, only a few biologics establishments
   produced products for the poultry industry. The first license issued by
   the USDA for a poultry product was in 1918 to the University of
   California, Berkeley, for fowlpox vaccine. The list of biological
   products for poultry grew slowly in the 1920s. However, this began to
   change with the licensing of laryngotracheitis vaccine in 1933;
   pigeonpox vaccine in 1939; several Newcastle disease vaccines
   (inactivated in 1946, Roakin strain in 1948, B1 strain in 1950, and La
   Sota strain in 1952); and the first bronchitis vaccine in 1953. With the
   development of these and other new products, the biologics industry
   began to move its emphasis on hog cholera serum and virus to one based
   on the production of numerous new vaccines and bacterial products. The
   USDA's approach to the regulation of biologics in the early 1950s was
   still geared to the production of hog cholera products; however, as a
   result of the intervention of a group of dedicated poultry scientists,
   who were concerned about the poor performance of Newcastle disease
   vaccines, this soon changed. This presentation describes the initiation
   and development of modern standards for poultry biologics that occurred
   as a result of this intervention. The development and improvement of
   standards and regulatory requirements to address mycoplasma, leukosis,
   and other extraneous virus contaminations in chicken embryo origin
   products are reviewed. The licensing of products to meet new and
   emerging disease problems in the poultry industry and the close
   interaction among research scientists, poultry industry, biologics
   manufacturers, and government regulatory officials that has been needed
   to ensure the availability of products that meet appropriate standards
   of purity, safety, potency, and efficacy are also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{As B cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE), therapies targeting them may provide a valuable
   treatment for patients with SLE. One of the therapeutic strategies for
   B-cell targeting is through the inhibition of factors involved in the
   survival or differentiation of B cells. B-cell-activating factor (SAFE)
   or B-lymphocyte stimulator (BlyS; trademark of Human Genome Sciences,
   Rockville, MD, USA) has proven to be a key factor in the selection and
   survival of B cells. Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody
   (immunoglobulin G1) that binds to soluble BAFF and inhibits it from
   binding to its receptors. To date, two phase Ill trials have
   demonstrated that belimumab in combination with standard of care
   significantly reduced SLE disease activity and SLE flare rates in
   patients with active SLE. In addition, it was generally well tolerated.
   This article reviews the immune mechanisms induced by the inhibition of
   BAFF/BLyS and the evidence-based clinical effectiveness of belimumab in
   SLE patients.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field data show that the digging habits of ants and the
   resulting nest architecture vary with soil conditions, yet, the
   geomechanical understanding of ant tunneling is lacking. We study the
   excavation strategies used by harvester ants in clay, silt, sand, and
   gravel at water contents that range from dry to saturated. The study
   focuses on the conditions at the tunnel face that determine particle
   removal methods, digging rate, the development of branches, and
   tunneling patterns. Analytical and numerical models provide
   particle-level insight into the experimental observations and help
   identify the causal links that relate ants digging performance and nest
   geometric patterns with the properties of the granular medium such as
   grain size, moisture, and packing density. Results highlight ants'
   exceptional ability to sense the prevailing geomechanical conditions in
   tunnels, and to adapt excavation strategies, transport methods and
   tunneling patterns to those conditions, within their inherent size and
   strength limitations. The resulting tunnel structure emerges as a
   mechanically-convenient and energy-efficient topology based on local
   information gather by ants along the tunnel and at the tunnel face.}},

Abstract = {{Correct prediction of the onset of delamination requires an accurate
   evaluation of interlaminar stresses in multilayer composite laminates.
   An efficient interlaminar stress recovery procedure for
   three-dimensional finite element formulations is presented in {[}1] by
   the authors. The procedure is validated in {[}1] by analyzing moderately
   thick/thin composite plates of various geometries, and the results are
   compared with available exact and finite element solutions. These
   comparisons indicate that excellent agreement is obtained with exact
   solutions, and that convergence is reached using considerably fewer
   degrees of freedom compared to other finite elements procedures, thus
   making the procedure more suitable for design purposes. It is also shown
   in {[}1] that smooth distributions are easily generated without the need
   to employ smoothing techniques, as usually required instead using
   customary stress recovery procedures. Moreover, the procedure is shown
   to be as accurate as assumed stress methods using coarser meshes and
   without the need to include stress degrees of freedoms in the solution
   process. In this paper, the procedure is implemented in the commercial
   finite element software ABAQUS. A contact formulation is used to recover
   the inter-layer forces, thus, the method is applicable to general 3-D
   geometries and loadings. Benchmark problems concerning multilayer plate
   and shell structures are analyzed, and comparisons with ABAQUS' built-in
   stress recovery and available solutions in the literature were used to
   confirm the accuracy of the procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In contrast to earlier reports, where the spectrum of the energy density
   of photonic black-body radiation modified by SU(2) effects was
   discussed, we discuss the low-frequency spectrum of the radiance at
   temperatures ranging between 5 and 20 Kelvin. We conclude that compared
   to the conventional theory the only observable effect is associated with
   the spectral gap (total screening) which for T >= 4.3 K scales with
   temperature T as nu{*}(T)/GHz = 42.70 (T/K)(-0.53) + 0.21. We also
   discuss how a low-temperature black body cavity under the influence of a
   sufficiently strong static electric field is forced to emit according to
   Planck's radiation law (pure U(1) theory) even at low frequencies and
   how this effect can be utilized to measure SU(2) induced deviations. (C)

   respect to acid number, flash point, water and sediment, free and total
   glycerin, sulfur content, distillation temperature, etc. It was found
   that cold soak and oxidative stability were out spec due to the high

Abstract = {{As the competition to gain customers becomes more intense, the
   hospitality industry has faced increasing pressure to find new
   approaches to create and deliver value to customers through supply chain
   management (SCM) practices. Over the past decade there has been a
   growing realization of the important contribution that purchasing and
   supply management can have on an organization's performance. This paper
   addresses SCM practices, with an emphasis on strategic purchasing (SP),
   in one sector of the Canadian hospitality industry. Using data collected
   from 105 Canadian hotels, this study tested seven hypotheses of the
   impact of SP on SCM practices and verified the impact on the hotel's
   performance. All of the hypothesized relationships were supported. The
   results indicate that SP is positively related to the relationship with
   the supplier (SR), communication (COM), service quality (SQ.), financial
   performance (FINP), and customer satisfaction performance (CUSP). The
   managerial and research implications of these findings are discussed in

Abstract = {{In recent years, energy companies in the Asia Pacific region have
   focused increasing attention on granitic basement reservoirs, following
   several new oil and gas discoveries in these complex reservoirs.
   However, accurate formation evaluation in fractured, crystalline,
   granitic reservoirs is notoriously difficult. Furthermore, relatively
   little research has been conducted to understand logging-tool response
   or pressure-transient behavior, or to develop suitable workflows for
   formation evaluation in these types of reservoirs. In this paper, we
   propose a method for integrating various openhole logs, production logs,
   and well-test data to better evaluate the reservoir potential of
   fractured granitic formations. Because the wells are either horizontal
   or highly deviated, this workflow also serves as a primary method of
   assessing the lateral extent of a reservoir. We include a case study
   from the region to illustrate the workflow. Image-log interpretation,
   advanced acoustic measurements, nuclear logs, and production logs with
   distributed local sensors are combined with well-test data to derive the
   best possible evaluation of the fracture network around the borehole and
   the degree of connectivity with the reservoir at large. We also discuss
   the advantages and limitations of the proposed workflow and set the
   stage for further work in this complex environment.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Patagonian
   octopus fed with moist diets formulated with several local feed
   ingredients. All formulated diets were based on crab paste (70\%) and

   meal, prime sardine meal, and wheat gluten, using fresh fish as a
   control; experiment 2 assayed prime fish meal and macroalgal meal
   against crab paste alone as a control. The ingestion rate was lower than
   expected for all diets except those of fresh fish, crab paste alone, and
   crab paste plus prime sardine meal. No significant differences were
   found in the observed digestibility of the diets, indicating, in
   general, low digestibility, even for fresh fish. The highest protease
   values were observed for crab paste plus prime sardine meal in both
   experiments. The better growth of Enteroctopus. megalocyathus was
   obtained when these were fed fresh fish, which was associated with the
   greater consumption observed in this diet, as neither the digestibility
   nor the enzymatic activities of the hepatopancreas were related to this
   greater growth.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, Beatrice Farnsworth suggests that Aleksandra Kollontai,
   Old Bolshevik, socialist-feminist, and former leader of the Workers'
   Opposition, survived Iosif Stalin's terror largely because in her effort
   to assure Stalin that she was no longer an oppositionist, she nurtured a
   friendly dynamic with him. Indeed, in their conversations, she pursued a
   gendered strategy of warm deference and flattery. Yet, while publicly
   serving the Soviet regime, even ingratiating herself with the party
   leadership, Kollontai, in diaries written for history, privately, and at
   risk to her life, mourned the regime's failure to develop ``communist
   humanism.{''} With their interlocking themes of emotion and
   personalities, her diaries not only provide insight into Kollontai's
   uncanny survival and the personal responses of an Old Bolshevik to
   political changes and people but offer a rare and intimate portrait of
   the internal life of Soviet politics at their highest level.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method for fast, accurate evaluation of
   doping-spike carrier concentrations in hot-electron injected GaAs Gunn
   diodes. The technique relies on current asymmetry measurements obtained
   using pulsed-dc testing of on-wafer quasi-planar Gunn diode test
   structures, which removes the need for full device fabrication. Small
   changes in carrier concentration can easily be detected (at a nominal
   value of 1 x 10(18) cm(-3)) and a greater sensitivity than conventional
   techniques is demonstrated at the doping levels used. In addition, test
   structure fabrication can be integrated into the initial Gunn diode
   front side production process allowing a rapid in-process test to be
   carried out thus leading to a significant reduction in material
   characterization cycle time.}},

   parameters such as the follower force, spring stiffness, and mass ratio
   and attachment location are included in the analysis based on the
   generalized function theory and Lagrange-Rayleigh-Ritz technique. The
   numerical results reveal that if each of the design parameters of the
   piezoelectric layers, follower force, spring stiffness, or external mass
   exceeds a certain critical value, the column will undergo buckling and
   utter instabilities. Besides, comparisons are made with available
   results in the literature and excellent agreement is observed.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed long-term changes in macroinvertebrate communities in a
   Mediterranean temporary stream in southern Portugal over 15 y
   (1993-2008) at 10 locations with 3 degrees of physicochemical
   disturbance (reference, high disturbance, and mild disturbance). We
   related year-to-year variation of macroinvertebrate communities to
   long-term (59 y) information on precipitation and temperature. Our goals
   were to: 1) determine the stability of macroinvertebrate communities in
   the stream, 2) establish the influence of physicochemical disturbance on
   community stability, 3) assess the influence of climate change on the
   macroinvertebrate communities, and 4) assess the interactive effects of
   climate change and disturbance level on macroinvertebrate communities.
   Community structure varied naturally from year to year, but changes in
   taxon richness and evenness were much stronger and more unpredictable in
   disturbed than in other sites. In the long term, the more diverse
   (reference) and the poorest (disturbed) communities were stable, whereas
   communities affected by mild disturbance slowly decreased in taxon
   richness (slope = -0.07, r(2) = 0.38). This decrease could be a response
   to the continuous stress or to climate change. The multivariate patterns
   over time of invertebrate communities at mildly disturbed sites were the
   only patterns significantly correlated with climatic patterns. In the
   past 59 y in this Mediterranean area (southeastern Europe), winter
   temperature has increased 1 degrees C and precipitation has decreased
   1.5 mm/d. Marked changes in community composition (70-80\% Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity) occurred only in years of extremely low precipitation or
   temperature. In years of climatic extremes and at chemically disturbed
   sites, Orthocladiinae and Simuliidae became dominant. In this stream, a
   shift in community equity occurs before species elimination. This shift
   might be useful as an early warning for biodiversity loss because of
   disturbance or climate change. We recommend continued sampling of
   reference sites for monitoring purposes so that effects of climate
   change can be established and so that contemporary human disturbance can
   be assessed relative to an adjusted reference condition.}},

Abstract = {{Background Carboxylation reactions offer a straightforward method for
   the synthesis of carbon-11 labelled carboxylic acids Among these, the
   preparation of carbon-11 (C-11)-acetate is receiving increasing
   attention because of diagnostic applications in oncology in addition to
   its well-established use as a probe for myocardial oxidative metabolism
   Although a number of dedicated modules are commercially available, the
   development of the synthesis on flexible platforms would be beneficial
   to widen the number of tracers, in particular for preclinical assessment
   and testing
   Methods In this study, the carboxylation reaction was implemented for
   the synthesis of sodium 1-{[}C-11]acetate after the classic route of
   carboxylation of methylmagnesium chloride by {[}C-11]carbon dioxide,
   followed by the acidic hydrolysis, purification and sterile filtration
   This was performed using a commercially available kit of preassembled
   hardware units and fully compatible components of radiochemistry
   automation (VarioSystem)
   Results The system proved be to highly versatile and inexpensive and
   allowed a quick translation of the radiochemistry project into a working
   system even by less experienced personnel, because of predefined
   interfaces between electronic parts and operating software (preloaded on
   a laptop and included in the kit) The automatic module proved to be a
   simple and reliable system for the production of 1-{[}C-11]acetate that
   was prepared in 24 min (total synthesis time) with stable radiochemical
   yields (20\% nondecay corrected) and high radiochemical purity (>97\%)
   The module is used routinely to produce 1 {[}C-11]acetate for prechnical
   studies and is being implemented for the production of the labelled
   fatty acids Nucl Med Commun 31 1033-1039 (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health

Abstract = {{Background: The Certification Board of Infection Control and
   Epidemiology, Inc., (CBIC) provides direction and administers the
   certification process for infection prevention professionals. CBIC
   performs a practice analysis (PA) survey every 5 years to assess the
   current practice of infection prevention. The last PA survey was
   conducted in 2005. The CBIC conducted the 2009 survey to ensure its
   certification examination focuses on current infection prevention
   practice.
   Methods: CBIC appointed a Task Force to develop the survey, approve the
   sampling plan and oversee the distribution and analysis of the
   responses. After pilot testing, the final survey was distributed
   electronically to infection preventionists in multiple health care
   settings throughout the world.
   Results: A total of 3,771 eligible surveys were received representing a
   27.5\% response rate. The typical respondent was a female, approximately
   50 years old, who is experienced in infection prevention, has worked in
   health care for 25 years, and is a registered nurse.
   Conclusion: Of importance to a multi-national certification examination
   is that the specifications for the examinations appropriately reflect
   the responsibilities of all individuals who will participate in the
   certification examination process. The respondents agreed that the
   survey listed the critical tasks currently performed by an infection
   prevention professional. Copyright (C) 2010 by the Association for

   Lawrence' s Women in Love. It attempts to point out that the use of
   various contradictory rhetorical devices by Lawrence in this novel is an
   expression of anxiety in the context of anti-modernity. The
   protagonists' indulgence in, at once, erotic ecstasy and spiritual
   destruction, pure love toward the world and obsession with death, is
   both suffering and self-gratification. In a certain sense, despair,
   melancholy, resentment, vindictiveness, hostility and malediction are
   signs of anti-modernity, while the critical attitude toward society, the
   exile in soul and the negativity to existence seen in different
   characters of this novel can be considered as an ideological resistance
   against modernity by literature.}},

   with different porosities are prepared, and the porosity effects on the
   depoling characteristics of those samples under shock wave load are
   investigated. The results show that under short circuit condition, the
   releasing current waveforms are in the form of square pulse for all
   samples. The amplitude of the current pulse decreases, but the width
   increases with the porosity increasing. The releasing charge decreases
   with the porosity increasing, which is consistent with the measurement
   by P-E loop. Porous ceramics has lower shock impedance, which improves
   the impedance match to the encapsulation medium. The depoling
   characteristics of those samples under high resistance load are
   simulated well by Lysne model. The results reveal that the dielectric
   constant of the sample is 4-5 times larger than that under static state,
   moreover, it decreases with porosity increasing. After the shock wave
   passing through the sample, the discharging time constant increases with
   porosity increasing. As the load increases, the rising edge becomes less
   steep for the restrain of the ferroelectric phase-antiferroelectric
   phase transformation under high electric field, and the breakdown
   happens to the dense ceramics.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, two-phase, five-component mathematical model has
   been developed to describe flow characteristics of clay particles and
   flocs in the profile control process, in which the clay particle
   suspension is injected into the formation to react with residual

   residual polymer, apparent viscosity of the mixture, retention of clay
   particles and flocs, as well as the decline in porosity and permeability
   caused by the retention of clay particles and flocs. A finite difference
   method is used to discretize the equation for each component in the
   model. The Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the polymer flow
   equation, and operator splitting algorithms are used to split the flow
   equation for clay particles into a hyperbolic equation for convection
   and a parabolic equation for diffusion, which effectively ensures
   excellent precision, high speed and good stability. The numerical
   simulation had been applied successfully in the 4-P1920 unit of the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of
   parity on mechanical behavior of the vagina and to correlate these
   findings with alterations in collagen structure.
   STUDY DESIGN: Mechanical properties of 5 nulliparous and 6 parous rhesus
   macaques were derived from uniaxial tensile tests. Collagen ratios and
   alignment were quantified by quantitative fluorescent microscopy and
   picrosirius red staining. Outcomes were compared by the Student t test
   or Mann Whitney U test (P < .05) and Spearman's rho for correlation
   coefficients.
   RESULTS: Mechanical properties were inferior in a parous vs nulliparous
   vagina with decreased tangent modulus (P = .03), tensile strength (P <
   .001), and strain energy density (P = .006). Although no difference in
   collagen ratios (P = .26) were observed, collagen alignment decreased
   with parity (P = .06). Worsening pelvic organ support negatively
   correlated with decreasing collagen alignment (r(2) = -0.66) and
   mechanical properties (r(2) = -0.67).
   CONCLUSION: Vaginal parity is associated with inferior tissue mechanics
   and loss of collagen alignment. Such behavior likely predisposes to the
   development of pelvic organ prolapse.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers postulate that both shame and guilt are emotions important
   to anxiety disorders. Extant data, however, indicate that
   guilt-proneness shares non-significant relationships with
   psychopathology symptoms after controlling for shame-proneness. To
   further investigate the relevance of shame and guilt to the anxiety
   disorders domain, the current study examined associations between shame-
   and guilt-proneness and anxiety disorder symptoms using data from
   patients (N = 124) with primary anxiety disorder diagnoses. Results
   indicated that only symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and
   generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) shared significant relations with
   shame-proneness after controlling for other types of anxiety disorder
   symptoms, depression symptoms, and guilt-proneness. Further, changes in
   shame-proneness during treatment were found to share significant
   relations with changes in obsessive-compulsive disorder. SAD, and GAD
   symptoms. The current results indicate that shame is more relevant to
   symptoms of the anxiety disorders domain than is guilt. The implications
   of these results for the conceptualization and treatment of anxiety

Abstract = {{The identification and specification of competency-based standards in
   speech-language pathology has provided practitioners, educators,
   employers, and government regulators with information and guidance. This
   paper reports the outcomes of workshops that provided familiarization
   with the new competency-based assessment tool, COMPASS (R), which was
   introduced for the assessment of speech-language pathology (SLP)
   students across all 13 SLP professional preparation programs in
   Australia during 2007. An anonymous evaluation was administered before
   and after the first eight familiarization workshops held nationally,
   involving 240 clinical educators. Quantitative data were analysed
   descriptively, and qualitative data were entered into NVivo qualitative
   analysis software for content analysis. Post-workshop, results indicated
   partial or full uptake of the main concepts involved in the new approach
   to assessment. Least uptake was observed for the need for direct
   observation of competence in workplace performance. Qualitatively,
   post-workshop, formative assessment was more apparent within student
   goals formulated in response to a hypothetical scenario. A possible
   contributor to this outcome is suggested to be the alignment between the
   tool and the professional community of practice, due to the
   collaborative process of its development. Research into the longer term
   impact of the new assessment in the context of everyday practice is
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Aims The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between
   age of cigarette smoking initiation and cigarette purchasing patterns on
   menthol smoking among current smokers. Design Secondary analyses were
   conducted using logistic regression with balanced replicated weights.
   Setting Data from the 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) to
   the Current Population Survey (CPS), collected by the National Cancer
   Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Census
   Bureau, formed the basis for this investigation. Participants A total of
   66 145 current smokers who participated in the TUS CPS administration in
   2003 and 2006/07 were examined. Measurements Demographic characteristics
   (gender, race/ethnicity, age, education and income), smoking frequency,
   purchase type (pack, carton, or both), age of initiation and menthol
   cigarette use were assessed. Findings One-quarter of the sample smoked
   menthol cigarettes; most purchased their cigarettes by the pack when
   rather than by the carton; average age of cigarette smoking initiation
   was 18 years; and females, ethnic/racial minorities and younger
   participants were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes compared with
   males, whites or older respondents. Other demographic factors associated
   with menthol cigarette use among current smokers included a high school
   education (the prevalence of menthol use among this cohort was greater
   than either those with less education or those with more). The
   multivariate logistic model only marginally revealed that age of smoking
   initiation predicted menthol smoking: findings are suggestive that the
   longer the delay of initiation the more likely that an individual smoked
   menthol cigarettes {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.01; 95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.00-1.01]. In addition, relative to those who purchased
   cigarettes by the pack, smokers who purchased cigarettes by the carton
   were less (OR = 0.86; 95\% CI: 0.81-0.91) likely to be menthol smokers.
   Conclusions Menthol smokers in the United States are more likely to be
   female, younger, from ethnic minority groups, and to have a high school
   education. The findings that menthol smokers in the U.S. tend to start
   smoking later than smokers of other types of cigarettes are suggestive
   only and require further study.}},

   The mite Otodectes cynotis live on the skin surface, preferrentially
   within the ear canal of different animal species, especially dogs and
   cats. This infestation is named otodectic mange. These mites are
   responsible for causing clinical otitis, leading to the appearance of
   ear hematoma and behavioral alterations. The objective of the present
   study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 10\% neem aqueous extract on the
   control of otodectic mange on naturally infested dogs. Eighteen animals
   were divided in three groups of six animals. Group 1 was daily treated
   with saline (control). Group 2 was treated with the product in a single
   dose per week. Group 3 was treated with the product daily for 10
   consecutive days. Animals were examined by otoscopy on days +3, +7, +14,
   +21, +28, and + 35 post-treatment. Dogs from control and the weekly
   treated groups presented mites throughout the days of observation. Group
   3 presented an efficacy of 66.6\% on day + 3 and 83.3\% on other
   observations. No product-related adverse reactions were observed. The
   10\% neem aqueous extract presented low efficacy on the control of
   otodectic mange on naturally infested dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Two ternary Al-2.2Zn-0.95Mg and Al-5.5Zn-2.1Mg (in wt pct) alloys, with
   Zn:Mg ratios close to 2.5 were produced by conventional ingot casting
   metallurgy. The ingots were solution heat treated at 500 degrees C for
   0.5 h and aged at 180 degrees C for times between 0.5 and 80 h. The
   structural characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron
   diffraction (SAED) and Vickers microhardness measurements (HV). The
   study was focused on the investigation of the precipitates formation and
   the relationship between hardness and lattice parameter for alpha-Al.
   The results showed that there was an inverse correlation for all the
   experimental conditions, and the aged peaks coincided with lattice
   parameter minima. Significant precipitates formation only occurred for
   the alloy containing 5.5 wt pct Zn and 2.1 wt pct Mg, provoking an
   important strengthening and variations in the lattice parameter,
   however, this was not observed for the alloy containing 2.2 wt pct Zn
   and 0.95 wt pct Mg. A plausible explanation of the increment of hardness
   values could be the presence of a well distributed eta phase (MgZn2). At
   initial stages of the precipitation process, eta' was the most abundant
   precipitate while the phase tau was observed at overaged conditions.
   These results showed that the aging response of the conventionally cast
   Al-Zn-Mg alloys could be obtained using the lattice parameter of the
   alpha-Al matrix, even for alloy systems with low precipitates formation.}},

Abstract = {{Drug addiction is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder involving the
   environmental and genetic factors. Genetic and physiological evidences
   suggest that the dopaminergic system may play an important role in
   cocaine abuse and dependence. Several association studies have focused
   on dopaminergic genes. We genotyped the Int8 and 3'UTR variable number
   of tandem repeats of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1/SLC6A3), the
   TaqIA (rs1800497) and TaqIB (rs1079597) SNP polymorphisms within the
   dopamine receptor D2 gene and the 19-bp insertion/deletion and c.444G >
   A (rs1108580) polymorphisms of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH)
   in a Spanish sample of 169 patients with cocaine addiction and 169
   sex-matched controls. The case-control study showed a nominal
   overrepresentation of the 5R/5R genotype of the Int8 variable number of
   tandem repeats within DAT1 in cocaine abusers (P = 0.016). However, no
   significant associations were detected when DAT1 haplotype frequencies
   or polymorphisms within the other dopaminergic genes were considered.

   Algeria and to study the mycotoxigenic capacities of the isolates. A
   total of 31 pistachio samples were collected from retail outlets from
   different regions of Algeria. The most frequently found fungi were
   Penicillium spp. (38\%), Aspergillus section Nigri (30\%) and A. flavus
   (22\%). A total of 56.5\% of A. flavus isolates were able to produce
   AFB(1) and AFB(2). No A. section Nigri uniseriate isolate was OTA
   producer, whereas OTA production capacity was detected in 33.3\% of the
   A. section Nigri biseriate. At least one of the potentially
   ochratoxigenic species was found in 64.5\% of samples. Despite the high
   number of pistachio samples containing AFs and OTA-producing isolates,
   only two samples contained AFs (always below the EU maximum tolerable

Abstract = {{Root hemiparasitic plants interact with their host plants through
   parasitism and competition. The interactions can be divided into
   aboveground and belowground interactions. Because both groups of plants
   are autotrophic, they compete for light aboveground. Belowground
   interactions are more complex. The host plants compete for resources in
   the soil and the hemiparasitic plants prey on the host plants through
   haustoria, using the hosts as the main source of water and nutrients. In
   this paper, we modeled the relationship between these two plant types,
   extending the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model to
   cover both light competition and intra-specific parasitism among
   hemiparasites. We included a realistic relationship of carrying capacity
   to environmental productivity and followed model behavior on a
   productivity gradient. The model shows that, at very low productivities,
   there are only a few poor hosts and hemiparasites have no chance to
   persist. As productivity increases, there is a range of productivity
   where both plant types coexist. A further increase in productivity gets
   the system out of the coexistence range, and only host plants survive.
   This final prediction successfully explains patterns observed in
   empirical data, contrary to the results of an earlier, oversimplified
   model of the explored interaction. Comparison of various models
   demonstrates that the model is able to reproduce the decline of
   hemiparasites with increasing productivity only when competition for
   light is included.}},

Abstract = {{The Faroese pilot whale hunt-the grindadrap-has provided meat and
   blubber for human consumption since at least the late 16th century. This
   paper briefly discusses the history of the grindadrap in the context of
   its culture and broader human-environmental interactions. It then
   describes threats to the continuance of the grindadrap, including the
   possibility of over-extraction through poor management, international
   protests and boycotts, and the current issue of marine pollutants found
   in the tissues of the whales. Next, it examines the outcomes, or
   anticipated outcomes, of each of these threats. The coordination of
   science and policy has arguably ensured a sustainable take level,
   whereas the redirection of many protest efforts to other, more
   commercialized whaling operations has reduced international pressure on
   the Faroese to give up whaling. However, the issue of environmental
   pollutants remains, and has become the leading threat to the grindadrap.
   It concludes with a look to the future and at what changes the Faroese
   would have to make in their current food and cultural systems were the
   grindadrap to cease, and what the environmental, economic and cultural
   effects of those changes might be. The major options examined are:
   increasing the importation of foodstuffs, increasing local food
   production and redirecting part of the fisheries' catch from exports to
   the local market. Each option carries its own environmental, economic
   and cultural impact. A careful combination of the three will most likely
   prove to be best, if indeed the grindadrap is to be reduced or
   abandoned.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike most other mammals, killer whales are capable of vocal learning
   and learn the dialect of their natal pod from their mothers. The
   classical model of killer whale dialect development suggests that the
   repertoire of calls is learned only ``vertically{''} from mother to
   offspring, and calls evolve gradually with time by random drift caused
   by the accumulation of copying errors. However, some observations
   suggest that not only ``vertical{''} (from mother to offspring) vocal
   learning can occur in killer whales, but also ``horizontal{''} (between
   adult animals). In this study we analyzed the distribution of different
   call types and similarity of calls from the same type in different pods
   of killer whales from Kamchatka waters to estimate the probability of
   existence of interpod horizontal transmission of vocal traditions in
   killer whales. We found that the degree of similarity of K1 calls and K5
   calls in different pods can differ. This situation contradicts the
   classical hypothesis and is possible in two cases: if different call
   types change with various speed in different pods, or if horizontal
   transmission of call features takes place. The distribution of K4 and
   K10 call types across pods also suggests the existence of horizontal
   transmission: K4 calls occur in the dialects of five of ten pods, and
   K10 calls, in six of ten pods, but only one pod has both K4 and K10
   calls. Our results suggest that the real picture of the distribution of
   call features and call types in killer whale dialects contradicts the
   classical hypothesis of killer whale dialect evolution through the
   accumulation of copying errors.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration membranes based on polyamide and polysulfone modified by
   polyelectrolytes are produced. The effect of the nature of a polymer
   matrix and modifier on the rejection ability and diffusion permeability
   of membranes is studied. The effect of the asymmetry of transport
   properties, which is manifested at different orientations of membrane
   with respect to the flow of electrolyte, is quantitatively evaluated. It
   was demonstrated that the asymmetry of substance transport is more
   pronounced in the ultrafiltration regime than in the diffusion of sodium
   chloride solutions. A mathematical model that describes the filtration
   of binary electrolyte solutions on partially charged two-layer membranes
   is proposed and the corresponding boundary-value problem is solved
   analytically. The qualitative correspondence between theoretical
   calculations and experimental data on the asymmetry effect of the
   rejection ability of two-layer system is revealed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Concurrent peer review visits are structured office visits
   conducted by clinician peers of the primary care clinician that are
   specifically designed to reduce competing demands, clinical inertia, and
   bias. We assessed whether single concurrent peer review visit reduced
   clinical inertia and improved control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and diabetes control among underserved patients.
   Methods: We conducted a randomized encouragement trial to evaluate
   concurrent peer review visits with a community health center. Seven
   hundred twenty-seven patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or
   diabetes who were not at goal for systolic blood pressure (SBP),
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and/or glycated hemoglobin
   (A(1c)) were randomly assigned to an invitation to participate in a
   concurrent peer review visit or to usual care. We compared change in
   these measures using mixed models and rates of therapeutic
   intensification during concurrent peer review visits with control
   visits.
   Results: One hundred seventy-one patients completed a concurrent peer
   review visit. SBP improved significantly (p < .01) more among those
   completing concurrent peer review visits than among those who failed to
   respond to a concurrent peer review invitation or those randomized to
   usual care. There were no differences seen for changes in LDL-C or
   A(1c.) Concurrent peer review visits were associated with statistically
   significant greater clinician intensification of blood pressure (p <
   .001), lipid (p < .001), and diabetes (p < .005) treatment than either
   for control visits for patients in either the nonresponse, group or
   usual care group.
   Conclusions: Concurrent peer review visits represent a promising
   strategy for improving blood pressure control and improving therapeutic
   intensification in community health centers.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-2-focus velocimetry (L2F), laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and
   Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) are common measurement techniques for
   flow analysis, but a fundamental comparison of their minimum achievable
   measurement uncertainties is still missing. In order to reveal the
   measurement principle with the lowest uncertainty, the Cramer-Rao lower
   bounds (CRLB) are derived analytically regarding two inevitable
   fundamental disturbances: photon shot noise and thermal detector noise.
   The CRLB results are compared with each other assuming equal temporal
   resolutions. For both noise sources, a relative uncertainty limit
   results for L2F and LDA, and an absolute uncertainty limit for DGV.
   Hence, DGV seems to be appropriate for investigating high-speed flows.
   However, the threshold velocities strongly depend on the possible
   viewing angles. The CRLBs are calculated and compared with each other
   for typical conditions in turbomachinery as an example. (C) 2010

   validity of their decision increases, which results in increased levels
   of confirmatory information processing (Study 2). In contrast, when

Abstract = {{Objective: This study analyzes the clinical and laboratory findings of
   children with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) followed
   in various referral centers of Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: A simple three-page questionnaire prepared by the
   Turkish Histiocyte Study Group was used for documentation of patient
   data.
   Results: Age at diagnosis varied from 0.6 to 78 months (median +/- SD,
   16.5 +/- 26.1). Sex distribution was almost equal (F/M= 10/12). The
   frequencies of parental consanguinity and sibling death in the family
   history were 100\% and 81.1\%, respectively. The most common clinical
   findings were hepatomegaly (100\%) and fever (95\%). The most common
   laboratory findings were anemia (100\%), hyperferritinemia (100\%) and
   thrombocytopenia (90.9\%). Triglyceride and total bilirubin levels in
   the deceased versus surviving group appear to be high (triglyceride: 394
   +/- 183 mg/dl, 289 +/- 7 mg/dl; total bilirubin: 2.7 +/- 6.9 mg/dl, 0.5
   +/- 1.2 mg/dl, respectively).
   Conclusion: We concluded that fever, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia,
   thrombocytopenia, and hyperferritinemia are the most common clinical and
   laboratory findings in primary HLH. Increased triglyceride and total
   bilirubin level at the time of diagnosis might be an indicator of poor
   prognosis in HLH. (Turk J Hematol 2010; 27: 157-62)}},

Abstract = {{During the 1960s, Howard M. Temin (1934-1994), dared to advocate a
   ``heretical{''} hypothesis that appeared to be at variance with the
   central dogma of molecular biology, understood by many to imply that
   information transfer in nature occurred only from DNA to RNA. Temin's
   provirus hypothesis offered a simple explanation of both virus
   replication and viral-induced cancer and stated that Rous sarcoma virus,
   an RNA virus, is replicated via a DNA intermediate. Popular accounts of
   this scientific episode, written after the discovery of an RNA-directed
   DNA polymerase in 1970, tend to describe the reaction to his proposition
   as ardent opposition. Typically these accounts use a aEuro(1)molecular
   biology' standpoint emphasizing the central dogma's part in its
   rejection. In this article, however, this episode will be examined from
   a joint perspective of virology and experimental cancer research. From
   this perspective it is clear that Temin's work was well within the
   epistemological and methodological boundaries of virology and cancer
   research. Still, scientists did havea reasons pound to doubt the
   provirus hypothesis, but these do not seem to be good enough to either
   justify an account that portrays Temin as a renegade or his ideas as
   heretical.}},

Abstract = {{Glutamatergic dysfunction is strongly implicated in schizophrenia and
   mood disorders. GluA1 knockout KO mice display schizophrenia- and
   depression-related abnormalities. Here, we asked whether GluA1 KO show
   mania-related abnormalities. KO were tested for behavior in
   approach/avoid conflict tests, responses to repeated forced swim
   exposure, and locomotor responses under stress and after psychostimulant
   treatment. The effects of rapid dopamine depletion and treatment with
   lithium or a GSK-3 beta inhibitor (SB216763) on KO locomotor
   hyperactivity were tested. Results showed that KO exhibited novelty- and
   stress-induced locomotor hyperactivity, reduced forced swim immobility
   and alterations in approach/avoid conflict tests. Psychostimulant
   treatment and dopamine depletion exacerbated KO locomotor hyperactivity.
   Lithium, but not SB216763, treatment normalized KO anxiety-related
   behavior and partially reversed hyperlocomotor behavior, and also
   reversed elevated prefrontal cortex levels of phospho-MARCKS and
   phospho-neuromodulin. Collectively, these findings demonstrate
   mania-related abnormalities in GluA1 KO and, combined with previous
   findings, suggest this mutant may provide a novel model of features of
   schizoaffective disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{If R(omega, q) denotes Dyson's partition rank generating function, due
   to work of Bringmann and Ono, it is known that for roots of unity omega
   not equal 1, R(omega, q) is the ``holomorphic part{''} of a harmonic
   weak Maass form. Dating back to Ramanujan, it is also known that (R)
   over cap(omega, q) := R(omega,q(-1)) is given by Eichler integrals and
   modular forms. In analogy to these results, more recently Monks and Ono
   have shown that modular forms arise in a natural way from G(omega, q),
   the generating function for ranks of partitions into distinct parts.
   Moreover, Monks and Ono pose the following problem: determine whether
   the function (G) over cap(omega, q) := G(omega,q(-1)) appears naturally
   in the theory of modular forms. Here we answer this question of Monks
   and Ono, and show that (G) over cap(omega, q), when combined with (G)
   over cap(omega(-1),q) and a twisted third-order mock theta of Ramanujan,
   form a weight 1 modular form. We provide a more general result on the
   modularity of certain expressions involving basic hypergeometric series
   and then show that our result on (G) over cap(omega, q) may be deduced
   from this as a special case.}},

Abstract = {{Endophytic bacterial strains SF2 (99.9\% homology with Achromobacter
   xylosoxidans), and SF3 and SF4 (99.9\% homology with Bacillus pumilus)
   isolated from sunflower grown under irrigation or drought were selected
   on the basis of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) characteristics.
   Aims of the study were to examine effects of inoculation with SF2, SF3,
   and SF4 on sunflower cultivated under water stress, to evaluate
   salicylic acid (SA) production by these strains in control medium or at
   Psi a = -2.03 MPa, and to analyze effects of exogenously applied SA,
   jasmonic acid (JA), bacterial pellets, and bacterial supernatants on
   growth of pathogenic fungi Alternaria sp., Sclerotinia sp., and
   Verticillum sp. Growth response to bacterial inoculation was studied in
   two inbred lines (water stress-sensitive B59 and water stress-tolerant
   B71) and commercial hybrid Paraiso 24. Under both water stress and
   normal conditions, plant growth following inoculation was more strongly
   enhanced for Paraiso 24 and B71 than for B59. All three strains produced
   SA in control medium; levels for SF3 and SF4 were higher than for SF2.
   SA production was dramatically higher at Psi a = -2.03 MPa. Exogenously
   applied SA or JA caused a significant reduction of growth for
   Sclerotinia and a lesser reduction for Alternaria and Verticillum.
   Fungal growth was more strongly inhibited by bacterial pellets than by
   bacterial supernatants. Our findings indicate that these endophytic
   bacteria enhance growth of sunflower seedlings under water stress,
   produce SA, and inhibit growth of pathogenic fungi. These
   characteristics are useful for formulation of inoculants to improve
   growth and yield of sunflower crops.}},

Abstract = {{M-type asteroids, as defined in the Tholen taxonomy (Tholen, D.J.
   {[}1984]. Asteroid Taxonomy from Cluster Analysis of Photometry. Ph.D.
   Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson), are medium albedo bodies
   supposed to have a metallic composition and to be the progenitors both
   of differentiated iron-nickel meteorites and enstatite chondrites. We
   carried out a spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared
   wavelength range (0.4-2.5 mu m) of 30 asteroids chosen from the
   population of asteroids initially classified as Tholen M-types, aiming
   to investigate their surface composition. The data were obtained during
   several observing runs during the years 2004-2007 at the TNG. NTT, and
   IRTF telescopes. We computed the spectral slopes in several wavelength
   ranges for each observed asteroid, and we searched for diagnostic
   spectral features. We confirm a large variety of spectral behaviors for
   these objects as their spectra are extended into the near infrared,
   including the identification of weak absorption bands, mainly of the 0.9
   mu m band tentatively attributed to orthopyroxene, and of the 0.43 mu m
   band that may be associated to chlorites and Mg-rich serpentines or
   pyroxene minerals such us pigeonite or augite. A comparison with
   previously published data indicates that the surfaces of several
   asteroids belonging to the M-class may vary significantly.
   We attempt to constrain the asteroid surface compositions of our sample
   by looking for meteorite spectral analogs in the RELAB database and by
   modeling with geographical mixtures of selected meteorites/minerals. We
   confirm that iron meteorites, pallasites, and enstatite chondrites are
   the best matches to most objects in our sample, as suggested for M-type
   asteroids. For 22 Kalliope, we demonstrate that a synthetic mixture
   obtained enriching a pallasite meteorite with small amounts (1-2\%) of
   silicates well reproduce the spectral behavior including the observed
   0.9 mu m feature.
   The presence of subtle absorption features on several asteroids confirms
   that not all objects defined by the Tholen M-class have a pure metallic
   composition.
   A statistical analysis of spectral slope distribution vs. orbital
   parameters shows that our sample originally defined as Tholen M-types
   tend to be dark in albedo and red in slope for increasing value of the
   semi-major axis. However, we note that our sample is statistically
   limited by our number of objects (30) and slightly varying results are
   found for different subsets. If confirmed, the albedo and slope trends
   could be due to a difference in composition of objects belonging to the
   outer main belt, or alternatively to a combination of surface
   composition, grain size and space weathering effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the era of evidence-based medicine, clinical guidelines, and
   personalized medicine, one would think that convincing clinical trial
   data would influence clinical practice if disseminated in an appropriate

   practice is evidence-based, clearly demonstrating a compelling need to
   collect and analyze additional data to better inform practice. Current
   data are usually gathered from a variety of sources, including clinical
   trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses. Yet according to Jeff
   Forringer, CEO of IntrinsiQ, data from oncology practices provide

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) into cells is widely
   utilized for antisense, antigene, aptamer, and similar approaches to
   regulate gene and protein activities based upon the ODNs'
   sequence-specific recognition. Short pieces of DNA can also be generated
   in biological processes, for example, after degradation of viral or
   bacterial DNA. However, the mechanisms that regulate intracellular
   trafficking and localization of ODNs are not fully understood. Here we
   study the effects of major transporters of microRNA, exportin-1 (Exp1)
   and exportin-5 (Exp5), on the transport of single-stranded ODNs in and
   out of the nucleus. For this, we employed a fluorescent microscopy-based
   assay to quantitatively measure the redistribution of ODNs between the
   nucleus and cytoplasm of live cells. By measuring the fluorescent signal
   of the nuclei we observed that after delivery into cells via cationic
   liposomes ODNs rapidly accumulated inside nuclei. However, after removal
   of the ODN/liposome containing media, we found re-localization of ODNs
   from the nuclei to cytoplasm of the cells over the time course of
   several hours. Downregulation of the Exp5 gene by siRNA resulted in a
   slight increase of ODN uptake into the nucleus, but the kinetics of ODN
   efflux to the cytoplasm was not affected. Inhibition of Exp1 with
   leptomycin B somewhat slowed down the clearance of ODNs from the
   nucleus; however, within 6 hours most of the ODN were still being
   cleared form the nucleus. ODNs that could form intramolecular
   G-quadruplex structures behaved differently. They also accumulated in
   nuclei, although at a lesser extent than unstructured ODN, but they
   remained there for up to 20 hours after transfection, causing
   significant cell death. We conclude that Exp1 and Exp5 are not the major
   transporters of our ODNs out of the nucleus, and that the transport of
   ODNs is strongly affected by their secondary structure.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the Fc segment of IgG and Fc gamma Rs on a variety
   of cells are likely to play an important role in the anti-HIV activity
   of Abs. Because the nature of the glycan structure on the Fc domain is a
   critical determinant of Fc-Fc gamma R binding, proper Fc glycosylation
   may contribute to Ab-mediated protection. We have generated five
   different glycoforms of the broadly HIV-1-neutralizing mAb 2G12 in
   wild-type and glycoengineered plants and Chinese hamster ovary cells.
   Plant-derived 2G12 exhibited highly homogeneous glycosylation profiles
   with a single dominant N-glycan species. Using flow cytometry with Fc
   gamma R-expressing-cell lines, all 2G12 glycoforms demonstrated similar
   binding to Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RIIa, and Fc gamma RIIb. In contrast,
   two glycoforms derived from glycoengineered plants that lack
   plant-specific xylose and core alpha 1,3-fucose, and instead carry
   human-like glycosylation with great uniformity, showed significantly
   enhanced binding to Fc gamma RIIIa compared with Chinese hamster ovary
   or wild-type plant-derived 2G12. Using surface plasmon resonance, we
   show that binding of 2G12 to Fc gamma RIIIa is markedly affected by core
   fucose, irrespective of its plant-specific alpha 1,3 or mammalian-type
   alpha 1,6 linkage. Consistent with this finding, 2G12 glycoforms lacking
   core fucose (and xylose) mediated higher antiviral activity against
   HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus as measured by Ab-dependent
   cell-mediated virus inhibition. This is, to our knowledge, the first
   demonstration that specific alterations of Fc glycosylation can improve
   antiviral activity. Such alterations may result in better
   immunotherapeutic reagents. Moreover, biasing vaccine-induced immune
   responses toward optimal Fc glycosylation patterns could result in
   improved vaccine efficacy. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:

Abstract = {{We comment on the recent observation of a 115 day modulation in the
   X-ray flux of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X-1, and in
   particular, the interpretation of this modulation as the orbital period.
   We suggest that this modulation may instead be due to a precessing jet,
   and is thus superorbital in nature. Comparing the properties of this ULX
   with those of the prototypical micro-quasar SS 433, we argue that NGC
   5408 X-1 is very similar to SS 433: a hyper-accreting stellar-mass black
   hole in a shorter-period binary. If the analogy holds, the 115 day
   modulation is best explained by the still poorly understood physics of
   inner-disk/jet precession and a longer observing baseline would be able
   to reveal an intrinsic phase jitter that is associated with such a
   precession.}},

Abstract = {{Methods: We reviewed the charts of adult patients who received IVIG in
   the five ICUs over a 5-year period. Data collection included
   demographics, severity of illness, indication for and dose of IVIG,
   mortality and adverse effects. On the basis of a classification
   developed by Canadian Blood Services, the indications for IVIG were then
   classified as `appropriate' or `inappropriate'.
   Results: One hundred and forty-five patients received IVIG in the ICU.
   In all, 19\% of IVIG prescriptions were for `appropriate' indications
   and 7\% were `inappropriate'. The remaining 74\% were prescribed for
   indications with some evidence to support their use. Three indications
   accounted for 50\% of all IVIG prescribed: Guillain-Barre syndrome
   (GBS), necrotising fasciitis (NF) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).
   Both the community and academic centres prescribed IVIG for similar
   indications. Adverse effects associated with IVIG administration
   included deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, fever and renal
   failure, although direct causation related to IVIG could not be
   established. The overall mortality rate was 55\%.
   Conclusions: IVIG is used relatively infrequently in the critical care
   setting. The most common indications were GBS, TEN and NF. Mortality was
   high. There was no difference between community and academic ICUs.}},

Abstract = {{In this article a novel approach to visual tracking called the harmony
   filter is presented. It is based on the Harmony Search algorithm, a
   derivative free meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm inspired by the
   way musicians improvise new harmonies. The harmony filter models the
   target as a colour histogram and searches for the best estimated target
   location using the Bhattacharyya coefficient as a fitness metric.
   Experimental results show that the harmony filter can robustly track an
   arbitrary target in challenging conditions. We compare the speed and
   accuracy of the harmony filter with other popular tracking algorithms
   including the particle filter and the unscented Kalman filter.
   Experimental results show the harmony filter to be faster and more
   accurate than both the particle filter and the unscented Kalman filter.

Abstract = {{Aim. - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Rotavirus infections
   represent up to 30\% of cross infections in pediatric units. As they are
   a major public health problem, we studied their evolution and
   distribution at the Dijon University Hospital. Population and methods.
   This exhaustive retrospective study included children under 15 with a
   new Rotavirus or RSV infection who were hospitalised at the Dijon
   University Hospital between 1998 and 2005. The general trend was
   determined by using moving averages, and the Spearman correlation
   coefficient r(s) was calculated.
   Results. - From 1998 to 2005, 1886 new RSV (n = 981) or Rotavirus (n =
   905) infections were identified in hospitalised children. The number of
   the infections decreased significantly, both for RSV (r(s) = -0.71; p <
   0.0001) and for Rotavirus (r(s) = 0.77; p < 0.0001). Almost half of Rota
   virus infections were nosocomial (46.3\%) vs 5.3\% of RSV infections, p
   < 0.0001. There was no significant difference in the proportion of RSV
   nosocomial infections between the epidemic and non-epidemic period
   (4.9\% of nosocomial infections vs 7.1\% respectively, p = 0.25).
   Rotavirus nosocomial infections were less frequent in epidemic period
   (41.6\%) than in non-epidemic period (54.6\%); p = 0.0002.
   Conclusion. - RSV and Rotavirus infections significantly decreased
   between 1998 and 2005. Proportion of RSV or Rotavirus infections didn't
   increase in epidemic period, which could be explained both by an
   increased attention from healthcare professionals and by the
   effectiveness of hygiene measures taken. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Two types of passive samplers-semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and
   polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS)-were deployed in
   spring 2008 to assess bioavailable concentrations of aquatic
   contaminants in five cave streams and resurgences in Perry County,
   Missouri. Study sites represent areas of high cave biodiversity and the
   only known habitat for grotto sculpin (Cottus carolinae). Time-weighted
   average (TWA) water concentrations were calculated for 20 compounds (n =
   9 SPMDs; n = 11 POCIS) originating primarily from agricultural sources,
   including two organochlorine insecticides, dieldrin and heptachlor
   epoxide, which were found at levels exceeding U.S. EPA criteria for the
   protection of aquatic life. GIS data were used to quantify and map
   sinkhole distribution and density within the study area. Infiltration of
   storm runoff and its influence on contaminant transport were also
   evaluated using land cover and hydrological data. This work provides
   evidence of cave stream contamination by a mix of organic chemicals and
   demonstrates the applicability of passive samplers for monitoring water
   quality in dynamic karst environments where rapid transmission of storm
   runoff makes instantaneous water sampling difficult.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{725}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{534-541}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the relationship between spiral arms and star formation
   in the grand-design spirals NGC 5194 and NGC 628 and in the flocculent
   spiral NGC 6946. Filtered maps of near-IR (3.6 mu m) emission allow us
   to identify ``arm regions{''} that should correspond to regions of
   stellar mass density enhancements. The two grand-design spirals show a
   clear two-armed structure, while NGC 6946 is more complex. We examine
   these arm and interarm regions, looking at maps that trace recent star
   formation-far-ultraviolet (GALEX NGS) and 24 mu m emission (Spitzer
   SINGS)-and cold gas-CO (HERACLES) and H I (THINGS). We find the star
   formation tracers and CO more concentrated in the spiral arms than the
   stellar 3.6 mu m flux. If we define the spiral arms as the 25\% highest
   pixels in the filtered 3.6 mu m images, we find that the majority (60\%)
   of star formation tracers occur in the interarm regions; this result
   persists qualitatively even when considering the potential impact of
   finite data resolution and diffuse interarm 24 mu m emission. Even with
   a generous definition of the arms (45\% highest pixels), interarm
   regions still contribute at least 30\% to the integrated star formation
   rate (SFR) tracers. We look for evidence that spiral arms trigger star
   or cloud formation using the ratios of SFR (traced by a combination of
   FUV and 24 mu m emission) to H-2 (traced by CO) and H-2 to H I. Any
   enhancement of SFR/M(H-2) in the arm region is very small (less than
   10\%) and the grand-design spirals show no enhancement compared to the
   flocculent target. Arm regions do show a weak enhancement in H-2/H I
   compared to the interarm regions, but at a fixed gas surface density
   there is little clear enhancement in the H-2/H I ratio in the arm
   regions. Thus, it seems that spiral arms may only act to concentrate the
   gas to higher densities in the arms.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids enclose a large number of molecular structures consisting
   of a cation and an anion. Their physical state and their chemical
   properties can be tuned by different combination of the ions and a large
   number of ionic liquids have already been reported. Toxicity of ionic
   liquids is a subject of great importance concerning their likely use as
   greener solvents and new materials for a broad number of potential
   applications. This review provides relevant toxicological data published
   so far about this topic and includes a large range of ionic liquids
   based on different cations (imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium,
   quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium and guanidinium) and anions
   (halogens-Br, Cl, bis (trifluoromethyl)sulfonylamide, tetrafluoroborate,
   hexafluorophosphate, dicyanamide, acesulfame and saccharin, amongst
   others). In general, toxicity of ionic liquids depends on both ions and
   the effect of the cation alkyl chain length is very pronounced although
   the type of anion also exerts impact on the overall toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a proof-theoretic semantics (PTS) for a fragment of
   natural language, providing an alternative to the traditional
   model-theoretic (Montagovian) semantics (MTS), whereby meanings are
   truth-condition (in arbitrary models). Instead, meanings are taken as
   derivability-conditions in a ``dedicated{''} natural-deduction (ND)
   proof-system. This semantics is effective (algorithmically decidable),
   adhering to the ``meaning as use{''} paradigm, not suffering from
   several of the criticisms formulated by philosophers of language against
   MTS as a theory of meaning. In particular, Dummett's manifestation
   argument does not obtain, and assertions are always warranted, having
   grounds of assertion. The proof system is shown to satisfy Dummett's
   harmony property, justifying the ND rules as meaning conferring. The
   semantics is suitable for incorporation into computational linguistics
   grammars, formulated in type-logical grammar.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is currently a global public health problem. Obesity in early
   life increases the risk of long-term energy imbalance and adult obesity
   and its comorbidities, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
   Since infancy and childhood are critical periods for the adoption of
   food preferences and physical activity, prevention strategies must
   intervene in these early periods to promote healthy habits and reduce
   risk behaviors. Trends in the prevalence of childhood obesity and
   overweight in Spain have continuously increased in the last three
   decades. Obesity and overweight currently affect 15 and 20\% of Spanish
   children, respectively, and these percentages are among the highest in
   Europe. Childhood obesity is determined by social and economic factors
   pertaining to sectors other than the health system, such as advertising,
   the built environment, education and the school environment,
   transportation and the food environment. Following the Health in All
   Policies (HiAP) approach, the authors identified a series of multisector
   policy changes that may help to prevent and control the current rising
   trend of childhood obesity in Spain. The HiAP approach acknowledges that
   social factors including socioeconomic status, gender differences and
   the work-life balance are important to develop effective policy changes
   in the prevention of childhood obesity. A key to success in the
   prevention of childhood obesity in Spain through policy changes will
   depend on the ability to establish a policy with the explicit and
   primary goal of improving health outcomes, despite the anticipated
   resistance from various sectors and stakeholders. (C) 2010 SESPAS.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: This study presents a retrospective, cohort analysis to
   estimate the 4-year rate of all-cause risk-adjusted mortality for
   veterans who were dispensed glaucoma medications. The main outcome
   measures was hazard of death according to glaucoma medication exposure.
   METHODS: Beneficiaries 40 years and older enrolled in Veterans Health
   Administration (VHA) with International Disease Classification diagnoses
   of glaucoma. VHA clinical and pharmacy data sets were linked with a
   national VHA mortality registry. Patients were identified with a primary
   diagnosis of glaucoma were then put into one of two groups, glaucoma
   medication exposure or nonexposure medication group. Four-Year survival
   analysis using the Cox proportional hazard method was adjusted for
   comorbidities using pertinent demographic characteristics and
   hierarchical condition categories from the Centers for Medicare and
   Medicaid Services.
   RESULTS: Of 214,971 beneficiaries with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma,
   25,148 (11.7\%) died during the study period. Compared to unexposed
   patients with glaucoma, the use of any class of glaucoma medication was
   associated with a statistically significant 7\% reduced hazard of death
   (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval: 0.90-0.95).
   Reduced risk of death was found for multiple topical medication use, but
   not individual glaucoma agents.
   CONCLUSIONS: The seemingly inexplicable protective effect of glaucoma
   agents on all-cause mortality may best be explained by unmeasured
   confounding variables involved in the clinical decision of whether or
   not to treat patients with limited life expectancy for glaucoma. Ann

Title = {{The Immunocytokine F8-IL2 Improves the Therapeutic Performance of

Abstract = {{Purpose: We investigated the therapeutic action of F8-IL2, a fusion
   protein consisting of the F8 antibody specific to the alternatively
   spliced extradomain-A of fibronectin, in diabody format and of human
   interleukin-2 in the Caki-1 (ATCC (R)) model of human renal cell
   carcinoma grafted subcutaneously in nude mice.
   Materials and Methods: F8-IL2 was cloned, expressed in CHO cells and
   purified to homogeneity. This immunocytokine was administered alone or
   combined with 3 standard drugs commonly used as therapy for kidney
   cancer, including sunitinib, sorafenib and interferon-alpha, in 2 sets
   of doses and treatment schedules.
   Results: Neither F8-IL2 nor any other therapeutic agent cured tumor
   bearing mice when used as a single agent. The best therapeutic results
   were observed for the combination of sunitinib with F8-IL2 in a
   continuous administration schedule, which yielded a 28\% cure rate and
   substantial tumor growth retardation.
   Conclusions: Considering that recombinant interleukin-2 based
   immunocytokines are now being investigated in several clinical trials in
   patients with cancer alone or combined with chemotherapy our preclinical
   results provide a motivation to study F8-IL2 combined with sunitinib in
   clinical trials in patients with kidney cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Non-adherent bone marrow-derived cells (NA-BMCs) are a mixed cell
   population that can give rise to multiple mesenchymal phenotypes and
   that facilitates hematopoietic recovery. We characterized NA-BMCs by
   flow cytometry, fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-f), real-time PCR,
   and in in vivo experiments. In comparison to adherent cells, NA-BMCs
   expressed high levels of CD11b(+) and CD90(+) within the CD45(+) cell
   fraction. CFU-f were significantly declining over the cultivation
   period, but NA-BMCs were still able to form CFU-f after 5 days. Gene
   expression analysis of allogeneic NA-BMCs compared to bone marrow (BM)
   indicates that NA-BMCs contain stromal, mesenchymal, endothelial cells
   and monocytes, but less osteoid, lymphoid, and erythroid cells, and
   hematopoietic stem cells. Histopathological data and analysis of weight
   showed an excellent recovery and organ repair of lethally irradiated
   mice after NA-BMC transplantation with a normal composition of the BM.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we tested the ability to remember the temporal

   occurred within a week of each other and, if not, how far apart they had
   occurred. Some event pairs were related, and others were unrelated. For
   unrelated event pairs, same-week and separation judgments were very
   poor. Accuracy was much greater for both kinds of judgments when the
   events were related. Participants often guessed the separation of
   unrelated event pairs, whereas they frequently deduced the separation or
   remembered the proximity of related event pairs. For both types of
   pairs, the participants reported using the strength of the memories or
   the general period in which the events had occurred.}},

Abstract = {{The economically important genus Arachis (Fabaceae) comprises 80 species
   restricted to South America. One monograph on the genus divided it into
   nine sections and included an intuitive assessment of evolutionary
   relationships. There is no comprehensive phylogenetic study of the
   genus. To test the current systematic treatment of the genus, we
   reconstructed a phylogeny for Arachis using nuclear ITS and plastid
   trnT-trnF sequences from 46 species representing all nine sections. ITS
   cloning of the allotetraploid species of section Arachis indicated the
   presence of A and B genome alleles and chimeric sequences. Our study
   revealed that species from section Extranervosae were the first emerging
   lineage in the genus, followed by sections Triseminatae and
   Caulorrhizae, and two terminal major lineages, which we refer to as
   erectoides and arachis. The lineage erectoides comprises members of
   sections Erectoides, Heteranthae, Procumbentes, Rhizomatosae, and
   Trierectoides. Species in the arachis lineage form two major clades,
   arachis I (B and D genomes species and the aneuploids) and arachis II (A
   genome species). Our results substantiated the sectional treatment of
   Caulorrhizae, Extranervosae, and Triseminatae, but demonstrated that
   sections Erectoides, Procumbentes, and Trierectoides are not
   monophyletic. A detailed study of the genus Arachis with denser taxon
   sampling, additional genomic regions, plus information from morphology
   and cytogenetics is needed for comprehensive assessment of its
   systematics.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic potential of CAMPATH-1H in skeletal tumours
   Aims:
   CD 52 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that
   is expressed abundantly on all lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages,
   eosinophils and in the male genital tract. To date, the physiological
   role of CD52 on lymphocytes has not been elucidated. However, an
   antibody directed to CD52 called CAMPATH-1H has been shown to be capable
   of depleting lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to analyse tissue
   and cell lines of non-neoplastic bone, cartilage and skeletal tumours
   for CD52 expression.
   Methods and results:
   The expression of CD52 mRNA and protein both in vivo and in vitro was
   detected. Malignant tumours showed higher CD52 expression compared to
   benign tumours, suggesting a role in the development and progression of
   bone tumours. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry
   revealed that CD52 was expressed not only on the surface of tumour
   cells, but also in the cytoplasm. The results obtained in osteosarcoma
   cells showed that CAMPATH-1H leads to a complement-independent reduction
   of viable cells.
   Conclusion:
   CD52 is expressed in a variety of bone tumours and the in vitro studies
   presented herein suggest that CAMPATH-1H treatment might have
   therapeutic potential for osteosarcoma patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate quality of life among patients of Family Health
   Strategy Units and how it relates to the prescribing complexity and to
   the number of psychotropic medications prescribed, including adjustments
   for sociodemographic characteristics. Setting Family Health Strategy
   Units in a municipality in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.
   Method Cross-sectional study using face-to-face interviews and
   prescribing analysis among users of Family Health Strategy Units.
   Patients were recruited by consecutive sampling. Multiple linear
   regression models were fitted to the different domains of quality of
   life in the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. The response rate for the
   patients who completed the interview was 97\%. The prescribed medication
   data and sociodemographic characteristics of the sample were included as
   covariates. Prescribing complexity was analyzed by means of the
   Medication Regimen Complexity Index. The assumptions in the estimated
   models were tested and the models were validated. Main outcome measure
   Quality of life among patients of Family Health Strategy Units. Results
   At total, 336 patients answered the questionnaire. Through multiple
   linear regression, it was observed that higher prescribing complexity
   was associated with significantly low scores in the physical (-2.01,
   95\% CI = -2.89 to -1.35) and overall (-1.93, 95\% CI = -2.81 to -0.99)
   quality of life domains. Greater amounts of psychotropic medications
   prescribed were associated with significantly low scores in the physical
   (-1.02, 95\% CI = -1.29 to -0.56), psychological (-2.52, 95\% CI = -3.15
   to -1.65) and overall (-0.97, 95\% CI = -2.06 to -0.33) domains of the
   interviewees' quality of life. The estimated models were adjusted for
   the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample and presented good
   predictive capacity. Conclusions The evaluated aspects of the prescribed
   medication (complexity and presence of psychotropic medications) were
   associated with low scores in the physical, psychological and overall
   quality of life domains. This may be an intrinsic characteristic of the
   interviewed patients, like having the quality of life at such a low
   level before starting the treatment, that the medication could not
   improve it to normal levels. Also, it can be a demonstration of the
   ineffectiveness of these treatments within primary health care.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we investigate the role of abstraction principles for
   knowledge transfer in agent control learning tasks. We analyze
   abstraction from a formal point of view and characterize three distinct
   facets: aspectualization, coarsening, and conceptual classification. The
   taxonomy we develop allows us to interrelate existing approaches to
   abstraction, leading to a code of practice for designing knowledge
   representations that support knowledge transfer. We detail how
   aspectualization can be utilized to achieve knowledge transfer in
   reinforcement learning. We propose the use of so-called structure space
   aspectualizable knowledge representations that explicate structural
   properties of the state space and present a posteriori structure space
   aspectualization (APSST) as a method to extract generally sensible
   behavior from a learned policy. This new policy can be used for
   knowledge transfer to support learning new tasks in different
   environments. Finally, we present a case study that demonstrates
   transfer of generally sensible navigation skills from simple simulation
   to a real-world robotic platform.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Package inserts are the most frequent source of patient
   information about medicines aside from doctors and pharmacists.
   Materials and methods: A representative selection of 271 German package
   inserts available in 2005 was investigated, using 152 validated quality
   criteria and by measuring 242 further values. Results: A significant
   increase in package insert texts over recent years was found; standing
   at an average of 2,005 words. This is associated with the significant
   increase in complicated medical information being communicated; with on
   an average of 114.1 difficult words and 46.3 non quantifiable phrases
   per package insert. Only 60.1\% of the package inserts offered all
   dosages as number of tablets or other amounts of the ready to use
   medicine, while just 29.5\% listed the maximum daily dose for all users.
   54.6\% provided actions for all possible side effects and 24.2\% the
   frequencies of side effects in numerical form. Conclusion: The
   significantly increased volume of medical information provided in
   package inserts does not meet the requirements of patients. Major
   efforts are required by pharmaceutical companies, authorities and
   legislative bodies in order to reduce information to that which is
   essential for patients and to ensure that this is provided in short,
   precise and easily comprehensible texts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{795-805}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) inhibits acetylcholine release
   at the neuromuscular junction in isolated muscles, and ouabain can
   partially block its effect. However, it is not clear whether ouabain
   attenuates BoNT/A-induced neuromuscular paralysis in vivo. In this work,
   we investigated the effects of ouabain on BoNT/A-induced neuromuscular
   paralysis in mice. Ouabain was administered to mice intraperitoneally
   immediately after a single injection of BoNT/A into skeletal muscle. The
   effects of ouabain on BoNT/A-induced muscle paralysis were assessed by
   quantitative monitoring of muscle tension and digit abduction via the
   digit abduction scoring (DAS) assay. A single administration of ouabain
   significantly prolonged BoNT/A-induced neuromuscular paralysis.
   Moreover, consecutive daily injection of ouabain exacerbated
   BoNT/A-induced neuromuscular paralysis, and led to a significant
   decrease in both twitch and tetanic forces as assayed in isolated
   BoNT/A-injected muscles. We next looked at the effects of ouabain on
   BoNT/A-induced muscle atrophy. Administration of ouabain led to a
   decrease in the myofibrillar cross-sectional area (CSAs) by 14
   post-BoNT/A injection. In addition, repeated administration of ouabain
   increased mRNA expression levels of ubiquitin ligases, which are markers
   of muscle atrophy, in BoNT/A-injected muscle. These results suggest that
   ouabain exacerbates BoNT/A-induced neuromuscular paralysis via a marked
   progression of BoNT/A-induced muscle atrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hypoxia and decreased blood supply have been proposed as
   risks for tendon rupture. Visualization of the vascularity of intact and
   torn rotator cuffs would be useful for improving treatments for rotator
   cuff tear.
   Purpose: To assess vascularity inside a tendon or an adjacent rotator
   cuff insertion point in patients differing in age and extent of damage
   to the tendon.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: Ten volunteers (all men) and 15 patients (10 men, 5 women)
   consented to participate in the study. Contrast agent for enhanced
   ultrasound was injected intravenously. Enhanced ultrasound images of the
   torn cuff and the contralateral shoulder were recorded for 1 minute.
   Four small regions of interest, the articular and bursal sides of the
   tendon and the medial and lateral sides of the bursa, were studied in
   all shoulders.
   Results: There was a significant decrease in blood flow in the
   intratendinous region in elderly subjects compared with young subjects,
   but age had no effect on blood flow in bursal tissue. Blood flow in
   ruptured rotator cuffs did not differ from that in intact rotator cuffs.
   The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver reproducibility
   was 0.82 (95\% confidence interval: 0.77-0.86).
   Conclusions: The findings of this investigation were the hypovascular
   pattern in intratendinous tissue compared with the subacromial bursa,
   the age-related decrease in intratendinous vascularity, and the
   hypovascular pattern in the tendon, regardless of rupture of the tendon.
   Clarification of vascular patterns inside or around the torn ends of a
   rotator cuff will assist in the development of successful treatments for
   torn rotator cuffs.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Some strokes of unknown etiology may be the
   result of a paradoxical embolism traversing through a nonfused foramen
   ovale (patent foramen ovale {[}PFO]). The utility of percutaneously
   placed devices for treatment of patients with cryptogenic stroke or
   transient ischemic attack (TIA) and PFO is unknown. In addition, there
   are no clear data about the utility of medical interventions or other
   surgical procedures in this situation. Despite limited data, many
   patients are being treated with PFO closure devices. Thus, there is a
   strong need for clinical trials that test the potential efficacy of PFO
   occlusive devices in this situation. To address this gap in medical
   knowledge, we designed the CLOSURE I trial, a randomized, clinical trial
   comparing the use of a percutaneously placed PFO occlusive device and
   best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone for prevention of
   recurrent ischemic neurologic symptoms among persons with TIA or
   ischemic stroke.
   Study Design-This prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
   has finished enrollment. Two-year follow-up for all 910 patients is
   required. The primary end point is the 2-year incidence of stroke or
   TIA, all-cause mortality for the first 30 days, and neurologic mortality
   from >= 31 days of follow-up, as adjudicated by a panel of physicians
   who are unaware of treatment allocation. This article describes the
   rationale and study design of CLOSURE I.
   Conclusions-This trial should provide information as to whether the
   STARFlex septal closure system is safe and more effective than best
   medical therapy alone in preventing recurrent stroke/TIA and mortality
   in patients with PFO and whether the STARFlex septal closure device can
   demonstrate superiority compared with best medical therapy alone.}},

Abstract = {{For immediate discrimination among isolated cells we propose a novel
   device and technique for isolation of cells and sequential detection of
   specific gene(s) within them by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this
   study, we isolated Salmonella enterica cells and detected the
   Salmonella-specific invA gene from isolated cells by PCR on a compact
   disk (CD)-shaped device. This device enabled liquid flow by centrifugal
   force without a micro pump, and was fabricated from silicon wafer and
   glass to avoid evaporation of a small amount of reagent. One device has
   24 microchannels, and 313 microchambers integrated on each microchannel.
   One microliter of PCR mixture containing cells was separated into
   microchambers on the device at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Each microchamber
   contained approximately 1.5 nL PCR mixture. A Poisson distribution of S.
   enterica cells was observed for different densities of cell suspension.
   At 200 cells mu L-1 of S. enterica or less, isolated single cells could
   be determined on the device by amplification of DNA of the invA gene; at
   400 cells mu L-1, chambers containing no, one, two, or three cells could
   be determined on the device. Selective detection of S. enterica was
   achieved by PCR from a mixture of S. enterica and Esherichia coli on the
   CD-shaped device.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the resolution period of
   spontaneous nystagmus (SN) may provide an indication of vestibular
   dysfunction on a particular day in the primary care setting. Objective:
   We aimed to predict canal paresis using fundamental observations of SN
   during the early stage of acute peripheral vestibular disorders.
   Methods: The study involved 87 patients who had recently experienced
   their first episode of acute spontaneous vertigo and direction-fixed
   horizontal nystagmus. Although they did not exhibit any other
   neurological deficits, they had been hospitalized with severe acute
   symptoms between 2004 and 2007. A correlation between the resolution
   period of SN and the results of laboratory caloric testing was reviewed.
   Results: The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the
   resolution period of SN may be a predictive indicator of unilateral
   vestibular hypofunction in the acute stage. In about half of the
   patients, SN disappeared on the third day after their initial visit.
   However, in 20\% of the patients SN still persisted on the eighth day.
   Among the patients with SN, the prevalence of canal paresis increased
   with the increase in the resolution period of SN. When SN was observed
   on the fifth day, the prevalence was approximately 70\%.}},

   to viewing one of three framing conditions for the BART: (1)
   positively-framed instructions emphasizing the ability to earn money if
   balloons were inflated to large size; (2) negatively framed instructions
   emphasizing the possibility that money could be lost if balloons were
   inflated to bursting; and (3) completely framed instructions noting both
   possible outcomes. Results revealed correlations between BART
   performance and impulsiveness for both sexes. Compared to positive and
   complete framing, negatively framed instructions decreased balloon
   inflation time in women but not men, indicating sex differences in

Abstract = {{Tobacco smoke containing numerous derived chemical carcinogens is the
   main risk factor for urothelial carcinoma. These carcinogens can induce
   DNA damage leading to chromosomal instability, which plays a fundamental
   role in urothelial carcinogenesis. Possible mechanisms could be
   centrosomal aberrations, which cause defective spindles and may be
   responsible for genetic instability. We evaluated the effect of urine
   from never smokers (NS) and current smokers (CS) in concentrations of 0
   to 50\% on cell proliferation, chromosomes, centrosomes, and the spindle
   status of normal human dermal fibroblasts and normal human urothelial
   cells (UROtsa). After 2 weeks of urine treatment, cell cultures were
   analyzed by centrosome and spindle immunostaining and conventional
   cytogenetics. Effects were compared to results of untreated controls.
   Analysis of normal human dermal fibroblasts and UROtsa cells revealed
   that urine from CS induced higher values of centrosome aberrations in a
   dose-dependent and cell line-independent manner when compared to
   cultures treated with urine from NS and untreated controls. Centrosomal
   alterations correlated with spindle defects and an increase of sporadic
   chromosomal aberrations. The observations suggest a causative role of
   chemical carcinogens in urine from CS in the origin of centrosome and
   spindle defects in vino leading to chromosomal instability and may be
   involved in urothelial carcinogenesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   luminance response functions were obtained simultaneously in a dilated

   amplitude was reduced by 14\% (P < 0 0001), implicit time prolonged (P <
   0 0001), and retinal sensitivity (log K) decreased by 0 38 log units (P
   < 0 0001) with no effect on a-wave Using a xenon strobe light (N = 6) to
   increase flash luminance, Vmax remained lower by about 12\% in the NDE
   (P = 0 02) V-max with LED and xenon was achieved at 3 9 +/- 1 0 cd S

   0 57 log unit (P <0 0001), respectively Increasing background luminance
   by 0 50 log units (80 cd m-2, N = 4) resulted in implicit time
   normalization but not V-max amplitude Rod V-max was decreased by 7\% in
   NDE (P < 0 05) and sensitivity reduced by 0 40 log units (P <0 0001),
   but our data suggest that the luminance may have not been sufficient to
   reach V-max in all participants in the NDE and that the sensitivity
   change may have been due to an inadequate inter-stimulus interval For
   the photopic ERG, increasing flash luminance is not sufficient to
   compensate for the smaller pupil size, whereas for the scotopic ERG,
   more data are needed to establish proper inter-stimulus interval to
   perform recordings in a non-pharmacologically dilated}},

Abstract = {{The use of microbicides is a promising approach for the prevention of
   HIV-1 transmission. Unfortunately, various candidates failed in clinical
   trials. In some cases, the candidate microbicide even resulted in
   enhanced virus transmission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
   develop more predictive preclinical strategies to anticipate the in vivo
   efficiency/toxicity rate, including in vitro assays that evaluate
   effects on epithelial integrity and inflammation. The present study aims
   to identify potential safety issues concerning the use of microbicides
   and excipients commonly used in vaginal microbicide preparations. The
   toxicities of various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs; TMC-120,
   UC-781, tenofovir {[}PMPA], PRO-2000, and glycerol monolaurate {[}GML])
   and excipients (preservatives, cosolvents, surfactants, and
   cyclodextrins) were evaluated using an in vitro dual-chamber model and
   uterine cervical explants. Epithelial viability and permeation of
   fluorescent virus-sized beads, as well as induction of interleukin-8
   (IL-8; as a sensitive marker of an inflammatory response), were
   assessed. Surprisingly, cell viability and epithelial layer integrity
   were compromised by most excipients at concentrations near the typical
   concentration used in vaginal gels, and a significant increase in the
   production of IL-8 was observed at subtoxic concentrations. Within the
   APIs, TMC-120, UC-781, and PMPA showed higher selectivity indices than
   PRO-2000 and GML. In conclusion, identification of safety issues
   concerning the use of pharmaceutical excipients could help to formulate
   less toxic vaginal microbicide preparations.}},

Abstract = {{The Planck experiment will soon provide a very accurate measurement of
   cosmic microwave background anisotropies. This will let cosmologists
   determine most of the cosmological parameters with unprecedented
   accuracy. Future experiments will improve and complement the Planck data
   with better angular resolution and better polarization sensitivity. This
   unexplored region of the CMB power spectrum contains information on many
   parameters of interest, including neutrino mass, the number of
   relativistic particles at recombination, the primordial helium
   abundance, and the injection of additional ionizing photons by dark
   matter self-annihilation. We review the imprint of each parameter on the
   CMB and forecast the constraints achievable by future experiments by
   performing a Monte Carlo analysis on synthetic realizations of simulated
   data. We find that next generation satellite missions such as CMBPol
   could provide valuable constraints with a precision close to that
   expected in current and near future laboratory experiments. Finally, we
   discuss the implications of this intersection between cosmology and
   fundamental physics.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MEDICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study was addressed to assess the clinical characteristics
   of patients presenting with chronic hyperamylasemia unrelated to
   pancreatic diseases (CHUPD). Almost all patients presenting with chronic
   hyperamylasemia undergo expensive, long, difficult, and often
   unnecessarily repeated diagnostic procedures. This is in conjunction
   with the poor knowledge of the fact that besides hyperenzymemia
   secondary to pancreatic diseases and systemic illnesses, various
   non-pathological forms of chronic hyperamylasemia without relevant
   pathologic consequence can occur in clinical practice.
   Material and Methods: Data of all patients with CHUPD were
   retrospectively reviewed (June 1997-December 2009). Fifty one patients
   were included in the study; median follow up was 48 months (range 8-112
   months). Their pre-enrolment diagnoses were: chronic pancreatitis in 31
   cases (60.7\%) and recurrent pancreatitis in 13 cases (25.4\%); the
   remaining 7 patients (13.7\%) were without a specific diagnosis.
   Results: Our observations, supported by diagnostic procedures (Ca19-9
   serum levels, abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and
   magnetic resonance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and
   endoscopic ultrasonography) revealed that CHUPD was secondary to: a)
   benign pancreatic hyperamylasemia, 20 patients (39.2\%); b)
   macroamylasemia, 18 patients (35.2\%) and c) salivary hyperamylasemia,
   13 patients (25.4\%).
   Conclusions: Due to the poor familiarity with CHUPD, the occurrence of
   this condition quite frequently leads to unnecessarily repeated
   diagnostic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{To test the validity of the new diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) in a naturalistic series of patients with mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI). Ninety consecutive MCI patients were enrolled in a
   longitudinal study on the natural history of cognitive impairment.
   Medial temporal (MT) atrophy on MRI was defined as hippocampal volume
   below the fifth percentile of the distribution in healthy elders,
   abnormal CSF was based on Sjogren's cutoffs for Abeta42 and tau, and
   temporoparietal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG PET based on Herholz's t sum
   score. Patients were followed clinically to detect conversion to AD
   (MCI-AD), non-AD dementia (MCI-nAD), or no conversion (MCI-NC). The 24
   MCI-AD and 15 MCI-nAD patients had sociodemographic, clinical, and
   neuropsychological baseline features similar to the 51 MCI-NC patients.
   All MCI patients with MT atrophy converted to AD, as did all those with
   abnormal CSF, but only 48 and 35\% of those without MT atrophy or
   abnormal CSF converted (p on logrank test = 0.0007 and 0.001).
   Prediction of AD conversion was enhanced when positivity to either MT
   atrophy or abnormal CSF was considered, with only 15\% of those MCI
   patients negative on both converting to AD (p < 0.0005). Markers were
   not predictive of non-AD dementia conversion. The accuracy of either MT
   atrophy or abnormal CSF in discriminating MCI-AD from MCI-NC was good
   (AUC 0.82, 95\% CI 0.70-0.95). MT atrophy and abnormal CSF are the
   single most robust predictors of conversion to AD in MCI patients, and
   their combination enhances prediction. AD markers are not predictive of
   conversion to non-AD dementia.}},

   facts suggesting that this gel network is capable of a volume-reducing
   phase-transition (an established physico-chemical phenomenon), which
   could be the motor of the whole-cell ultrastructural compaction. The

Abstract = {{Background Mid-dermal elastolysis (MDE) is a rare disorder of the
   elastic tissue that is characterized histopathologically by selective
   loss of elastic fibres in the mid dermis.
   Objective We aimed to investigate the protein and mRNA expression of
   extracellular matrix-related proteins and growth factors in the skin
   (lesional and non-lesional) of a female patient with the reticular
   variant of MDE.
   Methods Real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry was performed for
   matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase-1, decorin, biglycan, versican, fibronectin, elastin,
   extracellular matrix protein 1, cathepsin G, transforming growth factor
   beta 1 and connective tissue growth factor.
   Results Although protein expression of decorin, biglycan and versican
   was reduced in the mid dermis of lesional skin, mRNA expression did not
   differ between lesional and non-lesional skin. As expected, elastin
   expression was significantly diminished in the mid dermis of lesional
   skin, whereas mRNA expression levels of elastin were equal to
   non-lesional skin. Immunoreactivity of MMP-1 was increased in lesional
   upper and mid dermis. Accordingly, MMP-1 mRNA was also significantly
   higher expressed in MDE when compared with non-lesional skin.
   Conclusions The results of this study confirm data of the previous
   investigations indicating that increased MMP-1 activity followed by
   elastin degradation seems to constitute the pathogenetic background of
   MDE.}},

Abstract = {{Limit and shakedown analysis theorems are the theories of classical
   plasticity for the direct computation of the load-carrying capacity
   under proportional and varying loads. Based on Me lan's theorem, a
   solution procedure for lower bound limit and shakedown analysis of
   three-dimensional (3D) structures is established making use of the
   finite element method (FEM). The self-equilibrium stress fields are
   expressed by linear combination of several basic self-equilibrium stress
   fields with parameters to be determined. These basic self-equilibrium
   stress fields are elastic responses of the body to imposed permanent
   strains obtained through elastic-plastic incremental analysis by the
   three-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM). The Complex method is
   used to solve the resulting nonlinear programming directly and determine
   the maximal load amplifier. The numerical results show that it is
   efficient and accurate to solve three-dimensional limit and shakedown
   analysis problems by using the 3D-FEM and the Complex method. The limit
   analysis is treated here as a special case of shakedown analysis in
   which only proportional loading is considered.}},

Abstract = {{Specific isotopic labelling: a tool to extend the limits of biomolecular
   NMR Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a method of choice to
   study the structural and dynamic properties of biomacromolecules in
   solution at atomic resolution. However, standard NMR techniques are
   characterized by low sensitivity and are limited to biological objects
   of modest size. The development of new specific isotope labeling
   techniques has allowed the limits of biomolecular NMR to be extended in
   recent years. Protocols have been developed to selectively incorporate
   (CH3)-C-13 labeled methyl groups in isoleucine, alanine, methionine,
   leucine and valine amino acids within otherwise perdeuterated proteins.
   These labeling schemes significantly improve the quality of NMR data and
   this gain in sensitivity and resolution allows the characterization of
   the structure and dynamics of molecular interactions within
   supramolecular complexes of up to 1 MDa. Moreover, the improvement in
   sensitivity allows detection of very weak interactions in proteins such
   as nOe between protons separated by more than 10 A or scalar couplings
   of a few tenths or hundredths of a hertz.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, efficient, and simple protocol was developed on in vitro mass
   propagation and acclimatization of Gerbera jamesonii Bolus cv. Sciella,
   an ornamental plant with attractive flowers. Shoot tip was used as the
   primary explant for in vitro establishment in which Murashige and Skoog
   (MS) medium supplemented with a low level of NAA (0.5 mg l(-1)) and BAP
   (1.5 mg l(-1)) promoted earliest axillary bud initiation within 5 d in
   91.6\% of the inoculants. Five axillary buds were initiated from a
   single explant within 13 d after inoculation. A very high rate of shoot
   multiplication (14 shoots per inoculated axillary bud) and proliferation
   was achieved when MS medium was fortified with a relatively higher level
   of BAP (2 mg l(-1)) and 60 mg l(-1) ADS within 27 d of multiple shoot
   culture. A maximum number of well-developed roots per plant was observed
   in MS medium with 0.5 mg l(-1) IAA in the next 26 d. In the easy
   low-cost acclimatization process of 20 d, a combination of sand, soil,
   cow urine, and tea leaves extract (1:1:1:1; v/v) ensured 95\% survival
   rate. Sixty-one well-acclimatized plants were obtained from a single
   shoot tip within 86 d. The sustained multiple shoot culture for 15 mo
   paved the way toward the conservation of genetic resources as well as
   beneficial economics. The clonal fidelity study of micropropagated and
   sustained cultured clones using ISSR primers ensured the continuous
   supply of quality propagules retaining genetic uniformity. The in
   vitro-generated plants performed better over conventionally propagated
   plants in the field condition.}},

Abstract = {{We use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and centrifugation to measure

   water saturation after 300 psi centrifugation effectively represents the
   original water saturation measured by weighing fresh cores. There is a
   good correlation between mobile water saturation and the water
   production performance of the corresponding gas wells. The critical
   mobile water saturation whether reservoir produces water of the Xujiahe
   low permeability sandstone gas is 6\%. The higher the mobile water
   saturation, the greater the water production rate of gas well. This
   indicates that well's water production performance can be forecasted by

Title = {{A Comprehensive Approach to Image Spam Detection: From Server to Client

Abstract = {{Image spam is a type of e-mail spam that embeds spam text content into
   graphical images to bypass traditional text-based e-mail spam filters.
   To effectively detect image spam, it is desirable to leverage image
   content analysis technologies. However, most previous works of image
   spam detection focus on filtering the image spam on the client side. We
   propose a more desirable comprehensive solution which embraces both
   server-side filtering and client-side detection to effectively mitigate
   image spam. On the server side, we present a nonnegative sparsity
   induced similarity measure for cluster analysis of spam images to filter
   the attack activities of spammers and fast trace back the spam sources.
   On the client side, we employ the principle of active learning where the
   learner guides the users to label as few images as possible while
   maximizing the classification accuracy. The server-side filtering
   identifies large image clusters as suspicious spam sources and further
   analysis can be performed to identify the real sources and block them
   from the beginning. For those spam images which survived the server-side
   filter, our active learner on the client side will further guide the
   users to interactively and efficiently filter them out. Our experiments
   on an image spam data-set collected from the e-mail server of our
   department demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed comprehensive
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Pistachio culture is becoming highly interesting in Spain, where
   traditional crops as grape and olive have reduced their profitability.
   However, its expansion is hampered by both the difficulty of propagation
   by grafting of varieties of interest and by the lack of a clonal
   selected rootstock. The application of in vitro culture techniques would
   allow the clonal propagation of Pistacia species, as well as to perform
   in-depth studies of the problems affecting grafting. In vitro techniques
   provide an effective and flexible experimental model that allows us
   monitoring the graft union during the initial stages, when lack of
   affinity symptoms are most likely to appear. In vitro P vera cultures
   were initiated from nodal explants, whereas cultures of P terebinthus
   were initiated from seeds germinated in vitro. The in vitro
   multiplication rate of both species was close to 2 shoots per shoot
   every 3 weeks. A high rooting percentage (82\%) of P terebinthus was
   obtained in a modified WPM medium and plants were successfully
   transplanted to the greenhouse. Shoot apices of P vera of 10-20 mm
   length were grafted in vitro on rooted or unrooted shoots of P
   terebinthus in which the apex was removed and the evolution of the graft
   unions was studied. Over 70\% of the grafted plants survived during the
   firts 3-5 weeks and some plants continued their growth in the
   greenhouse. Similarly, control self-grafted P terebinthus were studied.
   Homografts showed that the technique of grafting in vitro is promising
   but should be improved in future works.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, the Huelva Port Authority in Spain has always found it
   necessary to dredge the harbour seabed in order to ensure that the
   depths can accommodate the ever-increasing sizes of the ships that use
   the port facilities. These days, the presence of pollutants in the
   material that has to be extracted is the main problem for those who
   carry out these activities. The Port of Huelva, which is located in the
   south-west of the Iberian Peninsula, has made it possible to carry out
   the dredging works in spite of the presence of heavy metals in the
   sediments, by using enclosed areas to confine the dredged materials; it
   has even made use of the land created by these deposits to construct the
   new Southern Wharf. This paper is presented in the aforementioned
   context, with a view to providing an account of how the dredged material
   has been managed, providing a specific description of the enclosed areas
   used to confine these materials and how they were subsequently used once
   the enclosed areas were full up.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Extraocular muscles show specific adaptations to fulfill the
   metabolic demands imposed by their constant activity. One aspect that
   has not been explored is the availability of substrate for energy
   pathways in extraocular muscles. In limb muscles, glucose enters by way
   of GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters in a process regulated by insulin and
   contractile activity to match metabolic supply to demand. This mechanism
   may not apply to extraocular muscles because their constant activity may
   require high basal (insulin-and activity-independent) glucose uptake.
   The authors tested the hypothesis that glucose uptake by extraocular
   muscles is not regulated by insulin or contractile activity.
   METHODS. Extraocular muscles from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were
   incubated with 100 nM insulin or were electrically stimulated to
   contract (activity); glucose uptake was measured with
   2-deoxy-d{[}1,2-H-3]glucose. The contents of GLUT1, GLUT4, total and
   phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated AMP-activated
   protein kinase (AMPK), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) underwent
   Western blot analysis. RESULTS. Insulin and activity increased glucose
   uptake over the basal rate to 108\% and 78\%, respectively. GLUT1 and
   GLUT4 were detectable in extraocular muscles. Phosphorylated AKT/total
   AKT increased by twofold after insulin stimulation, but there was no
   change with activity. AMPK phosphorylation increased 35\% with activity.
   Phosphorylated-GSK3/total GSK3 did not change with insulin or activity.
   CONCLUSIONS. Glucose uptake in extraocular muscles is regulated by
   insulin and contractile activity. There is evidence of differences in
   the insulin signaling pathway that may explain the low glycogen content
   in these muscles. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010;51:6364-6368)

Abstract = {{The management of lupus nephritis remains a clinical problem in children
   as in adults. Corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine have
   been used with satisfactory response, but the most important problems
   are their potential toxicities. Therefore, we evaluate the use of
   mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a new agent for treatment of lupus
   nephritis in children. Five children with biopsy-proven proliferative
   glomerulonephritis with active lesions received MMF, combined with
   corticosteroids during the induction phase and alone during the
   maintenance phase. We retrospectively studied the efficacy and safety of
   this therapeutic regimen. All patients had proteinuria and renal
   failure. Four patients from five presented nephrotic syndrome. During
   the induction phase, three patients achieved complete remission of their
   nephrotic syndrome with normalization of renal function. One patient
   achieved partial remission and kept moderate renal failure. One patient
   died at 50 days by severe sepsis secondary to leucopenia. During the
   maintenance phase, three patients had complete remission. One patient
   was kept proteinuria with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL/min/1,73 m(2).
   The growth of these patients is not affected. In childhood lupus
   proliferative glomerulonephritis, MMF was well tolerated, and most of
   the patients achieved remission and improvement of their renal
   functions. (C) 2010 Association Societe de nephrologie. Published by

Abstract = {{The purpose of the paper is two-fold: to introduce a multivariable
   creative telescoping method, and to apply it in a problem of Quantum
   Topology: namely the computation of the non-commutative A-polynomial of
   twist knots.
   Our multivariable creative telescoping method allows us to compute
   linear recursions for sums of the form J(n) = Sigma(k) c(n, k)J(k) given
   a recursion relation for (J(n)) and the hypergeometric kernel c(n, k).
   As an application of our method, we explicitly compute the
   non-commutative A-polynomial for twist knots with -15 and 15 crossings.
   The non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot encodes the monic, linear,
   minimal order q-difference equation satisfied by the sequence of colored
   Jones polynomials of the knot. Its specialization to q - 1 is
   conjectured to be the better-known A-polynomial of a knot, which encodes
   important information about the geometry and topology of the knot
   complement. Unlike the case of the Jones polynomial, which is easily
   computable for knots with 50 crossings, the A-polynomial is harder to
   compute and already unknown for some knots with 12 crossings.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   To calculate total intake of a nutrient and estimate inadequate intake
   for a population, the amounts derived from food/beverages and from
   vitamin/mineral supplements must be combined. The two methods Statistics
   Canada has suggested present problems of interpretation.
   Data and methods
   Data collected from 34,386 respondents to the 2004 Canadian Community
   Health Survey. Nutrition were used to compare four methods of combining
   nutrient intake from food/beverages and vitamin/mineral supplements:
   adding average intake from supplements to the 24-hour food/beverage
   recall and estimating the usual distribution in the population (Method
   1); estimating usual individual intake from food/beverages and adding
   intake from supplements (Method 2); and dividing the population into
   supplement users and non-users and applying Method 1 or Method 2 and
   combining the estimates based on the percentages of users and non-users
   (Methods 3 and 4).
   Results
   Interpretation problems arise with Methods 1 and 2; for example, the
   percentage of the population with inadequate intake of vitamin C and
   folate equivalents falls outside the expected minimum-maximum range.
   These interpretation problems are not observed with Methods 3 and 4.
   Interpretation
   Interpretation problems that may arise in combining food and supplement
   intake of a given nutrient are overcome if the population is divided
   into supplement users and non-users before Method 1 or Method 2 is
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an experimental procedure to analyze the spatial
   proximity of nuclear matrix-bound DNA fragments. This protocol, referred
   to as Matrix 3C (M3C), includes a high salt extraction of nuclei, the
   removal of distal parts of unfolded DNA loops using restriction enzyme
   treatment, ligation of the nuclear matrix-bound DNA fragments and a
   subsequent analysis of ligation frequencies. Using the M3C procedure, we
   have demonstrated that CpG islands of at least three housekeeping genes
   that surround the chicken alpha-globin gene domain are assembled into a
   complex (presumably, a transcription factory) that is stabilized by the
   nuclear matrix in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. In erythroid
   cells, the regulatory elements of the alpha-globin genes are attracted
   to this complex to form a new assembly: an active chromatin hub that is
   linked to the pre-existing transcription factory. The erythroid-specific
   part of the assembly is removed by high salt extraction. Based on these
   observations, we propose that mixed transcription factories that mediate
   the transcription of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes are
   composed of a permanent compartment containing integrated into the
   nuclear matrix promoters of housekeeping genes and a `guest' compartment
   where promoters and regulatory elements of tissue-specific genes can be
   temporarily recruited.}},

Abstract = {{Background Genetic factors alter the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver
   disease (NAFLD). We sought to identify NAFLD-associated genes and
   elucidate gene networks and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of
   NAFLD.
   Methods Quantitative global hepatic gene expression analysis was
   performed on 53 morbidly obese Caucasian subjects undergoing bariatric
   surgery (27 with NAFLD and 26 controls). After standardization of data,
   gene expression profiles were compared between patients with NAFLD and
   controls. The set of genes that significantly correlated with NAFLD was
   further analyzed by hierarchical clustering and ingenuity pathways
   analyses.
   Results There were 25,643 quantitative transcripts, of which 108 were
   significantly associated with NAFLD (p < 0.001). Canonical pathway
   analysis in the NAFLD-associated gene clusters showed that the hepatic
   fibrosis signaling was the most significant pathway in the up-regulated
   NAFLD gene cluster containing three (COL1A1, IL10, IGFBP3) significantly
   altered genes, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum stress and protein
   ubiquitination pathways were the most significant pathways in the
   down-regulated NAFLD gene cluster, with the first pathway containing one
   (HSPA5) and the second containing two (HSPA5, USP25) significantly
   altered genes. The four primary gene networks associated with NAFLD were
   involved in cell death, immunological disease, cellular movement, and
   lipid metabolism with several significantly altered ``hub{''} genes in
   these networks.
   Conclusions This study reveals the canonical pathways and gene networks
   associated with NAFLD in morbidly obese Caucasians. The application of
   gene network analysis highlights the transcriptional relationships among
   NAFLD-associated genes and allows identification of hub genes that may
   represent high-priority candidates for NAFLD.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge for trade unions is how to reposition themselves in
   order to counter the structural power of transnational capital. Unions
   seek this repositioning against the background of globalization and a
   new politico-economic order that is largely engineered by neoliberal
   nation-states and multinational capital. The agenda for renewal has,
   however, so far been confined largely within the national state, thus
   offering little effective challenge to internationally organized

Abstract = {{Magnetic field line reconnection is still considered, by some, to be one
   of the most important topics in plasma physics. It has been in this
   category for close to 30 years and the `problem of reconnection' has
   still not been solved. Magnetic field topologies are part and parcel of
   the current systems within a plasma whatever their source. Plasma
   currents may initially be induced or injected but they soon become
   entangled or part of the currents of plasma waves, flows and structures.
   We first present experimental results of undriven reconnection, which
   occurs when two magnetic flux ropes are generated from initially
   adjacent pulsed current channels in a background magnetoplasma (length
   18 m, diameter 60 cm). The second example presented is the
   three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields and currents associated with
   colliding laser-produced plasmas. The currents in this situation are
   those of shear Alfven waves. The wave magnetic field is a small fraction
   of the background field; nevertheless, reconnection regions, multiple
   magnetic `X' points (which are 3D) and induced electric fields are
   observed. The first involves the interaction of magnetic flux ropes and
   the second localized reconnection sites in the current system of Alfven
   waves.}},

Abstract = {{In his work on the epistemology of testimony, Peter Lipton developed an
   account of testimonial inference that aimed at descriptive adequacy as
   well as justificatory sophistication. According to `testimonial
   inference to the best explanation' (TIBE), we accept what a speaker
   tells us because the truth of her claim figures in the best explanation
   of the fact that she made it. In this paper, I argue for a modification
   of this picture. In particular, I argue that IBE plays a dual role in
   the management and justification of testimony. On the one hand, the
   coherence and success of our testimony-based projects provides general
   abductive support for a default stance of testimonial acceptance; on the
   other hand, we are justified in rejecting specific testimonial claims
   whenever the best explanation of the instances of testimony we encounter
   entails, or makes probable, the falsity or unreliability of the
   testimony in question. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sugar from sugarcane represents 65-70\% of the world production of sugar
   and its production is mainly located in developing countries. The
   production process requires high amounts of steam and electricity at the
   different stages, and generates important quantities of residues. A
   major residue of the sugar production is filter cake (in Cuba: Cachaza),
   the residue from cane juice filtration. Filter cake causes significant
   pollution, and in several sugar factories it is considered a waste,
   posing problems of management and final disposal. This paper reviews
   recycling and recovery opportunities of filter cake (and bagasse) and
   experimentally studies the use of filter cake as fuel at the sugar
   factory. Filter cake may e. g. be used as a fertilizer/soil improver
   directly applied on the fields or after composting. During its
   decomposition, it generates, however, an acid leachate and emits
   significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Moreover, the experimental part
   of the paper shows that blends of filter cake with bagasse can be
   combusted in industrial boilers in sugar factories, and that loose,
   non-vitrified ashes with a similar appearance as bagasse ash are
   obtained. This results in lower volumes and masses of residues to be
   transported, so that transportation costs are reduced. Moreover, it
   gives a new economic value to the filter cake, and reduces its
   environmental impact. When all filter cake would be combusted blended
   with bagasse, about 25\% more ash would be obtained than for bagasse and
   the trace element composition would comply with the regulatory limits
   for use as fertilizer/soil improver.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has relied on 2
   antimicrobial agents, metronidazole and vancomycin, since the
   recognition of this disease entity. While effective, these ``inside the
   box{''} approaches to CDI management have the disadvantage of further
   microbial disruption of the host indigenous microflora. ``Outside the
   box{''} therapies use non-antimicrobial approaches to management and are
   theoretically less prone to causing recurrent CDI episodes. Recent
   advances in understanding of ``inside the box{''} approaches include
   appreciation of the decreased efficacy of metronidazole overall and the
   superior efficacy of vancomycin for treatment of severe CDI, as well as
   a new agent under development, fidaxomicin, which appears to be equal in
   efficacy to vancomycin but with less risk of subsequent CDI recurrences.
   Several ``outside the box{''} approaches have also entered clinical
   development, including use of monoclonal antibodies, active vaccination,
   luminal toxin binders, and nontoxigenic C. difficile. These reports
   provide optimism that more-effective management of CDI is forthcoming.}},

Abstract = {{Direct compositionality is a property of empirical data (and of

   reliably computed from the meanings of its parts (Jacobson 2002). Using
   empirical data from Kam and Northern Zhuang, two Kam-Tai languages
   spoken in the P. R. of China, I define the notions of compositional and
   constructional reduplication rules. A rule is compositional if the host
   construction does not manifest selectional restrictions on the embedded
   output of the rule. By contrast, a reduplication rule is constructional
   if there are selectional restrictions. Based on the descriptive insights
   of this study and on Jacobson's two types of (direct) compositionality,
   I define four different degrees of compositionality that a
   morphosyntactic operation may exhibit: strong compositionality, weak
   compositionality, weak constructionality (non-compositionality) and
   strong constructionality.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystal (NC) films have been proposed as an alternative to bulk
   semiconductors for electronic applications such as solar cells and
   photodetectors. One outstanding challenge in NC electronics is to
   robustly control the carrier type to create stable p-n

   addition of Cd to InAs nanocrystals switches the resulting InAs:Cd NC
   films from n-type to p-type when operating in a field effect transistor.
   This method presents a stable, facile way to control the carrier type of
   InAs nanocrystals prior to deposition. We present two mechanisms to
   explain the observed switch in carrier type. In mechanism 1, Cd atoms
   are incorporated at In sites in the lattice and act as acceptor defects,
   forming a partially compensated p-type semiconductor. In mechanism 2, Cd
   atoms passivate donor-type InAs surface states and create acceptor-type
   surface states. This work represents a critical step toward the creation
   of p-n homojunction-based NC electronics.}},

Abstract = {{One of the best approaches for modeling large deformation of shells is
   the Cosserat surface. However, the finite-element implementation of this
   model suffers from membrane and shear locking, especially for very thin
   shells. The basic assumption of this theory is that the mid-surface of
   the shell is regarded as a Cosserat surface with one inextensible
   director. In this paper, it is shown that by constraining the director
   vector normal to the mid-surface, besides very good and accurate
   results, shear locking is also eliminated. This constraint is in fact a
   limiting analysis of the Cosserat theory in which Kirichhoff's
   hypothesis is enforced. Numerical solution is performed using nine-node
   isoparametric element. The principal of virtual work is used to obtain
   the weak form of the governing differential equations and the material
   and geometric stiffness matrices are derived through a linearization
   process. The validity and the accuracy of the method are illustrated by
   numerical examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cognitive model of OCD proposes that certain beliefs may contribute
   to the development and maintenance of this disorder. To date, however,
   it is not yet clear which beliefs are more relevant for explaining OCD
   symptomatology; moreover, their causal status is yet to be clearly
   established. In the effort to identify other constructs and processes
   related to OCD, the phenomenon labeled ``not just right experiences{''}
   (NJREs) has received increasing attention. In this study, measures of
   NJREs (the NJRE-Q-R), OCD symptoms, general distress (i.e., anxiety, and
   depression), and perfectionism were administered to a large sample of
   college students and a small sample of OCD and non-OCD patients. The
   clinical sample also completed a measure of OC beliefs. Results showed
   that NJREs could be reliably measured through a self-report format in
   non-clinical and clinical Italian individuals. A specific association
   between NJREs severity and OCD symptoms was found in the non-clinical
   sample, after controlling for anxiety, depression, and perfectionism.
   The NJRE-Q-R Severity scale clearly discriminated OCD patients from
   patients with other anxiety disorders or depression. Lastly, the NJREs
   measure differentiated the clinical groups when OC beliefs were
   controlled, whereas OC beliefs did not discriminate among the groups
   after NJREs severity was controlled. The concept of NJREs may contribute
   to improve current psychological and biological model of OCD. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Because vowels in English are largely distinguished by the frequencies
   of their first two formants (F1, F2), the division of the (F2, F1) plane
   is an important and quantifiable component of accents. We report results
   of a web-based study into some of the many accents of English.
   Participants identified the vowel in h{[}vowel]d words produced by
   synthesis from a large set of possible values of F1, F2 and F3, using
   two different fundamental frequencies and two different durations.
   Compared to analysing spoken utterances, this approach has a number of
   obvious disadvantages, which we discuss. It has the significant
   advantages, however, of low cost, large scale and wide-ranging
   international participation. It is then possible to use the same
   experimental protocol to characterise the (perceptual) vowel plane of a
   substantial number of subjects and accents, thus allowing simple
   comparisons. From the large data base thus acquired, we present four
   examples of vowel maps for different Anglophone countries and regions
   therein. Knowledge of local variations in the perceptual (F2, F1) map,
   and the way in which these depend on fundamental frequency f(0), is not
   only of phonetic interest, but may be useful to those who use synthetic
   speech in automated communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer found in
   a variety of polyvinyl chloride medical products Although DEHP-induced
   cytotoxicity and apoptosis are well studied in various cell types the
   precise mechanisms are not well understood so far This study aimed at
   going beyond the toxicology approach focuses on the molecular mechanisms
   through which DEHP causes hepatotoxicity We show that DEHP induces
   apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner as proven by an Increase
   in annexin V positively stained cells DAPI/PI staining and
   immunofluorescence studies The DEHP-induced decrease in cell viability
   was significantly inhibited by adding catalase (CAT) but CAT treatment
   did not suppress the DEHP stimulated calcium flux in the hepatocytes
   whereas BAPTA-AM significantly reduced the DEHP-stimulated DCF intensity
   These results demonstrate that DEHP increases the intracellular calcium
   level which mediates the generation of H2O2 in hepatocytes Investigating
   cell signaling mechanisms we found that DEHP induced apoptotic cell
   death by mitochondrial-dependent caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage
   These changes due to DEHP exposure were associated with increased IKK
   and NF kappa B phosphorylation Preexposure of hepatocytes to an IKK
   inhibitor (PS-1145) prevented DEHP-induced caspase 3 and PARP cleavage
   DEHP also markedly increased the activity of ERK1/2 MAPK Pretreatment
   with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 attenuated NF kappa B and IKK
   phosphorylation indicating that ERK MAPK is mainly involved in DEHP
   induced NF-kappa B activation These results for the first time reveal
   that DEHP induces apoptosis in hepatocytes via the activation of the
   ERK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in which calcium ions and hydrogen
   peroxide act as the pivotal mediators of the apoptone signaling (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We discuss a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology for
   rock slope instability assessment based on geometrical relationships
   between topographic slopes and structural discontinuities in rocks. The
   methodology involves (a) regionalization of point observations of
   orientations (azimuth and dip) of structural discontinuities in rocks in
   order to generate a digital structural model (DStM), (b) testing the
   kinematical possibility of specific modes of rock slope failures by
   integrating DStMs and digital elevation model (DEM)-derived slope and
   aspect data and (c) computation of stability scenarios with respect to
   identified rock slope failure modes. We tested the methodology in an
   area of 90 km(2) in Darjeeling Himalaya (India) and in a small portion
   (9 km(2)) within this area with higher density of field structural
   orientation data. The results of the study show better classification of
   rock slope instability in the smaller area with respect to known
   occurrences of deep-seated rockslides than with respect to shallow
   translational rockslides, implying that structural control is more
   important for deep-seated rockslides than for shallow translational
   rockslides. Results of scenario-based analysis show that, in rock slopes
   classified to be unstable, stress-induced rock slope instability tends
   to increase with increasing level of water saturation. The study
   demonstrates the usefulness of spatially distributed data of
   orientations of structural discontinuities in rocks for medium-to
   small-scale classification of rock slope instability in mountainous
   terrains. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Chain of Hardy-type local reality constraints for n qubits}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nonlocality without inequality is an elegant argument introduced by
   Hardy for two qubit systems, and later generalised to n qubits, to
   establish contradiction of quantum theory with local realism.
   Interestingly, for n = 2 this argument is actually a corollary of
   Bell-type inequalities, viz., the CH-Hardy inequality involving Bell
   correlations, but for n greater than two it involves n-particle
   probabilities more general than Bell-correlations. In this paper, we
   first derive a chain of completely new local realistic inequalities
   involving joint probabilities for n qubits and then associated with each
   such inequality, we provide a new Hardy-type local reality constraint
   without inequalities. Quantum mechanical maximal violations of the chain
   of inequalities and of the associated constraints are also studied by
   deriving appropriate Cirel'son-type theorems. These results involving
   joint probabilities more general than Bell correlations are expected to
   provide a new systematic tool to investigate entanglement. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Most of the irrigation systems in India, whether large or small, are
   reported to have problems relating to the management of irrigation
   system at grass-root level. Therefore, a solution that has been tried in
   various places is irrigation management transfer to water user groups.
   However, group dynamics plays a pivotal role in the functioning of
   groups in an efficient manner. The present study was conducted to study
   the group dynamics effectiveness of water users' associations (WUAs)
   under different irrigation systems in the state of Orissa, India. A
   group dynamics effectiveness index (GDEI) was formulated to measure
   group effectiveness of selected WUAs, which included 10 parameters. The
   study was carried out following an interview survey of 159 farmers
   representing eight WUAs under different irrigation systems. All 10
   parameters of the GDEI were highly regarded by the farmers of lift
   irrigation WUAs, except social support. Most of the parameters of group
   effectiveness were found to be high in the case of minor irrigation
   WUAs. Farmers of major irrigation WUAs have perceived many of the
   parameters (participation, decision-making procedure, group atmosphere,
   empathy, interpersonal trust and social support) to be weak.
   Differential group effectiveness may be attributed to the temporal and
   spatial variation in the irrigation command areas under the group's
   jurisdiction. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities of ancient banded iron formation ranges of South
   Western Australia occur as islands in a matrix of the largest remaining
   area of Mediterranean woodlands and shrub lands on the planet. These
   xeric shrub lands are structurally and compositionally different from
   the surrounding matrix and exhibit high levels of endemism and species
   turnover that cannot be ascribed to geology or current climatic
   gradients. The pattern of the vegetation and flora on these ranges
   appears to be related to local topographical factors and the long period
   of time these landscapes have remained unglaciated and above sea level.
   Similar patterns have recently been described for iron outcrop
   communities in Brazil. In both regions these communities are being
   significantly impacted by mining. The high correlation between local
   endemism and restricted plant communities and high grade mineral
   deposits presents difficult challenges for achieving a comprehensive,
   adequate and representative reserve system in South Western Australia.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the claim that social policy retrenchment has
   tremendous electoral consequences. It analyzes the electoral impact of
   social policy attitudes in a comparative design (20 elections in Western
   OECD countries between 2001 and 2006). I find that punishment is
   conditional on the performance of governments, indicating that people
   punish or reward a government for its past actions. However, empirical
   comparison shows this to be true not only for social policy, but for all
   types of issues. This study shows that social policy does not have the
   outstanding relevance for voters as assumed by the social policy
   literature; accordingly, the electoral impact is only limited and not
   equally strong in all contexts. The context shapes the link between
   social policy attitudes and vote choice, but the variance in effect
   strength is not explained by differences in the institutional setting or
   the campaign saliency of social policy. Comparative European Politics

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological
   care needs of cancer patients throughout the healthcare process: after
   diagnosis, after medical treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy)
   and during follow-up.
   Method: A total of 703 ambulatory cancer patients were assessed in this
   study. The inclusion period was from April 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007.
   The first psychological scales used were the 14-item Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scales (HADS), which has two sub-scales for anxiety (7
   items) and for depression (7 items). All patients with a score >= 14
   were assessed through the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatric
   Disorder (SCID-I) of the DSM-IV. All data were compared with
   sociodemographic and medical characteristics.
   Results: Of the 703 cancer patients in the study, 349 were men and 354
   women, with a mean age of 53 years. The median time between the cancer
   diagnosis and our clinical interview was 6 months (range, 12 days to 190
   months). Overall, the screening tools indicated that one in four
   patients needed psychological care. The most common psychiatric
   diagnosis was adjustment disorder (129 cases), whereas 10 patients were
   diagnosed with major depression. Using a HADS cut-off score of >7 for
   anxiety and depression, 28\% and 17\% of patients, respectively, were
   classified as ``possible clinical cases. ``Risk factors for distress
   included age <65 years, asthenia, constipation, and a low performance
   status. However, chemotherapy treatment was found to be a protector
   against distress in cancer patients.
   Significance of Results: Chemotherapy treatment is interpreted by the
   patients as a protector against cancer, thereby reducing distress
   levels.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{A reduction in congruency effects under working memory (WM) load has
   been previously described using different attentional paradigms (e.g.,
   Kim, Kim, \& Chun, 2005; Smilek, Enns, Eastwood, \& Merikle, 2006). One
   hypothesis is that different types of WM load have different effects on
   attentional selection, depending on whether a specific memory load
   demands resources in common with target or distractor processing. In
   particular, if information in WM is related to the distractors in the
   selective attention task, there is a reduction in distraction (Kim et
   al., 2005). However, although previous results seem to point to a
   decrease in interference under high WM load conditions (Kim et al.,
   2005), the lack of a neutral baseline for the congruency effects makes
   it difficult to differentiate between a decrease in interference or in
   facilitation. In the present work we included neutral trials in the task
   introduced by Kim et al. (2005) and tested normal participants and
   traumatic brain injury patients. Results support a reduction in the
   processing of distractors under WM load, at least for incongruent trials
   in both groups. Theoretical as well as applied implications are
   discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Regulators in different countries and domains experiment with regulatory
   tools that allow organizations to adapt regulation to their individual
   circumstances, while holding them accountable for their self-regulation
   systems. Several labels have been coined for this type of regulation,
   including systems-based regulation, enforced self-regulation,
   management-based regulation, principles-based regulation, and
   meta-regulation. In this article, these forms of regulatory governance
   are classified as belonging to one family of ``process-oriented
   regulation.{''} Based on a review of diverse empirical and theoretical
   research, it is suggested that the family of process-oriented regulation
   tends to have a positive, albeit varied, impact on organizations'
   performance, and the factors that shape this inconsistent effect are
   analyzed. Building on aspects of Parker's normative construct of
   ``meta-regulation,{''} the article explores the extent to which her
   innovative notion of a learning-oriented approach to regulation might
   overcome some of the weaknesses of prevalent process-oriented
   approaches. It is proposed that under conditions of regulatory
   uncertainty or entrenched and prevalent non-compliance or both,
   meta-regulation is likely to have many advantages over other forms of
   process-oriented regulation. Yet realizing these advantages requires a
   rare combination of high regulatory capacity, a stable regulatory
   agenda, and a supportive political environment.}},

Abstract = {{Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common malignancy in
   young men. However, there are few in vivo animal models that have been
   developed to study this disease. We have used the pufferfish (fugu)

   been shown to enforce high-level expression in the testes of transgenic
   mice, to express Simian virus 40 large T-antigen in zebrafish testes.
   Zebrafish that express T-antigen develop TGCTs after a long latency of
   >1 year. Although overt TGCTs are only evident in 20\% of the fish,
   occult TGCTs can be detected in 90\% of the transgenic fish by 36 month
   of age. The TGCTs resemble the human disease in terms of morphology and
   gene expression pattern, and can be transplanted to healthy wild-type
   recipient fish. In addition, enforced expression of the zebrafish stem

Title = {{Interpretation of capillary zone electrophoresis compared with cellulose
   acetate and agarose gel electrophoresis: reference intervals and
   diagnostic efficiency in dogs and cats}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Serum protein electrophoresis is widely used for diagnostic and research
   purposes. Cellulose acetate (CAE) and agarose gel (AGE) electrophoresis
   are the most frequently used methods, but capillary zone electrophoresis
   (CZE) is beginning to be used more in veterinary laboratories. However,
   reference intervals for CZE in animals and comparison studies with the
   other electrophoretic techniques are lacking, compromising the
   diagnostic utility of CZE.
   Objectives
   The aims of this study were to compare results obtained using CAE, AGE,
   and CZE; to establish reference intervals for CZE in dogs and cats; and
   to assess the capacity of CZE to detect abnormalities identified by AGE.
   Methods
   Serum samples from 204 dogs, including 104 healthy animals, and 62 cats,
   including 28 healthy animals, were analyzed using automated systems for
   CAE, AGE, and CZE. Descriptive statistics and Passing-Bablok and
   Bland-Altman tests were used to compare results. For each technique,
   reference intervals were calculated based on results from healthy
   animals. Concordance between CZE and AGE in detecting pathologic changes
   was assessed using Cohen's k coefficient.
   Results
   For most protein fractions, values obtained by CAE, AGE, and CZE were
   significantly different from each other, and constant and proportional
   errors were often detected. Nevertheless, reference intervals obtained
   by the 3 techniques overlapped. Moreover, Cohen's k coefficient
   demonstrated that the capacity of CZE and AGE to detect pathologic
   changes was comparable.
   Conclusions
   CZE performs comparably to AGE and CAE as long as CZE-specific reference
   intervals are used for interpretation and distinctive visual patterns
   for albumin, gaps between fractions, and subpeaks found on CZE tracings
   are recognized. In addition, CZE offers several technical advantages,
   such as ease of use and complete automation.}},

Abstract = {{TIMBRE HAS BEEN CONCEIVED OF AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL sensory attribute and
   as a carrier of perceptually useful information about the mechanics of
   the sound source. To date, research on musical timbre has focused on
   defining its acoustical correlates, whereas fragmentary evidence is
   available on the influence of mechanical parameters. We quantified the
   extent to which mechanical properties of the sound source are associated
   with structures in the data from published identification and
   dissimilarity-rating studies. We focus on two macroscopic mechanical
   properties: the musical instrument family and excitation type.
   Identification confusions are significantly more frequent for
   same-family instruments. With dissimilarity ratings, same-family or
   same-excitation tones are judged more similar and tend to occupy the
   same region of multidimensional-scaling spaces. As such, significant
   associations between the perception of musical timbre and the mechanics
   of the sound source emerge even when not explicitly demanded by the
   task.}},

Abstract = {{Giuliodori MJ, Lujan HL, Janbaih H, DiCarlo SE. How does a hopping
   kangaroo breathe? Adv Physiol Educ 34: 228-232, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/advan.00050.2010.-We developed a model to demonstrate how a
   hopping kangaroo breathes. Interestingly, a kangaroo uses less energy to
   breathe while hopping than while standing still. This occurs, in part,
   because rather than using muscle power to move air into and out of the
   lungs, air is pulled into (inspiration) and pushed out of (expiration)
   the lungs as the abdominal organs ``flop{''} within the kangaroo's body.
   Specifically, as the kangaroo hops upward, the abdominal organs lag
   behind, and the insertion of the diaphragm is pulled toward its origin,
   flattening the dome and increasing the vertical dimension of the
   thoracic cavity (the thoracic cavity and lungs enlarge). Increasing the
   volume of the thoracic cavity reduces alveolar pressure below
   atmospheric pressure (barometric pressure), and air moves into the
   alveoli by bulk flow. In contrast, the impact of the organs against the
   diaphragm at each landing causes expiration. Specifically, upon landing,
   the abdominal organs flop into the diaphragm, causing it to return to
   its dome shape and decreasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic
   cavity. This compresses the alveolar gas volume and elevates alveolar
   pressure above barometric pressure, so air is expelled. To demonstrate
   this phenomenon, the plunger of a syringe model of the respiratory
   system was inserted through a compression spring. Holding the syringe
   and pressing the plunger firmly against a hard surface expels air from
   the lungs (the balloon within the syringe deflates) and compresses the
   spring. This models the kangaroo landing after a hop forward.
   Subsequently, the compression spring provides the energy for the
   ``kangaroo{''} to ``hop{''} forward upon the release of the syringe, and
   air enters the lungs (the balloon within the syringe inflates). The
   model accurately reflects how a hopping kangaroo breathes. A model was
   chosen to demonstrate this phenomenon because models engage and inspire
   students as well as significantly enhance student understanding.}},

Title = {{Delayed Foreign-body Reaction to Absorbable Implants in Metacarpal
   Fracture Treatment}},

Abstract = {{Background First-generation bioabsorbable implants have been associated
   with a high complication rate attributable to weak mechanical properties
   and rapid degradation. This has led to the development of stronger
   devices with improved durability. However, the modern implants have
   raised concerns about potential late-occurring adverse reactions.
   Questions/purposes This retrospective study addressed the following
   questions: Can absorbable implants consisting of trimethylene carbonate,
   L-lactide, and D, L-lactide provide adequate fixation for healing of a
   metacarpal fracture? Will these implants obviate a second removal
   operation? What complications can occur in the reaction to implant
   breakdown?
   Patients and Methods Twelve unstable, displaced, metacarpal fractures
   were studied in 10 consecutive patients (seven men, three women; mean
   age, 36.4 years; range, 18-75 years). The fractures were treated with
   absorbable plates and screws consisting of the aforementioned copolymers
   and designed to resorb in 2 to 4 years. Nine patients (10 fractures)
   were available for clinical and radiographic followups (mean, 45.7
   months; range, 34-61 months).
   Results Fracture healing was uneventful in all cases. Four patients
   experienced a foreign-body reaction during the second postoperative year
   and required surgical de `bridement to remove implant remnants.
   Histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of a foreign-body
   reaction. Two other patients reported a transient local swelling that
   subsided without treatment.
   Conclusions Our results indicate these absorbable implants for
   metacarpal fractures achieved adequate bone healing but simply postponed
   the problem of foreign-body reactions. Patients treated with
   bioabsorbable implants should be advised of potential late complications
   and should be followed for at least 2 years, possibly longer.}},

   investigate the process of self-selected recovery in a multiple sprint
   test with a view to using self-selected recovery time as a means of
   reliably quantifying an individual's ability to resist fatigue in this
   type of exercise. Twenty physically active exercise science students
   (means +/- SD for age, height, body mass, body fat, and (V) over
   dotO(2)max of the subjects were 21 +/- 2 yr, 1.79 +/- 0.09 m, 83.7 +/-
   10.8 kg, 16.6 +/- 3.9\%, and 52.7 +/- 7.2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1),
   respectively) completed 4 trials of a 12 x 30 m multiple sprint running
   test under the instruction that they should allow sufficient recovery
   time between sprints to enable maximal sprint performance to be
   maintained throughout each trial. Mean recovery times across the 4
   trials were 73.9 +/- 24.7, 82.3 +/- 23.8, 77.6 +/- 19.1, and 77.5 +/-
   13.9 seconds, respectively, with variability across the first 3 trials
   considered evidence of learning effects. Test-retest reliability across
   trials 3 to 4 revealed a good level of reliability as evidenced by a
   coefficient of variation of 11.1\% (95\% likely range: 8.0-18.1\%) and
   an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.76 (95\% likely range:
   0.40-0.91). Despite no change in sprint performance throughout the
   trials, ratings of perceived exertion increased progressively and
   significantly (p < 0.001) from a value of 10 +/- 2 after sprint 3 to 14
   +/- 2 after sprint 12. The correlation between relative (V) over
   dotO(2)max and mean recovery time was 0.14 (95\% likely range:
   20.37-0.58). The results of the present study show that after the
   completion of 2 familiarization trials, the ability to maintain
   sprinting performance in a series of repeated sprints can be
   self-regulated by an athlete to a high degree of accuracy without the
   need for external timepieces.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Some musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity are
   not readily classified. The study objective was to determine if there
   were symptom patterns in self-identified repetitive strain injury (RSI)
   patients. Methods Members (n = 700) of the Dutch RSI Patients
   Association filled out a detailed symptom questionnaire. Factor analysis
   followed by cluster analysis grouped correlated symptoms. Results Eight
   clusters, based largely on symptom severity and quality were formulated.
   All but one cluster showed diffuse symptoms; the exception was
   characterized by bilateral symptoms of stiffness and aching pain in the
   shoulder/neck. Conclusions Case definitions which localize upper
   extremity musculoskeletal disorders to a specific anatomical area may be
   incomplete. Future clustering studies should rely on both signs and
   symptoms. Data could be collected from health care providers
   prospectively to determine the possible prognostic value of the
   identified clusters with respect to natural history, chronicity, and
   return to work.}},

Abstract = {{The current injection properties of gold contacts fitted to hydrazone
   doped polyesters (HDPs) have been investigated using a series of
   thin-film Au/HDP/Al diode structures. Current voltage characteristics of
   the HDP diodes recorded over a range of temperatures suggest that the
   measured injection is controlled by interface states which assist in the
   transfer of hole charge between the Au electrode and highest occupied
   molecular orbital (HOMO) of the hydrazone. Injection assistance occurs
   due to the energetic location of the interface states which are
   estimated to lie between the Fermi energy of the Au and the HOMO of the
   hydrazone. The density of the interface states is found to be
   independent of the hydrazone doping concentration used in the diodes and
   is calculated to be about 3 x 10(16) cm(-3). The available density of
   interface states which participate in the injection process may be
   progressively reduced through exposure of the Au electrode to increasing
   amounts of ultraviolet radiation. The diminished current injection
   following ultraviolet exposure is fully restored after a sufficiently
   long recovery period of several hundred days at room temperature. A
   charge transfer model that involves depopulation of the interface states
   to nearby hydrazone sites is proposed to explain the ultraviolet
   phenomena. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we apply state-of-the-art electronic-structure-based
   computational methods based on hybrid-exchange density functional theory
   to study the mechanism of the aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons
   catalysed by Mn-doped nanoporous aluminophosphates (Mn-AlPOs). We
   compare our results with available experimental data. We show that the
   catalytic efficiency of Mn-AlPOs in oxidation reactions is intrinsically
   linked to 1) the Mn redox activity, in particular between 2+ and 3+
   oxidation states, and 2) the coordinative insaturation of tetrahedral Mn
   embedded in AlPO frameworks, which facilitates the reaction by
   stabilising oxo-type radicals through the formation of Mn complexes. Our
   mechanism demonstrates the crucial role of both Mn-III and Mn-II in the
   reaction mechanism: Mn-III sites undergo an initial reaction cycle that
   leads to the production of the alkyl hydroperoxide intermediate, which
   can only be transformed into the oxidative products (alcohol, aldehyde
   and acid) by Mn-II. A preactivation step is required to yield the
   reduced Mn-II sites able to decompose the hydroperoxide intermediates;
   this step takes place through a transformation of the hydrocarbon into
   the corresponding peroxoderivative, stabilised by forming a complex with
   Mn-III and yielding at the same time reduced Mn-II sites. Both species
   enter a subsequent propagation cycle in which Mn-II catalyses the
   dissociation of the hydroperoxide that proceeds until the formation of
   the oxidative products by two parallel pathways, through alkoxy- or
   hydroxy-radical-like intermediates, whilst the Mn-III-peroxo complex
   enables further production of the hydroperoxide intermediate.}},

Abstract = {{Zebrafish is one of the most used vertebrate model organisms in

   zebrafish as a model species in nutritional studies in aquaculture in
   order to utilize the methodological toolbox that this species represents
   As a starting point to acquire some baseline data for further
   nutritional studies, growth of a population of zebrafish was followed
   for 15 weeks Furthermore, whole body proteome was screened during
   development by means of bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass
   spectrometry Fish were reared under best practice laboratory conditions
   from hatching until 103 days post-fertilization (dpf) and regularly fed
   ad libitum with Anemia nauplii from 12 dpf A growth burst occurred
   within 9-51 dpf, reaching a plateau after 65 dpf Fork length and body
   weight were significantly lower in males than in females from 58 dpf
   onwards Proteorims analysis showed 28 spot proteins differently
   expressed through development and according to sex Of these proteins, 20
   were successfully identified revealing proteins involved in energy
   production, muscle development, eye lens differentiation, and sexual
   maturation In summary, zebrafish exhibited a rapid growth until
   approximately 50 dpf, when most individuals started to allocate part of
   the dietary energy intake for sexual maturation However, proteomic
   analysis revealed that some individuals reached sexual maturity earlier
   and already from 30 dpf onwards Thus, in order to design nutritional
   studies with zebrafish fed Anemia nauplii, it is recommended to select a
   period between 20 and 40 dpf, when fish allocate most of the Ingested
   energy for non-reproductive growth purposes}},

Abstract = {{Talipexole is a non-ergot dopamine (DA) agonist that has been used in
   the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we examined
   the effect of talipexole on paraquat (PQ)-induced N27 cell death and the
   intracellular pathways involved in this effect. Pretreatment of N27
   cells with talipexole (1 mM) resulted in significant protection against
   paraquat-induced cell death. In N27 cells, talipexole inhibited
   paraquat-induced apoptotic hallmarks such as cytochrome c release,
   caspase-3 activation, chromatin condensation and externalization of
   phosphatidilserine. Talipexole pretreatment prevents the reduction in
   the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein and increases in the pro-apoptotic
   form of Bak and p-Bad, both induced by PQ. Finally, we also observed
   that talipexole abrogates the activation of cell death pathways JNK1/2
   and p38 produced by PQ and increases the phosphorylated (active) forms
   of the pro-survival pathways ERK1/2 and Akt. These results reveal that
   talipexole exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mesencephalic cell line
   exposed to the neurotoxin PQ which is related to the etiology of
   Parkinson's disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a great concern by the emergence and the wide dissemination of
   extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among animal Escherichia coli
   isolates. We intended to determinate the carriage level and type of
   ESBLs in E. coli obtained from fecal samples from pigs raised on an
   intensive pig farm in Portugal; further to characterize other associated
   resistance genes and their plasmid content, the phylogenetic groups, and
   the clonal relationship of ESBL-positive isolates. Sixty-five fecal
   samples were seeded in Levine media supplemented with cefotaxime for E.
   coli recovery. Susceptibility to 16 antimicrobial agents was performed
   by disk diffusion agar. ESBL-phenotypic detection was carried out by
   double-disk test; and the presence of the genes encoding TEM, OXA, SHV,
   and CTX-M type beta-lactamases was studied by polymerase chain reaction
   and sequencing. Other mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and
   phylogenetic groups were also determined. Clonal relationship was
   performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. ESBL-producing E. coli
   isolates were detected in 16 fecal samples, and one isolate per sample
   was studied. The CTX-M-1 type ESBL was detected in the 16 isolates. The

Abstract = {{p53 plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of genome integrity
   after DNA damage, deciding whether cells repair and live, or die.
   However, the rules that govern its choice are largely undiscovered. Here
   we show that the functional relationship between p38 and p53 is crucial
   in defining the cell fate after DNA damage. Upon low dose ultraviolet
   (UV) radiation, p38 and p53 protect the cells from apoptosis separately.
   Conversely, they function together to favor apoptosis upon high dose UV
   exposure. Taken together, a UV-induced, dose-dependent interaction
   between p38 and p53 acts as a switch to determine cell fate.

Abstract = {{The topics of shared interpretation, organizational learning and firm
   internationalization have been studied extensively. Though considered
   important factors that shape the international competitive landscape,
   research synthesizing these interrelated areas has been limited to date.
   We use the balanced scorecard as a framework for assessing how
   organizational learning and sensemaking influence actions relating to a
   global marketing strategy and subsequent financial performance. Using
   data from 169 multinational corporations, findings indicate that a
   specific set of knowledge activities is related to balanced scorecard
   outcomes (e.g. customer performance, innovation and learning
   performance, and internal process performance). The hypothesized
   importance of customer performance is confirmed as the only balanced
   scorecard outcome significantly related to financial performance. A post
   hoc analysis revealed further insights for future research
   opportunities. Overall, these results suggest that firms can improve
   their competitive position by emphasizing shared interpretation within
   the organization and including balanced scorecard elements when
   assessing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Goonetilleke SC, Doherty TJ, Corneil BD. A within trial measure of the
   stop signal reaction time in a head-unrestrained oculomotor
   countermanding task. J Neurophysiol 104: 3677-3690, 2010. First
   published October 20, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00495.2010. The
   countermanding (or stop-signal) task, which requires the cancellation of
   an impending response on the infrequent presentation of a stop signal,
   enables study of the contextual control of movement generation and
   suppression. Here we present a novel and empirical measure of the time
   needed to cancel an impending gaze shift by recording neck muscle
   activity during a head-unrestrained oculomotor countermanding paradigm.
   On a subset of STOP signal trials, subjects generated small head
   movements toward a target even though gaze remained stable due to a
   compensatory vestibular-ocular reflex. On such trials, we observed a
   burst of antagonist neck muscle activity during the small head-only
   error. Such antagonist neck muscle activity served as an active braking
   pulse as its magnitude scaled with the kinematics of the head-only
   error. This activity was selective for trials in which the head was
   arrested in mid-flight and did not appear on trials without a stop
   signal, on noncancelled STOP signal trials when the gaze shift was
   completed, or on STOP signal trials without head motion. Importantly,
   the timing of this antagonist activity related best to the onset of the
   stop signal (lagging it by similar to 180 ms), and strongly correlated
   with behavioral estimates of the time needed to cancel a movement (the
   stop signal reaction time). These results are consistent with the notion
   that such selective antagonist neck muscle activity arises as a
   peripheral expression of the oculomotor STOP process that successfully
   cancelled the gaze shift. Studying movement cancellation within nested
   systems like the head-unrestrained gaze shifting system offers a unique
   opportunity for investigating underlying neural mechanisms as the
   overall goal (i.e., to cancel a gaze shift) can be achieved despite
   motion of other components; on such individual trials, the oculomotor
   STOP process is expressed as an active braking pulse.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken because ZnO is being used as affinity
   probes for enhancing the signal intensities of bacterial analytes Since,
   ZnO is established for its bactericidal activity, it is vital that the
   threshold concentrations up to which ZnO does not show bactericidal
   activity and above which concentration the bactericidal activity of ZnO
   becomes pronounced is identified The results showed that at
   concentrations below 10 g/L, such as 5 and 1 g/L ZnO NPs did not damage
   the E coli cells much but improved the intensity of most of the peaks in
   the spectra For the first tune, this paper reports the use of matrix
   assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry
   (MALDI TOF MS) for assessing the damage incurred on the bacterial cells
   The results showed significant differences in spectral pattern
   confirming that MALDI TOF MS was successful in evaluating the
   bactericidal activity This paper is unique in that it presents the
   results of the comparative study conducted in assessing the capability
   of MALDI-TOF MS with the existing conventional plating technique which
   is generally used to estimate bactericidal activity This study brings
   out the inadequacy of the conventional plating techniques used in
   microbiology to depict antibacterial activity On the other hand,
   MALDI-MS analysis led to direct, simple, and rapid acquisition of data
   (5 mm for each measurement) which promptly reflected the bactericidal
   activity}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes hard machining which offers many potential benefits
   over traditional manufacturing techniques. In this work, investigations
   were carried out on end milling of hardened tool steel DIEVAR (hardness
   50 HRC), a newly developed tool steel material used by tool- and
   die-making industries. The objective of the present investigation was to
   study the performance characteristics of machining parameters such as
   cutting speed, feed, depth of cut and width of cut with due
   consideration to multiple responses, i.e. volume of material removed,
   tool wear, tool life and surface finish. Performance evaluation of
   physical vapour deposition-coated carbide inserts, ball end mill cutter
   and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride inserts (PCBN) was done for
   rough and finish machining on the basis of flank wear, tool life, volume
   of material removed, surface roughness and chip formation. It has been
   observed from investigations that chipping, diffusion and adhesion were
   active tool wear mechanisms and saw-toothed chips were formed whilst
   machining DIEVAR hard steel. PCBN inserts give an excellent performance
   in terms of tool life and surface finish in comparison with
   carbide-coated inserts. End milling technique using PCBN inserts could
   be a viable alternative to grinding in comparison to ball end mill
   cutter in terms of surface finish and tool life.}},

Abstract = {{Rasagiline is a selective, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor indicated
   for treatment of Parkinson's disease. This double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study determined the tyramine sensitivity factor
   (TSF) and degree of MAO-A inhibition (ie, reduction in plasma
   dihydroxyphenylglycol) in healthy volunteers who received phenelzine (15
   mg, 3 times daily; positive control), selegiline (5 mg, twice daily), or
   rasagiline (1-6 mg, once daily) for 14 days or rasagiline 2 mg/d for 30
   days. The selegiline/rasagiline groups were randomized to placebo or
   active drug. TSF was highest with phenelzine (17.3) and lowest with
   placebo (1.5). TSF with selegiline was 2.5. TSFs for rasagiline were as
   follows: 2.0 for 1 mg/d; 3.3 and 2.4 for 2 mg/d administered for 14 and
   30 days, respectively; 4.5 for 4 mg/d; and 5.1 for 6 mg/d. Plasma
   dihydroxyphenylglycol concentrations suggested that rasagiline 1 mg/d
   had no effect, whereas rasagiline 2 mg/d had only minimal effect. In
   contrast, rasagiline 4 and 6 mg/d reduced dihydroxyphenylglycol to a
   degree approaching that achieved by the positive control phenelzine.
   Results demonstrate that rasagiline selectively inhibits MAO-B and is
   not associated with increased tyramine sensitivity at the indicated dose
   (1 mg/d). These data allowed removal of dietary tyramine restriction
   from rasagiline US labeling.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is a recurrent pathology with a self-induced vulnerability.
   To explain this spontaneous aggravation, we have been mainly focusing on
   the Kindling hypothesis. However, the kindling phenomenon only reflects
   the concept of vulnerability but omits explaining its mechanisms. Both
   data of imaging and clinical studies showed evidence that the length and
   the repetition of major depressive episodes increase the risk for more
   frequent new episodes, i.e. that depressive episodes could be neurotoxic
   per se.
   This neurotoxicity hypothesis of major depressive disorder, apart from
   allowing a different way of communicating with our patients and to
   facilitate their compliance, strengthen the necessity to prevent
   recurrent depressive episodes. L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.}},

   transport properties. The Fe2V1-xZrxAl0.9-xSi0.1+x (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04,
   0.06, and 0.1) alloys indeed possessed the effective reduction in
   lattice thermal conductivity with increasing Zr concentration while the
   Seebeck coefficient showed very weak Zr concentration dependence. The
   Fe2-yIryV0.9-yTi0.1+yAl (y = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.1) alloys, on
   the other hand, possessed drastic reduction of Seebeck coefficient most
   likely due to the newly introduced Ir 5d states. These experimental
   facts agree with the present theoretical-prediction, and it was clearly
   proved that the combinational use of cluster calculation and band

Abstract = {{Goto T, Hatanaka R, Ogawa T, Sumiyoshi A, Riera J, Kawashima R. An
   evaluation of the conductivity profile in the somatosensory barrel
   cortex of Wistar rats. J Neurophysiol 104: 3388-3412, 2010. First
   published September 1, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00122.2010. Microelectrode
   arrays used to record local field potentials from the brain are being
   built with increasingly more spatial resolution, ranging from the
   initially developed laminar arrays to those with planar and
   three-dimensional (3D) formats. In parallel with such development in
   recording techniques, current source density (CSD) analyses have
   recently been expanded up to the continuous-3D form. Unfortunately, the
   effect of the conductivity profile on the CSD analysis performed with
   contemporary microelectrode arrays has not yet been evaluated and most
   of the studies assumed it was homogeneous and isotropic. In this study,
   we measured the conductivity profile in the somatosensory barrel cortex
   of Wistar rats. To that end, we combined multisite electrophysiological
   data recorded with a homemade assembly of silicon-based probes and a
   nonlinear least-squares algorithm that implicitly assumed that the
   cerebral cortex of rodents could be locally approximated as a layered
   anisotropic spherical volume conductor. The eccentricity of the six
   cortical layers in the somatosensory barrel cortex was evaluated from
   postmortem histological images. We provided evidence for the local
   spherical character of the entire barrels field, with concentric
   cortical layers. We found significant laminar dependencies in the
   conductivity values with radial/tangential anisotropies. These results
   were in agreement with the layer-dependent orientations of myelinated
   axons, but hardly related to densities of cells. Finally, we
   demonstrated through simulations that ignoring the real conductivity
   profile in the somatosensory barrel cortex of rats caused considerable
   errors in the CSD reconstruction, with pronounced effects on the
   continuous-3D form and charge-unbalanced CSD. We concluded that the
   conductivity profile must be included in future developments of CSD
   analysis, especially for rodents.}},

Abstract = {{Double-differential cross sections for neutron-induced light-ion
   production at 96 MeV have been measured for a variety of nuclei at The
   Svedberg Laboratory. Using the measured cross-section data, we deduce
   the Kerma coefficient from carbon and oxygen for p, d, t, He-3 and alpha
   particles. In order to get the total Kerma for C and O, we add GNASH
   calculation values where experimental data are not available and obtain
   a Kerma coefficient of 7.85 +/- 0.63 fGy m(2) for carbon and 7.09 +/-
   0.57 fGy m(2) for oxygen. The C/O Kerma coefficient ratio then becomes
   1.11 +/- 0.11. In addition we determine the Kerma ratio between ICRU
   muscle and A-150, again adding calculations with the GNASH code where no
   experimental data are available, and obtain a value of 0.98 +/- 0.05.
   While the Kerma coefficients for carbon and oxygen do not agree with the
   prediction in ICRU Report 63, the ratio values are in good agreement
   with existing predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the relationship between contact area and pressure under
   physiological loading has been described in the feline patellofemoral
   joint, this interaction has only been examined under simplified loading
   conditions and/or considerably lower forces than those occurring during
   demanding activities in humans. We hypothesized that patellofemoral
   contact area increases non-linearly under an increasing joint reaction
   force to regulate patellofemoral pressure. Eight human cadaveric knees
   were ramp loaded with muscle forces representative of the stance phase
   of stair climbing at 30 degrees knee flexion. Continuous pressure data
   were acquired with a pressure sensitive film that was positioned within
   the patellofemoral joint. While pressure was linearly dependent upon the
   resulting joint reaction force, contact area asymptotically approached a
   maximum value and reached 95\% of this maximum at patellofemoral forces
   of 349-723 N (95\% CI). Our findings indicate that the regulatory
   influence of increasing contact area to protect against high
   patellofemoral pressure is exhausted at relatively low loads. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity of 50 Tunisian almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) genotypes
   and their relationships to European and American cultivars were studied.
   In total 82 genotypes were analyzed using ten genomic SSRs. A total of
   159 alleles were scored and their sizes ranged from 116 to 227 bp. The
   number of alleles per locus varied from 12 to 23 with an average of 15.9
   alleles per locus. Mean expected and observed heterozygosities were 0.86
   and 0.68, respectively. The total value for the probability of identity
   was 4 x 10 (13). All SSRs were polymorphic and they were able all
   together to distinguish unambiguously the 82 genotypes. The Dice
   similarity coefficient was calculated for all pair wise and was used to
   construct an UPGMA dendrogram. The results demonstrated that the genetic
   diversity within local almond cultivars was important, with clear
   geographic divergence between the northern and the southern Tunisian
   cultivars. The usefulness of SSR markers for almond fingerprinting,
   detection of synonyms and homonyms and evaluation of the genetic
   diversity in the Tunisian almond germplasm was also discussed. The
   results confirm the potential value of genetic diversity preservation

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological characteristics
   of a representative sample of subsidized low cost housing communities in
   the City of Cape Town in relation to their living conditions and their
   health status Pour subsidized low cost housing communities were selected
   within the City of Cape Town in this cross sectional survey Structured
   interviews were administered in 336 dwellings on 173 plots Data was
   obtained from 1,080 persons with a response rate of 100\% Almost all of
   the state-subsidized houses had one or more shacks in the backyard,
   increasing the occupation density and putting the municipal sanitation
   infrastructure under pressure In 40\% of main houses, one or more cases
   of diarrhea were reported during the two weeks preceding the survey, in
   contrast to 23\% of shacks (p<0 0007) Of the total group, 1 7\%
   willingly disclosed that they were HIV positive, while 3 5\% reported
   being tuberculosis (TB) positive One of them reported having multiple
   drug resistant TB None of the HIV positive or TB positive persons was on
   any treatment A reported 6 8\% of the families admitted regularly eating
   only one meal per day, whereas 18 5\% reported having only two meals per
   day The shack dwellers had significantly higher education and employment
   status (p<0 01), since they had to pay rent Improvements in health
   Intended by the rehousing process did not materialize for the recipients
   of low cost housing in this study The health vulnerability of
   individuals in these communities had considerable implications for the
   curative health services Sanitation failures, injectious disease
   pressure, and environmental pollution in these communities represent a
   erious public health risk The densification caused by backyard shacks,
   in addition, has municipal service implications and needs to be better
   managed Urgent intervention is needed to allow the state funded housing
   schemes to deliver the improved health that was envisaged at its
   inception}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary issues in education should include conversations about
   immigration which has shaped our past, defines our present, and will
   enrich our collective future. This article explores a cadre of K-12 and
   collegiate United States (US) educators' participation in a graduate
   course on the construction of immigrants in multicultural literature and
   the ways in which the educators constructed themselves and immigrants
   during and after the course. Specifically, the article addresses how the
   immersion in and discussion of literature involving immigrants can
   cultivate educators' awareness of hegemonic policies and practices
   toward immigrants in the US. Engaging in a multilayered analytic method
   interweaving thematic analysis with critical discourse analysis, the
   author shares educators' oral and written discourses which both
   reinforced and countered prevailing socio-political constructions of
   immigrants in the US. Their discourses also illuminated the interplay
   between thought and action as indicators of ideological shifts. The
   author concludes with a discussion of issues surrounding the power of
   stories as mediums for personal and social change, the use of language
   as a social act, and educators as aspiring agents of change.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale processes are taken to mean the disturbances of the

   inhomogeneity of the underlying surface and under which one can neglect
   the effects of both centripetal and Coriolis accelerations. Slight
   disturbances suggest the use of linearized hydrothermodynamic equations

   of the models, circulation over a weakly sloping barchan is analyzed
   using a refined model of mountain-valley circulation (the well-known
   Prandtl model). The other model, which is a model of a thermal spot in a
   geostrophic flow, can conditionally be called ``anticonvective.{''} This

Abstract = {{Specific nuclear domains are nonrandomly positioned within the nuclear
   space, and this preferential positioning has been shown to play an
   important role in genome activity and stability. Well-known examples
   include the organization of repetitive DNA in telomere clusters or in
   the chromocenter of Drosophila and mammalian cells, which may provide a
   means to control the availability of general repressors, such as the
   heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). We have specifically characterized the
   intranuclear positioning of in vivo fluorescence of the Caenorhabditis
   elegans HP1 homologue HPL-2 as a marker for heterochromatin domains in
   developing embryos. For this purpose, the wavelet transform modulus
   maxima (WTMM) segmentation method was generalized and adapted to segment
   the small embryonic cell nuclei in three dimensions. The implementation
   of a radial distribution algorithm revealed a preferential perinuclear
   positioning of HPL-2 fluorescence in wild-type embryos compared with the
   diffuse and homogeneous nuclear fluorescence observed in the lin-13
   mutants. For all other genotypes analyzed, the quantitative analysis
   highlighted various degrees of preferential HPL-2 positioning at the
   nuclear periphery, which directly correlates with the number of HPL-2
   foci previously counted on 2D projections. Using a probabilistic 3D cell
   nuclear model, we found that any two nuclei having the same number of
   foci, but with a different 3D probabilistic positioning scheme, can have
   significantly different counts in the 2D maximum projection, thus
   showing the deceptive limitations of using techniques of 2D maximum
   projection foci counts. By this approach, a strong perinuclear
   positioning of HPL-2 foci was brought into light upon inactivation of
   conserved chromatin-associated proteins, including the HAT cofactor
   TRAPP.}},

   of prenatal anxiety disorder and maternal caregiving sensitivity on
   Infants responses to a standardised interactive stressor (still-face
   procedure) Eighty-four women completed a clinical interview during
   pregnancy to assess anxiety symptoms meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
   At infant age 7 months maternal sensitivity to infant distress and
   infant negative affect were observed and coded during the still-face
   procedure Maternal postnatal (concurrent) anxiety and depression were
   also assessed at this time Results indicated a negative association
   between maternal sensitivity to infant distress and infant negative
   affect responses to the still-face procedure An unexpected finding was a
   positive association between parity and Infant reactivity The main
   effect for sensitivity was qualified by a significant interaction p < 05
   suggesting that the impact of sensitivity was particularly marked among
   infants of women who experienced an anxiety disorder during pregnancy
   This finding is consistent with a cumulative risk model suggesting that

Abstract = {{Many scientific and engineering problems are solved by utilizing
   simulations of computationally intensive mathematical models within
   massive design spaces. As a result, parametric studies of these models
   are cost prohibitive in terms of computational time. The focus of this
   work is a particular kind of parameter sweep problem where the
   simulation of the model, given real parameters, results in a binary
   value. The goal of this work is to design, develop, and implement a
   parallel algorithm for bounding a binary objective when the simulation
   is a computationally intensive mathematical model. A fully functioning
   implementation is provided for a two-dimensional example using
   client-server architecture. Results show that a straight bisection
   search is approximately 50\% faster than a full parametric sweep for
   most continuous functions. With parallelization and load balancing, the
   simulation is remarkably faster, exhibiting near-linear speedup up to 16
   processors for most functions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.3510589]}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that classical mechanics played a significant role in
   the thought of several major economists in the neoclassical tradition
   from the 1860s to the 1910s. Less well studied are the particular parts
   or features of mechanics that exercised this influence, or the depth and
   extent of the impact. After outlining the main traditions of mechanics
   and the calculus, and describing types of analogy between theories in
   general, I review some main pertinent features of the work of eight
   neoclassical economists from the 1830s to the 1910s. I argue that the
   influence took various forms but that in practice it was modest. Then I
   briefly describe a fresh set of possible influences with the development
   of dynamical systems in the period 1920-1950, where again the role of
   mechanics was limited. I end by raising a large question: does economics
   need some mathematics designed for its own purposes rather than that
   traditionally obtained by analogizing from mechanics and physics?}},

Abstract = {{Against the backdrop of the historical 200S presidential election, I
   discuss the ways that the election of marginalized group members to
   public office can be used to silence the discourse on the social
   marginalization of group members and to remove these analyses from their
   appropriate context. 1 emphasize the need to materialize alternatives to
   the dominant cultural narrative as one way of contextualizing the
   behavior of marginalized group members, specifically African Americans,
   regarding their appropriate angry responses to their marginalization.
   The toxic effects of racism in the lives of African Americans are
   trivialized when we ignore their narratives and the social contexts of
   their behavior. Accurate explorations of social contexts require an
   explicit examination of social inequity and not just individual
   responsibility. I use the discussion of these phenomena to highlight an
   important aspect of the social context in which Black men become fathers
   and what happens when we understand their behavior as fathers within
   this social context as opposed to in isolation. My goal is to raise our
   consciousness about how ignoring social contexts reinforces dominant
   cultural stereotypes of Black men that vilify them, specifically ill
   their role as fathers, and how in doing so they reinforce the racial,
   gender, heterosexist, and socioeconomic class social status quo.}},

Abstract = {{Sacral neuromodulation has become a widely accepted form of therapy in
   the overall spectrum of treatment options for urinary urgency and

   prevalent forms of urinary problems in this population. Despite the fact

   often quite challenging. This may be exacerbated by underlying
   comorbidities which preclude or limit the utility of some therapies

Abstract = {{Aim of the study: To review the information available on the use of khat
   (Catha edulis) in the EU, and to assess the future use of this drug and
   related substances.
   Material and methods: Khat is not controlled by international law and it
   has not been systematically included in the list of illicit drugs
   monitored in the EU. The current principal source of information on khat
   use in Europe is the early-warning system set up to monitor new and
   emerging drugs. Further information was obtained from official national
   reports to the EMCDDA and from the scientific literature.
   Results: Across Europe, the use of khat is low. Khat use is limited to
   countries with immigrant communities from countries where khat use is
   common (such as Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya). Information on the
   prevalence of khat use in the general population is scarce. Data on
   seizures provide an insight on the situation, though these may be
   difficult to interpret. The most recent estimates suggest that Europe
   accounts for about 40\% of the khat seized worldwide.
   Conclusion: The shortage of data on the use and patterns of use of khat
   in Europe does not allow an evaluation of the needs for health and
   social interventions in communities in which the drug is used. But
   seizures of the plant are increasing in the EU, and more synthetic
   derivatives of the pharmacologically active ingredients of the plant
   (cathine and cathinone) are appearing on the market. Some of these, like
   mephedrone, have significant potential for future diffusion, and are
   likely to play a greater role on the European drug scene of the future.

   responders, reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Median day of onset was
   3 days following the event. Ten riders reported receiving a
   laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Campylobacter. Multivariate logistic
   regression analysis identified the inadvertent ingestion of mud (OR 2.5,
   95\% CI 1.5-4.2, P<0.001) and eating `other' food during the event (OR
   2.1, 95\% CI 1.2-3.6, P=0.01) as significant risk factors for illness.
   We concluded that the outbreak was caused by Campylobacter, spread to
   the riders by the inadvertent ingestion of mud which had been
   contaminated with sheep faeces from the rural course. Mountain-bike race
   organizers should consider microbiological hazards when risk-assessing
   potential race courses. The internet is an efficient tool for the
   investigation of outbreaks in computer-literate populations.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer kinetic properties of 2.1 mm I.D. columns packed with
   core-shell (Kinetex) and totally porous (BEH) sub-2 mu m particles,
   operated at high flow rates, under high pressure gradient, are
   investigated and discussed. The differences between their kinetic
   performance at low, intermediate, and high velocities are explained by
   the Kinetex column having a smaller longitudinal diffusion than the BEH
   column (due to the lower internal porous volume), a larger eddy
   diffusion (due to a less well-packed bed, with significant trans-column
   velocity biases), and a smaller amplitude of the radial temperature
   gradient across the column diameter generated by friction of the mobile
   phase percolating the bed at high flow rates. This last observation is
   accounted for by the heat conductivity of the Kinetex bed being three
   times larger than that of the BEH bed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Both endoscopic and surgical treatments are recommended for
   m3- or sm1-adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, depending on patients'
   lymph nodal status. Lymphatic dissemination is related to tumor
   infiltration depth, but varying incidences have been reported in m3- and
   sm1-adenocarcinomas. The study aim was to investigate whether the
   presence of occult tumor cells in lymph nodes could explain this
   variation.
   Methods: Sixty-three node-negative (NO) patients with early esophageal
   adenocarcinoma (m2/m3/sm1-tumors) were included. Multilevel-sectioning
   of lymph nodes was performed; sections were stained by means of
   immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin marker CAM5.2. Two pathologists
   searched for micrometastases (0.2-2.0 mm) and isolated tumor cells
   (ITCs, <0.2 mm).
   Results: Positive CAM5.2 staining in lymph nodes was not seen in any of
   the 18 m2-patients. In 2/25m3-tumors (8.0\%) an ITC was found, but no
   micrometastases. Tumor cells were identified in 4/20 sm1-tumors
   (20.0\%): three micrometastases and one ITC. Median follow-up was 121
   months. Two m3-patients (3.2\%) died due to disease recurrence,
   including one patient in whom an ITC was detected.
   Conclusions: Lymphatic migration of tumor cells was found in
   node-negative m3- and sm1-adenocarcinomas of the esophagus (8.0\% and
   20.0\%, respectively). However, the clinical relevance of these occult
   tumor cells should become apparent from large series of endoscopically
   treated patients. J. Surg. Oncol. 2010;102:863-867. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{The management of perioral injuries is a complex topic that must take
   into consideration the unique anatomy, histology, and function of the
   lips to best restore form and function of the mouth after injury. Basic
   reconstructive principles include three-layered closure for
   full-thickness lip lacerations. Additionally, special care is needed to
   ensure an aesthetic repair of the cosmetically complex and important
   vermillion border, philtrum, and Cupid's bow. Infraorbital and mental
   nerve blocks provide lip anesthesia for laceration repair without
   distorting crucial aesthetic landmarks. Prophylactic antibiotics are
   usually indicated in perioral injuries due to wound contamination with
   saliva. Perioral burn management is controversial; however, most lip
   burns can first be managed conservatively. Splinting, plastics, and
   other reconstructive options are available after secondary healing of
   perioral burns. Hypertrophic scars are common in the perioral area after
   trauma. The mainstays of treatment for hypertrophic scars on the lips
   are silicone elastomer sheeting and intralesional steroid injections.
   For large perioral defects, a myriad of reconstructive options are
   available, ranging from primary closure, cross-lip flaps, and local
   tissue transfer, to free tissue transfers such as radial forearm free
   flaps, innervated gracilis free flaps, anterolateral thigh free flaps,
   and osteocutaneous free flaps.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate the relationships of visfatin, adiponectin and leptin
   with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in
   adolescent female athletes with different training patterns.
   Methods: This study involved 170 healthy 13-15-year-old girls divided
   into six groups based on activity: sport games (i.e. basketball,
   volleyball, badminton) (n = 49), track sprint (n = 24), rhythmic
   gymnastics (n = 23), swimming (n = 24), cross-country skiing (n = 17)
   and sedentary controls (n = 33). BMD and BMC at femoral neck and lumbar
   spine (L2-L4) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
   Visfatin, adiponectin, leptin, insulin and glucose were measured, and
   the insulin resistance index was calculated using homeostasis model
   assessment.
   Results: There were no relationships found between visfatin
   concentrations and bone mineral parameters in adolescent female athletes
   or controls. Adiponectin was inversely correlated to BMD and BMC of
   femoral neck and lumbar spine (r = -0.47-0.62) in the swimmer group
   only, but after adjustments for age, height and body mass these
   associations disappeared. Leptin concentrations correlated with bone
   mineral parameters even after adjusting for age, height and body mass (r
   = 0.42-0.63) in the gymnast group only.
   Conclusion: We may conclude that after adjustment, leptin is the only
   adipokine of those measured that correlates to femoral neck and lumbar
   spine BMD and femoral neck BMC in the rhythmic gymnast group.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate how to extract the lowest frequency
   features from an image. A novel Laplacian smoothing transform (LST) is
   proposed to transform an image into a sequence, by which low frequency
   features of an image can be easily extracted for a discriminant learning
   method for face recognition. Generally, the LST is able to be an
   efficient dimensionality reduction method for face recognition problems.
   Extensive experimental results show that the LST method performs better
   than other pre-processing methods, such as discrete cosine transform
   (DCT), principal component analysis (PCA) and discrete wavelet transform
   (DWT), on ORL, Yale and PIE face databases. Under the leave one out
   strategy, the best performance on the ORL and Yale face databases is
   99.75\% and 99.4\%; however, in this paper, we improve both to 100\%

Abstract = {{A series of organolanthanide complexes supported by a new
   ferrocene-containing N-aryloxo-functionalized beta-ketoiminate ligand
   FcCOCH(2)C(Me)N(2-HO-5-Me-C6H3) (LH2, Fc - ferrocenyl) was synthesized
   by amine elimination reactions. It was found that the ionic radii have a
   profound effect on the outcome of the reactions. Reactions of LH2 with
   Ln{[}N(SiMe3)(2)](3)(mu-Cl)Li(THF)(3) in a 1:1 molar ratio in THF gave
   the desired lanthanide amido complexes {[}LLn\{N(SiMe3)(2)\}(THF)](2)
   {[}Ln = Nd (1), Sm (2), Er (3), Yb (4), Y (5)] in good isolated yields,
   whereas the similar reaction of LH2 with
   La{[}N(SiMe3)(2)](3)(mu-Cl)Li(THF)(3) gave the unexpected
   lanthanum-lithium heterobimetallic cluster
   {[}L2La\{mu-Li(THF)\}(2)(mu-Cl)](2) (6). These complexes were
   characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and H-1 NMR
   spectroscopy in the case of complexes 5 and 6. The definitive molecular
   structures of complexes 1, 2, 4 and 6 were determined by X-ray
   diffraction studies. Complexes 1-5 can initiate the ring-opening
   polymerization of L-lactide with moderate activity. (c) 2010 Elsevier

   reaction (PCR) equipment and the derived LAMP products can be directly
   observed by naked eye employing SybrGreen I dye instead of conventional
   gel electrophoresis analysis. The limits of detection of these
   established visual LAMP assays were about 4 copies of haploid soybean
   genomic DNA, and which were much higher than those of reported
   conventional PCR assays. Furthermore, the high specificity of LAMP
   assays was determined. All the results demonstrated that the developed

Abstract = {{Aim: To consider the arguments for screening outside the standard
   screening period of 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.
   Materials and Methods: A search of the literature between 1990 and 2010
   was performed using the PubMed (R) and Cochrane (R) databases.
   Recommendations from learned societies in diabetology and obstetrics \&
   gynaecology were consulted.
   Results: Gestational diabetes mellitus screening is classically
   recommended between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy, the period during
   which glucose tolerance deteriorates. However, the increasing prevalence
   of type 2 diabetes in women of childbearing age with risk factors
   requires earlier screening. Fasting blood glucose should be measured at
   the first visit during early pregnancy for these patients. The
   diagnostic threshold is the same as for patients who are not pregnant,
   i.e. blood glucose > 1.26 g/l. However, the benefit of screening for
   gestational diabetes during early pregnancy for women with risk factors
   has not been supported by prospective studies. Therefore oral glucose
   tolerance testing during early pregnancy is not currently recommended
   for the detection of gestational diabetes.
   Screening for gestational diabetes, regardless of the recommended
   screening policy, must be performed between weeks 24 and 28 of
   pregnancy. There are no reasons to consider subsequent screening for
   gestational diabetes at a later stage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Purpose Radiographic arthrosis is a common sequela of elbow trauma Few
   studies have addressed risk factors for radiographic arthrosis after
   elbow injury, especially in the long term Data from multiple long-term
   follow-up studies of patients with surgically treated elbow fractures
   provided us with an opportunity to assess risk factors for long-term
   radiographic arthrosis after elbow injury
   Methods During a 5-year period, we obtained radiographs during a
   research-specific evaluation of 139 patients (81 men and 58 women) 10 or
   more years (median, 19 5 y, range, 10-34 y) after surgical treatment of
   an elbow fracture as part of multiple retrospective studies Radiographic
   arthrosis was graded according to the system of Broberg and Money
   Bivariate and multivariable analyses evaluated risk factors for
   radiographic arthrosis
   Results Of 139 patients, 75 had radiographic evidence of arthrosis at
   final evaluation and 32 had moderate or severe radiographic arthrosis
   Mechanism of injury, age, gender, follow-up time, occupation, and limb
   dominance were not associated with radiographic arthrosis Multiple
   logistic regression analysis identified the type of injury as the only
   independent predictor of moderate to severe radiographic arthrosis
   Patients with a bicolumnar fracture of the distal humerus, a
   capitellum/trochlear fracture, or an elbow fracture dislocation were 8
   0, 7 3, and 5 2 times more likely (odds ratio), respectively, to develop
   radiographic evidence of moderate or severe radiographic arthrosis than
   the average patient in this cohort
   Conclusions Distal humerus fractures (both columnar and
   capitellum/trochlea) and elbow fracture dislocations are more likely
   than fractures of the olecranon and radial head to develop moderate or
   severe radiographic arthrosis m the long term (J Hand Surg 2010,35A

Abstract = {{Objective. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of either plain or
   hyperbaric solutions of intrathecal bupivacaine and ropivacaine on
   maternal block characteristics, complications, side effects and neonatal
   parameters to find out which is superior in a single study.
   Methods. One hundred and three term parturients were randomly assigned
   to receive intrathecal 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine (Group Bh), 10 mg
   plain bupivacaine (Group Bp), 15 mg hyperbaric ropivacaine prepared with
   dextrose 30\% (Group Rh) or 15 mg plain ropivacaine (Group Rp)
   coadministered with fentanyl 20 mu g. Sensory and motor block
   characteristics, analgesia duration, ephedrine consumption, and neonatal
   and maternal parameters were recorded.
   Results. Time to maximum cephalad spread of sensory block was longer in
   Group Rp than both bupivacaine groups. Time to achieve sensory block at
   T6 dermatome was similar between both hyperbaric groups (Group Bh:4.5
   +/- 1.6, Group Rh:4.6 +/- 1.1, p > 0.05) but Group Rp needed
   significantly longer time (7.5 +/- 5.5 min, p = 0.003) than both
   hyperbaric groups. Duration of motor block was shorter in ropivacaine
   groups (Group Rh: 90.6 +/- 17.3, Group Rp 121.6 +/- 33.7) vs.
   bupivacaine groups (Group Bh: 140.2 +/- 33.3, Group Bp: 149.7 +/- 46.0);
   Group Rh being shorter than Group Rp (p < 0.05). Ephedrine consumption
   was less in Groups Rh (20.0 +/- 11.9 mg) and Rp (18.3 +/- 12.4 mg) vs.
   Groups Bh (30.0 +/- 14.9 mg) and Bp (27.8 +/- 15.4 mg) (p = 0.006).
   Conclusions. Intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine 15 mg with fentanyl 20
   mu g for CSE is suitable since it provides early motor recovery leading
   to faster patient ambulation, rapid onset of sensory block with less
   ephedrine.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a disease that is known
   since 1944 affecting many people across the world and causing a high
   mortality rate. The aim of this study was to determine the
   epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the CCHF cases in our
   region.
   Materials and methods: The present study was conducted in patients with
   CCHF who were hospitalized between 2004 and 2006 at Karadeniz Technical
   University. Demographic, geographic, climatic, and clinical
   characteristics of all patients were investigated.
   Results: A total of 102 patients with confirmed CCHF were investigated
   in this study. All of the patients were from rural areas. Eighty-seven
   patients (85.2\%) were livestock workers. None of the cases was from the
   region where mountain range faced the sea and all cases were from areas
   of Harsit, Kelkit, and Coruh valleys situated at 1100-2265 m above sea
   level where the mountain ranges ceased to separate the sea and inner
   regions and streams reached the sea.
   Conclusion: CCHF case series have been reported from Turkey as well and
   particularly Middle Anatolia and northeastern regions have been
   determined as endemic areas recently. Population of those regions mostly
   earns their life from livestock breeding and agriculture, which
   increases the risk of exposure to ticks and development of CCHF.
   Therefore, especially in cases coming from regions categorized as
   endemic, it has been concluded that mortality can be reduced by
   carefully taken medical history and practice of rapid medical treatment
   and replacement therapies in consideration of CCHF prediagnosis.}},

   PEI-PBLG's amphiphilic advantages, but also possesses reducible
   properties. CPP can complex with DNA to form nanoparticles. CPP/DNA
   complex particles were characterized by particle size and zeta potential
   analysis. The result showed that the complex particles have suitable

   also prove CBA-PEI-PBLG has proper condensing ability for DNA. CPP has
   good reducible property, and also has good biocompatibility because of
   introducing PBLG segment. The cytotoxicity of CPP was evaluated using
   MTT assay, and the results showed CPP has lower cytotoxicity compared
   with PEI 25 K. The transfection properties were characterized in
   different cells by using plasmid DNA as a reporter. CPP showed higher
   transfection efficiencies and lower cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. This was
   attributed to bioreducible and biocompatibility properties of the CPP.
   These results suggested that CPP is a promising low-toxic, highly

Abstract = {{The ecosystem in northeastern China and the Russian Far East is a
   hotspot of scientific research into the global carbon balance. Forest
   aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important component in the land surface
   carbon cycle. In this study, using forest inventory data and forest
   distribution data, the AGB was estimated for forest in Daxinganlin in
   northeastern China by combining charge-coupled device (CCD) data from
   the Small Satellite for Disaster and Environment Monitoring and Forecast
   (HJ-1) and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) waveform data from
   the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). The forest AGB
   prediction models were separately developed for different forest types
   in the research area at GLAS footprint level from GLAS waveform
   parameters and field survey plot biomass in the Changqing (CQ) Forest
   Center, which was calculated from forest inventory data. The resulted
   statistical regression models have a R (2)=0.68 for conifer and R
   (2)=0.71 for broadleaf forests. These models were used to estimate
   biomass for all GLAS footprints of forest located in the study area. All
   GLAS footprint biomass coupled with various spectral reflectivity
   parameters and vegetation indices derived from HJ-1 satellite CCD data
   were used in multiple regression analyses to establish biomass
   prediction models (R (2)=0.55 and R (2)=0.52 for needle and broadleaf
   respectively). Then the models were used to produce a forest AGB map for
   the whole study area using the HJ-1 data. Biomass data obtained from
   forest inventory data of the Zhuanglin (ZL) Forest Center were used as
   independent field measurements to validate the AGB estimated from HJ-1
   CCD data (R (2)=0.71). About 80\% of biomass samples had an error less
   than 20 t ha(-1), and the mean error of all validation samples is 5.74 t
   ha(-1). The pixel-level biomass map was then stratified into different
   biomass levels to illustrate the AGB spatial distribution pattern in
   this area. It was found that HJ-1 wide-swath data and GLAS waveform data
   can be combined to estimate forest biomass with good precision, and the
   biomass data can be used as input data for future carbon budget
   analysis.}},

Title = {{Evidence for CGRP re-uptake in rat dura mater encephali}},

Volume = {{161}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in the
   trigeminovascular system and released from sensory fibres of the cranial
   dura mater upon noxious stimulation. Such release may be a mechanism
   underlying migraine headache. Based on data from guinea pig basilar
   artery preparations, we have here studied CGRP release and uptake in an
   organ preparation of the hemisected rat skull.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   CGRP release from the cranial dura was quantified by a commercial
   enzyme-linked immunoassay. CGRP was depleted using repetitive challenges
   of capsaicin. After incubating the tissue with CGRP for 20 min and
   extensive washing, another capsaicin challenge was performed.
   Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize CGRP immunofluorescence in
   dural nerve fibres.
   KEY RESULTS
   Capsaicin-induced CGRP release was attenuated by the transient receptor
   potential vanilloid receptor type I antagonist capsazepine or by
   Ca2+-free solutions. After the CGRP-depleted preparation had been
   exposed to exogenous CGRP, capsaicin-induced CGRP release was increased
   compared to the challenge just prior to incubation. CGRP uptake was not
   influenced by Ca2+-free solutions. Olcegepant and CGRP(8-37) (CGRP
   receptor antagonists) did not affect uptake of CGRP. However, a
   monoclonal CGRP-binding antibody decreased CGRP uptake significantly.
   Release of CGRP after incubation was attenuated by Ca2+-free solutions
   and by capsazepine. Immunohistochemical assays indicated a weak trend
   towards CGRP uptake in rat dura mater.
   CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
   We have presented evidence for CGRP uptake in nerves and its re-release
   in rat dura mater. This may have implications for the pathophysiology
   and treatment of migraine.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the treatment of choice
   for young patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia. For older
   patients, the acceptable upper age limit for transplantation as
   first-line treatment varies. The current analysis, therefore, sought to
   identify age or ages at transplantation at which survival differed.
   Design and Methods
   We studied the effect of patients' age, adjusting for other significant
   factors affecting outcomes, in 1307 patients with severe aplastic anemia
   after HLA-matched sibling transplantation using logistic and Cox
   regression analysis. Age categories (< 20 years, 20-40 years, > 40
   years) were determined using Martingale residual plots for overall
   survival and categories based on differences in survival.
   Results
   Patients aged over 40 years old were more likely to have had
   immunosuppressive therapy, a poor performance score and a longer
   interval between diagnosis and transplantation. Neutrophil recovery was
   similar in all age groups but patients aged over 40 years had a lower
   likelihood of platelet recovery compared to patients aged less than 20
   years (OR 0.45, P=0.01) but not compared to those aged 20-40 years (OR
   0.60, P=0.10). Compared to the risk of mortality in patients aged less
   than 20 years, mortality risks were higher in patients over 40 years old
   (RR 2.70, P < 0.0001) and in those aged 20-40 years (RR 1.69, P <
   0.0001). The mortality risk was also higher in patients aged over 40
   years than in those 20-40 years old (RR 1.60, P=0.008).
   Conclusions
   Mortality risks increased with age. Risks were also higher in patients
   with a poor performance score and when the interval between diagnosis
   and transplantation was longer than 3 months, implying earlier referral
   would be appropriate when this treatment option is being considered.}},

Abstract = {{Problem and Aims: In Germany, definitions and quality standards for
   health resorts ({''}Begriffsbestimmungen und Qualitatsstandards fur die
   Pradikatisierung von Kurorten, Erholungsorten und Heilbrunnen{''})
   provide a comprehensive catalogue of criteria for quality of health
   resorts and modalities of balneotherapy. They are basis of certification
   and legal acknowledgement of health resorts. However, in practice the
   use of these criteria cause some problems especially for 2 reasons:
   1(st) the definitions and quality standards for health resorts have not
   been designed as guideline for certification and therefore have other
   systematic of chapters. 2(nd) the definitions and quality standards for
   health resorts have been repeatedly revised and updated resulting in
   some inconsistency and contradictions. Aim of the paper therefore is to
   provide a new and clear structure for certification and legal
   acknowledgement of health resorts and treatment modalities and to
   present it in a structured table.
   Methods: Basic principle of the certification is that every health
   resort has to provide at least one natural treatment modality and
   additionally has facilities and environment appropriate to treat
   patients. Both areas have to be proven by suitable analytic methods and
   scientifically assessed regarding its usefulness for prevention, therapy
   and rehabilitation.
   Results: The resulting structured table for certification and legal
   acknowledgement of health resorts fully fulfils the criteria given in
   the German definitions and quality standards for health resorts. For
   treatment modalities in balneotherapy criteria are chemical composition
   and physical properties, effects, indications and contraindications,
   hygienic aspects, classification, and range of variability of
   composition. For health resorts they additionally are: appropriate
   bioclimatic conditions, good air quality, general and specific
   facilities for treatment (including appropriate environment),
   environment protection policy, and certification of indications and
   contraindications for treatment and rehabilitation in the specific
   health resort.
   Discussion: The structured table for certification and legal
   acknowledgement of health resorts shows that the German definitions and
   quality standards for health resorts may be structured in a systematic
   way and therefore are suitable for the certification procedure. The
   usefulness of the table has been proven to be useful in practice or
   legal acknowledgement of health resorts in the German state of Lower
   Saxony.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present new information about bone mineral
   density (BMD) variability in guanaco (Lama guanicoe), a South American
   wild camelid; while taking into account its ontogenic development. The
   importance of considering intrataxonomic variability in bone density
   related to age for constructing zooarchaeological indices and applying
   them to archaeological assemblages is also discussed. The results
   presented here were developed from a large sample of 46 metacarpals and
   45 femurs of modern guanacos, ranging in age from ca. 6 months of
   gestation to 12 years. Bone structural densities were measured using a
   biphotonic X-ray densitometer, DEXA method, Norland EXCELL and the bone
   mineral content (BMC) of each scanned portion or complete element was
   divided by its volume, which was obtained independently by water
   displacement. Our results indicate that the bone density of each
   anatomical unit is highly variable, even among individuals of the same
   species. According to metacarpals data, age is an important factor
   affecting BMD. Moreover, our study shows that the density ranges of
   different skeletal elements can overlap, suggesting that it is not
   possible to predict that a certain element is always denser than another
   one. Finally, we present new evidence about the potential age-related
   taphonomic bias in faunal assemblages, indicating that meanwhile some
   skeletal elements show clear differences in their density between their
   fused and unfused state (metacarpal) other do not (femur). (C) 2010

Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{6, 1}},
Pages = {{1720-1739}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To analyze the impact of public health insurance expansions and the use
   of enrollee cost sharing on insurance status and receipt of clinically
   indicated preventive screenings and physician services.
   Data Source
   This study uses Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data
   from 1997 to 2007.
   Study Design
   This study uses multivariate difference-in-difference logistic
   regression modeling of pooled cross-sectional time series data. The
   effect of the expansions on insurance status and access to care is
   identified by cross-state variation in program implementation, as well
   as cross-state and within-state variation in program eligibility
   criteria over time.
   Principal Findings
   Childless adult expansions, regardless of cost-sharing levels, reduced
   uninsurance rates and decreased the likelihood that childless adults
   needed to see a physician but did not because of cost. Expansions with
   traditional public insurance cost-sharing requirements increased the use
   of preventive screenings, while expansions with increased cost-sharing
   requirements did not.
   Conclusions
   Cost-sharing requirements did not have an impact on the ability to see a
   physician when needed, but they played an important role in the
   utilization of preventive services. Expanding public health insurance to
   low-income, childless adults presents a promising policy opportunity,
   but there are trade-offs between the efficiencies obtained through
   increased cost sharing and the potential inefficiencies due to the lower
   use of preventive services.}},

Abstract = {{The report deals with the opportunities for the implementation of the EU
   ``Rail Baltica{''} study project, evaluating the fulfillment of
   acoustical requirements for the railway route. The paper considers the
   causes of excited vibrations and noise. The railway has always been one
   of the most important transport means, which ensures the quality of the
   rail freight. Propagation of vibrations, excited by the moving train, to
   the environment and their evaluation is significant problem. Conducted
   research work will be used in laying out the new railroad line from the
   West to Central Europe. It will provide the possibility to improve the
   quality of the railroad route as well as reduce vibrations and noise
   generated by the trains. It was established that the transport moving
   along the railways caused many serious problems from the ecological
   point of view, noise and vibration being among the most important
   issues. Heavy train moves along the metal railway on its metal wheels
   i.e. rolling-stocks. This is one of key sources of noise and vibration:
   it produces audible low-frequency noise as well as non-audible noise -
   infrasound. The influence of the infrasound on the environment and human
   health has not been thoroughly investigated, yet there are plenty of
   means for reducing it. The research performed in this area indicates
   many cases when infrasound is far more harmful in comparison to the
   audible sounds. It is a costly and complicated process to eliminate
   infrasound from the aforementioned sources therefore the companies and
   private owners, as well as state institutions do not adopt relevant
   measures to solve this problem. Moreover, the audible sound would also
   decrease in such a case. In the paper the author treats the problem on
   the basis of practical tests and research conducted by different
   scientists as well as proposes approaches for solution of the considered
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{This research work presents various noise reduction measures, which,
   taking into account the relief of the country and the location of urban
   areas, should be designed during modernization of railway lines.
   European project ``Silence{''} is dedicated to the reduction of railway
   noise in urban areas. Attention in this paper is devoted to the impact
   of infrasound on the people living near the railway. Here we present the
   study of propagation of vibrations through the ground to the residential
   buildings. With this aim in view, experimental tests were performed for
   clarification of vibration propagation process from the railway lines
   (railings) to the residential building. Evaluation of possible impact of
   noise caused by the trains on the environment is presented. The report
   provides sound pressure levels from the moving trains, which will run
   until the reconstruction of the main line. Moreover, noise levels are
   predicted when modernizing road and railway transport means
   (locomotives, vans, etc.). This research work studies spectrum
   composition of noise produced by the train in terms of quantity and
   quality of the radiated energy with respect to the human body, i.e. not
   only by the sound level dBA, but also by the spectrum composition of
   sound pressure level. Attention is focused on the impact of very low
   sound frequencies and infrasound. On the basis of the measured and
   calculated noise levels propagated by various future railway trains, the
   impact of noise produced by the trains on the environment is specified.
   Based on the results of noise analysis, measures are foreseen for the
   reduction of harmful noise propagated by the trains. The article
   presents the research on reduction of noise and vibrations by means of
   barriers theory and their implementation in practice. Acoustic barriers
   are divided according to their usage and structures. The article deals
   with the presentation of implementation of screens in practice together
   with their theoretical evaluation as well as dependences on structure
   and materials of the screens. Evaluation of their positive and negative
   acoustic properties is provided as well. The obtained results will be
   used in the recommendations when designing noise reduction measures and
   expanding a railway network in the Baltic countries.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-ligament knee injuries require prompt recognition, awareness of
   associated potential limb-threatening conditions, accurate diagnosis of
   functional ligament deficiency, careful surgical planning, and dedicated
   rehabilitation. In this article, we summarize our approach to these
   serious injuries and how it has evolved with our experience. To
   establish the diagnosis, we rely on a thorough knee examination with
   adjunctive stress radiographs. Although we routinely use magnetic
   resonance imaging to characterize these injuries, we recognize that the
   intense signal generated by excessive edema may overcall injury. We
   advocate single-stage reconstruction of all injured structures at the
   index procedure pursuing early surgical intervention within 2 weeks if
   the pattern includes an injury to either corner/collateral. Except in
   some medial collateral ligament injuries amenable to primary repair, we
   augment corner/collateral repairs with free graft reconstruction to
   protect the repair and allow early motion. Our postoperative
   rehabilitation protocol emphasizes early protected range of motion to
   prevent stiffness. Using these principles, we have been able to reliably
   restore function and stability after these potentially devastating
   injuries. Although we have been pleased with our results, we acknowledge
   the ongoing evolution in the treatment of multiple-ligament knee
   injuries and will continue to refine our technique to improve our
   outcomes. Oper Tech Sports Med 18:235-244 (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In times of demand shocks, when quantitative forecasting based on

   information, depending on the patterns of the particular time series.
   This constitutes the applicability of the procedure within an industrial
   application where a large number of time series is automatically
   forecasted in a flexible and data-driven way. The architecture of such a
   planning system is explained and using real-world data from a

   (patho)physiological processes, such as neurodegenerative disorders.
   Survivin's dual function as an apoptosis inhibitor and a mitotic
   regulator is crucial not only for ordered development but its modulation
   seems crucial also under disease conditions. However, data on the
   expression and function of the guinea pig Survivin protein
   (Survivin(Gp)) are currently lacking.
   Results: Here, we here report the cloning and functional
   characterization of Survivin(Gp). The respective cDNA was cloned from
   spleen mRNA, containing a 426 bp open reading frame encoding for a
   protein of 142aa. Survivin(Gp) displays a high homology to the human and
   murine orthologue, especially in domains critical for function, such as
   binding sites for chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) proteins and the
   nuclear export signal (NES). Notably, phylogenetic analyses revealed
   that Survivin(Gp) is more related to humans than to rodents. Ectopic
   expression studies of a Survivin(Gp)-GFP fusion confirmed its dynamic
   intracellular localization, analogous to the human and murine
   counterparts. In interphase cells, Survivin(Gp)-GFP was predominantly
   cytoplasmic and accumulated in the nucleus following export inhibition
   with leptomycin B (LMB). A typical CPC protein localization during
   mitosis was observed for Survivin(Gp)-GFP. Microinjection experiments
   together with genetic knockout demonstrated that the NES is essential
   for the anti-apoptotic and regulatory role of Survivin(Gp) during cell
   division. In vivo protein interaction assays further demonstrated its
   dimerization with human Survivin and its interaction with human CPC
   proteins. Importantly. RNAi-depletion studies show that Survivin(Gp) can
   fully substitute for human Survivin as an apoptosis inhibitor and a
   mitotic effector. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western
   blotting were employed to detect Survivin expression in guinea pig
   tissues. Besides its expression in proliferating tissues, such as spleen
   and liver, we also found Survivin in terminally differentiated cell
   types. Importantly. Survivin was detectable also in the cochlea,
   suggesting a potential role for Survivin in the auditory system.
   Conclusions: We provide the first experimental evidence for the
   expression of Survivin in the guinea pig. As Survivin(Gp) can substitute
   for known functions of human Survivin, the guinea pig model will now
   also allow investigating Survivin's (patho)physiological role and to
   test Survivin-directed potential therapeutic strategies. (C) 2010

   treatments, the Rhizobium was superior than Azatobacter in enhancing Pb
   uptake by the plant. In roots and stem all the treatments either in
   single culture or co-culture inoculation showed significant increase in

   right ventricle and form the inception cohort. Of this group, 17 (43\%)
   had visceral metastases and two had bilateral synchronous tumours.
   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy appropriate to the pre-operative stage caused
   reduction in intravascular tumour in 18 (45\%) patients, allowing 3
   children who had atrial tumour at presentation to be surgically managed
   without recourse to cardiopulmonary bypass. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   also provided a window of opportunity to assess and manage co-morbidity
   especially malnutrition. Of the inception cohort, 31 (78\%) underwent
   surgical resection; 23 had simple cavotomy, one caval resection and
   seven resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. There was one
   post-operative death. 77\% of resected specimen contained viable
   malignant cells despite one or more cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
   Retrograde extension into caval tributaries threatened the completeness
   of resection in all patients necessitating the addition of
   post-operative radiotherapy. Of nine patients who did not undergo
   resection, five died pre-operatively. Three of these children died of

Abstract = {{Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a rare form of valvular heart disease

   substances produced by the tumour are able to reach the systemic
   circulation. By contrast, in ovarian carcinoid tumours carcinoid heart
   disease develops in the absence of liver metastasis, because vasoactive
   substances can be released directly into the systemic circulation,
   bypassing the first-pass metabolism of the liver. There are only a few
   case reports in the world literature of carcinoid heart disease caused

Abstract = {{Aim. The aim of this study is to describe the benefits of video home
   training on families' health and interaction from the perspective of
   parents six months after the training.
   Background. There is hardly any empirical knowledge of how a
   resource-enhancing approach could be used in nursing practice and how
   nursing in a home context affects the families' health outcomes and
   interaction.
   Design. The study was designed as a descriptive qualitative service
   evaluation.
   Methods. Fifteen families with 66 family members participated in the
   study. The study material consisted of videotapes recorded at homes and
   family service plans produced during the process of the video home
   training. The data were analysed by qualitative content analysis and by
   the method of analysing photographs and videotapes.
   Results. Video home training was found to bring about many positive
   effects on families' health and interaction. The families had reached
   their goals related to parenthood, relationship between the partners,
   childcare skills and child-rearing skills.
   Conclusion. The entire family benefited from the video home training.
   Video home training can be recommended in providing families with early
   support and anticipating and preventing family problems.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Video home training is applicable to
   family nursing owing to the concrete and interactive nature of the
   method. It supports the realisation of family centredness and family
   orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetics is a field that has swiftly gained momentum over the past
   few years. It has been associated with applications in development,
   evolution and pathogenesis. In recent studies, however, a link has
   surfaced that connects epigenetic changes and transplantation. From its
   very beginning, transplantation medicine has been confronted with the
   looming specter of transplant rejection. It has been shown that
   epigenetic changes are at least partly involved in transplant outcomes;
   it is therefore of great importance to further investigate the exact
   mechanisms affecting transplantation outcome. The use of epigenetic
   markers for the determination of graft prognosis and the diagnosis of
   transplant rejection status promises to be an efficient and accurate
   means in clinical applications. As will be discussed in this review,
   enlisting the help of epigenetic mechanisms might not only facilitate
   the diagnosis of graft rejection, but also contribute to attenuation of
   transplant rejection. This would be a very desirable aid to the field of
   transplant medicine. {[}Discovery Medicine 10(55):511-520, december

Abstract = {{This paper uses a methodological framework based on the new advances of
   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a sample of 71 developed, developing
   and under-developed countries to model and evaluate their biodiversity
   performance. Specifically, by using conditional DEA, bootstrapping and
   kernel density estimations, the efficiency levels of these countries are
   compared and analysed in such a way as to show whether the countries
   environmental policies have been used efficiently in order to enhance
   biodiversity. Our empirical results indicate that there are major
   inefficiencies among the countries considered in terms of their
   biodiversity performances revealing that population level is the
   dominant threat of countries' biodiversity performance followed up by
   GDP per capita and income inequalities. At the same time CO2 per capita,
   population, income inequalities and GDP per capita have different impact
   on developed, under-developed and developing countries which implies
   that environmental policies must be adopted and implemented accordingly.

Abstract = {{Patients with osteoporosis have an increased risk of sustaining
   fractures because of the low bone mineral density (BMD) and altered bone
   micro-architecture which are characteristic features of the disease.
   Although a good correlation exists between BMD and fracture risks, many
   other factors influence this relationship. While there is consensus that
   patients with osteoporosis should be investigated and treated, the issue
   is much less clear for patients with osteopenia. Because osteopenia is
   so prevalent, it would be unrealistic to treat all patients with this
   condition. Therefore, there is a need to identify those patients who are
   at risk of sustaining a fracture and would benefit most from the
   available therapy. Providing treatment to the appropriate risk group
   would not only reduce the number of fractures, but could also reduce the
   adverse effects associated with treatment, as treating patients earlier
   could shorten the treatment time. The availability of tools to select
   patients at risk of fracture should change the impact of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the changing German perceptions of Romania in the
   late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The impact of growing
   economic and political interaction, coupled with orientalist assumptions
   about the nature of Balkan society, shaped a particular understanding of
   Romanian society. Romanian elites were often portrayed as westernizing
   and modern, whereas the peasantry was backward and effeminate. The
   Romanian entry into the First World War on the side of Germany's enemies
   prompted a radical revision in German attitudes toward Romanians, as the
   Romanian elite suddenly emerged as a degenerate and effeminate force
   preying on an honest peasantry. The alleged unchecked power of women
   over an emasculated male elite was blamed for moral degeneracy and
   political disaster. The experience of occupation and ambitions for
   post-war domination prompted yet another revision, as Germans sought a
   usable collaborationist class. As a result, the Romanian elite was
   bifurcated between good and bad, pro-Entente and pro-German, and the
   peasantry emerged as a legitimizer of Germany's modernizing mission.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown that ambient particulate
   matter (PM) and changes in air temperature are associated with increased
   cardiopulmonary events.
   OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that patients with previous myocardial
   infarction (MI) experience changes in heart rate (HR) and repolarization
   parameters, such as Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTc), and T-wave
   amplitude (Tamp), in association with increases in air pollution and
   temperature changes.
   METHODS: Between May 2003 and February 2004, 67 MI survivors from the
   Augsburg KORA-MI registry repeatedly sent 16 sec electrocardiograms
   (ECGs) with a personal transmitter (Viapac) via telephone to the Philips
   Monitoring Center, where ECG parameters were immediately analyzed.
   Meteorological data and air pollutants were acquired from fixed
   monitoring sites on an hourly basis. Additive mixed models were used for
   analysis. Effect modification by patient characteristics was
   investigated.
   RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,745 ECGs revealed an increased HR
   associated with interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM levels among
   participants not using beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and among those
   with body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2). We observed a 24- to 47-hr lagged
   QTc prolongation {[}0.5\% change (95\% confidence interval, 0.0-1.0\%)]
   in association with IQR increases in levels of PM <= 2.5 mu m in
   aerodynamic diameter, especially in patients with one {[}0.6\%
   (0.1-1.0\%)] or two {[}1.2\% (0.4-2.1\%)] minor alleles of the nuclear
   factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2) single-nucleotide
   polymorphism rs2364725. Positive immediate (0-23 hr) and inverse delayed
   (48-71 hr up to 96-119 hr) associations were evident between PM and
   Tamp. We detected an inverse U-shaped association between temperature
   and Tamp, with a maximum Tamp at 5 C.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased air pollution levels and temperature changes may
   lead to changes in HR and repolarization parameters that may be
   precursors of cardiac problems.}},

   September 15, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00273.2010.-Small hibernating
   mammals show regular oscillations in their heart rate and body
   temperature throughout the winter. Long periods of torpor are abruptly
   interrupted by arousals with heart rates that rapidly increase from 5
   beats/min to over 400 beats/min and body temperatures that increase by
   similar to 30 degrees C only to drop back into the hypothermic torpid
   state within hours. Surgically implanted transmitters were used to
   obtain high-resolution electrocardiogram and body temperature data from
   hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus
   tridecemlineatus). These data were used to construct a model of the
   circulatory system to gain greater understanding of these rapid and
   extreme changes in physiology. Our model provides estimates of metabolic
   rates during the torpor-arousal cycles in different model compartments
   that would be difficult to measure directly. In the compartment that
   models the more metabolically active tissues and organs (heart, brain,
   liver, and brown adipose tissue) the peak metabolic rate occurs at a
   core body temperature of 19 degrees C approximately midway through an
   arousal. The peak metabolic rate of the active tissues is nine times the
   normothermic rate after the arousal is complete. For the overall
   metabolic rate in all tissues, the peak-toresting ratio is five. This
   value is high for a rodent, which provides evidence for the hypothesis
   that the arousal from torpor is limited by the capabilities of the
   cardiovascular system.}},

Abstract = {{In order to classify digital spaces in terms of digital-homotopic
   theoretical tools, a recent paper by Han (2006b) (see also the works of
   Boxer and Karaca (2008) as well as Han (2007b)) established the notion
   of regular covering space from the viewpoint of digital covering theory
   and studied an automorphism group (or Deck's discrete transformation
   group) of a digital covering. By using these tools, we can calculate
   digital fundamental groups of some digital spaces and classify digital
   covering spaces satisfying a radius 2 local isomorphism (Boxer and
   Karaca, 2008; Han, 2006b; 2008b; 2008d; 2009b). However, for a digital
   covering which does not satisfy a radius 2 local isomorphism, the study
   of a digital fundamental group of a digital space and its automorphism
   group remains open. In order to examine this problem, the present paper
   establishes the notion of an ultra regular covering space, studies its
   various properties and calculates an automorphism group of the ultra
   regular covering space. In particular, the paper develops the notion of
   compatible adjacency of a digital wedge. By comparing an ultra regular
   covering space with a regular covering space, we can propose strong
   merits of the former.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that the IgM MAb B6.1, specific for
   beta-1,2-mannotriose on the surface of the cell wall of Candida
   albicans, prevents mice from disseminated candidiasis. The preventive
   activity of the antibody is mediated by enhanced phagocytosis that
   caused killing of the fungus and involvement of the complement system.
   In the present study, MAb B6.1 was tested if the antibody enhances
   therapeutic efficacy of amphotericin B (Amp B) in a murine model of
   disseminated candidiasis due to C. albicans. Determination by the
   kidneys-cfu (colony forming unit) and survival times was used to assess
   treatment. Mice treated intraperitoneally with MAb B6.1 at 1 h
   post-infection with C. albicans (5 x 10(5) yeast cells/mouse) developed
   fewer 28\%cfu and prolonged survival rates than negative controls,
   whereas administration of B6.1 to mice at 2 h post-infection was
   ineffective. Therapeutic effect of Amp B on mice with the disseminated
   disease was dose-dependent, but dosage of Amp B (0.5 mg/kg body weight
   of mice) was not effective. A combination of MAb B6.1given at 1 h
   post-infection plus Amp B (0.5 mg dose) enhanced survival times beyond
   the effect due to only antibody (P<0.05). The MST (mean survival times)
   value resulted from the combination therapy-received mice was as almost
   the same as MST value from 2 mg dose of Amp B-given animals (P<0.05). In
   case mice given a combination of Amp B (0.5 mg dose) plus MAb B6.1 at 2
   h post-infection - a condition of developing no therapeutic efficacy,
   the combination also reduced disease severity. All these data indicate
   that MAb B6.1 acts in concert with Amp B, the antibody enhances
   therapeutic efficacy of Amp B, and this combination therapy augments
   protection which implies a possibility of reducing Amp B dose. The
   augmentation of the response appeared to be specific because an
   irrelevant IgM carbohydrate-specific MAb was not protective. In
   conclusion, these studies show that Amp B combined with MAb B6.1 may be
   an option of solving the problem of limited antifungal drug choices due
   to drug-resistant C albicans (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims:
   Although Helicobacter pylori eradication decreases the incidence of
   metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic treatment for early gastric
   cancer (EGC), metachronous cancer still develops after successful
   eradication, particularly in patients with severe corpus gastritis. We
   investigated whether the extent of atrophic fundic gastritis diagnosed
   by autofluorescence imaging (AFI) videoendoscopy is predictive of
   development of metachronous gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication
   in patients treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for EGC.
   Patients and Methods:
   A total of 82 patients who underwent ESD for EGC from 2003 to 2006, who
   received eradication therapy participated in this study. The extent of
   chronic atrophic fundic gastritis was evaluated by AFI and categorized
   into closed and open type. The main outcome was the incidence of
   metachronous gastric cancer detected by annual surveillance endoscopy.
   Results:
   During a median observation period of 55 months, metachronous gastric
   cancer developed in 12 of 82 patients (14.6\%). Multivariate Cox's
   proportional hazard analysis revealed that open-type, atrophic fundic
   gastritis diagnosed by AFI was significantly associated with development
   of metachronous gastric cancer (hazard ratio: 4.88, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.32-18.2, P = 0.018) after adjustment for age, sex,
   histological intestinal metaplasia, serum pepsinogen level, and H.
   pylori status.
   Conclusions:
   Metachronous EGC developed after successful H. pylori eradication, and
   extensive atrophic fundic gastritis diagnosed by AFI was a significant
   predictor, thus it could identify patients undergoing ESD for EGC who
   still required intensive surveillance after eradication.}},

Abstract = {{If consumer participation is to be translated from rhetoric into
   reality, the attitudes of health professionals need to be addressed.
   Educational strategies can play an important role, but measures of
   attitudes are needed to determine the effectiveness of these strategies.
   This paper seeks to establish the Mental Health Consumer Participation
   Questionnaire (MHCPQ) on psychometric grounds, and explore attitude
   levels. Overall, the 150 nursing students who participated saw consumer
   participation in a favourable light, although this varied with the
   nature and extent of involvement. Psychometric properties, attitude
   structure, and attitude differences are reported. The MHCPQ displays
   good face validity and can be further developed and used in mental
   health-care settings.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional fossil diesel fuel and renewable diesel fuel based on
   hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) were compared regarding the oxidation
   characteristics of the generated soot particulate. The comparison was
   performed by utilizing a high-temperature oxidation tandem differential
   mobility analyser in which monodisperse soot aerosol was first selected
   and then heated in a high-temperature furnace. The particle size
   reduction caused by oxidation during the furnace treatment was then
   measured as a function of furnace temperature. The results indicate that
   soot oxidation is very similar between the studied fuels. This is
   supported by the obtained HR-TEM images and EELS-spectra which were
   practically indistinguishable between different fuels and engine
   conditions. The similar oxidation properties and surface structure
   between fossil and HVO-based diesel fuels imply that the oxidative
   aftertreatment devices designed for fossil diesel should work well also
   with the studied renewable diesel fuel. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   range of possible outcomes divided into intervals, and estimated each
   interval's likelihood of including the true answer. The superiority of
   this Subjective Probability Interval Estimate (SPIES) method is robust
   to range widths and interval grain sizes. Its carryover effects are
   observed even in subsequent estimates made using the conventional, 90\%
   confidence interval method: judges who first made SPIES judgments
   considered a broader range of values in subsequent conventional interval
   estimates as well.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose a simple and general analytical model describing the
   operation of a velocity-map-imaging spectrometer. We show that such a
   spectrometer, possibly equipped with a magnifying lens, can be
   efficiently modeled by combining analytical expressions for the axial
   potential distributions along with a transfer matrix method. The model
   leads transparently to the prediction of the instrument's operating
   conditions as well as to its resolution. A photoelectron
   velocity-map-imaging spectrometer with a magnifying lens, built and
   operated along the lines suggested by the model has been successfully
   employed for recording images at threshold photoionization of atomic
   lithium. The model's reliability is demonstrated by the fairly good
   agreement between experimental results and calculations. Finally, the
   limitations of the analytical method along with possible
   generalizations, extensions, and potential applications are also
   discussed. The model may serve as a guide for users interested in
   building and operating such spectrometers as well as a tutorial tool.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The clinical diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a
   dichotomous (yes/no) categorization necessary for clinical
   decision-making. However, such dichotomous diagnostic categories do not
   convey an individual's subtle and temporal gradations in severity of the
   condition, and have poor statistical power when used as an outcome
   measure in research. This study evaluated the validity and potential
   utility of a continuous type score to index severity of CRPS.
   Psychometric and medical evaluations were conducted in 114 CRPS patients
   and 41 non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients. Based on the presence/absence
   of 17 clinically-assessed signs and symptoms of CRPS, an overall CRPS
   Severity Score (CSS) was derived. The CSS discriminated well between
   CRPS and non-CRPS patients (p < .001), and displayed strong associations
   with dichotomous CRPS diagnoses using both IASP diagnostic criteria (Eta
   = 0.69) and proposed revised criteria (Eta = 0.77-0.88). Higher CSS was
   associated with significantly higher clinical pain intensity, distress,
   and functional impairments, as well as greater bilateral temperature
   asymmetry and thermal perception abnormalities (p's < .05). In an
   archival prospective dataset, increases in anxiety and depression from
   pre-surgical baseline to 4 weeks post-knee arthroplasty were found to
   predict significantly higher CSS at 6- and 12-month follow-up (p's <
   .05). Results indicate the CSS corresponds with and complements
   currently accepted dichotomous diagnostic criteria for CRPS, and support
   its validity as an index of CRPS severity. Its utility as an outcome
   measure in research studies is also suggested, with potential
   statistical advantages over dichotomous diagnostic criteria. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic properties of rigid fractal aggregates are key
   ingredients in understanding the governing mechanism of their motion and
   the properties of their suspensions. In the present work we outline
   explicit equations for the estimation of the complete set of
   hydrodynamic properties of arbitrary shaped aggregates made of uniform
   sized spherical primary particles. The rigid body motion equations are
   coupled to Stokesian dynamics model to derive hydrodynamic rigid body
   properties. A wide library of clusters consisting of fractal aggregates
   of different morphologies (d(f) = 1.8-3.0) and spheroidal clusters of
   different axes ratios with broad range of number of constitutive spheres
   (N-sphere = 10-1000) was used. Using the developed hydrodynamic rigid
   body properties' equations quantities such as the hydrodynamic radii of
   translational (R-H) and rotational (R-omega) motion, and all
   hydrodynamic information for each cluster, contained in its grand
   resistance matrix, are found. Furthermore, the relations between
   different hydrodynamic properties of average clusters and their
   morphology are investigated. In the effort to introduce a simplified
   model that accurately reproduces the complex hydrodynamic behavior of a
   fractal cluster, two approaches are discussed, namely, an equivalent
   sphere model and an equivalent ellipsoid model. The predicted
   hydrodynamic properties from both approaches, which can be computed
   exactly, closely match those of the clusters, for all cluster masses and
   morphologies, with the equivalent ellipsoid model being more effective
   whenever the cluster anisotropy is crucial. Therefore, this simplified
   approach provides an effective tool to predict the behavior of any
   cluster with complex structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In an effort to reduce the negative impact of civil aviation on the
   human environment, trajectory optimisation techniques have been used to
   minimise the single event impact of noise and gaseous emissions of
   departures on communities in the vicinity of airports. For this purpose,
   the earlier developed trajectory optimisation tool NOISHHH has been
   adapted to design departure trajectories optimised for environmental
   criteria, based on area navigation. The new version of NOISHHH combines
   a noise model, an emissions inventory model, a geographic information
   system and a dynamic trajectory optimisation algorithm to generate
   flight paths with minimised environmental impact. Operational
   constraints have been introduced to ensure that the resulting flight
   paths are fully compliant with he guidelines and regulations that apply
   to the design of standard instrument departures and the use of area
   navigation. To illustrate the capabilities of the new version of
   NOISHHH, two numerical examples are presented, which are both redesigns
   of standard instrument departures currently in use at Amsterdam Airport

Abstract = {{The effect of the type of reinforcement was studied using Charpy impact
   test as well as hardness test. The material used is composed of
   polyester reinforced with fiber glass; a material increasingly and
   widely used in plenty of engineering applications, recently. In order to
   maximize the output of the present work, studies were carried out on
   different weight fraction of reinforcement. Two types of composite
   reinforcement were tested, namely the use of chopped fibers (randomly
   distributed glass fibers) and woven roving (laying fibers normal to the
   randomly distributed ones). It has been noted that the values of the
   Charpy impact resistance and hardness of the tested specimens, yield
   increases for weight fractions of reinforcement of about 30\% to 40\%.
   The results show that there is a scatter in the values of Charpy impact
   resistance and hardness in the ranges of weight fraction below and
   higher than the 30\% to 40\% range. It is also observed that the values
   of Charpy impact resistance and hardness of the chopped composites are
   higher than those of chopped and woven roven ones due to the fiber
   distribution and orientation. The direction of the load is at random
   angles of orientation to the Chopped fibers in the case of Chopped
   fibers. The paper discusses the results to explain the out coming
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{Hominins living in southern India 74,000 years ago faced a deteriorating
   environment, as the global climate moved from interglacial into full
   glacial conditions. At the same time, South Asian populations witnessed
   the widespread deposition of tephra from the Sumatran Toba
   super-eruption, the largest explosive volcanic event of the past two
   million years. Here we report new data on the lithic technology and
   environmental context for a southern Indian site with hominin occupation
   in association with Toba tephra deposits: Jwalapuram Locality 3 in the
   Jurreru Valley. Sedimentological and isotopic studies demonstrate that a
   cooling trend was in effect in this part of southern India prior to the
   eruption, and that thick deposits of ash in the Jurreru Valley supported
   grassland communities before more wooded conditions were re-established.
   Detailed technological analyses of an expanded lithic sample from
   Locality 3 suggest cultural continuity after the eruptive event, and
   comparisons with lithic core technologies elsewhere indicate that Homo
   sapiens cannot be ruled out as the creator of these Middle Palaeolithic
   assemblages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a critique of the use of the Maximizing Access to
   Quality (MAQ) instrument supplemented by non-participant observation as
   a way of assessing the quality of nursing care in primary care clinics
   in the north-eastern Badia of Jordan, where populated by Bedouin. The
   MAQ checklist with non-participant observation of clinic care was used
   to assess the quality of care in four comprehensive health centres. In
   the four comprehensive health centres, more than half of the indicators
   for measuring the quality of the physical conditions were adequate. In
   relation to personnel, general practitioners were available, but
   in-service training was needed and no social workers were available.
   Provision of health services was optimal in three of the clinics but was
   less than optimal in the remotest clinic. Health education was done
   sporadically and continuity of care was the main challenge in provision
   in the four clinics. The MAQ checklist for assessing the quality of
   health provision in maternal and child health and reproductive services
   is a useful instrument to capture a snapshot of health-care provision;
   however, it is not suited to a rural setting.}},

Abstract = {{Like in other vertebrates, the anterior part of the telencephalon of
   amphibians mainly consists of the olfactory bulb (OB), but different
   from higher vertebrates, the lateral telencephalic ventricles of larval
   Xenopus laevis expand deep into the anterior telencephalon. The
   neurogenic periventricular zone (PVZ) of the lateral ventricles
   generates new OB neurons throughout the animal's lifetime. We
   investigated the ultrastructural organization of the PVZ and found that
   within a time period of 24 h, 42.54 +/- 6.65\% of all PVZ cells were
   actively proliferating. Functional purinergic receptors are widespread
   in the central nervous system and their activation has been associated
   with many critical physiological processes, including the regulation of
   cell proliferation. In the present study we identified and characterized
   the purinergic system of the OB and the PVZ. ATP and 2MeSATP induced
   strong {[}Ca2+](i) increases in cells of both regions, which could be
   attenuated by purinergic antagonists. However, a more thorough
   pharmacological investigation revealed clear differences between the two
   brain regions. Cells of the OB almost exclusively express ionotropic P2X
   purinergic receptor subtypes, whereas PVZ cells express both ionotropic
   P2X and metabotropic P1 and P2Y receptor subtypes. The P2X receptors
   expressed in the OB are evidently not involved in the immediate
   processing of olfactory information.}},

Abstract = {{Many goods are marketed after first stating a list price, with the
   expectation that the eventual sales price will differ. In this article,
   we first present a simple model of search behavior that includes the
   seller setting a list price. Holding constant the mean of the buyers'
   distribution of potential offers for a good, we assume that the greater
   the list price, the slower the arrival rate of offers but the greater is
   the maximal offer. This trade-off determines the optimal list price,
   which is set simultaneously with the seller's reservation price.
   Comparative statics are derived through a set of numerical sensitivity
   tests, where we show that the greater the variance of the distribution
   of buyers' potential offers, the greater is the ratio of the list price
   to expected sales price. Thus, sellers of atypical goods will tend to
   set a relatively high list price compared with standard goods. We test
   this hypothesis using data from the Columbus, Ohio, housing market and
   find substantial support. We also find empirical support for another
   hypothesis of the model: atypical dwellings take longer to sell.}},

Abstract = {{Miniature digitising electronics have been coupled to a detector based
   on an organic liquid scintillator to form a digital neutron and gamma
   spectrometer. The electronics used are small enough to be packaged with
   a detector to form an easily portable unit. This miniaturisation has
   some impact on the achievable sampling rate and resolution, in
   comparison with the bulkier devices often used for such an application,
   so it is not clear which of the many pulse shape discrimination
   algorithms reported in the literature is best suited for use with this
   device. To explore this, the spectrometer was exposed to a selection of
   the radiation fields available at NPL, and three different neutron/gamma
   discrimination algorithms were compared on an equal footing. The energy
   resolution of the device, and its ease of use, were compared with those
   of a conventional analogue system. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{Risk is always associated to Exploration \& Production projects, mainly
   due to the geological, economic and technological uncertainties. In the
   development phase, these uncertainties strongly influence the oil
   recovery. The acquisition of additional information and flexibility are
   key points to risk mitigation. The value of information quantifies the
   benefits of new information and flexibility can be added to the project
   considering various possible scenarios; it offers the opportunity to
   improve projects by changing decisions in the future. Decision makers
   can develop giant fields immediately without information and assume the
   risks or acquire more information and delay the project, adding
   flexibility to it, such as flexible facilities, intelligent wells and
   development by modules, which is the focus of this work.
   A methodology to quantify the risk of a modular implantation of large
   petroleum fields was proposed. Evaluations of the expected monetary
   value (EMV), with and without information on possible scenarios, are
   based on the value of information (Vol). Geological uncertainties are
   integrated to different production strategies through the geological
   representative models (GRM). The net present value (NPV) method,
   supported by the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT), evaluates the
   return and risk of each possible scenario. The proposed methodology was
   applied in a case study based on a Brazilian offshore field in order to
   mitigate the risk associated to its development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To review 12 cases of postoperative detachment and spontaneous
   reattachment of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty
   (DSAEK) lenticles.
   DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.
   METHODS: This was a review of patients undergoing DSAEK at 7
   institutions. Patients who had a significant detachment of their DSAEK
   lenticle during the postoperative period were identified and divided
   into 2 groups. Significant detachment was defined as either complete
   central interface fluid with bare peripheral attachment (group 1) or a
   free-floating lenticle in the anterior chamber (group 2). Patients who
   subsequently had a spontaneous reattachment of the lenticle were
   identified, with data regarding surgical technique and intraoperative
   and postoperative complications collected for analysis.
   RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 12 eyes of 12 patients who met the
   definition of significant postoperative detachment with subsequent
   spontaneous reattachment. Four patients had complete central detachment
   with peripheral attachment (group 1), whereas 8 patients had a
   free-floating lenticle (group 2). Ten of the 12 patients had a
   successful outcome as defined as an attached and clear DSAEK lenticle.
   In our study, reattachment was seen as early as 5 days and as late as 7
   months after surgery, with reattachment in 9 of 12 patients by day 25.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous reattachment of detached DSAEK lenticles may
   occur during the postoperative period. The decision of when to bring the

Abstract = {{Canine influenza virus (CIV) emerged around 2000 when an equine
   influenza virus (EIV) was transmitted to dogs in Florida. After 2003,
   the canine virus was carried by infected greyhounds to various parts of
   the United States and then became established in several large animal
   shelters, where it has continued to circulate. To better understand the
   evolution of CIV since its emergence, and particularly its
   microevolution in spatially restricted populations, we examined multiple
   gene segments of CIV from dogs resident in two large animal shelters in
   New York City during the period 2006 to 2009. In particular, we focused
   on viruses circulating in the two shelters in 2008 and 2009, which we
   found shared a common ancestor. While viruses in each shelter were
   generally monophyletic, we observed some gene flow between them. These
   shelter sequences were compared to earlier CIV isolates. The shelter
   viruses differed in 1 to 6 amino acids in each gene segment compared to
   viruses isolated in Florida between 2003 and 2005 and in Colorado in
   2006 and 2008. A comparison of the sequences of equine and canine
   viruses revealed amino acid replacements that distinguished the viruses
   from the two hosts, but no clear evidence of positive selection
   indicative of host adaptation was detected, suggesting that any host
   range adaptation in CIV occurred early in the emergence of this virus or
   even before it transferred to dogs.}},

   reduce springback. In the optimization model, a mathematical formulation
   of stress difference was developed as an indicator of the degree of
   springback instead of implicit springback analysis. Explicit finite
   element method (FEM) was used to analyze the forming process and to
   provide the stress distribution for calculating the amount of the stress
   indicator. In addition, multi-island genetic algorithm (MGA) was
   employed to seek the optimal loading condition. A case study was
   performed to demonstrate the potential of the suggested method. The
   results show that the optimization design of process parameters
   effectively reduces the amount of springback and improves the part shape
   accuracy. It provides a guideline for controlling springback in stretch

   successfully performed in an ionic liquid (IL)/buffer biphasic system.
   Five ILs were analyzed, however, a hydrophobic IL
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}BMIM]PF6) showed the
   best bio-compatibility with PGUS-E. An obvious enhancement in the
   initial reaction rate, substrate conversion, GAMG yield and chemical
   bond selectivity (S-cb) was observed using 40\% (v/v) {[}BMIM]PF6/buffer
   as the reaction medium when compared to the acetate buffer medium. Under
   the optimized conditions (pH 6.0, temperature 50 degrees C, substrate
   concentration 6 mM and shaking speed 200 rpm), the initial reaction
   rate, the GAMG yield and the S-cb reached 3.15 mM h(-1), 74.36\% and
   98.12\%, respectively. The recyclability of {[}BMIM]PF6 was also studied
   and found to be reusable for five batches with high recovery percentage
   (>= 92\%). Furthermore, the desired product and byproduct were easily
   separated since they were distributed in different phases. Additionally,
   higher V-max (3.14 versus 2.24 mM h(-1)), lower apparent K-m (1.21
   versus 1.80 mM) and E-d (25.97 versus 32.60 kJ mol(-1)) were achieved in

Abstract = {{The ultraviolet to near infrared emission of Yb3+ in phosphate glass has
   been investigated. It was found that Yb3+ ions had several emission
   bands at 315, 430, 465, 976 and 1004 nm excited with 265 nm, which
   indicated that the charge transfer states played an important role in
   the emission of Yb3+. In addition, incorporating Gd3+ in the Yb3+-doped
   phosphate glass can greatly increase the intensity of the near-infrared
   emission of Yb3+ and expand the absorbing region from 250 to 400 nm. The
   obtained results would be beneficial for studying new materials, which
   can be used as enhancing the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of
   silicon solar cells via a down shifting process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Based on perturbation theory, we study the dynamics of how dark matter

   treatment on studying the structure formation in the spherical
   collapsing system. Furthermore we examine the cluster number counts

   energy inhomogeneities affect cluster abundances. It is shown that
   cluster number counts can provide specific signature of dark sectors
   interaction and dark energy inhomogeneities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this work was to construct one small interfering
   RNA (siRNA) eukaryotic expression vector targeting rat nuclear factor
   (NF)kappa B p65 and identify its inhibition effect on cell proliferation
   according to its down-regulation of NF-kappa B pathway.
   Methods. The p65siRNA expression vector ``pGenesil-1.2-p65siRNA{''} and
   negative control plasmid ``HK{''} were transfected into the cultured rat
   cells. After transfection, cells were divided into 4 treatment groups:
   1) control cells cultured in complete. Dulbecco modified Eagle medium;
   2) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mu g/mL); (3) LPS (1 mu g/mL) +
   HK-transfected; 4) LPS (1 mu g/mL) + p65siRNA (pGenesil-1.2-p65siRNA).
   Thereafter, the protein levels of NF-kappa B p65 in the cells were
   detected by Western blotting at 72 hours after LPS stimulation.
   Furthermore, to observe cell proliferation, the proliferative rate of
   the cell growth was evaluated by the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay
   (at 24, 48, and 72 hours). The cell cycle distribution at 72 hours was
   detected by flow cytometry.
   Results. p65siRNA effectively down-regulated the protein level of p65 (P
   < .05). Meanwhile, the proliferation of cells transfected with p65siRNA
   expression vector was significantly inhibited (P < .05), the ratio of
   cells at G(0)/G(1) stage markedly increased, and the proportion of cells
   at S stage was significantly decreased among transfected compared with
   control cells (P < .05).
   Conclusions. p65siRNA effectively suppressed NF-kappa B, expression,
   inhibiting rat cell proliferation induced by NF-kappa B signal pathway
   activation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA SCRIPTA}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We elaborate two generic methods for producing two-dimensional (2D)
   spatial soliton arrays (SSAs) in the framework of the cubic-quintic (CQ)
   complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model. The first approach deals with a
   broad beam launched into the dissipative nonlinear medium which is
   equipped with an imprinted grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The
   beam splits into a cluster of jets, each subsequently self-trapping into
   a stable soliton, if the power is sufficient. We consider two kinds of
   sharp gratings-'raised-cosine' (RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices-and
   two types of input beams: fundamental and vortical. By selecting
   appropriate parameters, this method makes it possible to create various
   types of soliton arrays, such as solid, annular (with single and double
   rings) and cross-shaped ones. The second method uses a `virtual
   lattice', in the form of a periodic transverse phase modulation
   imprinted into the broad beam which is passed through an appropriate
   phase mask and then shone into a uniform nonlinear medium. Two different
   types of masks are considered; in the form of a `checkerboard' or
   `tilings'. In these cases, broad fundamental and vortical beams may also
   evolve into stable SSAs if the beam power and spacing of the virtual
   phase lattice are large enough. By means of the latter technique,
   square-shaped, hexagonal and quasi-crystalline SSAs can be created.}},

   heat generation and propagation driven by an electric current pulse are
   simulated during the switching process. Graphitic filament breakage and
   growth are responsible for resistance switching. The simulation shows
   that a short and strong voltage pulse induces graphitic filament
   breakage, resulting in a high-resistance state, whereas a moderate but
   much longer pulse is required to enable filament growth, resulting in a
   low-resistance state. Key factors such as the bias condition and the
   power supply for such switching process are also studied. The results
   are quantitatively consistent with experimental measurements.}},

   found to be enhanced by plasma resistivity, which is in such a range
   that the growth rate of the modes induced by the latter alone is
   comparable with that of the modes mediated by the former alone, and vice
   versa. Otherwise the growth rate of the modes is equal to the higher of

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the current frequency of DT, the risks
   associated with DT, and to understand how physicians select patients to
   have DT.
   Methods: Between January 2007 and July 2008, all patients in Ontario,
   Canada who received an ICD were enrolled in this prospective registry.
   Results: A total of 2,173 patients were included; 58\% had new ICD
   implants for primary prevention, 25\% for secondary prevention, and 17\%
   had pulse generator replacement. DT was carried out at the time of ICD
   implantation or predischarge in 65\%, 67\%, and 24\% of primary,
   secondary, and replacement cases respectively (P = < 0.0001). The
   multivariate predictors of a decision to conduct DT included: new ICD
   implant (OR = 13.9, P < 0.0001), dilated cardiomyopathy (OR = 1.8, P <
   0.0001), amiodarone use (OR = 1.5, P = 0.004), and LVEF > 20\% (OR =
   1.3, P = 0.05). A history of atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.58, P = 0.0001)
   or oral anticoagulant use (OR = 0.75, P = 0.03) was associated with a
   lower likelihood of having DT. Age, gender, NYHA class, and history of
   stroke or TIA did not predict DT. Perioperative complications, including
   death, myocardial infarction, stroke, tamponade, pneumothorax, heart
   failure, infection, wound hematoma, and lead dislodgement, were similar
   among patients with (8.7\%) and without (8.3\%) DT (P = 0.7)
   Conclusions: DT is performed in two-thirds of new ICD implants but only
   one-quarter of ICD replacements. Physicians favored performance of DT in

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{851-872}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{RNA-binding motif (RBM) proteins comprise a large family of RNA-binding
   proteins whose functions are poorly understood. Since some RBM proteins
   are candidate alternative splicing factors we examined whether one such
   member of the family, RBM6, exhibited a pattern of nuclear distribution
   and targeting consistent with this role. Using antibodies raised against
   mouse RBM6 to immmunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the
   endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and
   concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to
   splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). Tagged RBM6
   was also targeted to IGCs, although it accumulated in large bodies
   confined to the IGC periphery. The basis of this distribution pattern
   was suggested by the targeting of tagged RBM6 in the giant nuclei (or
   germinal vesicles (GVs)) of Xenopus oocytes. In spread preparations of
   GV contents RBM6 was localized both to lampbrush chromosomes and to the
   surface of many oocyte IGCs, where it was confined to up to 50 discrete
   patches. Each patch of RBM6 labelling corresponded to a bead-like
   structure of 0.5-1 mu m diameter that assembled de novo on the IGC
   surface. Assembly of these novel structures depended on the repetitive
   N-terminal region of RBM6, which acts as a multimerization domain.
   Without this domain, RBM6 was no longer excluded from the IGC interior
   but accumulated homogeneously within it. Assembly of IGC-surface
   structures in mammalian cell lines also depended on the oligomerization
   domain of RBM6. Oligomerization of RBM6 also had morphological effects
   on its other major target in GVs, namely the arrays of nascent
   transcripts visible in lampbrush chromosome transcription units. The
   presence of oligomerized RBM6 on many lampbrush loops caused them to
   appear as dense structures with a spiral morphology that appeared quite
   unlike normal, extended loops. This distribution pattern suggests a new
   role for RBM6 in the co-transcriptional packaging or processing of most
   nascent transcripts.}},

Title = {{Regulating the types of foods and beverages marketed to Australian

Journal = {{NUTRITION \& DIETETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{258-266}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim:
   Any regulation of food marketing to children requires clear definitions
   of the types of foods considered inappropriate and subject to
   restrictions. The aim of this research was to examine the commitments
   made by signatory companies of the Australian Food and Grocery Council's
   Responsible Marketing to Children Initiative regarding the types of
   foods considered appropriate for marketing to children.
   Methods:
   Nutrient criteria developed by signatory food companies were examined by
   comparing (i) thresholds set for negative nutrients (saturated fats,
   added sugars and sodium) and total energy to two existing nutrient
   criteria: Healthy Kids Association and the National Heart Foundation
   Tick, and (ii) the types of foods considered appropriate for marketing
   to children, if applying companies' commitments or the product's
   nutrient profile using the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand
   nutrient profiling tool.
   Results:
   All five company-developed nutrient criteria examined specified higher
   thresholds for negative nutrients compared with existing criteria, and
   were more likely to report negative nutrients per serve rather than per
   100 g. When applying company commitments, 57\% more energy-dense,
   nutrient-poor foods and beverages were considered appropriate for
   marketing to children, compared with nutrient profiling.
   Conclusion:
   Food industry commitments regarding the types of foods considered
   appropriate for marketing to children do not adequately restrict the
   marketing for energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. It is recommended food
   manufacturers who commit to restricting their marketing of unhealthy
   foods to children use a standardised, independent nutrient profiling
   tool based on per 100 g/100 mL to determine the appropriateness of foods
   and beverages for marketing to children.}},

   without much `side effects'. Many non-traditional ways to armor,
   stabilize or restore beaches, including the use of patented precast
   concrete units, geotextile sand-filled bags, green belts,
   bio-engineering, sand fencing, beach-face dewatering systems, integrated

Abstract = {{Why has transnational war volunteering increased so dramatically in the
   Muslim world since 1980? Standard explanations, which emphasize
   U.S.-Saudi support for the 1980s Afghan mujahideen, the growth of

   transnational war volunteering is better explained as the product of a
   pan-Islamic identity movement that grew strong in the 1970s Arab world
   from elite competition among exiled Islamists in international Islamic
   organizations and Muslim regimes. Seeking political relevance and
   increased budgets, Hijaz-based international activists propagated an
   alarmist discourse about external threats to the Muslim nation and
   established a global network of Islamic charities. This ``soft{''}
   pan-Islamic discourse and network enabled Arabs invested in the 1980s
   Afghanistan war to recruit fighters in the name of inter-Muslim
   solidarity. The Arab-Afghan mobilization in turn produced a foreign
   fighter movement that still exists today, as a phenomenon partly
   distinct from al-Qaida. The analysis relies on a new data set on foreign
   fighter mobilizations, rare sources in Arabic, and interviews with

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{P>Calibration, the statistical consistency of forecast distributions and
   the observations, is a central requirement for probabilistic
   predictions. Calibration of continuous forecasts is typically assessed
   using the probability integral transform histogram. In this article, we
   propose significance tests based on scoring rules to assess calibration
   of continuous predictive distributions. For an ideal normal forecast we
   derive the first two moments of two commonly used scoring rules: the
   logarithmic and the continuous ranked probability score. This naturally
   leads to the construction of two unconditional tests for normal
   predictions. More generally, we propose a novel score regression
   approach, where the individual scores are regressed on suitable
   functions of the predictive variance. This conditional approach is
   applicable even for certain nonnormal predictions based on the
   Dawid-Sebastiani score. Two case studies illustrate that the score
   regression approach has typically more power in detecting miscalibrated
   forecasts than the other approaches considered, including a recently
   proposed technique based on conditional exceedance probability curves.}},

Abstract = {{Background Policy and regulatory efforts to reduce Clostridium difficile
   infection (CDI) rates now focus increasingly on the community setting,
   especially residential and nursing homes for the elderly. We aimed to
   describe how potentially infectious diarrhoea is managed in care homes,
   and to explore related infection control and human waste management
   practices.
   Methods A questionnaire was sent to all care homes in Sussex, asking
   about management of diarrhoea and related infection control practices.
   Results Response rate was 41\%. Residents with diarrhoea were reported
   to be isolated promptly in 36\% of homes, and 78.2\% of homes reported
   always wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Most homes
   waited over 24 h before sending stool samples for testing. Human waste
   was disposed of by automated sluice in only 26\% of care homes. Bedpans
   were washed in residents' sinks in 20.7\% of residential homes, and in
   communal baths in 9.6\%.
   Conclusion This study shows that most care homes are not fully compliant
   with current infection prevention and control guidance, and that some
   unacceptable practices are occurring. In order to reduce potential for
   transmission of CDI and other diarrhoeal infection in care homes,
   infection prevention and control practices must be improved, with early
   diagnosis and control.}},

Title = {{Active Living for Rural Children Community Perspectives Using PhotoVOICE}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Active living integrates physical activity into one's daily
   routine. Current understanding of active living among children and their
   families living in rural communities is limited. A community perspective
   is critical to understand the contextual factors that influence
   children's physical activity in rural areas.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the perceived
   environmental factors that support or hinder physical activity among
   rural children to develop testable hypotheses to inform future
   interventions for reducing unhealthy weight gain and preventing chronic
   diseases associated with physical inactivity.
   Methods: PhotoVOICE was used to explore active living opportunities and
   barriers for children living in four low-income, rural U.S. communities.
   In 2007, parents (n=99) and elementary school staff (n=17) received
   disposable cameras to document their perspective. Using their
   photographs and narratives, participants developed emergent themes
   during a facilitated group discussion. In 2008, study authors used the
   Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO) framework to
   categorize the themes.
   Results: Microenvironment themes include physical (e.g., natural
   features, topography); sociocultural (e.g., isolation); policy (e.g.,
   time for school recess); and economic (e.g., funding for physical
   activity programs). Macroenvironmental themes related to the built and
   natural environments and transportation infrastructure.
   Conclusions: This study identified rural environment elements that
   community members perceived as influencing children's physical activity
   patterns. Certain aspects were unique to rural areas, whereas other
   urban and suburban factors may be generalizable to rural settings.
   PhotoVOICE was a useful participatory research method to gain insight
   into perceived factors affecting rural children's physical activity
   behaviors. (Am J Prev Med 2010; 39(6): 537-545) (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Individuals frequently perceive immigrant and minority population sizes
   to be much larger than they are in reality. To date, little is
   understood about the extent or causes of this phenomenon, known as
   innumeracy, which may have consequences for inter-group relations.
   However, before the literature can assess these consequences, a better
   understanding of the development of these misperceptions is needed. The
   extant literature focuses only on the United States and lacks a clear
   understanding of how innumeracy arises. Drawing from the 2002 European
   Social Survey (ESS), this study attempts to make sense of this
   phenomenon by proposing and testing a framework that views innumeracy
   among majority group members as developing in two ways: as cognitive
   mistakes and emotional responses. I establish the existence and extent
   of the phenomenon across 21 European nations, test new key predictors
   such as media exposure and socio-economic status, and find independent
   associations with cognitive and emotional factors using multi-level
   regression analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The adult response to myocardial infarction results in
   inflammation, scar formation, left ventricular dilatation, and loss of
   regional and global function. Regenerative scarless healing has been
   demonstrated in foetal dermis and tendon and is associated with
   diminished inflammation. We hypothesised that following foetal
   myocardial infarction, there would be minimal inflammation, regenerative
   healing, and preservation of function. Methods: Anteroapical myocardial
   infarction encompassing 20\% of the left ventricle was created in adult
   or early gestation foetal sheep. Myocardial function was serially
   assessed using quantitative echocardiography. Infarct architecture was
   examined histologically for evidence of scar formation. Cellular
   inflammation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis were assessed using
   immunohistochemistry. Results: In the adult sheep 4 weeks following
   myocardial infarction, there was a significant decline in ejection
   fraction (EF) (41 +/- 7.4\% to 26 +/- 7.4\%, p < 0.05), and the akinetic
   myocardial segment increased in size (6.9 +/- 0.8 cm to 7.9 +/- 1.1 cm,
   p < 0.05). By contrast, there was no decline in the foetal EF (53 +/-
   8.1\% to 55 +/- 8.8\%) and no akinetic foetal myocardial segment 4 weeks
   post-infarction. The foetal infarcts lacked an inflammatory cell
   infiltrate and healed with minimal fibrosis, compared with the adults.
   Foetal infarcts also demonstrated 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+
   proliferating cells, including cardiomyocytes, within the infarct.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the foetal response to
   myocardial infarction is dramatically different from the adult and is
   characterised by minimal inflammation, lack of fibrosis, myocardial
   proliferation and restoration of cardiac function. Diminished
   inflammation is associated with foetal regenerative cardiac healing
   following injury. Understanding the mechanisms involved in foetal
   myocardial regeneration may lead to applications to alter the adult
   response following myocardial infarction. (C) 2010 European Association

Abstract = {{Aims: To assess the impact of late referral (LR) for nephrological
   co-management compared with early referral (ER) on morbidity and
   mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to identify individual
   factors associated with higher mortality in LR, correcting for lead-time
   and immortal time bias. Patients and methods: Retrospective
   observational study comparing 46 LR patients with 103 ER patients. The
   quality of CKD management was assessed by measures to prevent CKD
   progression and to modify CKD complications and cardiovascular risk
   factors according to current guidelines. One-year mortality of LR and ER
   was compared and factors associated with mortality were identified.
   Analysis was performed with equivalent GFR (glomerular filtration rate)
   of ER and LR at baseline to correct for lead-time and immortal time
   bias. Results: Late referral was associated with inferior control of
   most risk factors for CKD progression, CKD complications and
   cardiovascular risk factors. In particular, glycaemic control, the use
   of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2-receptor
   blockers in diabetic nephropathy or proteinuria, the control of
   nutritional and volume status were inferior in LR. One-year mortality
   was significantly higher in LR (RR 5.9 (95\% CI 1.5-19.6); p < 0.01).
   Inadequate control of blood pressure, anaemia, volume status,
   malnutrition and emergency initial dialysis, but not LR itself were
   independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Late referral was
   associated with a substantially lower survival after correction for
   lead-time and immortal time bias and with inferior control of most risk
   factors for CKD progression, complications and cardiovascular risk
   factors. CKD patients may particularly profit from adequate control of
   blood pressure, anaemia, nutritional and volume status, and avoidance of
   emergency initial dialysis as these factors may predominately contribute
   to survival.}},

Abstract = {{Internet markets allow online sellers to rapidly update prices. By
   employing intelligent software agents known as pricebots, the re-pricing
   process can be streamlined and automated. Developing the pricebot
   repricing logic requires an understanding of the optimal pricing
   strategy in relation to competitors' strategies.
   We use simulation to construct a decision table of the most effective
   counterstrategy for several competitor strategy combinations. We then
   design a neural network for classifying the strategies of the
   competition, which allows us to look up the optimal counterstrategy in
   the decision table. Our findings indicate that a pricebot armed with the
   decision table and neural network classifier can recognize when the
   market is such that no entrant can gain a profit advantage beyond the
   profit achieved at a common price floor, and in other cases where higher
   profits are possible, the agent is able to achieve statistically
   significant profit improvements over the no-pricebot case. (C) 2010

   When no visual information is available during movement execution
   movement kinematics change and become more variable indicating that the

   restricted period of time However little is known about the underlying
   decay characteristics In this study we investigated how increasing
   memory demands change the kinematics of a grasping movement and whether
   these alterations reflect a continuous or an abrupt decay of the
   underlying visuomotor memory Ten participants grasped differently sized
   objects under a full vision condition and four different delay
   conditions Results show that the visuomotor information used for
   grasping decays rapidly after visual occlusion The information decay
   over time became obvious in a decrease of movement accuracy and an
   increase in movement variability that were both well described by
   exponential decay models Our findings suggest that visuomotor
   information is represented in some sort of short-term memory showing the
   same decay characteristics as observed in classical memory research (C)

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1025-1030}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rationale, aims and objectives
   Within the field of evidence-based practice, a process termed `evidence
   mapping' is emerging as a less exhaustive yet systematic and replicable
   methodology that allows an understanding of the extent and distribution
   of evidence in a broad clinical area, highlighting both what is known
   and where gaps in evidence exist. This article describes the general
   principles of mapping methodology by using illustrations derived from
   our experience conducting an evidence map of interventions for youth
   mental-health disorders.
   Methods
   Evidence maps are based on an explicit research question relating to the
   field of enquiry, which may vary in depth, but should be informed by
   end-users. The research question then drives the search for, and
   collection of, appropriate studies utilizing explicit and reproducible
   methods at each stage. This includes clear definition of components of
   the research question, development of a thorough and reproducible search
   strategy, development of explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
   transparent decisions about the level of information to be obtained from
   each study.
   Discussion
   Evidence mapping is emerging as a rigorous methodology for gathering and
   disseminating up-to-date information to end-users. Thoughtful planning
   and assessment of available resources (e.g. staff, time, budget) are
   required by those applying this methodology to their particular field of
   clinical enquiry given the potential scope of the work. The needs of the
   end-user need to be balanced with available resources. Information
   derived needs to be effectively communicated, with the uptake of that
   evidence into clinical practice the ultimate aim.}},

Abstract = {{Rheumatology's comeback in the GDR saw the establishment of a
   rheumatology research institute in `Dresden, built up by Hans Tichy
   (1888-1970). It was here that initial success was seen in the treatment
   of rheumatic fever, mainly as a result of strict relapse prevention with
   the administration of penicillin. A working group of the ``Society for
   Clinical Medicine in the GDR{''} was the forerunner to what turned in
   1967 into the autonomous ``Society of Rheumatology of the GDR{''}. The
   latter worked closely with rheumatology societies in Eastern European
   countries. Their shared centre of coordination was in Moscow.
   International symposia took place with participants from Czechoslovakia,
   Poland and Hungary, but also with delegations from Switzerland, Austria
   and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Society of Rheumatology of the
   GDR merged with the West German Society of Rheumatology in September

Abstract = {{We present the results of two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical
   simulations of a Boussinesq fluid in the presence of gravity. Our
   simulations compare the evolution of a burning interface between a
   denser fuel and less dense ashes to the evolution of a non-burning
   interface. Initially, a dense, cool fluid is placed over a light, hot
   fluid and the interface between the two fluids is perturbed. Because of
   the presence of gravity, the system is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable, and the
   two fluids mix. We compare this Rayleigh-Taylor mixing problem to that
   in the same setup but with premixed combustion occurring at the
   interface between the two fluids. In both cases, the boundary conditions
   are periodic in the horizontal direction. As the force of gravity is
   increased, the flow behind the flame transitions from an ordered,
   laminar state to a chaotic, turbulent state. Our simulations explore the
   effect of burning on the development of the turbulent state, especially
   the effect of burning on the energy and enstrophy cascades, the mixing
   of the temperature fields and the shape of the flame front.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the
   process of transition to independent accommodation for people with
   schizophrenia. Method: The study employed a grounded theory approach.
   Multiple semi-structured and responsive e-mails and interviews were
   conducted with a total of seven participants currently living in
   independent accommodation. Through constant-comparative analysis of
   interview and e-mail data, three central processes were identified.
   Results: The three processes are developing a sense of control;
   establishing a relationship between illness and place; and attaining a
   sense of belonging. Conclusion: By attending to each of these three
   processes, mental health professionals may better assist people with
   schizophrenia to make a successful transition to independent
   accommodation, and in turn, to living well in the community.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare a double freeze thaw protocol
   to a triple freeze thaw protocol for pulmonary cryoablation utilizing an
   in vivo porcine lung model A total of 18 cryoablations were performed in
   normal porcine lung utilizing percutaneous technique with 9 each in a
   double- (10-5-10) and triple-freeze (3-3-7-7-5) protocol Serial
   noncontrast CT images were obtained during the ablation CT imaging
   findings and pathology were reviewed No imaging changes were identified
   during the initial freeze cycle with either protocol However, during the
   first thaw cycle, a region of ground glass opacity developed around the
   probe with both protocols Because the initial freeze was shorter with
   the triple freeze thaw protocol, the imaging findings were apparent
   sooner with this protocol (6 vs 13 min) Also, despite a shorter total
   freeze time (15 vs 20 min) the ablation zone identified with the triple
   freeze thaw protocol was not significantly different from the double
   freeze thaw protocol (mean diameter 1 67 +/- 0 41 cm vs 1 66 +/- 0 21 cm
   P = 0 77, area 2 1 +/- 0 48 cm(2) vs 1 99 +/- 062 cm(2), P = 07, and
   circularity 0 95 +/- 0 04 vs 0 96 +/- 0 03, P = 0 62 respectively) This
   study suggests that there may be several advantages of a triple freeze
   thaw protocol for pulmonary cryoablation including earlier
   identification of the imaging findings associated with the ablation the
   promise of a shorter procedure time or larger zones of ablation, and
   theoretically, more effective cytotoxicity related to the additional
   freeze-thaw cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in low-frequency fluctuations (LFF, 0.01-0.1 Hz) of BOLD fMRI
   signal were observed during sedation and sleep. We tested the hypothesis
   that sedation-induced LFF increases may be mediated by increased head
   motion likely associated with these brain states.
   Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned in resting-state baseline and (15
   thereof) in midazolam sedation condition. After standard preprocessing,
   LFF power was computed from average time series from 14 ROIs
   representing 5 functional networks (visual, motor, auditory, default
   mode, dorsal attentional). We assessed the effects of sedation on LFF
   and indirect effects of head motion (mean relative displacement) using
   mediation analysis.
   Sedation increased LFF power with the indirect effect of motion on
   sedation-induced LFF significant for all networks. Global mean corrected
   data showed similar but weaker results: significant total effect for
   auditory, motor and visual; significant mediation for auditory and motor
   networks. Motion was strongly correlated with LFF even at baseline.
   Reported results were significant at p < 0.05.
   The study confirms that conscious sedation induces LFF increase, but
   demonstrates that this effect is mediated by increased head motion.
   Hence, caution in design and interpretation is recommended for studies
   comparing subjects or conditions differently predisposing to head
   motion.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors have been implicated in the onset of type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM). Recently, immune response and inflammation were
   suggested to play certain roles in the development and complications of
   T2DM. The aim of this study is to investigate the putative correlation
   between the promoter polymorphisms of interleukin-4 (IL-4), one of the
   immune-regulatory type 2 helper T-cell cytokines, and T2DM. Genomic DNA
   from 425 Taiwanese T2DM patients and 148 nondiabetic control study
   subjects were extracted, and their IL-4 promoter polymorphisms were
   analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism. Both of the distribution of IL-4 C-589T (P=.013) and C-34T
   (P=.05) genotypes were significantly different between T2DM patients and
   control subjects. Significant association between IL-4 C-589T alleles
   (P=.002) and T2DM, as well as C-34T alleles and T2DM (P=.024), was also
   identified. In addition, a statistically significant association between
   homologous IL-4 -589 C/C genotype and lower circulatory high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol levels was observed. Our results suggested that
   IL-4 promoter polymorphisms are associated with T2DM. A significant
   association between IL-4 -589 C/C genotype and lower circulatory
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was observed as well. The
   above results suggested that IL-4 may participate in lipid metabolism
   and diabetic susceptibility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MOBILIZATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{447-463}},

Abstract = {{This article seeks to understand how social ties can be manipulated by
   industrial producers in such a way that local opposition to pollution is
   neutralized. Social movement researchers argue that mobilization cannot
   proceed without pre-existing social ties, and further reflection
   suggests the nature of social ties is tremendously consequential.
   Clientelist ties are characterized by mass dependence and cooperation as
   beneficiaries expect favors from above. Thus, when clientelist leaders
   are politically excluded, a strong community-based protest is likely to
   take place under their leadership. However, if clientelist leaders are
   incorporated to share the benefits of industrial development, the result
   is likely to be community acquiescence even though popular grievances
   are endemic. This paper analyzes Taiwan's environmental politics since
   the late-1980s by focusing on how material compensations incorporated
   the previously excluded politicians. Elites thus played the role of
   redistributors and brokers, rather than protest leaders, and
   consequently, popular discontent over pollution was contained.}},

Abstract = {{Construction is a labor-intensive industry that is heavily reliant on
   the availability of local manpower. The construction workload also
   fluctuates in either a cyclical or random manner. As a result, there is
   always either a shortage or surplus of manpower. Although a number of
   good forecasting models have been developed, they require input of
   sufficient and good-quality data to produce accurate results. The aim of
   this paper is to explore the use of the gray model in forecasting
   construction manpower based on a limited amount of data. A wide range of
   forecasting models in the literature is first reviewed. A
   single-variable first-order gray model is then proposed to forecast
   construction manpower one quarter ahead. The model is tested using
   manpower data based on the Quarterly Report on General Household Survey
   published by the Census and Statistics Department of the HKSAR
   Government. Data from 64 quarters, covering the first quarter of 1992 to
   the fourth quarter of 2007, are included. A computer program is
   formulated to manipulate all of the calculations involved. Based on the
   minimum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) criterion, it is found
   that the optimal sample size is 5. Based on the input of data from five
   quarters, the MAPE of the overall forecast is only 3.21\%, and the
   maximum absolute percentage error is 8.92\%. It is thus concluded that
   the gray model produces very accurate results. The results of this study
   also suggest that this model is applicable to forecasts of other time
   series particularly when limited data are available.}},

   levels of IL-10 before and after intranasal, live BCG administration and
   had fewer lung inflammatory cells post-BCG, relative to nonsensitized
   mice. In CHE-sensitized mice, the percentage of splenic CD4(+)CD25(+)
   cells expressing Foxp3 amongst total lymphocytes was not elevated
   significantly, but these cells limited nonspecific proliferation of
   CD4(+)CD25(-) effector cells upon coculture and promoted higher
   expression levels of CD103 and Foxp3 in response to BCG antigen
   stimulation than CD4(+)CD25(-) cells from nonsensitized mice. In
   adoptive transfer experiments, naive, WT mice receiving CD4(+)CD25(-)
   cells from CHE-sensitized mice and then given live BCG intranasally had
   significantly elevated lung IL-10 levels, reduced frequencies of lung
   IL-2-producing cells, and lower lymphocyte numbers in the BAL.
   Therefore, CHE sensitization induced CD4(+)CD25(-) Tregs with
   functional, suppressive activity on BCG responses in vitro and in vivo.
   Treg induction could therefore be one mechanism underlying how
   environmental mycobacteria priming modulates host responses to the BCG
   vaccine. J. Leukoc. Biol. 88: 1073-1080; 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The relation between the Shannon entropy and variational distance, two
   fundamental and frequently-used quantities in information theory, is
   studied in this paper by means of certain bounds on the entropy
   difference between two probability distributions in terms of the
   variational distance between them and their alphabet sizes. We also show
   how to find the distribution achieving the minimum (or maximum) entropy
   among those distributions within a given variational distance from any
   given distribution. These results are applied to solve a number of
   problems that are of fundamental interest. For entropy estimation, we
   obtain an analytic formula for the confidence interval, solving a
   problem that has been opened for more than 30 years. For approximation
   of probability distributions, we find the minimum entropy difference
   between two distributions in terms of their alphabet sizes and the
   variational distance between them. In particular, we show that the
   entropy difference between two distributions that are close in
   variational distance can be arbitrarily large if the alphabet sizes of
   the two distributions are unconstrained. For random number generation,
   we characterize the tradeoff between the amount of randomness required
   and the distortion in terms of variation distance. New tools for
   non-convex optimization have been developed to establish the results in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrates were sampled from summer 2006 until spring 2008 in
   the Du River basin in subtropical northern Vietnam. Seventy taxa were
   identified, which were dominated by aquatic insects, with Diptera,
   Hemiptera, Ephemeroptera, and Odonata being the orders with the highest
   diversities. Overall, macroinvertebrate diversity was higher during the
   wet season at upstream sites, while wide river sites downstream showed a
   higher diversity during the dry season. Spatial and temporal variations
   in the macroinvertebrate communities were driven by hydromorphological
   characteristics and especially by water quality issues reflecting
   anthropogenic impacts in the river basin. Multivariate analyses using
   canonical correspondence analysis discriminated between pristine and
   impacted sites. The caddisfly family Hydropsychidae, the mayfly family
   Caenidae, and the dobsonfly family Corydalidae were reliable indicators
   of sites with good ecological status. A relatively small temporal
   variation was detected in the macroinvertebrate community composition.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a high-speed and energy-efficient two-cycle
   multiply-accumulate (MAC) architecture that supports two's complement
   numbers, and includes accumulation guard bits and saturation circuitry.
   The first MAC pipeline stage contains only partial-product generation
   circuitry and a reduction tree, while the second stage, thanks to a
   special sign-extension solution, implements all other functionality.
   Place-and-route evaluations using a 65-nm 1.1-V cell library show that
   the proposed architecture offers a 31\% improvement in speed and a 32\%
   reduction in energy per operation, averaged across operand sizes of 16,
   32, 48, and 64 bits, over a reference two-cycle MAC architecture that
   employs a multiplier in the first stage and an accumulator in the
   second. When operating the proposed architecture at the lower frequency
   of the reference architecture the available timing slack can be used to
   downsize gates, resulting in a 52\% reduction in energy compared to the
   reference. We extend the new architecture to create a versatile
   double-throughput MAC (DTMAC) unit that efficiently performs either
   multiply-accumulate or multiply operations for N-bit, 1 x N/2-bit, or 2
   x N/2-bit operands. In comparison to a fixed-function 32-bit MAC unit,
   16-bit multiply-accumulate operations can be executed with 67\% higher
   energy efficiency on a 32-bit DTMAC unit.}},

   Hearing Threshold Levels in the Unscreened Adult Population of the

Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: (1) To present hearing threshold data from a recent
   nationally representative survey in the United States (National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004) in a distributional format
   that might be appropriate to replace Annex B in international (ISO-1999)
   and national (ANSI S3.44) standards and (2) to compare these recent data
   with older survey data (National Health Examination Survey I, 1959-1962)
   on which the current Annex B is based.
   Design: Better-ear threshold distributions (selected percentiles and
   their confidence intervals) were estimated using linear interpolation.
   The 95\% confidence intervals for the medians for the two surveys were
   compared graphically for each of the four age groups and for both men
   and women. In addition, we calculated odds ratios comparing the
   prevalences of better-ear hearing impairment (thresholds > 25 dB HL)
   between the two surveys, for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, and for their
   four-frequency average.
   Results: Across age and sex groups, median thresholds were lower
   (better) in the 1999-2004 survey at 500, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz (8000
   Hz was not tested in the 1959-1962 survey). For both men and women, the
   prevalence of hearing impairment was significantly lower in 1999-2004 at
   500, 2000, and 4000 Hz, but not at 1000 Hz.
   Conclusions: For men and women of a specific age, high-frequency hearing
   thresholds were lower (better) in 1999-2004 than in 1959-1962. The
   prevalences of hearing impairment were also lower in the recent survey.
   Differences seen at 500 Hz may be attributable at least in part to
   changes in standards for ambient noise in audiometry. The National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 distributions are
   offered as a possible replacement for Annex B in ISO-1999 and ANSI
   S3.44.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: In individuals with cervical spinal cord injury
   (SCI), damage to spinal pathways results in deficits of hand function;
   maladaptive cortical changes further impair function. Unimanual massed
   practice (MP) training with somatosensory stimulation (SS) has been
   shown to improve hand function and increase corticomotor excitability
   after SCI. However, bimanual training may be more beneficial as these
   individuals have bilateral impairment. We compared clinical and
   corticomotor changes associated with unimanual versus bimanual MP
   training, each combined with SS.
   Methods: Participants were 13 individuals with chronic tetraplegia who
   had at least minimal voluntary control of the thenar muscles of 1 hand.
   The participants were randomly assigned to unimanual MP + SS or bimanual
   MP + SS. Clinical outcome measures included tests of unimanual (Jebsen
   Taylor Hand Function Test; JTT) and bimanual hand function (Chedoke Arm
   and Hand Activity Inventory; CAHAI), sensory function (monofilament
   test), and pinch grip strength. Neurophysiological outcome measures were
   corticomotor map area, center of gravity (COG), of the corticomotor map
   and corticomotor threshold as assessed by transcranial magnetic
   stimulation.
   Results: There were no significant differences in outcomes between the
   unimanual MP + SS versus bimanual MP + SS groups, both groups showed
   significant improvements in the JTT, CAHAI, and monofilament test.
   However, trends suggest that the unimanual MP + SS group had greater
   improvement in the JTT whereas the bimanual MP + SS group had greater
   improvement on the CAHAI. Functional changes were accompanied by a
   strong trend toward increased corticomotor map area.
   Discussion and Conclusion: When combined with SS, both unimanual and
   bimanual MP training improve hand function and sensation in individuals
   with tetraplegia. Changes in hand function seem to be associated with
   increased corticomotor map area. (JNPT 2010; 34: 193-201)}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if early changes in
   triglycerides and weight may be useful in predicting longer-term changes
   in weight and other metabolic parameters. Data were from three 24- to
   28-week randomized, controlled studies comparing olanzapine to
   ziprasidone or aripiprazole for treatment of schizophrenia. Analyses
   were restricted to completers with fasting laboratory data at all
   protocol-specified time points. Analyses were primarily descriptive and
   included mean changes and categorical outcomes. In all treatment groups,
   participants who did not experience a 20 mg/dL or greater increase in
   triglycerides at early time points were unlikely to experience a change
   of 50 mg/dL or more in triglycerides after 6 months. Negative predictive
   values were 83\% to 95\%. However, early change in triglycerides was not
   useful for predicting later change in glucose, cholesterol, or weight.
   Similarly, early weight change gave robust negative predictive values
   for longer-term weight change (>= 10 kg), but not for change in glucose
   or cholesterol. Lack of early elevation in triglyceride concentrations
   was predictive of later lack of substantial increase in triglycerides in
   olanzapine-, ziprasidone-, and aripiprazole-treated participants. Lack
   of early elevation in weight was predictive of later lack of substantial
   increase in weight in all 3 treatment groups. Early monitoring of
   triglyceride concentrations and weight may help clinicians assess risk
   that individuals will experience significant increase in triglycerides
   or weight gain, allowing assessments of potential risks and benefits
   earlier in treatment. Clinical monitoring is advised throughout
   treatment for all patients.}},

Abstract = {{US veterinary students are subject to significant stress throughout
   their veterinary education. In this article, the authors characterize
   the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and relate their use to
   stress in a veterinary student population. Of the students sampled, 35\%
   were OTC medication users; 33\% of these were regular OTC medication
   users. Forty-three percent of students were energy drink (ED) users;
   45\% of these were regular ED users. OTC medication users had
   significantly higher stress scores than non-OTC medication users, and ED
   users had significantly higher anxiety scores than non-ED users. The
   most common reasons for use given by OTC medication users were to help
   with studying and to fall asleep at night. Depression scores were
   significantly higher for Juniors and sophomores than for freshmen.
   Depression, stress, and anxiety scores were all lower in the Colorado
   State University students when compared with the University of Georgia
   students. OTC medication and ED veterinary student users had distinct
   characteristics that differed from those of nonusers. Users suffered
   from more stress and anxiety and had more difficulties with sleep, which
   may have affected their overall health and academic performance.
   Educating veterinary students about the consequences of using OTC
   medication and ED and providing counseling support may be of benefit to
   veterinary students' psychological well-being.}},

Abstract = {{The response of selected photosynthetic and morphological parameters of
   plants to drought was examined in 5 inbred lines of maize (Zea mays L.)
   and their 10 F1 hybrids. The aim of the study was to establish whether
   the photosynthetic performance of parental genotypes under drought
   conditions correlates with the performance of their progeny and whether
   the net photosynthetic rate, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters or
   the content of photosynthetic pigments could be used as reliable
   physiological markers for early breeding generations. The relative
   importance of the additive and the nonadditive (dominance, maternal)
   genetic effects in the inheritance of these parameters was also assessed
   by means of the quantitative genetics analysis. The results showed that
   the nonadditive genetic effects associated with a particular combination
   of genotypes or a particular direction of crossing are at least equally
   and often even more important as the additivity and that these genetic
   effects almost totally change with the exposure of plants to drought
   conditions. This was reflected in the inability to predict the response
   of F1 hybrids to drought on the basis of the photosynthetic performance
   of their parents, which indicates that the practical usability of such
   parameters in maize breeding programs is rather limited.}},

Abstract = {{A revision to the Holland parametric approach to modeling the radial
   profile of winds in hurricanes is presented. The approach adopted uses
   information readily available from hurricane archives or in hurricane
   warning information and the profile can be readily incorporated into
   existing parametric models of the hurricane surface wind field. The
   original model utilized central and environmental surface pressures,
   maximum winds, and radius of maximum winds. In the revision a capacity
   to incorporate additional wind observations at some radius within the
   hurricane circulation was included. If surface observations are used,
   then a surface wind profile will result, obviating the need for deriving
   a boundary layer reduction from the gradient wind level. The model has
   considerably less sensitivity to data errors compared to the original
   and is shown to reproduce hurricane reconnaissance and surface wind
   profiles with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{On February 16, 2007 a massive propane release occurred at the Propane
   Deasphalting Unit (PDA) of the Valero-McKee Refinery near Sunray, Texas.
   The resulting vapor cloud ignited, burning four workers, destroying the
   PDA, and causing significant knock-on damage to adjacent pipe racks and
   equipment.
   The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB)
   investigation determined that water trapped in a piping dead-leg froze
   during cold weather, cracking a 10 `' diameter liquid propane line, and
   causing the initial release when warmer weather returned. The CSB
   identified dead-leg identification and management, freeze protection,
   emergency isolation capability, and structural steel fire protection as
   key issues contributing to the incident.
   Two near-misses were associated with this incident; the release of over
   2.5 tons of chlorine from containers adjacent to the PDA, and the
   inability of workers to access manual deluge valves protecting a nearby
   LPG storage sphere, which was impacted by the fire.
   The CSB made recommendations to Valero, the American Petroleum
   Institute, the McKee Refinery, and the United Steelworkers and their
   local. (C) 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Process Saf

Abstract = {{A method of predicting fatigue crack growth in hydrogen-charged thin
   steel plates is proposed. It consists in computing modified stress
   intensity factors which reflect the presence of hydrogen, and using them
   in a fatigue crack growth equation for an uncharged plate. The
   modification accounts for both, hydrogen embrittlement of crack tips and
   hydrogen-induced residual stresses in the plate. The new stress
   intensity factors are derived for two special cases - uniform and
   stationary hydrogen distribution in the plate. With their use bounds are
   established on the rate of hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth.
   Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical calculations. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine whether obesity and insulin resistance associate
   with changes in the protein content of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in
   2 different groups of men by using targeted proteomics.
   Methods and Results-Insulin resistance and obesity are hallmarks of type
   2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, which confer an
   increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest that
   the protein cargo of HDL makes important contributions to the
   lipoprotein's cardioprotective effects. In a discovery study, we used
   isotope dilution mass spectrometry to quantify the relative
   concentrations of 5 proteins previously implicated in HDL's
   cardioprotective effects in 3 groups of healthy subjects: lean
   insulin-sensitive, lean insulin-resistant, and obese insulin-resistant
   individuals. We validated our findings in a different group of subjects.
   The clusterin concentration in HDL strongly and negatively associated
   with insulin resistance and body mass index in both populations. HDL
   clusterin levels were lower in subjects with low HDL and high
   triglycerides, key components of the metabolic syndrome. There was an
   inverse correlation between clusterin levels in HDL and very-low-density
   lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein.
   Conclusion-Clusterin levels in HDL are lower in men with reduced insulin
   sensitivity, higher body mass index, and an unfavorable lipid profile.
   Our observations raise the possibility that clusterin depletion
   contributes to the loss of HDL's cardioprotective properties.

Abstract = {{This work examines the effects of photonically induced interband
   excitations from the d-band to states at the Fermi energy on the
   electron temperature decay in noble metals. The change in the electron
   population in the d-band and the conduction band causes a change in
   electron heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling factor In noble
   metals, due to the large d-band to Fermi energy separation, the
   contributions to electron heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling
   factor of intra- and interband transitions can be separated. The two
   temperature model describing electron-phonon heat transfer after
   short-pulsed laser heating is solved using the expressions for heat
   capacity and electron-phonon coupling factor after intra- and interband
   excitations, and the predicted electron temperature change of the intra-
   and interband excited electrons are examined. A critical fluence value
   is defined that represents the absorbed fluence needed to fill all
   available states at a given photon energy above the Fermi level. At high
   absorbed laser fluences and pulse energies greater than the interband
   transition threshold, the interband and intraband contributions to
   thermophysical properties differ and are shown to affect temporal
   electron temperature profiles. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4002295]}},

Title = {{Potentiation of omega-3 fatty acid antidepressant-like effects with low

Abstract = {{Despite the advances in psychopharmacology, the treatment of depressive
   disorders is still not satisfactory. Side effects and resistance to
   antidepressant drugs are the greatest complications during treatment.
   Based on recent evidence, omega-3 fatty acids may influence
   vulnerability and outcome in depressive disorders. The aim of this study
   was to further characterize the omega-3 antidepressant-like effect in
   rats in terms of its behavioral features in the depression model forced
   swimming test either alone or in combination with antidepressants
   fluoxetine or mirtazapine. Ultimately, we prompted to determine the
   lowest dose at which omega-3 fatty acids and antidepressant drugs may
   still represent a pharmacological advantage when employed in combined
   treatments. Chronic diet supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids
   produced concentration-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the
   forced swimming test displaying a behavioral profile similar to
   fluoxetine but different from mirtazapine. Fluoxetine or mirtazapine at
   antidepressant doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively) rendered
   additive effects in combination with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
   (720 mg/kg/day). Beneficial effects of combined treatment were also
   observed at sub-effective doses (1 mg/kg/day) of fluoxetine or
   mirtazapine, since in combination with omega-3 fatty acids (720
   mg/kg/day), antidepressants potentiated omega-3 antidepressant-like
   effects. The antidepressant-like effects occurred in the absence of
   changes in brain phospholipid classes. The therapeutic approach of
   combining omega-3 fatty acids with low ineffective doses of
   antidepressants might represent benefits in the treatment of depression,
   especially in patients with depression resistant to conventional
   treatments and even may contribute to patient compliance by decreasing
   the magnitude of some antidepressant dose-dependent side effects. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses three-dimensional (3-D) free vibration
   characteristic of thick circular/annular functionally graded (FG) plates
   with surface-bonded piezoelectric layers on the basis of 3-D Ritz
   solution. Three displacement components along with electrical potential
   field of the plate are expressed by a set of Chebyshev polynomials
   multiplied by geometry boundary functions. Both open-circuit and
   closed-circuit surface conditions are taken into account. The mechanical
   properties of the FG plates are assumed to vary continuously through the
   thickness of the plate and obey either exponent or power law
   distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. The effect of
   thickness-to-radius ratio, inner-to-outer radius ratio, piezo-to-host
   thickness ratio and gradient index on the natural frequencies of coupled
   piezoelectric FG circular/annular plates is investigated for different
   electrical and mechanical boundary conditions. It is observed that,
   unlike isotropic homogeneous circular/annular plates, frequency
   parameters of their piezoelectric coupled FG counterparts significantly
   increase with an enhancement in the host plate thickness to radius
   ratio. Results also show that the frequency parameters for open-circuit
   condition are higher than those for closed-circuit condition. (C) 2010

   that are considered typical of the school classroom environment (quiet,
   +4, 0, -4 dB) while simultaneously rehearsing sets of five digits for

   cognitive resources and is associated with reduced performance on the
   secondary task. The study sample consisted of 31 normal-hearing children

   in the regulatory regimes related to agri-food genomic innovations found
   in six countries: Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the
   US. Applying this framework to the six cases shows that these
   governments have fostered different types of regulatory regimes over the
   last quarter century that are closely connected with the manner in which
   governments have pursued either promotional or precautionary
   orientations towards new technologies; and second whether regulatory
   policy-making has been driven by state or public actors and interests.
   The implications of these findings for the study of biotechnology, and
   especially genomics-related matters, regulation and policy-making are
   then discussed.}},

Abstract = {{P>The crystal structures of two active forms of dissimilatory sulphite
   reductase (Dsr) from Desulfovibrio gigas, Dsr-I and Dsr-II, are compared
   at 1.76 and 2.05 A resolution respectively. The dimeric
   alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) structure of Dsr-I contains eight {[}4Fe-4S]
   clusters, two saddle-shaped sirohaems and two flat sirohydrochlorins. In
   Dsr-II, the {[}4Fe-4S] cluster associated with the sirohaem in Dsr-I is
   replaced by a {[}3Fe-4S] cluster. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   of the active Dsr-I and Dsr-II confirm the co-factor structures, whereas
   EPR of a third but inactive form, Dsr-III, suggests that the sirohaem
   has been demetallated in addition to its associated {[}4Fe-4S] cluster
   replaced by a {[}3Fe-4S] centre. In Dsr-I and Dsr-II, the
   sirohydrochlorin is located in a putative substrate channel connected to
   the sirohaem. The gamma-subunit C-terminus is inserted into a positively
   charged channel formed between the alpha- and beta-subunits, with its
   conserved terminal Cys gamma 104 side-chain covalently linked to the CHA
   atom of the sirohaem in Dsr-I. In Dsr-II, the thioether bond is broken,
   and the Cys gamma 104 side-chain moves closer to the bound sulphite at
   the sirohaem pocket. These different forms of Dsr offer structural
   insights into a mechanism of sulphite reduction that can lead to
   S(3)O(6)2-, S(2)O(3)2- and S2-.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Replantation of the distal phalanx and pulp can be performed
   to improve finger function and finger aesthetics; however, establishing
   adequate venous drainage is a challenge. Slattery et al. reported
   microsurgical reattachment of a partial distal phalanx with the use of a
   bifurcated terminal digital artery. The bifurcation was divided into two
   pedicles, one of which was used for venous drainage. In this article,
   the authors report their experience with a similar technique and propose
   a new algorithm for distal finger replantation.
   Methods: From January of 2008 to February of 2009, five replantations
   were performed using a single central artery. The replanted levels were
   pulp, avulsed fingertip of the thumb, and distal phalanges. There was no
   volar vein, dorsal vein, or second artery available in the amputated
   part for standard venous drainage. Venous drainage in all cases was
   established by creating an anastomosis from a branch of the solitary
   terminal artery to a recipient vein.
   Results: All digits were replanted successfully without evidence of
   arterial insufficiency or venous congestion. Partial necrosis was not
   identified postoperatively in any of the five fingers. There were no
   cases of wound infection.
   Conclusions: A branch of the central solitary artery may be used
   successfully to reestablish venous outflow in cases of distal finger tip
   replantation. This technique allowed for the salvage of all fingers in
   this study without the use of leeches or other techniques used in cases
   of venous insufficiency. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 126: 2043, 2010.)}},

Abstract = {{In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan surprised domestic and
   international audiences by announcing his intention to scrap the
   symbolically important National Unification Council (NUC) and the
   Guidelines for National Unification (GNU). This announcement not only
   invited strong criticism from Beijing, but also seriously strained
   U.S.-Taiwan relations, because it was a clear violation of Chen's 2000
   inaugural pledge regarding cross-Strait policy. This policy proposal
   presented an important theoretical challenge to the broadly recognized
   election cycle model in Taiwan's mainland policymaking unlike Chen `s
   earlier nationalist propaganda, the NUC initiative came after instead of
   during a major election campaign. To address this anomaly, this paper
   argues that while domestic politics play a key role in Taiwan's mainland
   policymaking, gaining votes is not the state leader's only concern. A
   careful examination of the political context shows that Chen's NUC
   campaign was used to divert attention from his personal political crisis
   following on his loss of both control over policy and leadership over
   his party after the DPP's poor showing in the December 2005 elections
   for city mayors and county magistrates.}},

Abstract = {{The time window construct describes when and how an earlier experience
   will be enduring. According to the construct, there is a limited period
   after an event occurs, or time window, in which a second event can
   retrieve and be integrated with the memory of the first event. The
   construct also holds that when the integration occurs later in the time
   window, its effects are more enduring. This study examined the time
   window construct for session spacing with 6- to 18-month-old human
   infants. Infants of all ages exhibited the retention benefit of two
   (integrated) sessions only when the second session occurred within the
   time window, but only 6-month-olds remembered longer when it occurred
   late in the time window. Combined with 3-month-olds' data, these
   findings document the generality and predictive validity of the time
   window construct throughout the infancy period with one modification:
   Integration late in the time window only benefits infants younger than 9

Title = {{Changes in Auditory Nerve Responses Across the Duration of Sinusoidally

Abstract = {{Response rates of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) to electric pulse trains
   change over time, reflecting substantial spike-rate adaptation that
   depends on stimulus parameters. We hypothesize that adaptation affects
   the representation of amplitude-modulated pulse trains used by cochlear
   prostheses to transmit speech information to the auditory system. We
   recorded cat ANF responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM)
   trains with 5,000 pulse/s carriers. Stimuli delivered by a monopolar
   intracochlear electrode had fixed modulation frequency (100 Hz) and
   depth (10\%). ANF responses were assessed by spike-rate measures, while
   representation of modulation was evaluated by vector strength (VS) and
   the fundamental component of the fast Fourier transform (F(0)
   amplitude). These measures were assessed across the 400 ms duration of
   pulse-train stimuli, a duration relevant to speech stimuli. Different
   stimulus levels were explored and responses were categorized into four
   spike-rate groups to assess level effects across ANFs. The temporal
   pattern of rate adaptation to modulated trains was similar to that of
   unmodulated trains, but with less rate adaptation. VS to the modulator
   increased over time and tended to saturate at lower spike rates, while
   F(0) amplitude typically decreased over time for low driven rates and
   increased for higher driven rates. VS at moderate and high spike rates
   and degree of F(0) amplitude temporal changes at low and moderate spike
   rates were positively correlated with the degree of rate adaptation.
   Thus, high-rate carriers will modify the ANF representation of the
   modulator over time. As the VS and F(0) measures were sensitive to
   adaptation-related changes over different spike-rate ranges, there is
   value in assessing both measures.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich
   inclusions (CAIs) were formed at the inner edge of the protoplanetary
   disk and then entrained in magnetocentrifugal X-winds. We study
   trajectories of such solid bodies with the consideration of the central
   star gravity, the protoplanetary disk gravity, and the gas drag of the
   wind. The efficiency of the gas drag depends on a parameter eta, which
   is the product of the solid body size and density. We find that the
   gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a non-negligible effect on the
   trajectories. If a solid body re-enters the flared disk, the re-entering
   radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment, the disk's
   gravity, the parameter eta, and the initial launching angle. The disk's
   gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30\%. We find a
   threshold eta, denoted a eta(t), for any particular configuration of the
   X-wind, below which the solid bodies will be expelled from the planetary
   system. eta(t) sensitively depends on the initial launching angle, and
   also depends on the mass of the disk. Only the solid bodies with an.
   larger than but very close to eta(t) can be launched to a re-entering
   radius larger than 1 AU. This size-sorting effect may explain why
   chondrules come with a narrow range of sizes within each chondritic
   class. In general, the size distributions of CAIs and chondrules in
   chondrites can be determined from the initial size distribution as well
   as the distribution over the initial launching angle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of a bioinspired 3-D tactile sensor
   for minimally invasive surgery. Inspired by the principle of hair cells,
   the sensor is composed of a central silicon post and a
   piezoresistor-embedded polyimide diaphragm to which the silicon post is
   attached. The high-aspect-ratio silicon post helps to increase the
   sensitivity to shear force significantly. Another unique advantage is
   that the silicon post is surrounded by a cylindrical cavity that
   provides a safety stop for the excessively large force/displacement. A
   fabrication process using deep reactive-ion etching, as well as a simple
   but effective packaging scheme, was demonstrated. The packaged tactile
   sensor was characterized by monitoring the resistance change of the
   piezoresistors when the central post was pushed in different directions.
   The sensor exhibited a shear force sensitivity of 10.8 N-1 and a normal
   force sensitivity of 3.5 N-1. The measured displacement sensitivities in
   shear and normal directions are 1.2 x 10(-3) and 6.0 x 10(-3) mu m(-1),
   respectively. The responses of single and multiple sensors to the rubber
   scratching test were studied to demonstrate the capability of the sensor
   to detect the direction and other information of the scratching.}},

Title = {{Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulation and Experimental Study of Sheet
   Metal Bending by Laser Peen Forming}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Laser peen forming (LPF) is a purely mechanical forming method achieved
   through the use of laser energy to form complex shapes or to modify
   curvatures. It is flexible and independent of tool inaccuracies that
   result from wear and deflection. Its nonthermal process makes it
   possible to form without material degradation or even improve them by
   inducing compressive stress over the target surface. In the present
   study, a fully three-dimensional numerical model is developed to
   simulate the forming process of laser peen forming. The simulation
   procedure is composed of several steps mainly including the shock
   pressure prediction, the modal analysis, and the forming process
   calculation. System critical damping is introduced to prevent
   unnecessary long post-shock residual oscillations and to greatly
   decrease the solution time for simulation. The bending profiles and
   angles with different thicknesses are experimentally measured at
   different scanning lines and scanning velocities to understand the
   process and validate the numerical model. The calculated bending
   profiles and angles agree well with the trend of the measured results.
   But it is found that simulations with the Johnson-Cook model are more
   consistent, matching the experimental results for the thick sheet metal
   with a convex bending, while the elastic-perfectly-plastic model
   produces a better agreement even though with underestimated values for
   the thinner sheet metal with a concave bending. The reason for this
   phenomenon is discussed, combining the effects of strain rate and
   feature size. Both the simulation and the experiments show that a
   continuous decrease in bending angle from concave to convex is observed
   with increasing specimen thickness in general. Large bending distortion
   is easier to induce by generating a concave curvature with LPF, and the
   angle of bending distortion depends on the number of laser shocks.

Abstract = {{Traditional field survey methods for detection of water leaks in
   irrigation canal systems are costly and time-consuming. In this study, a
   rapid, cost-effective method was developed for identifying irrigation
   canal locations likely to have leaks and/or seepage. The method involves
   the use of a multispectral imager equipped with red, near infrared, and
   thermal sensors which is mounted on an aircraft and flown at low
   altitude to collect the images. A three-step process, image acquisition,
   image processing, and field reconnaissance, was developed for processing
   the imagery and identification of locations likely to have leaks. The
   method was evaluated in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, USA.
   Images were collected of 24 selected canal segments within 11 irrigation
   districts in this region. Evaluation of the imagery indicated that 140
   sites had possible canal leakage problems (point leak and/or seepage). A
   field site evaluation form was developed and used to document the type
   and severity of the leaks at 28 of the sites. Twenty-six sites were
   confirmed to have leaks, representing a success rate of 93\%. The
   methods used in this study should have widespread application for
   detecting leaks and seepage in irrigation canals. Copyright (C) 2009

Title = {{Effects of porosity gradient in gas diffusion layers on performance of

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, two-phase, non-isothermal model has been developed
   to explore the interaction between heat and water transport in proton
   exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Water condensate produced from
   the electrochemical reaction may accumulate in the open pores of the gas
   diffusion layer (GDL) and retard the oxygen transport to the catalyst
   sites. This study predicts the enhancement of the water transport for
   linear porosity gradient in the cathode GDL of a PEMFC. An optimal
   porosity distribution was found based on a parametric study. Results
   show that a optimal linear porosity gradient with epsilon(1) = 0.7 and
   epsilon(2) = 0.3 for the parallel and z-serpentine channel design leads
   to a maximum increase in the limiting current density from 10,696 Am-2
   to 13,136 Am-2 and 14,053 Am-2 to 16,616 Am-2 at 0.49 V. respectively.
   On the other hand, the oxygen usage also increases from 36\% to 46\% for
   the parallel channel design and from 55\% to 67\% for the z-serpentine
   channel design. The formation of a porosity gradient in the GDL enhances
   the capillary diffusivity, increases the electrical conductivity, and
   hence, benefits the oxygen transport throughout the GDL The present
   study provides a theoretical support for existing reports that a GDL
   with a gradient porosity improves cell performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: SRT1720 and SRT2183 were described recently as activators of
   the NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT1. These molecules enhanced
   metabolic function when administered to rodents at doses of 100-500
   mg/kg/day, purportedly by activating SIRT1 enzymatic activity in various
   tissues; however, considerable controversy surrounds these claims.
   Results: We find that these molecules do not activate SIRT1 deacetylase
   activity when tested in a variety of enzymatic assay formats and
   conditions. The compounds effectively decrease acetylated p53 in cells
   treated with DNA damaging agents but do so in cells that lack SIRT1,
   calling into question their designation as direct activators of SIRT1.
   In contrast, we find that the compounds inhibit p300 histone
   acetyltransferase activity in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism for
   their effects in vivo. Conclusion: Structural features of these
   molecules may account for false-positive activation using
   fluorescence-based assays.}},

Abstract = {{Chemometrical tools for experimental design were used to study ways of
   improvement of cadmium(II) and lead(II) ions recovery yields from toxic
   wastes using mixtures of strong acids. We report here a technique that
   takes advantage of the predictable electrochemical behavior of cadmium
   (II) and lead(II) ions in several strong acidic media and the effect of
   these strong acids to collect cadmium (II) and lead(II) ions from toxic
   wastes. The anodic peak intensity was used to compare the free forms of
   cadmium(II) and lead(II) in different aqueous mineral acids media. The
   experimental screening design show that only the sulfuric acid exhibits
   significant positive effects on cadmium(II) and lead (II) ions,
   therefore the free forms of cadmium (II) and lead(II) ions in this media
   are the highest. In perchloric and phosphoric acids media the
   cadmium(II) and lead(II) ions generate more stable, electroinactive
   ionic species of the heavy metals clue to their different solvation
   properties and also probably by favoring the formation of insoluble
   colloidal particles of cadmium and lead, which gave lower
   electrochemical signals and also the shift of redox peak potentials
   recorded by square wave polarography. On the other hand, according to
   the designs coefficient plot, the influence of hydrochloric and nitric
   acid is not at all significant. Considering the anodic peak intensity as
   response of the screening experimental design, we can conclude that the
   nature and concentration of acid used in mixture with metallic ions
   exhibits positive, negative or no effect on the the formation of free,
   electroactive ionic complexes of the studied cations.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) are a unique subpopulation
   of fenestrated endothelial cells lining the hepatic sinusoids and
   comprising the majority of endothelial cells within the liver. HSECs not
   only have important roles in blood clearance, vascular tone, and
   immunity, but also undergo pathological changes, contributing to
   fibrosis, angiogenesis, and portal hypertension. There are few cell
   culture models for in vitro studies of motility and angiogenesis as
   primary cells are time-consuming to isolate, are limited in number, and
   often lack features of pathological vasculature. The aim of this study
   was to generate an immortalized cell line derived from HSECs that mimic
   pathological vasculature and allows detailed molecular interventions to
   be pursued. HSECs were isolated from mouse liver using CD31-based
   immunomagnetic separation, immortalized with SV40 large T-antigen, and
   subcloned on the basis of their ability to endocytose the acetylated
   low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL). The resulting cell line, transformed
   sinusoidal endothelial cells (TSECs), maintains an endothelial phenotype
   as well as some HSEC-specific features. This is evidenced by typical
   microscopic features of endothelia, including formation of lamellipodia
   and filopodia, and a cobblestone morphology of cell monolayers. Electron
   microscopy showed maintenance of a limited number of fenestrae organized
   in sieve plates. TSECs express numerous endothelia-specific markers,
   including CD31 and von Willebrand's factor (vWF), as detected by PCR
   array, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence (IF). Functionally, TSECs
   maintain a number of key endothelial features, including migration in
   response to angiogenic factors, formation of vascular tubes, endocytosis
   of AcLDL, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Their phenotype most
   closely resembles the pathological neovasculature associated with
   chronic liver disease, in which cells become proliferative,
   defenestrated, and angiogenic. Importantly, the cells can be transduced
   efficiently with viral vectors. TSECs should provide a reproducible cell
   culture model for high-throughput in vitro studies pertaining to a broad
   range of liver endothelial cell functions, but likely broader
   endothelial cell biology as well. Laboratory Investigation (2010) 90,

Abstract = {{While much attention has been focused on chromatin at promoters and
   exons, human genes are mostly composed of intronic sequences. Analyzing
   published surveys of nucleosomes and 41 chromatin marks in humans, we
   identified histone modifications specifically associated with 5'
   intronic sequences, distinguishable from promoter marks and bulk
   nucleosomes. These intronic marks were spatially reciprocal to
   trimethylated histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36me3), typically transitioning near
   internal exons. Several marks transitioned near bona fide exons, but not
   near nucleosomes at exon-like sequences. Therefore, we examined whether
   splicing affects histone marking. Even with considerable changes in
   regulated alternative splicing, histone marks were stable. Notably,
   these findings are consistent with exon definition influencing histone
   marks. In summary, we show that the location of many intragenic marks in
   humans can be distilled into a simple organizing principle: association
   with 5' intronic or 3' exonic regions.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal echocardiography has progressed to be able to diagnose many forms
   of congenital heart disease (CHD) and to assess the prognosis of cardiac
   lesions based on their anatomy and presentation in utero. Fetal
   echocardiography is for pregnancies at risk of structural, functional,
   and rhythm-related fetal heart disease. Routine obstetrical ultrasound
   screening is critical in the prenatal detection of fetal heart
   disease/CHD. With or without CHD, fetal heart dysfunction defined as
   inadequate tissue perfusion may occur. Perinatal problems other than CHD
   can also be assessed, such as the effects of noncardiac malformations
   that affect hemodynamics, that is, twin-twin transfusion. Cardiac rhythm
   can affect cardiac function and outcome, and prenatal diagnosis can be
   lifesaving. A tool for the assessment of cardiac function is the
   Cardiovascular Profile Score that combines ultrasonic markers of fetal
   cardiovascular unwellness based on univariate parameters, which have
   been correlated with perinatal mortality. This ``heart failure score''
   could potentially be used in much the same way as and in combination
   with the biophysical profile score. This study will present a summary of
   fetal Doppler and its place in the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis
   of fetal heart failure.}},

Title = {{Analysis of progression-free survival data using a discrete time
   survival model that incorporates measurements with and without
   diagnostic error}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background In cancer studies progression-free survival (PFS) is becoming
   a very important endpoint in the development of new therapeutic agents.
   Two methods of determining progression are typically used: (1) the local
   radiologist evaluates scans and (2) scans are reviewed by an independent
   blinded (central) reviewer. The second method is considered to be the
   reference standard but is expensive, time consuming, and logistically
   difficult. The first method has measurement error associated with it,
   but, it is less expensive and easier to obtain.
   Purpose This article explores a new
   method for analyzing PFS data. Methods When PFS data using the test with
   measurement error are analyzed, inferences about covariate effects may
   be invalid due to bias. A sampling strategy is evaluated where data are
   collected on a subset of subjects using the reference test and on all
   subjects using the test that has error. The strategy is designed to
   maintain valid inferences while requiring the more expensive or
   difficult test on a small proportion of patients. In the analysis of the
   data we incorporate subject-specific and time-dependent covariates into
   the diagnostic errors (sensitivity and specificity) of the tests. We
   also propose a modeling formulation that accounts for unobserved
   covariate affects on diagnostic error through a shared random effect. We
   explore the effect of different diagnostic test properties on inference
   via simulation and use the methodology to analyze a renal cancer
   example.
   Results The simulations show inference is correct when a subset of
   measurements without error are collected.
   Limitations When the sensitivity and specificity of the local review is
   low a large fraction of centrally reviewed tests are needed to have high
   efficiency.
   Conclusions When designing a study where PFS is the primary endpoint
   collecting centrally reviewed data on a subset of patients may provide a
   valid an more feasible approach than collecting centrally reviewed data
   on all patients. Clinical Trials 2010; 7: 634-642.

Abstract = {{A Murrah buffalo in second parity was presented to the Veterinary
   Teaching Hospital, Pantnagar for the correction of dystocia. During the
   general examination of animal, two supernumerary teats, one attached to

   of milk from both the additional teats along with normal (primary)
   teats. To confirm whether milk came from a different gland sinus or from
   the teat sinus of the normal (primary) teat, sterilised methylene blue
   was injected through the orifice of the additional teat using a teat
   canula. The colour of milk was noted after milking the teats ten minutes
   later. The coloured milk came out from additional teats while the colour
   of milk from primary teat was normal. This confirmed that the additional
   teats had separate gland sinuses indicating the accessory teats as
   conjoined. There was no interference with milking. The familial history
   of this buffalo revealed that the dam also had supernumerary teats,
   indicating the hereditary nature of the trait.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) by vascular
   endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 is necessary for
   proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro. Previous
   work has demonstrated that Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) promotes
   ubiquitination of PLC gamma 1 and suppression of its tyrosine
   phosphorylation. This study was designed to evaluate the importance of
   PLC gamma 1 and c-Cbl in experimental choroidal neovascularization
   (CNV).
   METHODS. The role of PLC gamma 1 was studied in three models of
   angiogenesis: the endothelial cell culture system, the chorioallantoic
   membrane (CAM) assay, and the laser-induced CNV model. Endothelial cells
   were analyzed for the role of PLC gamma 1 in promoting tube formation.
   CAMs were incubated with pharmacologic agents that either inhibit or
   stimulate PLC gamma 1. CNV was induced in wild-type and c-Cbl-knockout
   mice, and the progression of CNV was evaluated by fluorescein
   angiography.
   RESULTS. Activation of PLC gamma 1 was necessary for tube formation of
   endothelial cells. PLC gamma 1 stimulation increased the growth of blood
   vessels and conversely, PLC gamma 1 inhibition decreased the growth of
   blood vessels in the CAM model. CNV lesions in the c-Cbl-knockout mice
   were significantly greater in number, more confluent, and increased in
   size with time, compared with those in the control wild-type mice.
   CONCLUSIONS. The data show that PLC gamma 1 plays an important role in
   angiogenesis. Loss of c-Cbl results in enhanced CNV in the eye. The
   study also shows that c-Cbl plays an important role in ocular
   angiogenesis, suggesting that modulation of c-Cbl activity or inhibition
   of PLC gamma 1 would be a compelling target for antiangiogenesis
   therapy. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010;51:6803-6809)

   residue levels in liver and muscles of young chicks fed 6400 mu g/kg
   AFB1 was 6.97 +/- 0.08 and 3.27 +/- 0.05 ng/g, respectively. Maximum
   residue concentration was high in birds of young age and those kept on
   high AFB1 ration. After withdrawal of AF contaminated rations, residues
   clearance was slow and AFB1 was detectable in liver and muscles of birds
   for longer duration in younger birds and those fed high AFB1 dietary

   time when the heat loss was present. The similar variation was observed
   in changes in the thermal NO concentration that was evaluated by only
   considering the reactions associated with the thermal (Zeldovich) NO
   mechanism. With the heat loss increased, the calculated NOx
   concentration was substantially reduced for all equivalence ratios
   investigated. In addition, the reductions in the NOx concentration with
   respect to residence time became faster with increasing the equivalence
   ratio particularly for fuel rich conditions. The observed variations in
   the calculated NOx concentration over the residence time (NOx/tau) were
   found to fit well to the following correlation: ln(NOx/tau) = a(HLI) +
   b. In the correlation, HLI is the dimensionless heat loss parameter and
   coefficients a and b are constants expressed as a function of adiabatic
   flame temperature (for a given equivalence ratio) and equivalence ratio,
   respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many hog farmers are now suffering from high pig mortality rates due to
   various wasting diseases and increased breeding costs, etc. It is
   therefore necessary for hog farms to implement systematic and scientific
   pig production technology to increase productivity and produce high
   quality pork in order to solve these problems. In this study, we
   describe such a technology by suggesting a ubiquitous hog farm system
   which applies WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) technology to the pig
   industry. We suggest that a WSN and CCTV (Closed-circuit television)
   should be installed on hog farms to collect environmental and image
   information which shall then help producers not only in monitoring the
   hog farm via the Web from outside the farm, but also facilitate the
   control of hog farm facilities in remote locations. In addition,
   facilities can be automatically controlled based on breeding environment
   parameters which are already set up and a SMS notice service to notify
   of deviations shall provide users with convenience. Hog farmers may
   increase production and improve pork quality through this ubiquitous hog
   farm system and prepare a database with information collected from
   environmental factors and the hog farm control devices, which is
   expected to provide information needed to design and implement suitable
   control strategies for hog farm operation.}},

Abstract = {{Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma hormone carrier protein associated with
   hereditary and senile forms of systemic amyloid disease, wherein slow
   tetramer disassembly is thought to be an obligatory step. Plasma
   transport of retinol is carried out exclusively by the retinol-binding
   protein (RBP), through complexation with transthyretin, Using mass
   spectrometry to examine the subunit exchange dynamics, we find that
   retinol stabilizes the quaternary structure of transthyretin, through
   its interactions with RBP, reducing the rate of transthyretin
   disassembly similar to 17-fold compared to apoTTR. In the absence of
   retinol but in the presence of RBP, transthyretin is only marginally
   stabilized with the rate of disassembly reduced similar to two-fold with
   respect to apoTTR. Surprisingly, we found two retinoids that stabilize
   transthyretin directly, in the absence of RBP, whereas retinol itself
   requires RBP in order to stabilize transthyretin. Our results
   demonstrate new roles for RBP and retinoids as stabilizers of
   transthyretin.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: According to the clinical perspective, early diagnosis of
   the prodromal phase and early treatment provision in the first episode
   of psychosis (FEP) is able to prevent or reduce morbidity. The main aim
   of this study is to inventory and analyze the most important causes of
   treatment delay from the perspective of patients, families and
   healthcare providers. The secondary aim is to point out the most
   important consequences of treatment delay.
   Subjects and methods: The study was conducted on 28 patients
   hospitalized for FEP of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in the
   Psychiatry Clinic of Timisoara and Day-care center 2009. The
   corresponding sample of relatives consisted of 25 relatives, and the
   sample of health care providers of 10 general practitioners and 11
   psychiatrists. A semi-structured interview with open-ended questions was
   used.
   Results: Data analysis generated the following themes: society's beliefs
   and attitude about mental illness: fear of stigma and labeling,
   insufficient information, lack of infrastructure from the perspective of
   the professionals, and modified threshold for treatment initiation.
   Conclusions: Efforts at the level of Communities as well as efforts at
   the level of psychiatry specialists could help individuals and their
   families to overcome the illness situation and improve their quality of

Abstract = {{Exopolysaccharide (EPS) and hpopolysaccharide (LPS) from Bradyrhizobium

   understand this, we constructed mutants in B Japonicum USDA 110 impaired
   in galactose or galacturonic acid incorporation into the EPS without
   affecting the LPS The derivative LP 3010 had a deletion of lspL-ugdH and
   produced EPS without galacturonic acid whereas LP 3013, with an
   insertion in exoB, produced EPS without galactose In addition, the
   strain LP 3017, with both mutations, had EPS devoid of both galactosides
   The missing galactosides were not replaced by other sugars The defects
   in EPS had different consequences LP 3010 formed biofilms and nodulated
   but was defective in competitiveness for nodulation, and, inside
   nodules, the peribacteroid membranes tended to fuse, leading to the
   merging of symbiosomes Meanwhile, LP 3013 and LP 3017 were unable to
   form biofilms and produced empty pseudonodules but exoB suppressor
   mutants were obtained when LP 3013 plant inoculation was supplemented
   with wild-type EPS Similar phenotypes were observed with all these
   mutants in G soja Therefore, the lack of each galactoside in the EPS has
   a different functional effect on the B Japonicum-soybean symbiosis}},

Abstract = {{BLT2 is a low-affinity leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) receptor that is activated
   by 12(S)-hydroxyheptadeca-5Z,8E,10E-trienoic acid (12-HHT) and LTB4.
   Despite the well-defined proinflammatory roles of BLT1, the in vivo
   functions of BLT2 remain elusive. To clarify the role of BLT receptors
   in intestinal inflammation, we assessed susceptibility to dextran sodium
   sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice lacking either BLT1 or BLT2.
   BLT2(-/-) mice exhibited increased sensitivity to DSS as compared to
   wild-type and BLT1(-/-) mice, with more severe body weight loss and
   inflammation. Expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon
   (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6, chemokines such as CXC
   chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and
   metalloproteinases was highly up-regulated in the colons of DSS-treated
   BLT2(-/-) mice, and there was an enhanced accumulation of activated
   macrophages. Phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 (STAT3) was also markedly accelerated in the crypts of
   DSS-treated BLT2(-/-) mice. Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells
   transfected with BLT2 exhibited enhanced barrier function as measured by
   transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran leakage
   through MDCK monolayers. Thus, BLT2 is expressed in colon cryptic cells
   and appears to protect against DSS-induced colitis, possibly by
   enhancing barrier function in epithelial cells of the colon. These novel
   results suggest a direct anti-inflammatory role of BLT2 that is distinct
   from the proinflammatory roles of BLT1.-Iizuka, Y., Okuno, T., Saeki,

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional advantages of
   pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) in comparison with distal
   gastrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis (DG) in early gastric cancer
   (EGC). Between 2005 and 2007, 24 patients underwent PPG and 30 underwent
   DG. Subjective global assessment, objective data assessment, and
   endoscopic findings of the remnant stomach were compared between the two
   groups. Two years after surgery, the patients' body weights recovered to
   97\% in PPG, but they continued to decrease in DG. Postoperative blood
   lymphocyte counts remained low in DG, but recovered to preoperative
   levels 6 months after surgery in PPG. Food residue in the gastric
   remnant was frequently observed in PPG (71.4\%) than in DG (15.8\%, P =
   0.001). In nutritional aspect, PPG may be a more ideal operation than
   DG. However, food residue in the gastric remnant should be considered in
   PPG.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - Complications occur in diabetes despite rigorous efforts to
   control risk factors Since 2000 the National Development Programme for
   the Prevention and Care of Diabetes has worked to halve the incidence of
   amputations in 10 years Here we evaluate the impact of the efforts
   undertaken by analyzing the major amputations done in 1997-2007
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - All individuals with diabetes (n = 396
   317) were identified from comprehensive national databases Data on the
   first major amputations (n = 9 481) performed for diabetic and
   nondiabetic individuals were obtained from the National Hospital
   Discharge Register
   RESULTS - The relative risk for the first major amputation was 7 4(95\%
   CI 7 2-7 7) among the diabetic versus the nondiabetic population The
   standardized incidence of the first major amputation decreased among the
   diabetic and nondiabetic populations (48 8 and 25 2\% relative risk
   reduction respectively) over 11 years, and the time from the
   registration of diabetes to the first major amputation was significantly
   longer on average 1 2 years more The cumulative five-year postamputation
   mortality among diabetic individuals was 78 7\%
   CONCLUSIONS - In our nationwide diabetes database the duration from the
   registration of diabetes to the first major amputation increased and the
   incidence of major amputations decreased almost 50\% in 11 years
   Approximately half of this change was due to the increasing size of the
   diabetic population The risk for major amputation is more than sevenfold
   that among the nondiabetic population These results pose a continuous
   challenge to improve diabetes care}},

Abstract = {{Umbrella sampling in combination with a polarizable QM/MM model have
   been used to study the role of electrostatics and polarization in the
   translocation and selectivity properties of two K+ channels, KcsA and
   KirBac, with ions traversing the channel according to an ion water ion
   mechanism. Analysis of electrostatic interaction energies shows an
   increased electrostatic gradient within the KirBac channel relative to
   KcsA. Quantitative measurements of polarization effects induced by ions
   and water molecules in the channel suggest a decreased interaction with
   K+ and Rb+ close the S2 binding site. This effect cannot be explained
   solely by the geometry of the polarizable region, or by conformational
   changes in the filter, but appears to be due to the polarization of the
   valine residue of the TVGYG selectivity filter motif. We observe that
   the presence of an ion in the S2 site, and the absence of an ion at the
   S3 site, where there is a water molecule instead, depolarizes valine
   and, hence, decreases the interaction energy between that residue and
   the ion in S2. Our results suggest that the incorporation of
   polarization effects can make an observable difference to the potential
   experienced by an ion in the channel.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim:
   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy through the oral cavity of patients who have
   undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) causes some distress
   and puts these patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate results for the upper gastrointestinal tract by
   transgastrostomic endoscopy using an ultrathin endoscope.
   Methods:
   The study subjects were 43 patients, who underwent exchange of a PEG
   button or tube, 20-French or more in diameter. After PEG buttons or
   tubes were extracted from the gastrostomy tract, an ultrathin endoscope
   was inserted through the gastrostomy tract. The stomach and the duodenal
   bulb were observed and the esophagus was observed in retrograde passage.
   A new PEG button or tube was then inserted. The rate of successful
   insertion into the esophagus and duodenal bulb, the observation of the
   gastrostomy site in retroversion in the stomach, and the endoscopic
   findings were analyzed.
   Results:
   Ninety-nine examinations were carried out. The esophagus could be
   observed in 95 (96.0\%), the duodenum in 92 (92.9\%) and the gastrostomy
   site in the stomach in all. Gastric polyps were detected in four
   patients, gastric erosions in two, reflux esophagitis in two, polypoid
   lesion at the gastrostomy tract in two, gastric ulcer scar in one,
   duodenal ulcer scar in one, early gastric cancer in one and recurrent
   esophageal cancer in one. Neither discomfort nor complications occurred
   during transgastrostomic endoscopy.
   Conclusions:
   Observation of the upper gastrointestinal tract by transgastrostomic
   endoscopy using an ultrathin endoscope during a gastrostomy button or
   tube replacement may be useful and safe.}},

   multisectarian Lebanon, however, the Sunni/Catholic ban on third-party
   reproductive assistance has been lifted, because of Shia rulings
   emanating from Iran. Today, third-party reproductive assistance is
   provided in Lebanon to both Muslims and Christians, unlike in
   neighbouring Egypt and Italy. Such comparisons point to the need for
   understanding the complex interactions between law, religion, local
   moralities and reproductive practices for global bioethics. (C) 2010,

   of a particle method for flow simulation of seaside areas are presented.
   Since the analysis region was divided for parallel computation using a

   techniques were tested. The first was renumbering, which reduced the
   amount of communication. The second Was the use of a communication list
   including the maximum and minimum particle numbers. These techniques
   improved communication speed. Performance during large-scale simulation
   was examined by computing tsunami wave run-up on a seaside area using
   6,300,000 particles. A calculation time of 237 hr was used to generate
   real time data for 60s.}},

Abstract = {{Viscous elongation of glass rods has been investigated to improve
   procedures for producing parabolic capillaries from straight capillaries
   for use as intensity concentrating x-ray optical elements. Experiments
   and simulations have been carried out pulling Corning 7740 borosilicate
   glass rods in a cylindrical furnace. Simulations were based on
   one-dimensional and two-dimensional finite difference/element
   calculations, assuming that deformation occurred by linear viscous flow
   and that the temperatures in the glass remained in equilibrium with the
   temperatures measured along the axis of the furnace. Rates of elongation
   in experiments were smaller than those in simulations for later stages
   of the elongation process. Further experimental and analytical
   investigations ruled out explanations based on increased viscosities
   caused by structural relaxation or by partial crystallization and showed
   that the simulations gave incorrect results because they did not
   incorporate the dependence of local heat transfer processes on the glass
   rod radius. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The SLC26A4 gene encodes the transmembrane protein pendrin, which is
   involved in the homeostasis of the ion concentration of the endolymph of
   the inner ear, most likely by acting as a chloride/bicarbonate
   transporter. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene cause sensorineuronal hearing
   loss. However, the mechanisms responsible for such loss have remained
   unknown. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the function of ten
   missense pendrin mutations (p.P123S (Pendred syndrome), p.M147V (NSEVA),
   p.K369E (NSEVA), p.A372V (Pendred syndrome/NSEVA), p.N392Y (Pendred
   syndrome), p.C565Y (NSEVA), p.S657N (NSEVA), p.S666F (NSEVA), p.T721M
   (NSEVA) and p.H723R (Pendred syndrome/NSEVA)) reported in Japanese
   patients, and analyzed their cellular localization and anion exchanger
   activity using HEK293 cells transfected with each mutant gene.
   Immunofluorescent staining of the cellular localization of the pendrin
   mutants revealed that p.K369E and p.C565Y, as well as wild-type pendrin,
   were transported to the plasma membrane, while 8 other mutants were
   retained in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we analyzed whether salicylate,
   as a pharmacological chaperone, restores normal plasma membrane
   localization of 8 pendrin mutants retained in the cytoplasm to the
   plasma membrane. Incubation with 10 mM of salicylate of the cells
   transfected with the mutants induced the transport of 4 pendrin mutants
   (p.P123S, p.M147V, p.S657Y and p.H723R) from the cytoplasm to the plasma
   membrane and restored the anion exchanger activity. These findings
   suggest that salicylate might contribute to development of a new method
   of medical treatment for sensorineuronal hearing loss caused by the
   mutation of the deafness-related proteins, including pendrin. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The international environmental movement is readying itself to celebrate
   its 40th anniversary since the Stockholm Conference on the Human
   Environment (1972). During these four decades, while conservation and
   sustainable use of biodiversity has become accepted as a necessary
   condition for sustainable development, local and context-specific
   performance for integrating conservation and sustainable use of
   biodiversity remains fragmented and unable to meet globally-set
   performance targets. The origin and evolution of the UNESCO (United
   Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) Man and the
   Biosphere (MA B) Programme and its World Network of Biosphere Reserves
   (WNBR) is analysed to draw insights that explain and help improve the
   mismatch between the rates of global evolution of ideas and local
   evidence-based performance to integrate conservation and sustainable use
   of biodiversity. The World Network of Biosphere Reserves of the UNESCO
   MAB Programme, now comprises 564 sites in 109 countries. This UN asset
   could serve as a platform for international cooperation and sharing of
   lessons learned from efforts to integrate conservation and sustainable
   use of biodiversity with the socio-economic and environmental wellbeing
   of humans.}},

   RbOs(2)O(6) monotonically increases with increasing pressure and then
   abruptly vanishes at 6.0 GPa. Similar abrupt vanishment is also observed
   in KOs(2)O(6) at 5.2 GPa. Under high pressure above 5.8 GPa, other two
   anomalies are found instead of that of the superconductivity for
   RbOs(2)O(6). It is suggested that the abrupt destruction of the
   superconductivity and the appearance of anomalies under high pressure
   are important to understand the origin of the superconductivity in this

Abstract = {{A molybdenum-blue method with the preconcentration of ion pairing form
   on MF was applied for the speciation of phosphorus in coastal seawater
   at three points in Okinawa island and their monitoring from 2007 to
   2008. The features of water quality for coastal seawater near Okinawa
   island were discussed from four kinds of physicochemical forms of
   phosphorus, such as dissolved, particle-adsorbed, insoluble particulate,
   and total. As a result, analytical results for Sesoko island samples in
   the suburb area showed a significantly different concentration
   distribution from those for Tornari port samples in the urban area. The
   total concentrations of P for Sesoko island samples were 14.0 mu g L(-1)
   on the average, and 16\% and 65\% of the total P were dissolved and
   insoluble particulate forms, respectively. On the contrary, the total
   concentrations of P for Tomari port samples were 14.0 mu g L(-1) on the
   average and 64\% of total P was dissolved form. In addition, the
   concentration correlation between dissolved phosphate ions and trace
   metals classified as the nutrient type was investigated. The molar
   ratios of {[}Cd]/{[}PO(4)(3-)] for Sesoko island samples were 1.46-3.7 x
   10(-3), which were significantly the higher than those for literature
   values in open surface seawater of the North Pacific Ocean. The cause of
   higher ratios of {[}Cd]/{[}PO(4)(3-)] can be attributed to the input of
   Cd to the coastal seawater near Sesoko island or the difference of the
   intake speed of dissolved phosphate ions by each phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{Two different molecular weight hyperbranched polymers (HBP(L)-(PA)(2)

   group at the periphery and a low molecular weight hyperbranched polymer
   (HBP(L)-(PA)(2)-Ac) with both two phosphonic acid groups and an acryloyl
   group as a cross-linker at the periphery were successfully synthesized
   as thermally stable proton-conducting electrolytes. A cross-linked
   electrolyte membrane (CL-HBP(L)-(PA)(2)) was prepared by thermal
   polymerization of the HBP(L)-(PA)(2)-Ac using benzoyl peroxide. Ionic
   conductivities of the HBP(L)-(PA)(2), the HBP(H)-(PA)(2), and the
   CL-HBP(L)-(PA)(2) under dry condition and their thermal properties were
   investigated, and also, the effect of the phosphonic acid group number
   on them was discussed. Ionic conductivities of the HBP(L)-(PA)(2) and
   the HBP(H)-(PA)(2) were found to be 1.5 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 150 A
   degrees C and 3.6 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) at 143 A degrees C, respectively,
   under dry condition, and showed the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher type
   temperature dependence. The hyperbranched polymers and the cross-linked
   electrolyte membrane were thermally stable up to 300 A degrees C, and
   the cross-linked electrolyte membrane (CL-HBP-(PA)(2)) had suitable
   thermal stability as an electrolyte membrane for the high-temperature
   fuel cells under dry condition. Fuel cell measurement using a single
   membrane electrode assembly cell with the cross-linked membrane was
   performed.}},

   activity of kumazasa extract (KE) was assessed by the plaque reduction
   assay for the pseudorabies virus (PRV). KE reduced 99\% of the plaque
   formation of PRV at concentrations of 1.2\%, showing that KE inhibited
   PRV adsorption to cells and 1E180 expression. The polysaccharide
   fraction of KE showed a concentration dependent inhibition of PRV plaque
   formation. We conclude that KE possesses potent anti PRV activity, and
   the candidate responsible for the antiviral property was the
   polysaccharide fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To report our experience in the care of patients with minor
   salivary gland cancers occurring only in the oropharynx and to determine
   factors predictive of outcome.
   Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Setting: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
   Patients: Sixty-seven patients with malignant minor salivary gland
   tumors were identified from a preexisting database of patients with
   cancers of the oropharynx between January 1985 and December 2005.
   Main Outcome Measures: Overall survival, disease-specific survival, and
   recurrence-free survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Factors predictive of outcome were identified by univariate and
   multivariate analyses.
   Results: The most common histologic types were mucoepidermoid carcinoma
   in 26 patients (39\%), adenoid cystic carcinoma in 16 (24\%),
   adenocarcinoma in 16 (24\%), and malignant mixed tumor in 7 (10\%). The
   tumors were located in the base of the tongue in 41 patients (61\%),
   soft palate in 20 (30\%), and tonsil in 6 (9\%). With a median follow-up
   time of 86 months (range, 12249 months), overall outcomes at 5 and 10
   years were overall survival, 80\% and 53\%; disease-specific survival,
   87\% and 67\%; and recurrence-free survival, 69\% and 60\%,
   respectively. Tumor recurred in 20 patients (34\%); 12 of these patients
   had locoregional failure and 15 developed distant metastases.
   Multivariate analyses showed that clinical T stage, anatomic subsite,
   and margin status were independent predictors for overall survival; T
   stage and margin status were independent predictors for locoregional
   recurrence-free survival.
   Conclusion: Clinical T stage, anatomic subsite, and margin status are
   independent predictors of outcome of patients with minor salivary gland

Abstract = {{Background: HBV infection is prevalent in India and poses a potential
   risk of transmission by blood transfusion, but studies of risk factors
   for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage among Indian blood
   donors are lacking.
   Methods/Materials: Using a case-cohort design, we enrolled 71 cases with
   repeatedly reactive HBsAg results and a cohort of 212 contemporaneous
   blood donors with unknown HBsAg status. Questionnaire data were analysed
   using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: In our multivariate analysis controlling for age, HBsAg
   positivity was associated with repeat donor status (OR = 0 center dot
   34, 95\% CI 0 center dot 17-0 center dot 71 vs first-time donor status),
   residence outside Bangalore and Hosur (rural areas) (OR = 15 center dot
   66, 95\% CI 3 center dot 60-68 center dot 07vs Bangalore residence),
   having been a customer at a local barber shop (OR = 4 center dot 07,

   Conclusion: In addition to recognised demographic risk factors,

Abstract = {{Clinical decision-making is the basis for professional nursing practice.
   This can be taught and learned through appropriate teaching and clinical
   experiences. Unfortunately, it has been observed that many graduates are
   unable to demonstrate suitable clinical decision-making skills. Research
   and study on the process of decision-making and factors influencing it
   assists educators to find the appropriate educational and clinical
   strategies to teach nursing students. To explore the experience of
   nursing students and their view points regarding the factors influencing
   their development of clinical decision-making skills. An exploratory
   qualitative approach utilizing grounded theory methods was used; focus
   group interviews were undertaken with 32 fourth year nursing students
   and data were analysed using constant comparative analysis. Four main
   themes emerged from the data: clinical instructor incompetency, low
   self-efficacy, unconducive clinical learning climate and experiencing
   stress. The data indicated that students could not make clinical
   decisions independently. The findings of this study support the need to
   reform aspects of the curriculum in Iran in order to increase
   theory-practice integration and prepare a conductive clinical learning
   climate that enhances learning clinical decision-making with less
   stress.}},

   room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), salts which are liquid at room
   temperature, may be water-soluble or water immiscible, depending on the
   combination of cation and anion. They are efficient solvents for a wide
   range of solutes including drugs. The water-immiscible RTILs studied in
   this paper (the 1-butyl, hexyl and octyl 3-methyl imidazolium (BMIM,
   HMIM, and OMIM) hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) salts) can act as drug
   reservoirs. Passage of an electric current through these immiscible
   liquids can enhance the release of some solutes into an aqueous medium.
   Current flow (over the range 1-5 mA) increased the release rate of a
   solubilized hydrophilic solute, H-3-sucrose, and of a model hydrophobic
   drug, H-3-dexametasone. A threefold increase in the release rate of both
   sucrose and dexamethasone into water was observed under some conditions
   although the effect of application of current was not always linear.
   OMIM{[}PF6] was the most responsive liquid. Some measurable physical
   properties of the ionic liquids change on the application of current.
   For example, the surface tension of the three RTILs studied decreased
   significantly on application of current for 15 min (from 47.8 mNm(-1) to
   36.2 mNm(-1) for BMIM) but the effect on the surface tension of the OMIM
   salt was small. Only a small decrease in the viscosity of RTILs was
   observed. Although the mechanisms of the enhanced release are not yet
   elucidated, RTILs are potentially interesting depots for electrically
   controlled drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Background The Internet as a source of medical information has emerged
   during the last years There is a confusing amount of medical websites
   with a great diversity of quality Websites of radiotherapy institutions
   could offer a safe and an easy-to-control way to assist patients
   requests
   Material and Methods 205 Internet appearances of German radiotherapy
   institutions were analyzed in June 2009 (nonuniversity hospitals n =
   108, medical practices n = 62 university hospitals n = 35) For the
   evaluation of each homepage verifiable criteria concerning basic
   information service and medical issues were used
   Results The quality of information published via Internet by different
   radiotherapy institutions showed a large variety Basic information like
   telephone numbers, operating hours, and direction guidance were provided
   in 96 7\%, 40\%, and 50 7\%, respectively 85\% of the websites
   introduced the staff 50 2\% supplied photos and 14 h further information
   on the attending physicians The mean amount of continuative links to
   other websites was 5 4 the mean amount of articles supplying medical
   information for patients summed up to 4 6 Medical practices and
   university hospitals had statistically significant more informative
   articles and links to other websites than nonuniversity hospitals No
   statistically significant differences could be found in most other
   categories like service issues and basic information
   Conclusion Internet presences of radiotherapy institutions hold the
   chance to supply patients with professional and individualized medical
   information While some websites are already using this opportunity,
   others show a lack of basic information or of user-friendliness}},

Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Drawing on qualitative interviews with drug addicts in Copenhagen,
   Denmark, this article offers a phenomenological reading of a methadone
   maintenance program. The program is set within the principles of harm
   reduction, meaning that its aim is not to cure the participants'
   addiction but to keep them stable on substitution medicine and slow the
   deterioration of their lives. We analyze the program's implications for
   participants' sense of agency and constraint and for their orientations
   toward the past, present, and future. A major concern is with the
   program as a last resort policy that challenges neoliberal ideals of
   self-governance and self-development. While the program increases the
   participants' sense of stability by providing them with methadone and by
   allowing them to better address their economic, housing, and other needs
   of everyday life, it also represents a context of physical, emotional,
   and social dependence. The interviews cast the program as a paradox that
   simultaneously increases participants' sense of stability and
   vulnerability. In essence, the Danish methadone program has the effect
   of both helping the participants by reducing the drug-related harm in
   their lives and of fostering conditions of inferiorization and enduring
   nonbecoming.}},

Abstract = {{The retrospective narrative mode of the nineteenth-century Bildungsroman
   afforded an ideal arena for modelling hypotheses about the nature and
   function of memory. Memory had long been held to be part of the
   consciousness that divided humans from the animal world, but
   mid-nineteenth-century scientific theories questioned what part there
   remained for the moral and spiritual in the physiological operations of
   the brain. The exegetical, devotional and liturgical practices of the
   Christian Church had been predicated upon a particular understanding of
   the part played by memory in spiritual development, and this way of
   thinking was harder to discard than the dogma for those educated within
   its traditions. George Eliot's desire to retain a spiritual role for
   memory within a physiological account of its workings can be seen both
   in her protagonists' moral development and in the reading habits her
   fiction endeavours to foster. In the firmly post-Darwinian world of
   Hardy's Jude the Obscure, memory can no longer be held to act as a moral
   force, but Hardy continues to blame and lament Christian epistemology
   for its false promise. Modernist fiction reflected recent physiological
   and psychological thinking in representing memory as less susceptible to
   personal control and so drained it of moral significance.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) is an increasing risk
   factor for paradoxical cerebral embolism. Decompression Sickness (DCS)
   results from gas coming out of solution in the bodily fluids and tissues
   when a diver ascends too quickly. This occurs because decreasing
   pressure lowers the solubility of gas in liquid. Also, the expansion of
   gas in the lungs may lead to alveolar rupture which may, in turn, result
   in Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE). The amount of nitrogen that diffuses
   into the bodily tissues during a dive depends on the depth of the dive
   and the duration of exposure. PFO acquires significance in various
   congenital heart diseases leading to right to left shunt and thus to
   paradoxical embolism. The presence of asymptomatic brain lesion like
   ``spots{''} has been investigated in a randomized population of diving
   individuals. The partial pressure of the gas can be calculated by
   Henry's Law and the pressure of the blood stream can be calculated by
   Poiseuille's Law. The statistical comparison of the fractal dimension
   was obtained by means of Box Counting Method with slope analysis. We
   observe that PFO plays a significant role in the occurrence of
   unexplained cerebral DCS and white spots in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of pituitary adenoma compressing the optic
   chiasm on multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) responses and to
   compare these responses with visual field defects seen on static
   automated perimetry (SAP) Eight eyes of four subjects (median age, 41 50
   years, interquartile range, 33-51 years) who were diagnosed with
   pituitary adenoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and seen to have a
   bitemporal visual field defect on standard automated perimetry (SAP),
   and twelve age-matched normal subjects (median age, 47 00 years,
   interquartile range, 34 75-51 75 years) were subjected to multifocal
   visual evoked potential (mfVEP) testing The monocular latencies and
   monocular amplitudes of each sector of cases were compared with the
   responses of normative database The topography of the mfVEP response was
   compared with corresponding field defect as seen in total deviation
   threshold on SAP to allow a comparison with conventional subjective
   perimetry The mfVEP amplitudes were reduced in the areas with visual
   field defect on SAP In 6 out of 8 eyes, locations with preserved
   amplitudes and no visual defects showed prolonged latency A prolonged
   median latency of 9 17 ms (interquartile range 3 44-17 69 ms) in cases
   was seen when compared to the median latency of 1 67 ms (interquartile
   range, 0 94-4 17 ms) in age-matched controls with P value of 0 054
   Chiasmal compression due to pituitary adenoma causes the reduction of
   amplitudes and prolongation of latencies of the mfVEP response The mfVEP
   can be used to assess objectively the topography of the visual field in
   compressive optic neuropathy secondary to pituitary adenomas It can be
   used in assessing the subjects whose visual field report is unreliable
   and prolonged median latency can be an early sign of the disease}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To present outcomes of a contemporary series of patients
   undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer after previous
   treatment for localized cancer of the prostate (CaP).
   METHODS A retrospective review of more than 1000 RCs performed for
   bladder cancer between 1995 and 2008 identified 49 patients previously
   treated for localized CaP. Patients were stratified according to the
   type of primary therapy received for CaP: any form of primary or
   adjuvant radiotherapy (brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy)
   versus radical prostatectomy (RP) monotherapy. Perioperative data were
   analyzed and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS Of 49 patients, 40 (82\%) underwent primary or adjuvant
   radiotherapy and 9 (18\%) RP alone. Eleven (22\%) patients received a
   continent diversion. Mean estimated blood loss (EBL) and hospital stay
   were 979 mL and 12 days, respectively. Extravesical disease (>= pT3a)
   was present in 23 patients (57.5\%) in the radiotherapy group and in 2
   patients (22\%) in the RP group. Ten patients (all in the radiotherapy
   group) had a positive margin, 9 (90\%) of whom had pathologic T4
   disease. The overall major perioperative complication rate was 41\%. Of
   the 6 patients with an ONB (all after RP), 4 had severe incontinence.
   CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing RC after previous treatment for
   localized CaP are at increased risk for perioperative morbidity.
   Patients should be counseled that orthotopic diversion after RP may be
   associated with significant incontinence. Extravesical disease is more
   prevalent in patients treated with previous radiation. We observed a
   high rate of positive margins associated with pathologic T4 disease in
   this cohort. UROLOGY 76: 1430-1433, 2010. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are
   present in gastric cancer cells (GC). Moreover, the activity of total
   ADH and class IV isoenzymes is significantly higher in cancer tissue
   than in healthy mucosa. The activity of these enzymes in cancer cells is
   probably reflected in the sera and could thus be helpful for diagnostics
   of gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate a potential
   role of ADH and ALDH as tumor markers for gastric cancer. We defined
   diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, predictive value for positive and
   negative results, and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve for
   tested enzymes. Serum samples were taken from 168 patients with gastric
   cancer before treatment and from 168 control subjects. Total ADH
   activity and class III and IV isoenzymes were measured by photometric
   but ALDH activity and ADH I and II by the fluorometric method, with
   class-specific fluorogenic substrates. There was significant increase in
   the activity of ADH IV isoenzyme and ADH total in the sera of gastric
   cancer patients compared to the control. The diagnostic sensitivity for
   ADH IV was 73\%, specificity 79\%, positive and negative predictive
   values were 81 and 72\% respectively. Area under ROC curve for ADH IV
   was 0.67. The results suggest a potential role for ADH IV as marker of
   gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{A serious side effect of high-activity radioiodine therapy in the
   treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer is radiogenic salivary gland
   damage. This damage may be diminished by lemon-juice-induced saliva flow
   immediately after I-131 administration. The aim of this study was to
   assess the effect of chewing lemon slices on the absorbed (radiation)
   doses to the salivary glands.
   Ten patients received (pretherapy) I-124 PET(/CT) dosimetry before their
   first radioiodine therapy. The patients underwent a series of six PET
   scans at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 48 and a parts per thousand yen96 h and one
   PET/CT scan at 24 h after administration of 27 MBq I-124. Blood samples
   were also collected at about 2, 4, 24, 48, and 96 h. Contrary to the
   standard radioiodine therapy protocol, the patients were not stimulated
   with lemon juice. Specifically, the patients chewed no lemon slices
   during the pretherapy procedure and neither ate food nor drank fluids
   until after completion of the last PET scan on the first day. Organ
   absorbed doses per administered I-131 activity (ODpAs) as well as gland
   and blood uptake curves were determined and compared with published data
   from a control patient group, i.e. stimulated per the standard
   radioiodine therapy protocol. The calculations for both groups used the
   same methodology.
   A within-group comparison showed that the mean ODpA for the
   submandibular glands was not significantly different from that for the
   parotid glands. An intergroup comparison showed that the mean ODpA in
   the nonstimulation group averaged over both gland types was reduced by
   28\% compared to the mean ODpA in the stimulation group (p=0.01). Within
   each gland type, the mean ODpA reductions in the nonstimulation group
   were statistically significant for the parotid glands (p=0.03) but not
   for the submandibular glands (p=0.23). The observed ODpAs were higher in
   the stimulation group because of increased initial gland uptake rather
   than group differences in blood kinetics.
   The I-124 PET(/CT) salivary gland dosimetry indicated that lemon juice
   stimulation shortly after I-131 administration in radioiodine therapy
   increases the absorbed doses to the salivary glands.}},

Abstract = {{The esterification of fatty acids is an important pretreatment step in
   the production of biodiesel from low-cost raw materials. It was thus
   used as a model reaction in a study of the influence of concentration
   variations of the polar component (methanol) in a reaction mixture on
   the morphology and functioning of ion exchange catalysts. For a gel-type
   ion exchange catalyst, a decrease in the methanol concentration proved
   to have unambiguously negative effects, as it induced de-swelling of the
   polymer matrix and diminished the accessibility of the active centers.
   For macroreticular ion exchange catalysts, on the other hand, the drop
   in methanol concentration had a positive influence on the efficiency of
   the catalytic action mechanism of the acidic centers. This was due to
   the existence of some swelling-independent porosity, causing a shift
   from a general to a specific catalysis-like mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To achieve the goal of reducing the levels of chemical fertilizers
   applied in rice production, there is a need to develop microorganisms
   with the capacity to enhance plant growth. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that Bacillus cereus RS87 promotes growth of various plants
   in greenhouse and field trials. The objectives of this study were to (i)
   evaluate the efficacy and determine the optimum concentration of B.
   cereus RS87 to enhance growth of various Thai rice cultivars, (ii)
   measure the chlorophyll content in leaves affected by strain RS87, and
   (iii) investigate the capacity of strain RS87 to solubilize phosphate
   and produce siderophores. Three concentrations of strain RS87 (log 6.0,
   log 7.0, and log 8.0 CFU/mL) were applied to each rice cultivar.
   Superior responses (i.e., enhanced development of roots and shoots of
   all rice cultivars) were observed using RS87 at log 8.0 CFU/mL compared
   with lower bacterial concentrations and the water-treated control
   treatment. In addition, log 8.0 CFU/mL of RS87 provided the greatest
   root length and plant height of all rice cultivars 45 days after
   planting in the greenhouse. Rice leaves treated with log 8.0 CFU/ mL of
   RS87 yielded the highest total chlorophyll, specifically chlorophyll a
   and chlorophyll b, compared with the control. Strain RS87 also
   solubilized phosphate and produced siderophores. The results of these
   studies demonstrate that log 8.0 CFU/ mL is the optimum concentration of
   strain RS87 for growth promotion of various Thai rice cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{The refractive index changes in CSBN50 crystal under external electric
   field are experimentally investigated based on Michelson interferometer
   and digital image process. An expanded and collimated beam with a
   diameter of about 2.0 cm from a He-Ne laser with 632.8 nm wavelength is
   used to irradiate the crystal sample, and simultaneously, an external
   direct electric field is applied along the crystal c-axis with different
   amplitude. Because the incident light intensity is very low (about 1.5
   mW), the experimental results indicate that there are almost no index
   changes to be observed without the presence of external electric field.
   When the crystal is irradiated by laser beam on the condition of
   applying external electric field along the c-axis, both the e-light
   index and o-light index are obviously changed. The changed values
   increase with the increasing external electric field and its signs can
   be controlled by the orientation of the external electric field. (C)

Abstract = {{2,3-Butanediol, which is considered as an important fine and potential
   platform chemical, has been widely used in many fields such as
   materials, medicine, foods, aeronautics, astronautics, etc.
   Biotechnological production of 2,3-butanediol has a long history over
   100 years. Recently, microbial 2,3-butanediol production has attracted
   great attention as this means which depends on renewable bioresources is
   a promising route for developing low carbon economy and a gateway to a
   more sustainable future. In this review, the history of 2,3-butanediol
   fermentation is revisited and the metabolic mechanism of microbial
   2,3-butanediol accumulation and the related key genes and enzymes are
   firstly introduced. Some strategies for efficient and economical
   2,3-butanediol production, including using alternative cost-effective
   substrates to reduce the raw materials cost, strain improvement for
   enhancing the 2,3-butanediol yield and process development for improving
   the bioprocessing ecnomics, are then summarized. At last, various
   downstream separation methods for economical 2,3-butanediol recovering
   process are compared. It is pointed out that the focus of future
   research should be placed on improving biomass utilizing efficiency and
   enhancing 2,3-butanediol titer, also series of value-added
   2,3-butanediol derivatives could be exploited to further expand its
   applications.}},

Journal = {{EPL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, we study the influence of non-additive interactions on
   lane formation, using Langevin dynamics simulations. Lane formation and
   positive non-additivity have recently been observed in binary complex
   plasmas on board the International Space Station (ISS). Positive
   non-additivity of particle interactions is known to stimulate phase
   separation (demixing), but its effect on lane formation is unknown. We
   show that there is a non-additivity-stimulated crossover from the normal
   laning mode to a demixing-dominated laning mode. To analyze this
   crossover on the individual particle level we applied a very sensitive
   order parameter for lane formation based on anisotropic scaling indices.
   Extensive numerical simulations enabled us to identify a critical value
   of the non-additivity parameter Delta for the crossover. In addition the
   simulations revealed that the dynamics of lane formation is strongly
   influenced by the exact spatial configurations at the very moment of
   contact between two different complex plasmas. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2010}},

Abstract = {{The effects of particle size, stoichiometric ratio (lambda), atmosphere,
   temperature, and recycled NO on the emissions of three fractional
   nitrogens, {[}N](N2O), {[}N](NO) and {[}N](NO2), during the combustion
   of superfine pulverized coal in O-2/CO2 atmosphere were investigated in
   the present study. NO2 has shown little contribution to NOx compared
   with N2O and NO in all the cases. As the stoichiometric ratio increases,
   the trend is much similar in CO2/O-2 and N-2/O-2. However, the
   conversion ratio from fuel-N to NOx in CO2/O-2 atmosphere is less than
   that in N-2/O-2 atmosphere especially at lambda > 1.2. {[}N](NO) makes
   up the largest portion of {[}N](NOx) at lambda > 1, and {[}N](N2O)
   dominates at lambda < 1 resulting from the presence of hydrocarbons and
   CO at low stoichiometric ratio. For the three coals, {[}N](N2O)
   increases as the mean particle size increases while {[}N](NO) shows the
   opposite trend because the evolution of volatile nitrogen was delayed
   and the reburning-like scheme happened. There exists a minimum for the
   conversion ratio from fuel-N to NOx at the particle size range of 15-25
   mu m under the combined effects of {[}N](N2O) and {[}N](NO). As
   temperature goes up, {[}N](NO) and the conversion ratio from fuel-N to
   NOx increase while the {[}N](N2O) decreases obviously. The conversion
   ratio from fuel-N to NOx decreases while the reduction rate increases as
   recycled NO increases. Recycled NO is destroyed in the flame through its
   reactions with hydrocarbon radicals in the form of CHi, and reduction
   reactions occur between recycled NOx and fuel-N. The increase in NO
   concentration accelerates the formation reactions of N2O and also
   promotes the conversion of char-N to N2O.}},

Abstract = {{The resonance scattering spectral probe for Pb2+ was obtained using
   aptamer-modified AuPd Nanoalloy. In the pH 7.0 Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4 buffer
   solution, the aptamer interacted with AuPd nanoalloy particles to form
   stable aptamer-AuPd nanoalloy probe for Pb2+ that is stable in high
   concentration of salt. The probe combined with Pb2+ ions to form a
   G-quadruplex and to release AuPd nanoalloy particles that aggregate to
   form big particles which led the resonance scattering (RS) intensity
   enhancing. The reaction solution was filtered by 0.15 mu m membrane to
   obtain the filtration containing aptamer-AuPd nanoalloy probe that has
   strong catalytic effect on the electrodeless nickel particle plating
   reaction between Ni(II) and PO23- that exhibited a strong RS peak at 508
   nm. The RS intensity at 508 nm decreased when the Pb2+ concentration
   increased. The decreased intensity (Delta I-508nm) is linear to the
   concentration of 0.08-42 nM Pb2+, with regress equation of Delta I-508nm
   = 16.3c + 1.5, correlation coefficient of 0.9965, and detection limit of
   0.04 nM Pb2+. The RS assay was applied to the analysis of Pb2+ in
   wastewater, with satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Surgery is considered the treatment of choice
   for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with poor
   pulmonary function or other comorbidities are treated with radiotherapy.
   The objective of this investigation is to compare the 3-year survival of
   two early-stage NSCLC populations treated in two different hospitals,
   either by surgical resection (lobectomy) or by individualized high-dose
   accelerated radiotherapy, after matching patients by propensity scoring
   analysis.
   Methods: A retrospective comparative study has been performed on two
   series of consecutive patients with cytohistological diagnosis of NSCLC,
   clinically staged IA by means of PET-scan (radiotherapy group) and
   pathologically staged IA (surgery group).
   Results: A total of 157 cases were initially selected for the analysis
   (110 operated and 47 treated by radiotherapy). Patients in the
   radiotherapy group were older, with higher comorbidity and lower FEV1\%
   with 3-years probability of survival for operated patients higher than
   that found for patients treated by radiotherapy. After matching by
   propensity scoring (using age and FEV1\%), differences disappear and
   3-years probability of survival had no statistical differences.
   Conclusions: Although this is a non-randomized retrospective analysis,
   we have not found 3-years survival differences after matching cases
   between surgery and radiotherapy. Nevertheless, data presented here
   support the continuous investigation for non-surgical alternatives in
   this disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract = {{The kinetics of small fatigue crack growth at room temperature was
   measured using light microscopy observation of the cracks in a shallow
   notch of a cylindrical specimen. Symmetrical tension-compression cycling
   was adopted. The growth of the crack was measured within the range of

   A linear dependence between the crack growth rate and the crack length,
   observed in case of steels, was confirmed to be valid in the aluminium
   6082/T6 alloy, too. The crack growth coefficient k(g) increases with
   plastic strain amplitude; this dependence is well described by a power
   law. The fatigue life prediction based on the crack growth measurements
   is compared with the Manson-Coffin law. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, we determined the effects of raising seedlings with
   different light spectra such as with blue, red, and blue + red
   light-emitting diode (LED) lights on seedling quality and yield of red
   leaf lettuce plants. The light treatments we used were applied for a
   period of 1 week and consisted of 100 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot
   s(-1) of blue light, simultaneous irradiation with 50 mu mol center dot
   m(-2)center dot s(-1) of blue light and 50 mu mol center dot m(-2)center
   dot s(-1) of red light, and 100 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)
   of red light. At the end of the light treatment, that is 17 days after
   sowing (DAS), the leaf area and shoot fresh weight (FW) of the lettuce
   seedlings treated with red light increased by 33\% and 25\%,
   respectively, and the dry weight of the shoots and roots of the lettuce
   seedlings treated with blue-containing LED lights increased by greater
   than 29\% and greater than 83\% compared with seedlings grown under a
   white fluorescent lamp (FL). The shoot/root ratio and specific leaf area
   of plants irradiated with blue-containing LED lights decreased. At 45
   DAS, higher leaf areas and FWs were obtained in lettuce plants treated
   with blue-containing LED lights. The total chlorophyll (Chl) contents in
   lettuce plants treated with blue-containing and red lights were less
   than that of lettuce plants treated with FL, but the Chl a/b ratio and
   carotenoid content increased under blue-containing LED lights.
   Polyphenol contents and the total antioxidant status (TAS) were greater
   in lettuce seedlings treated with blue-containing LED lights than in
   those treated with FL at 17 DAS. The higher polyphenol contents and TAS
   in lettuce seedlings at 17 DAS decreased in lettuce plants at 45 DAS. In
   conclusion, our results indicate that raising seedlings treated with
   blue light promoted the growth of lettuce plants after transplanting.
   This is likely because of high shoot and root biomasses, a high content
   of photosynthetic pigments, and high antioxidant activities in the
   lettuce seedlings before transplanting. The compact morphology of
   lettuce seedlings treated with blue LED light would be also useful for
   transplanting.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a highly contagious respiratory
   disease of chickens caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV).
   The disease is mainly controlled through biosecurity and by vaccination
   with live-attenuated vaccines. The chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines,
   although proven to be effective in experimental settings, have limited
   efficacy in controlling the disease in dense broiler production sites
   due to unrestricted use and poor mass vaccination coverage. These
   factors allowed CEO vaccines to regain virulence, causing long lasting
   and, consequently, severe outbreaks of the disease. A new generation of
   viral vector fowl poxvirus (FPV) and herpesvirus of turkey (HVT)
   vaccines carrying ILTV genes has been developed and such vaccines are
   commercially available. These vaccines are characterized by their lack
   of transmission, lack of ILTV-associated latent infections, and no
   reversion to virulence. HVT-vectored ILTV recombinant vaccines were
   originally approved for subcutaneous HVT or transcutaneous (pox)
   delivery. The increased incidence of ILTV outbreaks in broiler
   production sites encouraged the broiler industry to deliver the FPV-LT
   and HVT-LT recombinant vaccines in ovo. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate the protection induced by ILTV viral vector recombinant
   vaccines after in ova application in 18-day-old commercial broiler
   embryos. The protection induced by recombinant ILTV vaccines was
   assessed by their ability to prevent clinical signs and mortality; to
   reduce challenge virus replication in the trachea; to prevent an
   increase in body temperature; and to prevent a decrease in body weight
   gain after challenge. In this study, both recombinant-vectored ILTV
   vaccines provided partial protection, thereby mitigating the disease,
   but did not reduce challenge virus loads in the trachea.}},

   were seven to ten days apart, which suggested differences in prey
   availability between the two periods. Since the average number of fish
   recovered in pellets was significantly higher than that in stomachs, use
   of pellets to determine fish consumption of double-crested cormorants
   may be more valid than stomach analysis because pellet content represent
   an integrated sampling of food consumed over approximately 24 hours.}},

Abstract = {{T his article addresses the policing of consensual sexual activity in
   public places in New South Wales (NSW) Australia It draws upon data
   produced during a qualitative study conducted in NSW that involved
   semistructured interviews with key professionals who have specialist
   knowledge of this area of policing Using these interview data and an
   analysis of NSW Police policy documents the article considers opera
   tonal policing within the broader context of contemporary NSW law It
   argues that the legal construction of public sex offences facilitates
   forms of police discretion that, because of the social and moral
   landscape in which such discretion takes place encourages the
   disproportionate social control of male homosexual conduct By thinking
   of policing as a dynamic arena in which competing moral values are
   brought into tension the article explores how the moral decision making
   of police officers (a product of their moral habitus) determines the
   scope and application of the law It concludes by arguing that the
   problem of selective enforcement in relation to male homosexuality lies
   not in policing or in police culture but in law that allows
   heteronormative social morality to become translated into police
   practice}},

   strain reduced the system of exact governing differential equations to a
   single equation of a single dependent variable. The approximated

   Tetherin/BST-2-Mediated Restriction in T cells}},

Abstract = {{Direct cell-to-cell spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1) between T cells at the virological synapse (VS) is an efficient
   mechanism of viral dissemination. Tetherin (BST-2/CD317) is an
   interferon-induced, antiretroviral restriction factor that inhibits
   nascent cell-free particle release. The HIV-1 Vpu protein antagonizes
   tetherin activity; however, whether tetherin also restricts cell-cell
   spread is unclear. We performed quantitative cell-to-cell transfer
   analysis of wild-type (WT) or Vpu-defective HIV-1 in Jurkat and primary
   CD4(+) T cells, both of which express endogenous levels of tetherin. We
   found that Vpu-defective HIV-1 appeared to disseminate more efficiently
   by cell-to-cell contact between Jurkat cells under conditions where
   tetherin restricted cell-free virion release. In T cells infected with
   Vpu-defective HIV-1, tetherin was enriched at the VS, and VS formation
   was increased compared to the WT, correlating with an accumulation of
   virus envelope proteins on the cell surface. Increasing tetherin
   expression with type I interferon had only minor effects on cell-to-cell
   transmission. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
   depletion of tetherin decreased VS formation and cell-to-cell
   transmission of both Vpu-defective and WT HIV-1. Taken together, these
   data demonstrate that tetherin does not restrict VS-mediated T cell-to-T
   cell transfer of Vpu-defective HIV-1 and suggest that under some
   circumstances tetherin might promote cell-to-cell transfer, either by
   mediating the accumulation of virions on the cell surface or by
   regulating integrity of the VS. If so, inhibition of tetherin activity
   by Vpu may balance requirements for efficient cell-free virion
   production and cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 in the face of antiviral
   immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a group of small non-coding RNA molecules
   generally 18-22 base-pairs in length. miRNAs are considered to be
   negative regulators of gene expression at the level of
   post-transcription and are important in normal physiological
   development, tissue homeostasis and disease. The cellular origin of
   individual microRNAs is of utmost importance for understanding their
   roles in molecular and biological processes, in multi-cellular and
   complex structured tissues. For the localization of miRNAs in clinical
   and experimental formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples we have
   developed a simple and robust one-day in situ hybridization protocol
   based on the use of double digoxigenin (DIG)labeled LNA-DNA chimeric
   probes. We show that the protocol enables analyses of specificity, and
   demonstrate the detection of miR-1, miR-21, miR-124, miR-126, miR-145,
   and miR-205 in human and murine paraffin material. The well established
   localization of these microRNAs makes them ideal for use as reference
   microRNAs when optimizing the microRNA in situ hybridization assay for a
   particular tissue and miRNA. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An aminopropyltrimethoxysilane functionalized chitosan was found to be
   an efficient solid base catalyst for the self-aldol condensation of

   and TGA. The modified chitosan was evaluated for the aldol condensation
   of C-3-C-7 linear aldehydes in which the selective formation was
   obtained for alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. A decreasing trend in the
   conversion from propanal to heptanal was observed. Propanal and pentanal
   were subjected for detail investigations to study the effect of
   parameters like amount of catalyst and aldehyde, and temperature on the
   conversion and selectivity. Kinetic performance of the modified chitosan
   investigated for a representative aldehyde, pentanal showed that the
   rate was increased with the catalyst amount, pentanal and temperature.
   The catalyst was reused up to six cycles without significant loss in its
   activity and selectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of choice for HCC with cirrhosis is liver transplantation
   (LT). We assessed if patients evaluated for hepatocellular carcinoma are
   being diagnosed by surveillance, the proportion of patients meeting
   Milan criteria at diagnosis, and rates of liver transplantation.
   All HCC cases in cirrhotic patients at Duke University Medical Center in
   the MELD era (Feb 2002-Oct 2008) were identified. Surveillance was
   defined as an imaging exam for detection of HCC in the 12 months prior
   to diagnosis of HCC. Logistic regression was used to examine predictors
   of LT.
   There were 319 cases meeting diagnostic criteria for HCC. Only 30.7\%
   were diagnosed by surveillance and 43.7\% met Milan criteria at
   diagnosis. Patients diagnosed by surveillance were more likely to meet
   Milan criteria and to receive LT (p < 0.0001 for both outcomes).
   Surveillance was associated with higher rates of LT with an OR 2.6 (95\%
   CI 1.2-5.7, p = 0.02).
   Patients managed by a hepatologist were more likely to be diagnosed by
   surveillance (65.9 vs. 19.0\%, p < 0.0001). Patients meeting Milan
   criteria managed by a hepatologist were more likely to receive LT than
   those referred from other providers (26.4 vs. 8\%, p = 0.009).
   A minority of HCC cases in cirrhotic patients were diagnosed by
   surveillance, and only 12.5\% underwent LT. Patients diagnosed by
   surveillance were more likely to meet Milan criteria and to undergo LT.
   These findings highlight the need for increased identification of
   patients with chronic liver disease and for subsequent referral to
   hepatologists for enrollment in HCC surveillance programs.}},

Abstract = {{Crowd simulation has been an important research field due to its diverse
   range of applications that include film production, military simulation,
   and urban planning. A challenging problem is to provide simple yet
   effective control over captured and simulated crowds to synthesize
   intended group motions. We present a new method that blends existing
   crowd data to generate a new crowd animation. The new animation can
   include an arbitrary number of agents, extends for an arbitrary
   duration, and yields a natural-looking mixture of the input crowd data.
   The main benefit of this approach is to create new spatio-temporal crowd
   behavior in an intuitive and predictable manner. It is accomplished by
   introducing a morphable crowd model that allows us to encode the
   formations and individual trajectories in crowd data. Then, its original
   spatiotemporal behavior can be reconstructed and interpolated at an
   arbitrary scale using our morphable model.}},

Abstract = {{Subambient temperature operations of advanced semiconductor devices
   offer many benefits, including improved reliability, reduced leakage
   currents, and enhanced signal to noise ratios. We discuss a new design
   concept for compact solid-state refrigerators based on the
   electrocaloric (EC) effect. The EC refrigerators are attractive because
   they may approach the Carnot efficiency more closely than Peltier
   coolers, which involve intrinsically irreversible processes. To address
   parasitic losses and other practical considerations that limit the
   actual performance of EC coolers, we incorporate laterally
   interdigitated electrode arrays with high effective thermal conductivity
   and switchable thermal interfaces with high switching ratios and high
   off-state thermal resistance. Numerical simulations are used to quantify
   the impact of various design parameters and the expected performance of
   the module, focusing in particular on the heat diffusion time and RC
   thermal time constant. Based on the material properties reported in the
   literature, we project that cooling power densities > 10 W/cm(2) may be
   achieved across Delta T of the order of 10 K at coefficient of
   performance (COP) > 10. The present work motivates further experimental
   studies to develop advanced electrocaloric materials and fabricate/test
   cooling modules to assess the feasibility of their practical

Abstract = {{Weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation may be associated with
   mental discomfort. It is not known whether such discomfort is linked
   with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Accordingly, we investigated whether PTSD occurs in patients after
   weaning from prolonged ventilation. We also determined whether
   administering a questionnaire would identify patients at risk for
   developing PTSD.
   A prospective longitudinal study of patients transferred to a long-term
   acute-care hospital for weaning from prolonged ventilation was
   undertaken: 72 patients were studied 1 week after weaning, and 41
   patients were studied again 3 months later. An experienced psychologist
   conducted a structured clinical interview 3 months after weaning to
   establish a diagnosis of PTSD. To assess for the presence of
   PTSD-related symptoms, the post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS-10)
   questionnaire was administered 1 week after weaning and 3 months later.
   The psychologist diagnosed PTSD in 12\% of patients 3 months after
   ventilator weaning. Patients who developed PTSD were more likely to have
   a previous history of psychiatric disorders (P < 0.02). A PTSS-10 score
   > 20 one week after weaning reliably identified patients who were
   diagnosed with PTSD 3 months later: sensitivity 1.0; specificity 0.76;
   area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.91.
   PTSD was diagnosed in 12\% of patients who were weaned from prolonged
   ventilation. A PTSS-10 score > 20 one week after weaning identified
   patients diagnosed with PTSD 3 months later. This finding suggests that
   a simple questionnaire administered before hospital discharge can
   identify patients at risk for developing PTSD.}},

Journal = {{NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{529-539}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Determining the effectiveness and limitations of near-surface,
   non-invasive geophysical techniques is imperative when attempting to
   locate clandestine burials. Unlike in archaeology, there has been
   limited forensic research with regard to optimum methodologies, with
   most emphasis to date being on metal detectors and ground-penetrating
   radar. However, these techniques may not be suitable in certain soil
   types (e.g., conductive or highly magnetic) or for certain non-metallic
   targets. Therefore, in this study, magnetic and electrical resistivity
   detection techniques have been utilized over different aged (0.25-1
   year) simulated clandestine burials with no buried metal, in contrasting
   depositional environments. These environments included semi-rural,
   urban, woodland and a parkland medieval grave site acting as an
   archaeological analogue.
   The magnetic surveys showed mixed success in detecting clandestine
   burials. Elevated magnetic gradient readings, with respect to background
   values, were observed over very shallow burials, whereas deeper burials
   displayed a reduction in gradient and/or no associated magnetic
   anomalies. Magnetic anomalies were observed over surface-burials and
   validated by simple 2D forward modelling. Magnetic anomalies were also
   observed in the control data set. Electrical resistivity surveys
   produced anomalies over all the simulated burial positions, including
   surface burials but did not produce anomalies at the archaeological
   analogue site.
   Laboratory analysis of fluid retrieved from simulated graves showed an
   overall increase in iron levels over a year post-burial, which may
   account for the observed magnetic anomaly variation. There was also a
   corresponding increase in grave `fluid' conductivity, which was
   interpreted to be the cause of the observed low resistivity anomalies.
   This research suggests that, as a technique for locating clandestine
   burials, bulk ground resistivity is more successful than the tested
   magnetic methods. Moreover, magnetic techniques are more effective when
   used as part of a multi-technique study over rural and semi-rural sites
   that are relatively low in magnetic and electrical `noise'. These
   results have important implications for the use of geophysical
   techniques when searching for clandestine burials. We emphasize that
   local depositional environment, soil type, likely style of burial and
   search area size should all be considered when choosing forensic
   geophysical detection techniques. We also provide evidence to show that
   geophysical data can assist in locating a primary deposition site even
   when no physical evidence remains.}},

   the inclusion of 6\% HP-cDDG or greater in the diets negatively impacted
   body weight (BW) gain and feed conversion ratio as compared with the

   HP-cDDG and to be isocaloric. The crumble (0 to 15 d of age) and pellet
   diets (16 to 33 d of age) were fed to eight replications per treatment
   containing 40 chicks per replication. There was no effect of up to 16\%
   HP-cDDG inclusion on broiler performance during the starter period (0 to
   15 d of age). However, any inclusion of HP-cDDG in the diets during the
   grower period (16 to 33 d of age) significantly decreased BW gain as
   compared with the control diet. Also, the inclusion of 9\% HP-cDDG or
   greater to the diets negatively impacted feed conversion ratio. The
   reason for the depression in performance was also likely due to a lysine
   deficiency. In conclusion, HP-cDDG could be an acceptable feed
   ingredient for broilers, but special attention must be paid to the amino
   acid levels (especially lysine) in order to prevent deficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{The biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds is a critically
   important process in global sulfur biogeochemistry. In this study, we
   enriched from marine sediments under denitrifying conditions,
   chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidizers that could oxidize a variety of
   reduced sulfur compounds: thiosulfate, tetrathionate, sulfide, and
   polysulfide. Two major phylotypes of 16S rRNA gene (>99\% identity in
   each phylotype) were detected in this enrichment culture. In order to
   characterize sulfide oxidation, we sequenced and characterized one
   fosmid clone (43.6 kb) containing the group I sulfide-quinone reductase
   (sqr) gene. Interestingly, four putative rhodanese genes were found in
   this clone. Furthermore, comparative alignment with the closest genome
   of Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL2 revealed that three homologous genes
   were located within the vicinity of the sqr gene. Fosmid clones
   harboring carbon fixation (cbbL and cbbM) and denitrification (narG)
   genes were screened, and the phylogeny of the functional genes was
   analyzed. Along with the comparison between the sqr-containing fosmid
   clones and the relevant gamma-proteobacteria, our phylogenetic study
   based on the 16S rRNA gene and carbon fixation genes suggest the
   prevalence of chemolithotrophic gamma-proteobacteria in the denitrifying
   cultures. The findings of this study imply that a combination of
   cultivation and metagenomic approaches might provide us with a glimpse
   into the characteristics of sulfur oxidizers in marine sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Study of nervous systems via the connectome, the map of connectivities
   of all neurons in that system, is a challenging problem in neuroscience.
   Towards this goal, neurobiologists are acquiring large electron
   microscopy datasets. However, the shear volume of these datasets renders
   manual analysis infeasible. Hence, automated image analysis methods are
   required for reconstructing the connectome from these very large image
   collections. Segmentation of neurons in these images, an essential step
   of the reconstruction pipeline, is challenging because of noise,
   anisotropic shapes and brightness, and the presence of confounding
   structures. The method described in this paper uses a series of
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a framework combined with a feature
   vector that is composed of image intensities sampled over a stencil
   neighborhood. Several ANNs are applied in series allowing each ANN to
   use the classification context provided by the previous network to
   improve detection accuracy. We develop the method of serial ANNs and
   show that the learned context does improve detection over traditional
   ANNs. We also demonstrate advantages over previous membrane detection
   methods. The results are a significant step towards an automated system
   for the reconstruction of the connectome. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Automatic heterogeneous image recognition is a challenging research
   topic in computer vision. In fact, a general purpose images require
   multiple descriptors to cover their diverse category contents. However,
   not all extracted features are always relevant. Furthermore, simply
   concatenating multiple features may not be efficient for recognizing
   images in heterogeneous databases. In this context, we propose a new
   heterogeneous image recognition system, which aims to enhance the
   recognition results while decreasing the computational complexity. In
   particular, the proposed system is based on two complementary methods:
   adaptive relevant feature selection and multi-model classification
   method (MM-CM). Since it employs hierarchically selected features, the
   MM-CM ensures better classification accuracy and significantly less
   computation time than existing classification methods. The performance
   of the proposed image recognition system is assessed through two image
   databases and a large number of features. A comparison with competing
   algorithms from the literature is also provided. Our extensive
   experimental results show that an adaptive feature selection based MM-CM
   outperforms existing methods and improves the classification results in
   heterogeneous image databases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Object. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of
   posttraumatic hydrocephalus in severely head-injured patients who
   required decompressive craniectomy (DC). Additional objectives were to
   determine the relationship between hydrocephalus and several clinical
   and radiological features, with special attention to subdural hygromas
   as a sign of distortion of the CSF circulation.
   Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective study of 73 patients with
   severe head injury who required DC. The patients were admitted to the
   authors' department between January 2000 and January 2006. Posttraumatic
   hydrocephalus was defined as: 1) modified frontal horn index greater
   than 33\%, and 2) the presence of Gudeman CT criteria. Hygromas were
   diagnosed based on subdural fluid collection and classified according to
   location of the craniectomy.
   Results. Hydrocephalus was diagnosed in 20 patients (27.4\%). After uni-
   and multivariate analysis, the presence of interhemispheric hygromas
   (IHHs) was the only independent prognostic factor for development of
   posttraumatic hydrocephalus (p < 0.0001). More than 80\% of patients
   with IHHs developed hydrocephalus within the first 50 days of undergoing
   DC. In all cases the presence of hygromas preceded the diagnosis of
   hydrocephalus. The IHH predicts the development of hydrocephalus after
   DC with 94\% sensitivity and 96\% specificity. The presence of an IHH
   showed an area under the receiver-operator characteristic of 0.951 (95\%
   CI 0.87-1.00; p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Hydrocephalus was observed in 27.4\% of the patients with
   severe traumatic brain injury who required DC. The presence of IHHs was
   a predictive radiological sign of hydrocephalus development within the
   first 6 months of DC in patients with severe head injury. (DOI:

Abstract = {{The interferon-gamma-release assays were developed to overcome the
   pitfalls and logistic difficulties of the tuberculin skin test (TST) for
   the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). These blood tests
   measure the in vitro production of interferon-gamma by sensitized
   lymphocytes in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens.
   Two interferon-gamma-release assays are registered for use in Canada:
   the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (Cellestis Inc, Australia) and the
   T. SPOT-TB test (Oxford Immunotec, United Kingdom). Evaluation of these
   tests has been hampered by the lack of a gold standard for LTBI, and
   limited paediatric data on their use. It appears that they are more
   specific than the TST, and may be useful for evaluating TST-positive
   patients at low risk of true LTBI. Moreover, they may add sensitivity if
   used in addition to the TST in immuno-compromised patients, very young
   children and close contacts of infectious adults. A summary of these
   tests, their limitations and their application to clinical paediatric
   practice are described.}},

Abstract = {{Natural convection is the governing phenomena in many material
   processing applications. The conventional method of uniform heating at
   the bottom wall of an enclosure may result in inadequate thermal mixing
   and poor temperature distribution leading energy wastage. In this work,
   an alternative, energy-efficient method of distributed heating of the
   cavity is studied and compared with the isothermal bottom wall heating
   case in enhancing the thermal mixing and improving the temperature
   distribution in the cavity. Steady laminar natural convection of various
   fluids of industrial importance (Pr = 0.015, 07, 10, 1000) in the range
   of Ra = 10(3)-10(5) is studied in a differentially heated cavity and in
   two cases of discretely heated square cavities. Detailed analysis is
   carried out by visualizing the heat flow by heatlines. The thermal
   mixing and temperature uniformity in each case are quantified in terms
   of cup-mixing temperature and root-mean square deviation (RMSD),
   respectively. It is found that thermal management policy of distributed
   heating significantly influences the thermal mixing and temperature
   uniformity in the enclosures. In a case with multiple discrete heat
   sources, a remarkable uniformity in temperature across the cavity is
   achieved with moderate thermal mixing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ontogeny and differentiation stages of digestive systems related

   puntazzo, were investigated from hatching to 40 DAH (days after
   hatching), and total lengths and weights of larvae were determined
   Histologic and enzymatic techniques were used to explain the functional
   development of the pancreas including trypsin activity The pancreas was
   identified as a compact structure located in the region slightly
   posterior to the liver At 3 DAH, first anus and then mouth opened
   Incipient pancreas secretion polyhedral cells could be first observed as
   zymogen granules During larval metamorphosis, the pancreas became
   diffuse, spreading throughout the mesentery in proximity to the stomach,
   the anterior intestine and the pyloric caeca The specific activity of
   trypsin (42 54 +/- 6 8 mU/mg protein(-1)) was found as early as after
   hatching at larvae size of 2 87 +/- 0 34 mm at 0 DAH Activity further
   increased until 10 DAH, especially after exogenous feeding The highest
   trypsin activity was detected at 25 DAH as 119 26 +/- 11 6 mU/mg
   protein(-1) It is concluded that exocrine pancreas organogenesis is the
   main critical step in the development of digestive system that results

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing demands for higher data rate applications, also
   due to the actual spectrum crowd situation, Dynamic Spectrum Access
   (DSA) turned into an active research topic. In this paper, we analyse
   DSA in cellular networks context, where a Coordinated Access Band ( CAB)
   is shared between Radio Access Networks (RANs). We propose a Semi-Markov
   Decision Process ( SMDP) approach to derive the optimal DSA policies in
   terms of operator reward. In order to overcome the limitations induced
   by optimal policy implementation, we also propose two simple, though
   sub-optimal, DSA algorithms: a Q-learning (QL) based algorithm and a
   heuristic algorithm. The achieved reward using the latter is shown to be
   very close to the optimal case and thus to significantly exceed the
   reward obtained with Fixed Spectrum Access (FSA). The rewards achieved
   by using the QL-based algorithm are shown to exceed those obtained by
   using FSA. Higher rewards and better spectrum utilisation with DSA
   optimal and heuristic methods are, however, obtained at the price of a
   reduced average user throughput. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This study shows how applying compressed sensing (CS) to F-19 chemical
   shift imaging (CSI) makes highly accurate and reproducible
   reconstructions from undersampled datasets possible. The missing
   background signal in F-19 CSI provides the required sparsity needed for
   application of CS.
   Simulations were performed to test the influence of different CS-related
   parameters on reconstruction quality. To test the proposed method on a
   realistic signal distribution, the simulation results were validated by
   ex vivo experiments. Additionally, undersampled in vivo 3D CSI mouse
   datasets were successfully reconstructed using CS.
   The study results suggest that CS can be used to accurately and
   reproducibly reconstruct undersampled F-19 spectroscopic datasets. Thus,
   the scanning time of in vivo F-19 CSI experiments can be significantly
   reduced while preserving the ability to distinguish between different
   F-19 markers. The gain in scan time provides high flexibility in
   adjusting measurement parameters. These features make this technique a
   useful tool for multiple biological and medical applications. (C) 2010

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{This first part of a series of papers on the thermo-mechanical responses
   of fiber-reinforced composites at elevated temperatures reports the
   experimental results required as input data in order to validate the
   kinetic, heat transfer, and thermo-mechanical models being developed and
   to be discussed in subsequent papers. Here the experimental techniques
   used for the determination of physical, thermal, and mechanical
   properties and their significance for particular models are discussed.
   The fire retardant system used to improve the fire performance of glass
   fiber-reinforced epoxy composites is a combination of a cellulosic
   charring agent and an interactive intumescent, melamine phosphate.
   Thermogravimetry is used to obtain kinetic parameters and to evaluate
   the temperature-dependent physical properties such as density, thermal
   conductivity, and specific heat capacity, determined using other
   techniques. During flammability evaluation under a cone calorimeter at
   50 kW/m(2) heat flux, thermocouples are used to measure temperatures
   through the thicknesses of samples. To investigate their
   thermo-mechanical behavior, the composites are exposed to different
   heating environments and their residual flexural modulus after cooling
   to ambient temperatures determined. At a low heating rate of 10AC/min
   and convective conditions, there was a minimal effect of fire retardant
   additives on mechanical property retention, indicating that fire
   retardants have no effect on the glass transition temperature of the
   resin. On the other hand, the fire-retarded coupons exposed to a radiant
   heat from cone calorimeter, where the heating rate is about 200AC/min,
   showed 60\% retention of flexural modulus after a 40-s exposure,
   compared to 20\% retention observed for the control sample after cooling
   specimens to ambient temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Retroviral vectors remain the most efficient and widely applied system
   for induction of pluripotency. However, mutagenic effects have been
   documented in both laboratory and clinical gene therapy studies,
   principally as a result of dysregulated host gene expression in the
   proximity of defined integration sites. Here, we report that cells with
   characteristics of pluripotent stem cells can be produced from normal
   human fibroblasts in the absence of reprogramming transcription factors
   (TFs) during lentiviral (LV) vector-mediated gene transfer. This
   occurred via induced alterations in host gene and microRNA (miRNA)
   expression and detrimental changes in karyotype. These findings
   demonstrate that vector-induced genotoxicity may alone play a role in
   somatic cell reprogramming derivation and urges caution when using
   integrating vectors in this setting. Clearer understanding of this
   process may additionally reveal novel insights into reprogramming
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in sequencing the Pneumocystis carinii genome have, helped
   identify potential metabolic pathways operative in the organism. Also,
   data from characterizing the biochemical and physiological nature of
   these organisms now allow elucidation of metabolic pathways as well as
   pose new challenges and questions that require additional experiments.
   These experiments are being performed despite the difficulty in doing
   experiments directly on this, pathogen that has yet to be subcultured
   indefinitely and produce mass numbers of cells in vitro. This article
   reviews biochemical approaches that have provided insights into several
   Pneumocystis metabolic pathways. It focuses on 1)
   S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet; SAM), which is a ubiquitous participant
   in numerous cellular reactions; 21 sterols: focusing on oxidosqualene
   cyclase that forms lanosterol in P carinii; SAM:sterol C-24
   methyltransferase that adds methyl groups at the C-24 position of the
   sterol side chain; and sterol 14 alpha-demethylase that removes a methyl
   group at the C-14 position of the sterol nucleus; and 3) synthesis of
   ubiquinone homologs, which play a pivotal role in mitochondrial inner
   membrane and other cellular membrane electron transport.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effectiveness of negative evidence and its
   explicitness and positioning factors in the learning of Korean as a
   heritage language at the postsecondary level. The explicitness factor
   was divided into explicit versus implicit categories, depending on the
   presence or absence of an alternative corrective form during
   interaction. The positioning factor was divided into proactive versus
   reactive categories, depending on whether negative evidence utterances
   were provided prior to or immediately after the learner's deviant form
   during interaction. Forty-five second-generation Korean-American
   learners were randomly assigned to the following conditions: (a)
   explicit/proactive; (b) explicit/reactive; (c) implicit/reactive; and
   (d) provision of backchannels (control). It was revealed that negative
   evidence was indeed effective in either explicit or implicit form, but
   the benefits of negative evidence became more prominent when the
   negative evidence utterances immediately followed the learners'
   production of a non-target-like form than when the negative evidence
   utterances preceded their output. Although negative evidence helped the
   heritage learners to retreat from the non-target-like form, the positive
   effects of negative evidence faded over time.}},

   a vibrating carbon-nanotube-resonator were originated by centrifugal
   forces exerted at the central position of the vibrating carbon-nanotube,

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the frequency of urinary tract infections (UTIs)
   and degree of renal parenchymal damage as well as the parameters of

   Methods: Infants, whose antenatal ultrasonography (US) showed a fetal
   renal pelvic diameter of 5 mm or greater were investigated. Of the 277
   infants with antenatal HN, 36 {[}56 renal units (RUs)] were diagnosed
   with VUR. All cases with VUR were evaluated in terms of the frequency of

   (RW)]. Statistical evaluation was performed using the Chi-squared test.
   Findings: Of these 36 patients with VUR, 25 (69.4\%) were males and 11
   (30.6\%) females. Of the 56 RUs, 48 (85.7\%) had severe VUR Grade III).
   The mean duration of postnatal follow-up was 37.8 +/- 24.50 months. The

   these 36 infants, 32 (88.8\%) recovered from VUR following either
   medical (17 patients, 47.2\%) or surgical (15 patients, 41.6\%)
   treatment. The initial DMSA showed parenchymal defects in 16 (44.4\%)
   RUs, and 4 RUs showed recovery in the final DMSA. Although statistically
   insignificant (P>0.05), initial growth and development (HSDS: -0.17 +/-
   0.86; WSDS: 0.00 +/- 0.14) and nutritional status (RW: 98.19 +/- 8.81)
   values gradually improved (0.05 +/- 1.06, 0.06 +/- 1.071 and 101.97 +/-
   14.85, respectively).
   Conclusion: Postnatal early diagnosis and appropriate management of VUR
   in infants with antenatal hydronephrosis can prevent the occurrence of
   frequent UTIs, renal scarring and malnutrition, enabling normal growth
   and development.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that metal oxide composites CuO-ZnO-CeO(2)/Al(2)O(3) and
   Cu-ZnO/Al(2)O(3), supported by cordierite monoliths, catalyze the
   production of hydrogen with selectivity and yield close to 90\% and
   above for the decomposition and the partial oxidation of methanol. In
   methanol decomposition on CuO-ZnO-CeO(2)/Al(2)O(3)/cordierite, nanosized
   ceria acts as a key component stabilizing catalyst operation by
   suppressing carbonization of a surface, facilitating hydrogen production
   with a yield of 85-96\%. At the same time, copper and zinc oxides are
   shown to act as modifying/promoting additives reducing the temperature
   of full conversion of the alcohol as well as minimizing the formation of
   methane as a by-product. Concerning partial oxidation of methanol over
   Cu-ZnO/Al(2)O(3)/cordierite, zinc oxide (as a constituent of ZnAl(2)O(4)
   aluminate) is shown to be a ``self-sufficient{''} catalytic component
   playing a key role in the high-yield H(2) producing. A non-additive
   effect of decrease in selectivity concerning CO (as a by-product) on the
   binary Cu-ZnO catalyst, as compared with the samples derived from
   individual components Cu and ZnO, is found.}},

Abstract = {{Malignant variants of ameloblastoma include metastasizing ameloblastoma,

   ameloblastic carcinoma that exhibits malignant histopathologic features.
   Ameloblastic carcinoma is classified into 2 types: a primary odontogenic
   malignancy and a secondary type resulting from malignant transformation
   of ameloblastoma. Most secondary ameloblastic carcinomas result from
   malignant transformation of a primary lesion after repeated postsurgical
   recurrences. Therefore it is rare to find an untreated secondary type
   presenting with histologic features of malignant transformation from an
   earlier benign lesion. We experienced a rare case of ameloblastic
   carcinoma, secondary type which might arise in an untreated
   ameloblastoma. The mechanism by which a preexisting benign ameloblastoma
   goes through a malignant transformation is also described. (Oral Surg

Abstract = {{DFT calculation results for intramolecular proton transfer reactions in

   hydrogen bonding angle). Hence, the study on the systems reported herein
   could provide a good basis for designing aza nucleoside prodrug systems
   that are less hydrophilic than their parental drugs and can be used, in
   different dosage forms, to release the parent drug in a controlled
   manner. For example, based on the calculated log EM, the cleavage
   process for prodrug 1ProD is predicted to be about 10(10) times faster
   than that for prodrug 7ProD and about 10(4) times faster than prodrug
   3ProD: rate (1ProD) > rate (3ProD) > rate (7ProD) . Hence, the rate by
   which the prodrug releases the aza nucleoside drug can be determined
   according to the structural features of the linker (Kirby's enzyme
   model).}},

Abstract = {{In selecting a material to create an intended product meaning, several
   factors, such as the material's sensorial and technical properties, the
   product in which the material is embodied, and who the user is, may need
   to be taken into consideration. Each factor consists of a number of
   aspects (e. g., user covers aspects including gender, expertise,
   culture, etc.) with each playing a different role in attributing meaning
   to a particular material. The role that two product aspects (shape and
   function) and two user aspects (gender and culture) plays in attributing
   meaning to two materials, plastics and metal, is studied. The study
   demonstrates the contention that meanings of materials in a particular
   context are shaped by interactions of materials with aspects of products
   and users. On the other hand, the effect of a certain aspect (e. g.,
   shape) may change depending on the meaning (e. g., feminine) aimed to be
   expressed. The results of the study, main effects and interactions are
   thoroughly discussed in this paper.}},

   that PAH emissions decreased with the addition of biodiesel during all
   driving modes. However, their nitrated and oxygenated products were
   found to increase with biodiesel compared to diesel fuel. The use of
   pure biodiesel led in some increases in PAH emissions when compared to
   its 50\% blend. PAH emissions were also found to be adversely influenced

Abstract = {{The most commonly reported coronary arterial malformation, in accounts
   of sudden deaths, is anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery.
   Anomalous coronary arteries may arise from the left, right, or
   non-coronary sinuses of Valsalva. Importantly, although the left
   coronary artery from the right sinus has the worst prognosis, sudden
   death has been reported in all variants of origin from the various
   sinuses of Valsalva. This paper describes a technique that addresses all
   of the problems relating to anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery
   from the wrong sinus of Valsalva. This technique includes the
   transection of the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk, coronary
   arterial enlargement with a pericardial patch, and lateral translocation
   of the pulmonary trunk to the left pulmonary artery. Anomalous aortic
   origin of a coronary artery from the wrong sinus of Valsalva is a
   potentially lethal cardiac anomaly that can be corrected in all cases
   using this simplified surgical technique that addresses the major
   anatomic and physiological problems.}},

Title = {{A 5-year survey of biopsy-proven kidney diseases in Lebanon: significant
   variation in prevalence of primary glomerular diseases by age,

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background. Differences in epidemiology of kidney disease across the
   Middle East may arise from variations in indication for biopsy,
   environmental exposure and socio-economic status. The Lebanese
   population is composed of different ethnicities, with distinct ancestry
   and religion, enabling comparison of their effect on the prevalence of
   kidney disease within a confined geographic setting and uniform
   practices. Here we report 5 years' detailed epidemiology of renal
   diseases, based on histological diagnosis, in a sample from three large
   pathology centres in Lebanon.
   Methods. Records of renal biopsies analysed at the American University
   of Beirut Medical Center, Hotel Dieu de France Hospital and the Institut
   National de Pathologie from January 2003 till December 2007 were
   retrospectively examined. We recorded the following data for each
   patient: age, gender, indication for renal biopsy and histopathological
   diagnosis. Religious affiliation and parents' consanguinity were
   recorded when feasible.
   Results. The mean age at renal biopsy was 36.76 +/- 20 years (range
   1-84). The most common diagnosis was mesangioproliferative
   glomerulonephritis (GN; 20\%), followed by focal segmental
   glomerulosclerosis (13.2\%). While there were no differences in age,
   gender or indications for biopsy among different religious affiliations,
   mesangioproliferative GN was significantly more frequent among Muslims
   (P = 0.039) and offspring of consanguineous unions (P = 0.036). On the
   other hand, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was most prevalent in
   Christians (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions. Variation in the distribution of diagnoses between Muslim
   and Christian groups likely reflects differences in population structure
   and ancestry. In particular, the increased prevalence of
   mesangioproliferative GN among offspring of consanguineous unions in
   Muslims suggests a recessive genetic component to this disease which may
   be identified via homozygosity mapping. These findings have important
   implications for formulating renal health policies and designing
   research studies in this population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust optimization formulation, with an exact
   solution method, that simultaneously solves continuous network capacity
   expansion, traffic signal optimization and dynamic traffic assignment
   when explicitly accounting for an appropriate robustness measure, the
   inherent bi-level nature of the problem and long-term O-D demand
   uncertainty. The adopted robustness measure is the weighted sum of
   expected total system travel time (TSTT) and squared up-side deviation
   from a fixed target. The model propagates traffic according to Daganzo's
   cell transmission model. Furthermore, we formulate five additional,
   related models. We find that when evaluated in terms of robustness, the
   integrated robust model performs the best, and interestingly the
   sequential robust approach yields a worse solution compared to certain
   sequential and integrated approaches. Although the adopted objective of
   the integrated robust model does not directly optimize the variance of
   TSTT, our experimental results show that the robust solutions also yield
   the least-variance solutions.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates fifth sixth and seventh grade students place

   elementary schools The study explores whether differences in the variety
   and organization of the spaces of school facilities have an impact on
   the place preferences of students and whether students are aware of the
   reasons for their preferences Students place preferences and their
   activities were determined with field observations and a 30-item
   questionnaire with Yes/No and open-ended questions A total of 173
   students (n = 51 School 1 n = 70 School 2 and n = 52 School 3)
   participated in the questionnaire The Chi-Square test a non-parametric
   statistical analysis test was used to analyze the students answers to
   the questionnaire The results indicate that students prefer places which
   offer variety and which are large enough to avoid congestion and that in
   general students are aware of the spatial features of their environments
   and make choices accordingly When students are given a choice of
   outdoors or Indoors they tend to choose according to which is more
   conducive to their activities If both outdoor and indoor spaces are
   conducive students tend to use both If neither is conducive to their
   activities students either alter their behavior patterns for example
   developing a preference for stationary activities or staying inside the
   classroom or they convert available spaces to accommodate their
   activities It is concluded that students are good sources of information

Abstract = {{Understanding the biological self-assembly process of virus capsids is
   key to understanding the viral life cycle, as well as serving as a
   platform for the design of assembly-based antiviral drugs. Here we
   identify and characterize the phenylpropenamide family of small
   molecules, known to have antiviral activity in vivo, as assembly
   effectors of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid. We have found two
   representative phenylpropenamides to be assembly accelerators,
   increasing the rate of assembly with only modest increases in the
   stability of the HBV capsids; these data provide a physical-chemical
   basis for their antiviral activity. Unlike previously described HBV
   assembly effectors, the phenylpropenamides do not misdirect assembly;
   rather, the accelerated reactions proceed on-path to produce
   morphologically normal capsids. However, capsid assembly in the presence
   of phenylpropenamides is characterized by kinetic trapping of assembly
   intermediates. These traps resolve under conditions close to
   physiological, but we found that trapped intermediates persist under
   conditions that favor phenylpropenamide binding and strong core
   protein-protein interactions. The phenylpropenamides serve as chemical
   probes of the HBV capsid assembly pathway by trapping on-path assembly
   intermediates, illustrating the governing influence of reaction kinetics
   on capsid assembly.}},

   regularization problems with a certain class of piecewise linear loss
   functions. The problem of computing the l(1) regularization path for a

   the parametric simplex algorithm for such a problem. We also conduct a
   simulation study to investigate the behavior of the number of
   ``breakpoints{''} of the regularization path when both the number of
   observations and the number of explanatory variables vary. Our method is
   also applicable to the computation of the regularization path for a
   piecewise linear loss and the blockwise l(infinity) penalty. This

Abstract = {{Rice fields provide important habitats for many endemic and endangered
   species originally dependent on wetlands as habitat. However, the value
   of rice fields has rarely been evaluated from a multi-scale perspective.
   We examined abundance of two frogs, the montane brown frog Rana
   ornativentris and the forest green tree frog Rhacophorus arboreus, that
   use rice fields as breeding sites, and explored local and
   landscape-level factors determining their abundance. To determine
   appropriate spatial scales influencing abundance, we generated different
   sized buffer circles around a focal rice field, calculated landscape
   composition in each buffer, and determined the regression model that
   best explained frog abundance using Akaike's Information criterion
   (AIC). The montane brown frog and the forest green tree frog exhibited
   the lowest AIC at buffer sizes of 300 and 1,000 m, respectively. Both
   species exhibited a higher abundance at intermediate water depths (7-10
   cm). At the landscape-level, the montane brown frog showed highest
   abundance at intermediate forest cover (50\%-60\%). Forest green tree
   frogs showed a monotonic increase with forest cover. Because each
   species responded somewhat differently to spatial scale and landscape
   composition, context and species dependent outcomes of local restoration
   practices are required for particular rice fields to achieve
   cost-effective results.}},

Abstract = {{Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) boost following external beam
   radiation therapy (EBRT) for advanced localized prostate cancer may
   reduce toxicity while escalating the dose. We present preliminary
   biochemical control and urinary, rectal and sexual toxicities for 73
   patients treated with SBRT as a boost to EBRT. Forty-one intermediate-
   and 32 high-risk localized prostate cancer patients received 45 Gy EBRT
   with SBRT boost. Twenty-eight patients (38.3\%) received a total SBRT
   boost dose of 18 Gy (3 fractions of 6 Gy), 28 patients (38.3\%) received
   19.5 Gy (3 fractions of 6.5 Gy), and 17 patients (23.2\%) received 21 Gy
   (3 fractions of 7 Gy). Toxicity was assessed using the Radiation Therapy
   Oncology Group urinary and rectal toxicity scale. Biochemical failure
   was assessed using the Phoenix definition. The median follow-up was 33
   months (range, 22 - 43 months). Less than 7\% Grade II and no higher
   grade acute toxicities occurred. To date, one Grade ill and no Grade IV
   late toxicities occurred. For the 97\% of patients with 24 months
   minimum follow-up, 71.8\% achieved a PSA nadir threshold of 0.5 ng/mL.
   Three intermediate-risk and seven high-risk biochemical failures
   occurred; one high-risk patient died of his cancer. Three-year actuarial
   biochemical control rates were 89.5\% and 77.7\% for intermediate- and
   high-risk patients, respectively. SBRT boost for prostate cancer
   treatment is safe and feasible with minimal acute toxicity. At 33 months
   late toxicity and biochemical control are promising. Long-term
   durability of these findings remains to be established.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article examines the current state of disease surveillance and
   reporting in the United States and seeks to answer two central
   questions: first, whether the increasing emphasis on the global
   importance of public health policies compels a fundamental reexamination
   of the long-standing deferential approach to state power where matters
   of population health surveillance are concerned and, second, how the
   nation's long-standing deferential legal customs might be modified to
   address the growing emphasis on global public health policy that is
   undergirded by technological advances. We examine the International
   Health Regulations, or IHR (2005), and suggest that these regulations
   offer a powerful impetus for reevaluating U.S. legal custom concerning
   the policy and practice of population health surveillance, not only as a
   matter of U. S. law but also as a core dimension of U.S. legal
   obligations to other nations, as embodied in international agreements
   and treaties. We find that if the political will exists to change the
   domestic disease surveillance and reporting system, the federal
   government has the power to act. Questions remain, however, about
   whether the public health and legislative communities are willing to
   challenge current customs or even if they desire to do so.}},

Abstract = {{Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms
   that often differ in function. To infer isoform regulation from
   high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the
   mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates
   expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses
   confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment length
   distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of
   alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated
   exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing
   factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and
   polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV
   cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in
   human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq
   analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield
   guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of
   gene and isoform expression.}},

Abstract = {{Background Medication errors are common in many settings and have
   important ramifications. Although there is growing research on rates and
   characteristics of medication errors in adult ambulatory settings, less
   is known about the paediatric ambulatory setting.
   Objective To assess medication error rates in paediatric patients in
   ambulatory settings.
   Methods The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of paediatric
   patients in six outpatient offices in Massachusetts. Data were collected
   using duplicate prescription review, two parental surveys and chart
   review. A research nurse classified all medication errors by stage and
   type of error.
   Results The authors identified 1205 medication errors with minimal
   potential for harm (rate: 68\% of patients, 95\% CI 64 to 72\%; 53\% of
   Rx, 95\% CI 50 to 56\%) and 464 potentially harmful medication errors
   (ie, near misses) (rate: 26\% of patients, 95\% CI 24 to 28\%; 21\% of
   Rx, 95\% CI 19 to 22\%). Overall, 94\% of the medication errors with
   minimal potential for harm and 60\% of the near misses occurred at the
   prescribing stage. The most common types of errors were inappropriate
   abbreviations followed by dosing errors. The most frequent cause of
   errors was illegibility.
   Conclusion With paper prescribing, half the prescriptions had medication
   errors, and one in five had a potentially harmful error. These rates are
   very high. Interventions targeting the ordering and administration
   stages have the greatest potential benefit.}},

Abstract = {{A sublimation process governs the innermost region of the dusty torus of
   active galactic nuclei. However, the observed inner radius of the torus
   is systematically smaller than the expected radius by a factor of
   similar to 1/3. We show that the anisotropy of the emission from
   accretion disks resolves this conflict naturally and quantitatively. An
   accretion disk emits lesser radiation in the direction closer to its
   equatorial plane (i.e., to the torus). We find that the anisotropy makes
   the torus inner region closer to the central black hole and concave.
   Moreover, the innermost edge of the torus may connect with the outermost
   edge of the disk continuously. Considering the anisotropic emission of
   each clump in the torus, we calculate the near-infrared flux variation
   in response to a UV flash. For an observer at the polar angle theta(obs)
   = 25 degrees, the centroid of the time delay is found to be 37\% of the
   delay expected in the case of isotropic illumination, which explains the
   observed systematic deviation.}},

   Although the left and right basal turns of the cochleae were ossified,
   all electrodes were successfully inserted, and subsequently the inferior
   segment of the basal turn was drilled out. The patient did not have any

Abstract = {{Background and aims: The aim of this study was to investigate weight,
   diet and activity habits among adolescents in a semi-urban area of
   Istanbul. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted
   with 369 adolescents aged 11-14 years and recorded 72-hour food
   consumption. After basic socio-demographic information was obtained, a
   questionnaire was applied to all students, asking for family history,
   consumption of fast food, exercise and sedentary activity habits,
   diseases and some symptoms related to obesity. Height and weight were
   measured. A BMI (kg/m(2)) >= 85(th) percentile was defined as excessive
   weight and a BMI >= 95(th) percentile was defined as obesity. Energy
   intake and macronutrient variables were calculated by a dietician with
   BeBis dietary program. Results: Individuals who were having excessive
   weight represented 15.0\%. More girls than boys were of excessive weight
   (p=0.046). There were no differences for obesity between sexes. The
   amount of protein and fat intake was higher for boys than for girls
   (p=0.003, p=0.001). Boys were physically active more frequently than
   girls (p=0.03). A logistic regression analysis revealed that eating at
   least 3 meals per day was inversely related to excessive weight in both
   boys and girls (p=0.009, OR 0.277, 95\% CI 0.105-0.730; p=0.036, OR
   0.430, 95\% CI 0.195-0.946, respectively). Conclusions: We found some
   differences regarding weight status, macronutrient intake and physical
   activity habits between the sexes. It is very important to encourage a
   habit of at least three meals per day and physical exercise, especially
   for girls in order to decrease the obesity rate in our region. Obesity

Abstract = {{To investigate the mechanisms by which O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine
   modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins (O-GlcNAc) confers stress
   tolerance to multiple forms of cellular injury, we explored the role(s)
   of O-GlcNAc in the regulation of heat shock protein (HSP) expression.
   Using a cell line in which deletion of the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT;
   the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc) can be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, we
   screened the expression of 84 HSPs using quantitative reverse
   transcriptase PCR. In OGT null cells the stress-induced expression of 18
   molecular chaperones, including HSP72, were reduced. GSK-3 beta promotes
   apoptosis through numerous pathways, including phosphorylation of heat
   shock factor 1 (HSF1) at Ser(303) (Ser(P)(303) HSF1), which inactivates
   HSF1 and inhibits HSP expression. In OGT null cells we observed
   increased Ser(P)(303) HSF1; conversely, in cells in which O-GlcNAc
   levels had been elevated, reduced Ser(P)(303) HSF1 was detected. These
   data, combined with those showing that inhibition of GSK-3 beta in OGT
   null cells recovers HSP72 expression, suggests that O-GlcNAc regulates
   the activity of GSK-3 beta. In OGT null cells, stress-induced
   inactivation of GSK-3 beta by phosphorylation at Ser(9) was ablated
   providing a molecular basis for these findings. Together, these data
   suggest that stress-induced GlcNAcylation increases HSP expression
   through inhibition of GSK-3 beta}},

Abstract = {{Cascade-correlation learning is used to model pronoun acquisition in
   children. The cascade-correlation algorithm is a feed-forward neural
   network that builds its own topology from input and output units.
   Personal pronoun acquisition is an interesting non-linear problem in
   psychology. A mother will refer to her son as you and herself as me, but
   the son must infer for himself that when he speaks to his mother, she
   becomes you and he becomes me. Learning the shifting reference of these
   pronouns is a difficult task that most children master. We show that
   learning of two different noun-and-pronoun addressee patterns is
   consistent with naturalistic studies. We observe a surprising factor in
   pronoun reversal: increasing the amount of exposure to noun patterns can
   decrease or eliminate reversal errors in children.}},

Abstract = {{The realization relation is commonly explicated via, or identified with,
   the causal role playing relation. However, the realization relation does
   not formally match the causal role playing relation. While realization
   is a relation between a base realizer property and a single higher level
   realized property, I argue that the causal role playing relation as
   typically defined is a relation between a base property and two
   higher-level role properties. Advocates of using causal role playing to
   explicate realization must therefore decide which of the two kinds of

Abstract = {{Combined in situ small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS)
   studies were performed in a recently developed laboratory setup to
   investigate the dynamical properties of dry oleic acid-capped titanium
   dioxide nanorods during annealing in an inert gas stream in a
   temperature interval of 298-1023 K. Aggregates formed by the titanium
   dioxide particles exhibit a continuous growth as a function of
   temperature. The particle size determined with SAXS and the crystallite
   size refined from WAXS show a correlated growth at temperatures above
   673 K, where the decomposition of the surfactant is expected. At
   temperatures above 823 K, the particle and crystallite sizes increase
   rapidly. An increasing discrepancy between particle and crystallite size
   indicates growth of a shell structure on the single-crystalline core of
   the particles. This was confirmed by high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy studies of the sample. Transmission electron
   microscopy shows a transformation from a rod to a spherical particle
   shape; the WAXS data indicate that the shape change occurs in a
   temperature interval of 773-923 K. The highly crystalline titanium
   dioxide particles remain in the metastable anatase phase during the
   entire annealing process. The transition to the thermodynamically stable
   rutile phase was not observed at any temperature, in agreement with
   existing experimental observations.}},

   these reasons, each of the stop bands can be turned on and off

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial resistance among community-acquired isolates of
   Escherichia coli is increasing globally, with international travel
   emerging as a risk for colonisation and infection. The aim was to
   determine the rate and duration of colonisation with resistant E. coli
   following international travel. One hundred and two adult hospital staff
   and contacts from Canberra, Australia, submitted perianal/rectal swabs
   before and following international travel. Swabs were cultured
   selectively to identify E. coli resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin
   and/or third-generation cephalosporins. Those with resistant E. coli
   post-travel were tested monthly for persistent colonisation.
   Colonisation with antibiotic-resistant E. coli increased significantly
   from 7.8\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 3.8-14.9) pre-travel to 49\%
   (95\% CI 39.5-58.6) post-travel. Those colonised were more likely to
   have taken antibiotics whilst travelling; however, travel remained a
   risk independent of antibiotic use. Colonisation with resistant E. coli
   occurred most frequently following travel to Asia. While over half of
   those carrying resistant E. coli post-travel had no detectable resistant
   strains two months after their return, at least 18\% remained colonised
   at six months. Colonisation with antibiotic-resistant E. coli occurs
   commonly after international travel, and can be persistent. Medical
   practitioners should be aware of this risk, particularly when managing
   patients with suspected Gram-negative sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{In 1970, H. Werner considered the question of which sublattices of
   partition lattices are congruence lattices for an algebra on the
   underlying set of the partition lattices. He showed that a complete
   sublattice of a partition lattice is a congruence lattice if and only if
   it is closed under a new operation called graphical composition. We
   study the properties of this new operation, viewed as an operation on an
   abstract lattice. We obtain some necessary properties, and we also
   obtain some sufficient conditions for an operation on an abstract
   lattice L to be this operation on a congruence lattice isomorphic to L.
   We use this result to give a new proof of Gratzer and Schmidt's result
   that any algebraic lattice occurs as a congruence lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
   with erectile dysfunction (ED) among African American prostate cancer
   patients treated with external beam radiation therapy
   Methods and Materials A cohort of African-American prostate cancer
   patients treated with external beam radiation therapy was observed for
   the development of ED by use of the five Item Sexual Health Inventory
   for Men (SHIM) questionnaire Final analysis included 27 cases
   (post-treatment SHIM score <= 7) and 52 control subjects (post treatment
   SHIM score >= 16) A genome-wide association study was performed using
   approximately 909,000 SNPs genotyped on Affymetrix 6 0 arrays
   (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
   Results We identified SNP rs2268363, located in the follicle-stimulating
   hormone receptor (FSHR) gene, as sigmficantly associated with ED after
   correcting for multiple comparisons (unadjusted p = 5 46 x 10(-8),
   Bonferroni p = 0 028) We identified four additional SNPs that tended
   toward a significant association with an unadjusted p value < 10(-6)
   Inference of population substructure showed that cases had a higher
   proportion of African ancestry than control subjects (77\% vs 60\%, p =
   0 005) A multivariate logistic regression model that incorporated
   estimated ancestry and four of the top-ranked SNPs was a more accurate
   classifier of ED than a model that included only clinical variables
   Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first genome wide association
   study to identify SNPs associated with adverse effects resulting from
   radiotherapy It is important to note that the SNP that proved to be
   significantly associated with ED is located within a gene whose encoded
   product plays a role in male gonad development and function Another key
   finding of this project is that the four SNPs most strongly associated
   with ED were specific to persons of African ancestry and would therefore
   not have been identified had a cohort of European ancestry been screened
   This study demonstrates the feasibility of a genome wide approach to
   investigate genetic predisposition to radiation injury (C) 2010 Elsevier

   for current harmonics, unbalanced and neutral current compensation;
   Series Active Power Filter (SAF) used for compensation of source voltage
   harmonics, unbalanced voltage and sag and swell of source voltage. The
   performance of the proposed control system was analyzed using
   simulations with Matlab/Simulink program, and experimental results with
   the hardware prototype. The proposed UPQC control algorithm can improve

Abstract = {{Skim milk was heated at different pH values to cause differential
   association of whey proteins (WP) with the casein micelles. All of these
   milk treatments coagulated poorly with rennet. To understand this in
   more detail, the casein micelles from heated milk were redispersed in
   unheated serum or unheated micelles were suspended in the sera from
   heat-treated milk. Systems containing micelles from milk heated at pH
   6.7 and 7.1 were marginally better than the heated milk, but that from
   milk heated at pH 6.3 was not. The sera from milk heated at pH 6.7 and
   7.1 impaired the clotting of native micelles but that from the pH 6.3
   milk did not. Native casein micelles were suspended in permeates or
   dialyzed (against unheated milk) sera from heat-treated milk. Permeate
   systems free of WP/kappa-casein complexes produced significantly
   stronger rennet gels: as did dialyzed systems. The impaired rennet
   clotting of heat-treated milk was attributed to a synergistic effect of
   the casein micelles with their heat-modified surfaces, the soluble serum
   WP/kappa-casein complexes, and other dialyzable serum components. (C)

   blend of beef tallow and soybean oil, or soybean oil plus a-tocopheryl
   acetate added at 220 mg/kg (treatments 2 to 5). All diets were kept
   isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and diet treatments 2 to 5 had 50 g/kg

   were significantly (p <= 0.05) increased by adding fat to the diet
   during the starter stage. However, birds that received fat-supplemented
   diets gained less (p <= 0.05) during the grower period. Serum malone

   affected by dietary treatments with the exception that inclusion of
   a-tocopheryl acetate to the diet supplemented with soybean oil
   significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the activity of the enzyme when

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cancer survivors may experience long-term depression or
   anxiety, however, there is little previous research on the use of
   services in this area. We explored consultation and prescribing
   behaviour for depression and anxiety amongst cancer survivors in British
   primary health care.
   Methods: This study uses data on 26,213 survivors of breast, colorectal
   and prostate cancer at least 5 years post-diagnosis, matched to four
   controls without cancer, from the UK General Practice Research Database.
   We compared consultations for depression and anxiety, and prescribing
   for anti-depressants and anxiolytics between cancer survivors and
   controls.
   Results: Multivariate, matched regression models showed no difference in
   consulting for. depression or anxiety between any cancer survivors and
   matched controls. However, breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.22) and prostate cancer survivors (OR
   1.31, 95\% Cl 1.16-1.47) were more likely to receive a prescription for
   an antidepressant. Breast cancer survivors (IRR 2.49, 95\% CI 1.82-3.42)
   and prostate cancer survivors (IRR 2.84, 95\% CI 1.94-4.17) who died
   received significantly more antidepressants than controls who died.
   There were no differences in anxiolytic prescribing for colorectal and
   prostate cancer survivors compared to controls. However, breast cancer
   survivors nearing the end of life received a greater number of
   anxiolytic prescriptions compared to controls (IRR 1.84, 95\% CI
   1.36-2.49).
   Conclusions: In this cohort of cancer survivors, there were no
   differences in consultation behaviour for depression and anxiety
   compared to controls. However, breast and prostate cancer survivors
   access more antidepressants, and those nearing the end of life received
   the highest volume of prescriptions. Breast cancer survivors at the end
   of life also receive more anxiolytics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Prosody features have been widely used in many speech-related
   applications, including speaker and word recognition, emotion and accent
   identification, topic and sentence segmentation, and text-to-speech
   applications. Languages other than Arabic have received a lot of
   attention in this regard. An important application of prosodic features
   which is investigated here is that of identifying question sentences in
   Arabic monologue lectures. To our best knowledge, this is the first
   attempt at addressing question detection from spoken lectures in any
   language. To this end, we developed a small corpus made of 1028
   utterances that were extracted from 15 Arabic spoken lectures. We
   approach this problem by first segmenting the continuous speech
   (recorded lectures) into sentences using both intensity and duration
   features. Prosodic features are, then, extracted from each sentence.
   These features are used as input to four different classifiers to
   classify each sentence into either a question or a non-question
   sentence.
   Our results suggest that questions are cued by more than one type of
   prosodic features in spontaneous Arabic speech. We classified questions
   with an accuracy of 77.43\%. A feature-specific analysis further reveals
   that energy and fundamental frequency (F0) features are mainly
   responsible for discriminating between question and non-question
   sentences. In terms of classification, we found that a Bayes Network
   performs better than support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron
   neural networks, or decision trees on our dataset. Removal of correlated
   features through Correlation-based Feature Selection produced more
   efficient and accurate results than the complete feature set.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes exhibit exceptional properties that are a consequence
   of their symmetric structure. Many properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   have been explained in the wider context of materials science, thereby
   highlighting the contribution from different researchers worldwide in
   this rapidly expanding field. Among various other properties of CNTs
   studied so far, the electrical transport properties are still unclear
   and needs a lot of attention. Due to high anisotropy of graphite, the
   electrical properties are strongly dependent on the structure of the
   nanotubes. Since, the CNTs can be metallic and semi-conducting in
   nature, their explanation to electrical conduction mechanism in these
   two cases would be different. During the last few years, efforts have
   been made to understand the electrical transport phenomenon in CNTs,
   aiming at the design of nanoelectronic devices made solely of carbon.
   Keeping in view the above, it is of great interest to present a state of
   art on the progress involving the research work on electrical conduction
   mechanism especially variable range hopping in CNTs. In the present
   paper, we have presented a review on electrical transport mechanism
   especially variable range hopping in carbon nanotubes. This review will
   provide a better understanding of variable range hopping in CNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Background Differences in life expectancy at birth across social classes
   can be more easily interpreted as a measure of absolute inequalities in
   survival. This study quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to
   life expectancy differences by income among 4 million public servants
   and their dependents in South Korea (9.1\% of the total Korean
   population).
   Methods Using 9-year mortality follow-up data (208 612 deaths) on 4 055
   150 men and women aged 0-94 years, with national health insurance
   premiums imposed proportionally based on monthly salary as a measure of
   income, differences in life expectancy at birth by income were estimated
   by age- and cause-specific mortality differences using Arriaga's
   decomposition method.
   Results Life expectancy at birth gradually increased with income.
   Differences in life expectancy at birth between the highest and the
   lowest income quartile were 6.22 years in men and 1.74 years in women.
   Mortality differentials by income among those aged epsilon 50 years
   contributed most substantially (80.4\% in men and 85.6\% in women) to
   the socio-economic differences in life expectancy at birth. In men,
   cancers (stomach, liver and lung), cardiovascular diseases (stroke),
   digestive diseases (liver cirrhosis) and external causes (transport
   accidents and suicide) were important contributors to the life
   expectancy differences. In women, the contribution of ill-defined causes
   was most important. Cardiovascular diseases (stroke and hypertensive
   disease) and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) also
   contributed to the life expectancy differences in women while the
   contributions of cancers and digestive diseases were minimal.
   Conclusions Reductions in socio-economic differentials in mortality from
   stroke and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) among
   middle-aged and older men and women would significantly contribute to
   equalizing life expectancy among income groups. Policy efforts to reduce
   mortality differentials in major cancers (stomach, liver and lung) and
   liver cirrhosis are also important for eliminating Korean men's
   socio-economic inequalities in life expectancy.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the conjecture on quantum-like (QL) processing of information
   in the brain. It is not based on the physical quantum brain (e. g.,
   Penrose) - quantum physical carriers of information. In our approach the
   brain created the QL representation (QLR) of information in Hilbert
   space. It uses quantum information rules in decision making. The
   existence of such QLR was (at least preliminary) confirmed by
   experimental data from cognitive psychology; in particular, experiments
   on recognition of ambiguous figures (Conte et al., 2006; 2009). The
   violation of the law of total probability in these experiments is an
   important sign of nonclassicality of data. In this paper we speculate on
   a possible physical realization of QLR in the brain: a classical wave
   model producing QLR. It is based on variety of time scales in the brain.
   Each pair of scales (fine - the background fluctuations of
   electromagnetic field and rough the cognitive image scale) induces the
   QL representation. The background field plays the crucial role in
   creation of ``superstrong QL correlations{''} in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Drug solubility in compressed carbon dioxide is usually low, and for
   this reason, CO2 is not considered a suitable solvent. However, it can
   be used as antisolvent to crystallize a solute from a liquid solution.
   The choice of optimal pressure and the CO2/drug solution ratio is a
   crucial point of the process, and these values must be optimized. An
   estimation method based on the Peng-Robinson's equation of state is
   presented here with which to calculate the solubility of drugs such as
   Acetaminophen, Acyclovir, Atenolol, Carbamazepine, Ibuprofen, Naproxen,
   Nimesulide, and Sotalol hydrochloride in mixtures of CO2 and common
   organic solvents at a constant temperature but a variable pressure. The
   model temperature was 298 K for Ibuprofen and Naproxen, 315 K for
   Acetaminophen and 313 K for any other systems. This method is a
   practical and rapid alternative to experimental determination. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The present review describes the double beneficial effect of using clays
   for purposes of health and human nutrition: first, their chemical
   composition, which can enable the release of trace elements; and second,
   their mineralogical composition, which allows them to be used in the

   to the release of trace elements contained in clay: clay-containing
   pellets designed for oral delivery of the trace elements iron and zinc.
   This multiple-unit pellet system is designed to be retained by flotation
   in the stomach cavity for a few hours (5 h), with simultaneous control
   of the release of the trace elements in order to optimize their
   gastrointestinal absorption. Finally, it is shown that the total amount
   of ions released from the clay was increased when the formulations were
   added, in comparison with raw clay, respectively as follows: Zn<SU2+</SU
   (60\% versus 40\%), Fe<SU3+</SU (70\% versus 30\%) and Fe<SU2+</SU (95\%

Abstract = {{This study deals with energy and irreversibility analysis of a cascade
   refrigeration system employing various refrigerant couples, namely
   R152a-R23, R290-R23, R507-R23, R234a-R23, R717-R23 and R404a-R23, using
   a computer code developed for this aim. It is assumed that the
   refrigeration load is 1 kW, the refrigerated space temperature is -40
   degrees C, and the environment temperature is 300 K, while the degrees
   of condenser subcooling and evaporator superheat are 5 and 7 degrees C,
   respectively, for all cases. Furthermore, the polytropic efficiencies of
   the compressors are assumed to be equal. It has been determined that the
   COP of the cascade refrigeration system increases and the
   irreversibility decreases with rising evaporator temperature and
   polytropic efficiency for all studied refrigerant couples. On the other
   hand, the COP of the cascade refrigeration system decreases and the
   irreversibility increases on increasing the condenser temperature and
   the difference between the saturation temperatures of the lower and
   higher temperature systems in the heat exchanger (Delta T). In all
   cases, the refrigerant couple R717-R23 has the highest COP and lowest
   irreversibility except for the limited ranges of polytropic efficiency
   (50-60\%) and Delta T (13 K-16 K), while R507-R23 has the lowest COP and
   highest irreversibility. The refrigerant couple R152a-R23 has been found
   to be an alternative couple to R717-R23 for the above mentioned ranges
   of polytropic efficiency and Delta T. The refrigerant couples R134a-R23
   and R290-R23 have placed in the middle range, and R404a-R23 can be
   considered as a replacement couple for R507-R23 in all cases. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective : Bone cement augmentation procedures such as percutaneous
   vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have been shown to be effective
   treatment for acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral compression
   fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of
   bone cement augmentation procedures for long standing osteoporotic
   vertebral compression fracture with late vertebral collapse and
   persistent back pain.
   Methods : Among 278 single level osteoporotic vertebral compression
   fractures that were treated by vertebral augmentation procedures at our
   institute, 18 consecutive patients were included in this study. Study
   inclusion was limited to initially, minimal compression fractures, but
   showing a poor prognosis due to late vertebral collapse, intravertebral
   vacuum clefts and continuous back pain despite conservative treatment
   for more than one year. The subjects included three men and 15 women.
   The mean age was 70.7 with a range from 64 to 85 years of age. After
   postural reduction for two days, bone cement augmentation procedures
   following intraoperative pressure reduction were performed. Imaging and
   clinical findings, including the level of the vertebra involved,
   vertebral height restoration, injected cement volume, local kyphosis,
   clinical outcome and complications were analyzed.
   Results : The mean follow-up period after bone cement augmentation
   procedures was 14.3 months (range 12-27 months). The mean injected
   cement volume was 4.1 mL (range 2.4-5.9 mL). The unipedicular approach
   was possible in 15 patients. The mean pain score (visual analogue scale)
   prior to surgery was 7.1, which decreased to 3.1 at 7 days after the
   procedure. The pain relief was maintained at the final follow up. The
   kyphotic angle improved significantly from 21.2 +/- 4.9 degrees before
   surgery to 10.4 +/- 3.8 degrees after surgery. The fraction of vertebral
   height increased from 30\% to 60\% after bone cement augmentation, and
   the restored vertebral height was maintained at the final follow up.
   There were no serious complications related to cement leakage.
   Conclusion : In the management of even long-standing osteoporotic
   vertebral compression fracture for over one year, bone cement
   augmentation procedures following postural reduction were considered
   safe and effective treatment in cases of non-healing evidence.}},

Abstract = {{A cDNA clone (Zds) encoding zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS) was isolated
   from the Citrus fruit cDNA library. Sequence analyses indicated that the
   clone contains an open reading frame encoding 570 amino acids. A genomic
   Southern blot analysis and phylogenic dendrogram indicated that the Zds
   gene is present as more than two isoforms in the Citrus genome. Sequence
   analyses revealed that the cDNA showed significant similarity to other
   dicotyledonous woody plants. An RNA blot analysis showed that the
   transcripts were expressed in all investigated tissues of Citrus. During
   the ripening of fruits, the signal of the Zds transcripts was very weak
   until the break stage, but its expression markedly increased to the
   maximum level at the last stage. A similar pattern was detected in peels
   of citrus fruits. Furthermore, the level of Zds transcripts was changed
   in the process of leaf development. The results suggest that Citrus Zds
   is one of the important regulatory enzymes in carotenoid accumulation
   especially in the last stage of fruit ripening.}},

Abstract = {{Background A vaccine targeting human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and
   18, which are associated with 80\% of anal cancers, is efficacious in
   men. High-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) might
   especially benefit from vaccination. I aimed to estimate the
   cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of MSM in the USA.
   Methods I constructed decision-analytic models to estimate the direct
   health and economic outcomes of HPV vaccination (against types 6, 11,
   16, and 18) for prevention of HPV-related anal cancer and genital warts.
   The model parameters that were varied were age at vaccination (12 years,
   20 years, and 26 years), previous exposure to vaccine-targeted HPV
   types, and prevalence of HIV-1. I used the models to conduct sensitivity
   analyses, including duration of vaccine protection, vaccine cost, and
   burden of anal cancer and genital warts.
   Findings In a scenario of HPV vaccination of MSM at 12 years of age
   without previous exposure to HPV, compared with no vaccination,
   vaccination cost US\$15 290 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In
   scenarios where MSM are vaccinated at 20 years or 26 years of age, after
   exposure to HPV infections, the cost-effectiveness ratios worsened, but
   were less than \$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year under most
   scenarios. For example, HPV vaccination of MSM at 26 years cost \$37 830
   per quality-adjusted life-year when previous exposure to all
   vaccine-targeted HPV types was assumed to be 50\%. Outcomes were most
   sensitive to variations in anal cancer incidence, duration of vaccine
   protection, and HIV prevalence in MSM.
   Interpretation HPV vaccination of MSM is likely to be a cost-effective
   intervention for the prevention of genital warts and anal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Improved treatment of EBV positive lymphoma depends on the
   identification of molecular mechanism underlying chemo-resistance. LMP1
   is an essential transmembrane protein for EBV-induced immortalization of
   hematopoietic cells. Herein, we show that an oncogenic Pim-1 is
   translocated to the cytoplasm by LMP1. Three lines of evidence indicate
   that cytoplasmic sequestration of Pim-1 may be required for LMP1-induced
   cancer cell survival. First, Pim-1 enhanced the survival of
   LMP1-overexpressing cells treated with doxorubicin. Second, nuclear
   export of Pim-1 was sufficient to increase the survival. Third,
   knockdown of Pim-1 effectively suppressed LMP-1-induced survival of
   cancer cells. Collectively, these data suggest that Pim-1 is a
   downstream target of LMP1, and that it contributes to the
   chemo-resistance of cancer cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The lengthy 1990 boycott of the Family Red Apple Grocery in New York
   City and the 1992 Los Angeles riots have come to exemplify the so-called
   Black Korean conflict of the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United
   States. The numerous accounts of antagonistic relations between black
   customers and Korean American merchants in inner-city neighbourhoods
   that circulated during and after these events evinced a recurrent
   interest in the role that the daily conduct of store owners and
   employees may have played in aggravating the communities in which they
   ran their businesses. Focusing on ostensibly trivial behaviours such as
   making eye contact and giving change, media depictions of these tensions
   tended to assume and perpetuate notions of a fundamental ``culture
   clash{''} between African Americans and recent Korean immigrants.
   Offering a pointed rejoinder to mainstream media accounts of the 1990
   boycott, Elizabeth Wong's play Kimchee and Chitlins tests, instead, the
   possibilities of cross-racial performance for representing and
   reconciling, and thus doubly ``mediating,{''} these disputes. Exploring
   the implications of assuming the gestures, mannerisms, and speech of
   those positioned as other, the play grapples with the risks and
   limitations of such re-enactments, even as it imagines that traversing
   racial boundaries and mixing theatrical and journalistic conventions
   might elucidate the complex entanglements of habitual behaviours and
   habituated perceptions that inform both interracial tensions and their
   public narration.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: CYP2C19 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme showing
   various genetic polymorphisms that may cause marked inter-individual and
   interethnic variability in the disposition of its substrates. We
   assessed CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in a Korean population using a
   newly developed multiplex pyrosequencing method.
   Method: A multiplex pyrosequencing method to simultaneously detect
   CYP2C19{*}2, {*}3, and {*}17 alleles was designed. We established the
   frequency of these CYP2C19 alleles in 271 Korean subjects using the
   multiplex pyrosequencing method.
   Results: The results showed 100\% concordance between single and
   multiplex pyrosequencing methods. We also validated the polymorphisms
   identified by pyrosequencing with direct sequencing method. The allele
   frequencies of CYP2C19{*}2, CYP2C19{*}3, and CYP2C19{*}17 were 0.284,
   0.101 and 0.015 respectively. These frequencies are similar to that
   reported for other Asian populations including Japanese and Chinese but
   different from that of Caucasians and Africans.
   Conclusions: The multiplex pyrosequencing method to detect CYP2C19{*}2,
   CYP2C19{*}3, and CYP2C19{*}17 concurrently, seems to be a rapid and
   reliable genotyping method for the detection of important CYP2C19
   genetic polymorphisms. Similar to studies conducted on other Asian
   populations, this study reported that in the Korean population tested,
   the CYP2C19{*}2 and CYP2C19{*}3 alleles were relatively frequently
   found, whereas the frequency of CYP2C19{*}17 was very low.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The proportion of middle-aged people in one's total life
   cycle has increased. Health providers are required to promote and manage
   their health, and improve the quality of their life, especially
   middle-aged women. As international interchanges in nursing are growing
   between Korea and China, understanding of the level related to health
   and quality of life between middle-aged Korean and Chinese women is
   critical to improve their health and quality of life.
   Aim: To compare and examine the health perception, anger expression,
   self-esteem and quality of life between middle-aged Korean and Chinese
   women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. The participants were
   comprised of a total 430 middle-aged Korean (n = 220) and Chinese (n =
   210) women aged 40-64 years. The survey included a set of four
   questionnaires. All measures were self-administered. Data were analysed
   using the statistical package, SPSS/WIN Ver16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,
   IL, USA).
   Results: Middle-aged Chinese women had higher health perception than
   middle-aged Korean women. Anger expression, self-esteem and quality of
   life of middle-aged Korean women were higher than in middle-aged Chinese
   women. Also, there were the differences in the health perception, anger
   expression and self-esteem according to the general characteristics in
   all middle-aged Korean and Chinese women.
   Conclusions: Various nursing intervention strategies should be developed
   and adjusted to improve the self-esteem and quality of life for all
   middle-aged Korean and Chinese women, especially middle-aged Chinese
   women. Additionally, the individual characteristics and national culture
   of the middle-aged women should be considered as a basis for the nursing
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The point prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) among Korean adults
   visiting the Health Service Center for health check-ups was assessed. AD
   was diagnosed based on the questionnaires filled by patients and through
   physical examination by dermatologists. A total of 3,563 persons
   completed the questionnaires, and 2,032 persons were examined by the
   dermatologists. According to the questionnaires, the prevalence of AD
   was 7.1\%, and from the dermatologists' examination, it was 2.6\%
   overall, which decreased with age significantly. The prevalence in men
   was higher than that of women. Grading the severity of AD according to
   their eczema area and severity index scores, 70.6\% were classified as
   being mild, 25.5\% moderate, and 3.9\% severe. Interestingly,
   concomitance of psoriasis and AD was found in 0.5\% of those examined by
   the dermatologists. Our results suggest that AD is one of the most
   common skin diseases not only in children but also in adults in Korea.}},

   Penile tumours are rare in dogs. Reported herein is a case of a penile
   extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) in a 5-year-old male cocker spaniel
   that was brought to a local hospital for an evaluation of a penile mass.
   The mass was approximately 1.3 cm in diameter at the time of
   presentation. In fine needle aspiration and histopathological
   examinations, the neoplastic cells showed eccentric round nuclei, a
   moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, and a peri-nuclear clear zone,
   consistent with plasma cell morphology. There was nuclear pleomorphism
   with mononuclear giant cells and occasional bi-nucleation. Round cells
   on the periphery of the mass demonstrated plasmacytic differentiation.
   Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells stained positive for MUM1
   and light lambda chain. Based on the cytological and pathological
   observations, a diagnosis of penile EMP was established.}},

Abstract = {{Background : Late-onset neutropenia (LON) following rituximab therapy
   has been reported in recent years. However, its incidence has not been
   reported in Korea. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence
   of LON after rituximab therapy in Korean patients with diffuse large
   B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
   Methods : Ninety-eight cases of DLBCL treated with rituximab between
   2004 and 2008 were evaluated. We identified LON as defined by the
   neutrophil count of <1.5 x 10(9)/L without apparent cause after the
   recovery of neutrophil count following rituximab therapy. Bone marrow
   aspiration and biopsy specimens at the time of neutropenia were
   available for retrospective review in only 5 of the patients.
   Results : LON was observed in 15 (15.3\%) of the 98 patients. In the
   bone marrow specimens of the 5 patients, promyelocytes were relatively
   increased and the maturation index of the granulopoiesis was 2:1-3:1,
   which reflects maturation arrest.
   Conclusions : The incidence of LON following rituximab therapy was
   15.3\% in Korean patients with DLBCL. Although there are several
   hypotheses about the causative mechanisms of LON, we suggest that
   maturation arrest at the promyelocyte stage of granulopoiesis may be one
   of the mechanisms involved in the development of LON. (Korean J Lab Med

Abstract = {{Arterial stiffness is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular
   disease, and the degree of arterial stiffness is associated with the
   extent of vascular calcification. This study aimed to investigate the
   association of hair calcium levels with augmentation index (AIx), a
   simple, non-invasive measurement for arterial stiffness. Healthy Koreans
   (male, n=34, female, n=70) were enrolled in this study. Anthropometric
   parameters, lipid profiles, fasting glucose, hair mineral levels, and
   AIx were measured. Pearson/partial correlations and multivariate linear
   regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between hair
   calcium levels and AIx. AIx positively correlated with hair calcium
   levels (r=0.275, p=0.005), age (r=0.283, p=0.004), systolic blood
   pressure (r=0.282, p=0.004), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol
   (r=0.255, p=0.009), and hair magnesium (r=0.196, p=0.046), and
   negatively correlated with heart rate (r=-0.563, p<0.001) and fasting
   glucose (r=-0.262, p=0.005). Hair calcium levels significantly
   correlated with hair magnesium (r=-0.926, p<0.001). Significant
   relationship between AIx and hair calcium levels was maintained after
   adjustment for sex, age, height, hear rate, blood pressure, total
   cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, and hair magnesium
   (r=0.244, p=0.018). Logistic regression model showed that AIx increased
   with the increment of hair calcium levels; log-AIx increased by 0.403\%
   (95\% CI: 0.139-0.515, p=0.001) per unit change in log-hair calcium
   level (sex-adjusted). After adjustment for all the variables above
   together with triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
   increased significance of the association was 0.513\% (p=0.016)]. This
   study supports the presence of the independent positive relationship
   between hair calcium levels and AIx. It suggests the possibility that
   hair calcium levels may be a useful index for reflecting arterial
   stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Two similar microbial fungicides (termed as MA and MB) developed in a
   Korean biopesticide company were analyzed and compared each other in
   their biocontrol activities against the phytophthora blight of chili
   pepper caused by Phytophthora capsici. MA and MB contained the microbe
   Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus subtills, respectively, with
   concentrations over those posted on the microbial products. In
   comparison of the isolated microbes (termed as MAP from MA and MBB from
   MB) in the antagonistic activities against P capsici was effective,
   prominently against zoospore germination, while MBB only significantly
   inhibited the mycelia growth of the pathogen. Some effectiveness of MAP
   and MBB was noted in the inhibition of zoosporangium formation and
   zoospore release from zoosporangia; however, no such large difference
   between MAP and MBB was noted. In a pot experiment, MA reduced the
   severity of the phytophthora blight more than MB, suggesting that the
   disease control efficacy would be more attributable to the inhibition of
   zoospore germination than mycelia growth of P capsici. These results
   also suggest that the similar microbes MA and MB targeting different
   points in the life cycle of the pathogen differ in the disease control
   efficacies. Therefore, to develop microbial fungicides it is required to
   examine the targeting points in the pathogen's life cycle as well as the
   action mode of antagonistic microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the agreement between dual-source computed tomography (DSCT)
   and two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) with respect
   to the assessment of global left ventricular (LV) function in patients
   with severe arrhythmia. With 2D-TTE serving as the reference method, we
   performed both DSCT and 2D-TTE, at an interval of less than 2 days, in
   54 patients with severe arrhythmia (average heart rate difference > 30
   beats per min) before open heart surgery for evaluation of valvular
   heart disease (VHD) and coronary artery disease. DSCT was performed
   using retrospective electrocardiography (ECG) without dose modulation.
   Ten phases of the cardiac cycle were analyzed for identification of
   end-diastolic and end-systolic phases with ECG-editing. Pearson's
   correlation coefficient (r) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to
   determine agreement for parameters of LV global function. Correlation
   between DSCT and 2D-TTE measurements was good or excellent in terms of
   the values of the LV ejection fraction (51.0 +/- A 11.4\% vs. 55.8 +/- A
   11.6\%; r = 0.8), LV end-diastolic volume (179.5 +/- A 98.6 ml vs. 152.1
   +/- A 73.8 ml; r = 0.95), LV end-systolic volume (90.7 +/- A 60.7 ml vs.
   69.1 +/- A 46.8 ml; r = 0.90), and LV stroke volume (89.0 +/- A 48.1 ml
   vs. 82.9 +/- A 37.3 ml; r = 0.89). Left ventricular ejection fraction
   measured using DSCT was less than that measured using 2D-TTE by an
   average of -4.8 +/- A 7.3\%. Dual-source CT with ECG editing can provide
   results comparable to those of 2D-TTE for assessment of LV global
   function in patients with severe arrhythmia.}},

Abstract = {{During the last century, domestic and foreign scholars alike engaged in
   diverse discourses on Korean aesthetics. However, the majority of these
   discussions did not take place as part of specialized academic research,
   but rather consisted solely of authors' renderings of their intuitive
   judgment or individual impressions. Furthermore, even when attempts were
   made to discuss theories relating to Korean aesthetics, the majority of
   these merely focused on the characteristics of Korean arts, and in
   particular craft items. As these discussions have been carried out
   within limited frameworks such as those of the uniqueness or identity of
   Korean aesthetics, these have to some extent become esoteric in nature.
   As a result, the theory of Korean aesthetics could not overcome the
   existing framework in which it emerged as a simple by-product in the
   study of Korean art history. In this regard, there is a need to expand
   the sphere of the study of Korean aesthetics by examining it from the
   standpoint of the wider culture known as humanitarianism. Few
   examinations of Korean aesthetics as part of studies of ideological and
   religious notions such as those found in Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism,
   or Shamanism, or even in everyday life, have been undertaken.
   To this end, this study intends to conduct a reanalysis from the
   standpoint of Daoist philosophy, or more specifically, of the religious
   perspectives contained in Daoism, so as to be able to relativize and
   generalize Korean aesthetics.}},

   with 15 Latin American women in the USA, we illustrate how

   reports of everyday experiences and framed within the constraints of
   contemporary language politics and ideological debates. Building on
   recent shifts in language policy research towards the study of how
   individuals engage with language policy issues, we argue for a close
   analysis of interview talk as a way of gaining important insights into
   this issue. Data from the study not only illustrate the existence of
   multiple frames for individual understandings of language policy, but
   also suggest how these discussions become terrains for the personal
   negotiation of identities within a broader socio-political context that
   is overwhelmingly anti-immigrant.}},

Abstract = {{The Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation change from the 1960s to
   the 1990s shows a strong positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and a
   deepening of the Aleutian low The issue regarding the contributions of
   external forcings and Internal atmospheric variability to this
   circulation change has not been resolved satisfactorily Previous studies
   have found the importance of tropical SST forcing Here this hypothesis
   is examined again using relatively large ensembles of atmospheric
   general circulation model simulations of the twentieth century climate
   forced only by historically varying SST The resulting ensemble mean
   amplitude underestimates the observed change by at least 70\%, although
   the spatial pattern is reproduced well qualitatively Furthermore, AGCM
   experiments are performed to investigate other driving factors such as
   the greenhouse gases sea ice the stratospheric ozone as well as the
   contribution from atmospheric internal variability The increase in
   ensemble mean trend amplitude induced by these additional drivers was
   not enough to substantially improve the agreement with the observed
   trend However the full distribution of simulated trends reveals that the
   ensemble members at the upper tall are much closer to the observed
   amplitude In the best ensemble the 95th percentile of the simulated NAO
   trend amplitude remains at about 80\% of the observed trend amplitude,
   with nearly equal contributions from external forcings and internal
   variability The results also indicate that a complete set of driving
   factors and a correct simulation of stratospheric trends are important
   in bridging the gap between observed and modeled interdecadal
   variability in the North Atlantic winter circulation}},

   Phone Calls to Female Adolescent Clinic Patients}},
Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT: Adolescent females often have questions or concerns about their
   contraceptive methods, and they may discontinue use if these questions
   are not answered. Little evidence exists on whether follow-up phone
   calls to address young women's concerns can help sustain contraceptive
   use. M
   METHODS: Between 2005 and 2007, a total of 805 females aged 14-18
   attending a reproductive health clinic in San Francisco were randomly
   assigned to receive either regular clinic services or regular clinic
   services plus nine follow-up phone calls over 12 months. The young women
   were surveyed at baseline and roughly six, 12 and 18 months later to
   measure condom and contraceptive use, rates of pregnancy and STDs, and
   other outcomes and mediators. Multiple linear and logistic regression
   repeated measures analyses were used to assess the program's effects.
   RESULTS: Clinic counselors completed only 2.7 calls per patient, and
   made 7.8 attempts for every completed call. Although contraceptive use
   increased from baseline to follow-up at six months in both groups,
   levels of condom and contraceptive use, and rates of pregnancy and STDs,
   did not differ between the intervention and control groups at any of the
   follow-up assessments. Moreover, the intervention did not improve clinic
   utilization or satisfaction or have consistent positive effects on
   participants' attitudes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reaching young women by phone after a clinic visit for
   contraception is challenging and does not appear to provide significant
   benefits beyond those provided by basic clinic services. More intensive
   interventions may be needed to markedly change adolescent sexual and
   contraceptive behavior. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health,

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of a boost technique
   Methods and Materials Twenty two patients underwent tumorectomy with
   placement of two or more clips in the surgical cavity before breast
   remodeling Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans,
   with match point registration, were performed on all patients The
   relationship between the location of the gross tumor volume (GTV),
   defined on the preoperative scan, and clip clinical target volume (CTV)
   (clips with a 5-mm margin on the postoperative scan) was then studied,
   by use of commercial volume analysis software
   Results Of the patients, 4 had two clips, 2 had three clips, 8 had four
   clips, and 8 had five clips The median GTV was 1 06 mL (range, 0 2-5 3
   mL), clip CTV ranged from 2 4 to 21 5 mL Volumetric analysis showed that
   in 7 cases (32\%), there was no intersection between the GTV and the
   clip CTV, with the following distribution 4 patients with two clips, 1
   patient with three clips, 1 patient with four clips, and 1 patient with
   five clips The common contoured volume was defined as the percent ratio
   between the intersection of the GTV and clip CTV and the GTV It was
   found to be significantly increased if three or more clips were used vs
   only two clips (common contoured volume, 35 45\% vs 0 73\%, p = 0 028)
   Finally, the GTV and clip CTV volume relationship can be presented as
   follows 12 5\% to 33\% overlap in 8 patients (36 4\%), 50\% to 75\% in 5
   patients (22 7\%), and greater than 90\% in 2 patients (9\%)

Abstract = {{Detrital zircon provenance studies that combine low-temperature
   fission-track and high-temperature U-Pb single-grain age dating are
   powerful in constraining sediment provenance by documenting the
   tectonothermal evolution of the sediment source(s). We apply these
   techniques to Miocene (12-6 Ma) sandstones of the Hengchun Peninsula,
   southern Taiwan, which, based on diametrically opposite palaeocurrents,
   have a controversial provenance. U-Pb grain ages range from the Miocene
   (8 Ma) to Archaean (2.5 Ga). Cretaceous thermal cooling is recorded by
   detrital zircon fission tracks at Loshui and Lilongshan. Permian
   fission-track grain ages account for <33\% of zircon ages from Loshui,
   while at Lilongshan, Jurassic/Triassic grain ages account for 33-66\% of
   all zircon fission-track ages. Minor (<12\%) Miocene age components are
   detected in both formations. These new data suggest that the primary
   sources of these Miocene sediments were similar. A simple model is
   proposed invoking sediment reworking in this complex tectonic setting.}},

Abstract = {{This research addressed the effect of hip osteoarthritis severity on
   equilibrium ability after sudden changes in direction among 20 healthy
   elderly people, 20 with moderate hip osteoarthritis (mOA), and 20 with
   severe hip osteoarthritis (sOA). The Lehr's damping ratio calculated
   from testing while standing on both limbs (D-elderly(both) = 0.466 +/-
   0.033; D-mOA(both) = 0.436 +/- 0.055; (D-sOA(both) = 0.346 +/- 0.055)
   did not differ significantly from results of testing while standing on
   the dominant limb in healthy subjects (D-elderly(dom) = 0.413 +/- 0.036)
   and on the unaffected limb in patients with varying degrees of
   osteoarthritis (D-mOA(dom) = 0.408 +/- 0.064; D-sOA(dom) = 0.309 +/-
   0.060). Results from testing during standing on the non-dominant limb in
   healthy subjects (D-elderly(non-dom) = 0.302 +/- 0.039) and on the
   affected limb in patients with osteoarthritis (D-mOA(affected) = 0.219
   +/- 0.068, D-sOA(affected) = 0.135 +/- 0.071) differed significantly
   from the results of the other two scenarios, indicating that the healthy
   side is dominant. In cases of sOA, equilibrium ability decreased with
   standing on both limbs or on the healthy limb compared to the control
   group and to the patients with mOA. Furthermore, an increased degree of
   hip osteoarthritis significantly decreased equilibrium ability on the
   affected side after sudden changes in direction, based on a comparison
   of the affected side in patients with sOA to the affected side in
   patients with mOA. Deterioration of equilibrium ability may indicate an
   increased risk of falling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen yearling steers were used to evaluate treatments for ammonia
   intoxication. The animals subjected to ammonium chloride infusion were
   distributed into three groups of five animals each, and treated as
   following: 1-control group (C), physiological saline solution (H)
   infusion; 2-O+H group, urea cycle aminoacids (O) and ``H{''} medication;
   and 3-O+F+H group, the same protocol of group 2 plus furosemide (F). The
   animals were monitored by collection of blood samples and the whole
   urinary volume. O+F+H and O+H treatments promoted pronounced clinical
   improvement, in attention to H group, i.e., they remained in standing
   position, returned ruminal movement and appetite, and recovered more
   quickly from pulmonary edema. In O+F+H and O+H groups, minor plasmatic
   levels of ammonia and L-lactate, more abundant urine, major ammonium and
   urea amount excretion by urine, more intensive ammonia depuration from
   blood, and lower urinary pH were observed. It was concluded that the
   proposed treatments had effective action due to hyperammonemia decrease,
   by major renal ammonium excretion, and hepatic transformation of ammonia
   in urea.}},

Abstract = {{User resistance is an important issue in the implementation of
   enterprise systems (ES). However, despite a large body of user
   acceptance literature, there is far less literature addressing user
   resistance. This study seeks to better understand the development of
   user resistance. Information is obtained and triangulated in this study
   from a focus group and semi-structured user interviews from three
   organizations. Through the lens of the psychological contract employees
   have with their organization, user resistance is investigated. Twelve
   determinants were found that upset the psychological contract and affect
   the level of user resistance. These determinants have been classified
   into four key categories which expand on previous literature:
   individual, system, organizational, and process issues. The
   relationships among these concepts and both the theoretical and
   practical contributions of this study are discussed. European Journal of

Abstract = {{The ability of the monoclonal antibody TU-20 and its scFv fragment to
   bind specifically to the C-end of the class III beta-tubulin makes these
   substances useful as potential diagnostics for neurodegenerative
   diseases-especially peripheral neuropathies. TU-20 and its scFv were
   labeled with (125)I and (123)I by chloramine-T (with radiochemical yield
   75 and 50\%, respectively). Radiochemical purity and stability was
   revealed by gel filtration (decrease to 80 and 50\% in 2 months,
   respectively). Immunoreactivity of the labeled TU-20 was determined by
   ELISA-the range of the preserved immunoreactivity varies from 60 to 95\%
   in accordance to the used radiolabeling process. RIA and affinity
   coupling analytic methods were specifically designed with focusing on
   specifics of the antibody and its fragment. The results of RIA differ in
   depandance on the type of the reaction vessel (glass or polystyrene) and
   the affinity coupling results depend on the experimental arrangement-in
   the batch or on the column. Fragmentation of the labeled antibody and
   its fragment was estimated by bis-tris gel electrophoresis followed by
   silver staining and autoradiography (over 95\% of radioactivity bound in
   the substances). The antibody binding in tissue slices was studied in
   vitro by immunohistochemistry. The Purkinje cells were observed
   conjugated with the radiolabeled substances, either TU-20 or its ScFv
   fragment in the area of the cerebellum. In vivo biodistribution of
   (125)I-TU-20, (125)I-scFv TU-20, (123)I-scFv TU-20 and Na(125)I was
   proceeded in normal mice (wild type C57B/6/J). Both biomolecules labeled
   by (123)I were also proved in an imaging biodistribution study with use
   of the SPECT camera. Finally, a transgene population G93A1 Gur was used
   for comparative study to show the different behaviour of the substances
   in a normal mouse and in the modified organism with amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis. The most part of differences is observed in the area of the
   muscles, rostal and caudal spinal cord. In summary, the monoclonal
   antibody TU-20 and its scFv were successfully radioiodinated and
   afterwards analysed by several quality control methods and
   biodistribution studies which confirmed their preserved or expected
   immunoanalytical characteristics in normal and genetically modified
   organism.}},

Abstract = {{Fast neutron and gamma-ray flux spectra and time-of-arrival spectra of
   slow neutrons have been measured in a neutronics mock-up of the European
   Helium-Cooled Lithium-Lead Test Blanket Module with the aim to validate
   nuclear cross-section data. The mock-up was irradiated with fusion peak
   neutrons from the DT neutron generator of the Technical University of
   Dresden. A well characterized cylindrical NE-213 scintillator was
   inserted into two positions in the LiPb/EUROFER assembly. Pulse height
   spectra from neutrons and gamma-rays were recorded from the NE-213
   output. The spectra were then unfolded with experimentally obtained
   response matrices of the NE-213 detector. Time-of-arrival spectra of
   slow neutrons were measured with a (3)He counter placed in the mock-up,
   and the neutron generator was operated in pulsed mode. Monte Carlo
   calculations using the MCNP code and nuclear cross-section data from the
   JEFF-3.1.1 and FENDL-2.1 libraries were performed and the results are
   compared with the experimental results. A good agreement of measurement
   and calculation was found with some deviations in certain energy
   intervals. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a detailed procedure to create photolabile, polyethylene
   glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels and manipulate material properties in situ.
   The cytocompatible chemistry and degradation process enable dynamic,
   tunable changes for applications in two-dimensional (2D) or 3D cell
   culture. The materials are created by synthesizing an
   o-nitrobenzylether-based photodegradable monomer that can be coupled to
   primary amines. In this study, we provide coupling procedures to
   PEG-bis-amine to form a photodegradable cross-linker or to the
   fibronectin-derived peptide RGDS to form a photoreleasable tether.
   Hydrogels are synthesized with the photodegradable cross-linker in the
   presence or absence of cells, allowing direct encapsulation or seeding
   on surfaces. Cell-material interactions can be probed in 2D or 3D by
   spatiotemporally controlling the gel microenvironment, which allows
   unique experiments to be performed to monitor cell response to changes
   in their niche. Degradation is readily achieved with cytocompatible
   wavelengths of low-intensity flood irradiation (365-420 nm) in minutes
   or with high-intensity laser irradiation (405 nm) in seconds. In this
   protocol, synthesis and purification of photodegradable monomers take
   approximately 2 weeks, but the process can be substantially shortened by
   purchasing the o-nitrobenzylether precursor. Preparation of sterile
   solutions for hydrogel fabrication takes hours, whereas the reaction to
   form the final hydrogel is complete in minutes. Hydrogel degradation
   occurs on demand, in seconds to minutes, with user-directed light
   exposure. This comprehensive protocol is useful for controlling peptide
   presentation and substrate modulus during cell culture on or within an
   elastic matrix. These PEG-based materials are useful for probing the
   dynamic influence of cell-cell and cell-material interactions on cell
   function in 2D or 3D. Although other protocols are available for
   controlling peptide presentation or modulus, few allow manipulation of
   material properties in situ and in the presence of cells down to the
   micrometer scale.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective was to study the prevalence of cervicogenic
   headache (CEH) in the general population.
   Methods: An age-and gender-stratified random sample of 30,000 persons
   aged 30-44 years received a mailed questionnaire. Those with
   self-reported chronic headache were interviewed by neurological
   residents. The criteria of the Cervicogenic Headache International Study
   Group and the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second
   edition, were applied.
   Results: The questionnaire response rate was 71\% and the participation
   rate of the interview was 74\%. The prevalence of CEH was 0.17\% in the
   general population, with a female preponderance. Fifty per cent had
   co-occurrence of medication overuse and 42\% had co-occurrence of
   migraine. The pericranial muscle tenderness score was significantly
   higher on the pain than non-pain side (p <. 005). The cervical range of
   motion was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls (p <.
   005). The mean duration of CEH was eight years. Based on patients'

Title = {{Considerations in experimental and theoretical collision cross-section
   measurements of small molecules using travelling wave ion mobility
   spectrometry-mass spectrometry}},

Abstract = {{Travelling wave ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TWIMS-MS)
   has the capability to separate ions based on their mobility through a
   gas-filled travelling wave (T-wave) device in the presence of a train of
   transient voltage pulses. By calibration of this device using analytes
   of previously determined cross-sectional area (from conventional IMS
   experiments), collision cross-sections of ions can be determined based
   on their drift time through the T-wave device. Comparison of
   experimentally determined cross-sections with theoretical calculations
   from structural models has the potential to provide methodology which
   can be applied to analytes of previously uncharacterised structure:
   however, this comparison relies on a high degree of confidence in both
   experimental and theoretical methods.
   Focussing on small (<= 200 Da) molecules, collision cross-sections have
   been measured by TWIMS-MS employing a calibration procedure that uses
   both oligo-glycine peptides and human haemoglobin-derived tryptic
   peptides in order to extend the calibration range for the measurement of
   high mobility ions. The effect of TWIMS wave height parameters on the
   calibration is addressed.
   Theoretical TWIMS cross-section calculations have been performed using a
   rapid, Windows-based, in-house developed projection approximation
   algorithm. These estimates were optimised by comparison with
   experimental values for a series of small molecules with rigid core
   structures by systematic variation of the interaction radii of the atoms
   comprising these species until theoretical measurements were in
   agreement with experimentally derived TWIMS cross-sections. The effect
   of varying the interaction radius for the buffer gas was subsequently
   studied by comparison of theoretical collision cross-sections calculated
   using helium and nitrogen radii with TWIMS-MS cross-section measurements
   determined in either helium or nitrogen buffer gases. It was found that
   the buffer gas used in theoretical calculations should ideally match the
   buffer gas in which the cross-sections of the calibrants were originally
   determined by conventional IMS.
   The resolving potential of the experimental methodology was demonstrated
   by separation of two isomeric amino acids, leucine and isoleucine, which
   showed <3\% difference in cross-sectional areas. Furthermore, the
   application of both experimental and theoretical methods to compare the
   gas phase and solution conformations of seven amino acids was
   demonstrated. This study describes important considerations for the
   comparison of TWIMS-MS collision cross-sections with those obtained by
   theoretical methods, and also demonstrates that TWIMS-MS could be
   applied specifically to study a range of small molecules including those
   of pharmaceutical interest, in particular structural isomers and
   diastereoisomers that may not be distinguishable by mass spectrometry
   alone. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 169 male 100-km ultra-marathoners, the variables of anthropometry,
   training, and prerace experience, in order to predict race time, were
   investigated. In the bivariate analysis, age (r = .24), body mass (r =
   .20), Body Mass Index (r = .29), circumference of upper arm (r = .26),
   percent body fat (r = .45), mean weekly running hours (r = -.21), mean
   weekly running kilometers (r = -.43), mean speed in training (r = -.56),
   personal best time in a marathon (r = .65), the number of finished
   100-km ultra-runs (r = .24), and the personal best time in a 100-km
   ultra-run (r = .72) were associated with race time. Stepwise multiple
   regression showed that training speed (p < .0001), mean weekly running
   kilometers (p < .0001), and age (p < .0001) were the best correlations
   for a 100-km race time. Performance may be predicted (n = 169, r(2) =
   .43) by the following equation: 100-km race time (min) = 1,085.60-36.26
   x (training speed, km/hr.) - 1.43 x (training volume, km/wk.) +2.50 x
   (age, yr.). Overall, intensity of training might be more important for a
   successful outcome in a 100-km race than anthropometric attributes.
   Motivation to train intensely for such an ultra-endurance run should be
   explored as this might be the key for a successful finish.}},

Title = {{Oviposition Behaviors in Relation to Rotation Resistance in the Western

Abstract = {{Across a large area of the midwestern United States Corn Belt, the
   western corn rootworm beetle (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte,
   Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) exhibits behavioral resistance to annual crop
   rotation. Resistant females exhibit increased locomotor activity and
   frequently lay eggs in soybean (Glycine max L.) fields, although they
   also lay eggs in fields of corn (Zea mays L.) and other locations. The
   goals of this study were (1) to determine whether there were any
   differences in ovipositional behavior and response to plant cues between
   individual rotation-resistant and wild-type females in the laboratory
   and (2) to examine the roles of, and interaction between, host
   volatiles, diet, and locomotor behavior as they related to oviposition.
   Because rootworm females lay eggs in the soil, we also examined the
   influence of host plant roots on behavior. In the first year of the
   study, rotation-resistant beetles were significantly more likely to lay
   eggs in the presence of soybean foliage and to feed on soybean leaf
   discs than wild-type females, but this difference was not observed in
   the second year. Oviposition by rotation-resistant females was increased
   in the presence of soybean roots, but soybean herbivory did not affect
   ovipositional choice. Conversely, ovipositional choice of wild-type
   females was not affected by the presence or identity of host plant roots
   encountered, and wild-type females consuming soybean foliage were more
   likely to lay eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling laws based on the concept of dimensional similitude are proposed
   to simulate the hydrodynamics of hot and large particle systems at
   conditions of cold and small particle systems. This technique uses the
   concept of dimensional similitude to accomplish this by maintaining
   certain dimensional groups constant in the large, hot and small, cold
   systems. However, there are certain limitations with this technique. One
   of them is that the particle size in the small, cold system is usually
   smaller than in the large, hot system. Because particle size is such a
   dominant parameter in fluidized systems, this can certainly affect the
   simulation.
   An alternative method of simulating hot hydrodynamics in
   ambient-temperature Group A particle systems has been proposed. In this
   method, the same calculated drag force is maintained between the two
   systems. The drag force is varied by changing the gas density of the
   cold system so that it matches the drag force in the hot system. (C)

Abstract = {{It is well known that the results of yarn evenness test informed the
   quality of the resulting fabric. The unevenness such as thin, thick,
   nep, and mass periodic change caused bad visual quality of fabric.
   Evener yarn makes better visual quality fabric. In our previous paper,
   it was, however, reported that the double ply yarn having little
   unevenness caused a peculiar manner of bad visual quality of the plain
   stitch fabric. But, in yarn friction test, this yarn had the wider range
   of the friction change working between needles and the running yarn than
   usual yarns. In addition, the friction change had a certain cyclic
   variation. In case of flat knitting machine, dyeing double ply yarns are
   generally knitted. After dyeing, evenness test and friction test are
   seldom applied to the yam. In this paper, these tests were carried out
   for the several yams which were generally knitted by flat knitting
   machine. Some yams were added as tested yarns. Those yarns imitated the
   yam that caused a peculiar manner of bad visual quality. The result of
   these examination and measurement was weighed. It was found that there
   was the correlation between the variety of friction and visual quality
   of the resulting fabric.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: to identify risk factors associated with neonatal transfers
   from a free-standing birth centre to a hospital.
   Design: epidemiological case-control study.
   Setting: midwifery-led free-standing birth centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Participants: 96 newborns were selected from 2840 births between
   September 1998 and August 2005. Cases were defined as all new borns
   transferred from the birth centre to a hospital (n = 32), and controls
   were defined as new borns delivered at the same birth centre, during the
   same time period, and who had not been transferred to a hospital (n =
   64).
   Measurements and findings: data were collected from medical records
   available at the birth centre. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
   performed using logistic regression. The multivariate analysis included
   outcomes with p<0.25, specifically: smoking during pregnancy, prenatal
   care appointments, labour complications, weight in relation to
   gestational age, and one-minute Apgar score. Of the foregoing outcomes,
   those that remained in the full regression model as a risk factor
   associated with neonatal transfer were: smoking during pregnancy {[}p =
   0.009, odds ratio (OR) = 4.1,95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-16.33],
   labour complications (p<0.001, OR = 5.5, 95\% CI 1.06-28.26) and
   one-minute Apgar score <= 7 (p<0.001, OR = 7.8,95\% CI 1.62-37.03).
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: smoking during pregnancy,
   labour complications and one-minute Apgar score <= 7 were confirmed as
   risk factors for neonatal transfer from the birth centre to a hospital.
   The identified risk factors can help to improve institutional protocols
   and formulate hypotheses for other studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

   nine concentrations of six modifiers: acetonitrile, acetone, dioxane,
   propan-2-ol, methanol and tetrahydrofurane. The elaborated comparative
   analysis formed several general recommendations. Methanol and dioxane
   were the best modifiers, while acetonitrile gave the worst and
   inacceptable correlation of retention with lipophilicity. Surprisingly,
   good correlations were obtained for the single TLC runs and this method
   is underestimated in the literature. The advanced chemometric processing
   proposed recently, such as PCA, PARAFAC and PLS did not show a visible
   advantage comparing to classical methods. A need to use a robust
   regression and robust correlation measures, due to presence of
   significant outliers, was also noticed and studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: This case report provides an overview of surgical procedures,
   including single-event multiple level surgery (SEMLS) used in the
   management of secondary conditions in cerebral palsy (CP). Physical
   therapy (PT) management over 35 months following SEMLS is described for
   an adolescent (Gross Motor Function Classification System level II) with
   CP. Summary of Key Points: When conservative management is not
   sufficient to manage secondary complications, SEMLS, combined with PT
   and family support, may provide the foundation for greater functional
   improvement than surgical correction of a single impairment. The outcome
   measures used following SEMLS included the Gross Motor Function
   Measure-66, Activity Scale for Kidsperformance38, goniometry, manual
   muscle testing, and Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Statement of
   Conclusions: Preoperative functional level can be exceeded and sustained
   beyond 24 months following surgery. Recommendations for Clinical
   Practice: Rehabilitation following a SEMLS requires teamwork and a
   long-term commitment to maximize outcomes. (Pediatr Phys Ther 2010; 22:

Abstract = {{The species composition, distribution, and biodiversity of the bacterial
   communities in the rumen of cows fed alfalfa or triticale were
   investigated using 16S rRNA gene clone library analyses. The rumen
   bacterial community was fractionated and analyzed as three separate
   fractions: populations in the planktonic, loosely attached to rumen
   digesta particles, and tightly attached to rumen digesta particles. Six
   hundred and thirteen operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to 32
   genera, 19 families, and nine phyla of the domain Bacteria were
   identified from 1014 sequenced clones. Four hundred and fifty one of the
   613 OTUs were identified as new species. These bacterial sequences were
   distributed differently among the three fractions in the rumen digesta
   of cows fed alfalfa or triticale. Chao 1 estimation revealed that, in
   both communities, the populations tightly attached to particulates were
   more diverse than the planktonic and those loosely attached to
   particulates. S-Libshuff detected significant differences in the
   composition between any two fractions in the rumen of cows with the same
   diet and between the communities fed alfalfa and triticale diets. The
   species richness estimated for the communities fed alfalfa and triticale
   is 1027 and 662, respectively. The diversity of the rumen bacterial
   community examined in this study is greater than previous studies have
   demonstrated and the differences in the community composition between
   two high-fiber diets have implications for sample selection for
   downstream metagenomics applications.}},

Abstract = {{Research on curcumin (polyphenol derived from the rhizome of herb
   Curcuma longa) has occupied a unique niche owing to its distinctive
   properties, unique molecular architecture and multi-potent efficacies,
   particularly in the bio-medical domain with recent interest in material
   science. In the present study, conjugation of curcumin onto
   biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) - templated magnetic iron oxide
   nanoparticles (MNP) (2-5 nm), prepared through a simple wet chemical
   route is reported along with modulation of the activity of the partners.
   Statistical optimization, using response surface methodology, of
   sonication parameters (8 min. 0.4 cycle and 60\% amplitude) for maximal
   curcumin loading (86\%), has shown major morphology directing effect
   generating triads, tetrads, amongst others and chain-like arrangement
   (TEM imaging) of the bio-conjugated nanoparticles (80-90 nm). Intonation
   of the magnetometric parameters of the PEG assisted MNPs on
   bioconjugation was also evident. The synergistic potency of the
   partners, the polymer templated iron oxide nanoparticles and curcumin,
   was unmasked during scavenging of diphenyl picryl hydrazyl (DPPH). The
   system represents an architecturally appealing, magnetically responsive
   bio-conjugated system possessing synergistic participation of the
   partners, with prospective applications in medical domain. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A favored hypothesis to explain the pathology underlying nuclear
   envelopathies is that mutations in nuclear envelope proteins alter
   genome/chromatin organization and thus gene expression. To identify
   nuclear envelope proteins that play roles in genome organization, we
   analyzed nuclear envelopes from resting and phytohemagglutinin-activated
   leukocytes because leukocytes have a particularly high density of
   peripheral chromatin that undergoes significant reorganization upon such
   activation. Thus, nuclear envelopes were isolated from leukocytes in the
   two states and analyzed by multidimensional protein identification
   technology using an approach that used expected contaminating membranes
   as subtractive fractions. A total of 3351 proteins were identified
   between both nuclear envelope data sets among which were 87 putative
   nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) that were not identified
   in a previous proteomics analysis of liver nuclear envelopes. Nuclear
   envelope localization was confirmed for 11 new NETs using tagged fusion
   proteins and antibodies on spleen cryosections. 27\% of the new proteins
   identified were unique to one or the other of the two leukocyte states.
   Differences in expression between activated and resting leukocytes were
   confirmed for some NETs by RT-PCR, and most of these proteins appear to
   only be expressed in certain types of blood cells. Several known
   proteins identified in both data sets have functions in chromatin
   organization and gene regulation. To test whether the novel NETs
   identified might include those that also regulate chromatin, nine were
   run through two screens for different chromatin effects. One screen
   found two NETs that can recruit a specific gene locus to the nuclear
   periphery, and the second found a different NET that promotes chromatin
   condensation. The variation in the protein milieu with pharmacological
   activation of the same cell population and consequences for gene
   regulation suggest that the nuclear envelope is a complex regulatory
   system with significant influences on genome organization. Molecular \&
   Cellular Proteomics 9: 2571-2585, 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on open-source software (OSS) products report that
   smaller modules are proportionally more defect prone compared to larger
   ones. This phenomenon, referred to as the Theory of Relative Defect
   Proneness (RDP), challenges the traditional QA approaches that give a
   higher priority to larger modules, and it attracts growing interest from
   closed-source software (CSS) practitioners. In this paper, we report the
   findings of a study where we tested the theory of RDP using ten CSS
   products. The results clearly confirm the theory of RDP. We also
   demonstrate the useful practical implications of this theory in terms of
   defect-detection effectiveness. Therefore, this study does not only make
   research contributions by rigorously testing a scientific theory for a
   different category of software products, but also provides useful
   insights and evidence to practitioners for revising their existing QA
   practices.}},

Title = {{The effect of age on the tolerability of intraperitoneal chemotherapy,

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. We sought to determine if patient age influenced chemotherapy
   completion rate, complication rate, or progression free survival (PFS)
   among patients who received intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy for
   epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers.
   Methods. Charts for patients receiving IP chemotherapy between January
   2006 and September 2009 were reviewed at three institutions. Primary
   outcomes included completion rate of planned IP chemotherapy,
   complication rate, and PFS. Completion rates were categorized as 0-49\%,
   50-99\%, or 100\% of planned treatments were delivered. The tolerability
   of IP versus intravenous (IV) chemotherapy was also compared among
   patients >= 70 years.
   Results. One hundred nine patients receiving IP chemotherapy were
   identified, 86 were <70 years and 23 were years. All patients received
   IP cisplatin and paclitaxel in combination with IV paclitaxel or
   docetaxel. Patients >= 70 years old were less likely to complete all
   planned cycles of IP chemotherapy than the younger cohort (OR = 0.33,
   95\% CI 0.13-0.83, p = 0.01), but there was no significant association
   between age and complication rate or PFS (p = 0.82 and p = 0.68,
   respectively). Optimally debulked patients >= 70 years receiving IV
   chemotherapy completed more cycles than patients >= 70 receiving IP
   chemotherapy (p<0.01).
   Conclusions. Although elderly patients appear to tolerate fewer cycles
   of IP chemotherapy, they do not have higher objective complication rates
   or impaired PFS compared to younger patients. Age alone should not limit
   access to IP chemotherapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the English
   literature about the usefulness of ultrasound therapy in degenerative
   hip osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to examine its short- and
   long-term efficacy in patients with primary hip osteoarthritis with
   regard to pain, functional status, and quality of life (QoL). Forty-five
   patients with primary hip osteoarthritis were enrolled into the study.
   Demographic and clinical characteristics including age, sex, duration of
   disease, and pain on activity and at rest using visual analogue scale
   (VAS) were recorded. Functional status was determined by a 15-m timed
   walking test and Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire.
   QoL was determined by the Short Form-36 survey (SF-36). Each patient was
   randomly assigned to either group I (standard physical therapy including
   hot pack and exercise program), group II (sham ultrasound in addition to
   standard physical therapy), or group III (ultrasound and standard
   physical therapy). The main outcome measures of the treatment were pain
   intensity by VAS; functional status measurements that were evaluated at
   baseline, at the end of the therapies, and at the first and third month
   of follow-up; and QoL scores that were determined at baseline and at the
   end of the first and third months. Twelve male and 33 female patients
   (mean age, 65.3 +/- 6.7 years; mean disease duration, 2.5 +/- 1.7 years)
   were included in the study. There were no differences between the groups
   regarding demographic variables on entry to the study. There were 15
   patients in each group. Pain and functional outcome measures were
   determined to have improved significantly in all of the groups at the
   end of the therapies, but these improvements continued at the end of the
   first and third months only in group III (p<0.001) The physical
   subscores of SF-36 were improved at the end of the first month and were
   maintained at the end of the third month only in patients receiving
   additional ultrasound therapy (group III, p<0.001), while mental
   subscores of SF-36 did not change significantly in any group. In
   conclusion, addition of therapeutic ultrasound to the traditional
   physical therapy showed a longitudinal positive effect on pain,
   functional status, and physical QoL in patients with hip osteoarthritis.
   The use of therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of hip osteoarthritis
   should be encouraged, and it seems worthy to continue with large
   clinical trials on ultrasound in order to standardize the treatment
   modality in this patient group.}},

Abstract = {{Goose feather and down is a renewable natural product valued for its
   peculiar quality properties. This material is largely obtained after the
   slaughter of waterfowl and on a smaller scale by harvesting from live
   geese at time of moulting. During the course of slaughter and
   processing, feather and down is exposed to various unfavourable effects
   which degrade its quality. Conversely, the feather and down harvested by
   hand from live geese is superior to the industrial feather product in
   several respects. However, animal rights activist groups recently began
   to protest vigorously against the hand-harvesting of feathers from live
   geese. To this end, they frequently display images of illegal
   live-harvesting or live-plucking in the media which differs markedly
   from the proper practice regulated by the law. Live-plucking is
   prohibited by EU legislation, and the Hungarian laws and regulations
   approve the live-harvesting of mature feathers at time of moulting
   according to the rules specified. This procedure is based on the
   inherent moulting characteristics of domestic geese (i.e. shorter
   feather maturation with more frequent moults compared to wild geese) and
   is technically feasible without any harm to the goose, its well-being or
   production, as evidenced by clinical and productivity data. Illegal
   hand-harvesting of feathers differing from the approved practice is
   strictly penalised in Hungary and cruelty to animals is defined as a
   crime.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation and application of evaporate cooling within a hybrid
   ventilation scheme. It is a challenge to attain a high level of thermal
   comfort during the summer without using energy intensive air
   conditioning systems even with high insulation standards of the walls in
   new buildings. Despite moderate inner loads and intensive protections
   against solar gains a cooling load often remains that affects the
   thermal comfort. This paper investigates by means of computer simulation
   a hybrid ventilation concept where cooling is provided by a direct
   evaporative cooler. The research work has been carried out within a
   DST-DFG cooperation program with the Indian Institute of Technology
   Roorkee, where a prototype of such a cooler is investigated and
   optimised.
   This paper analyses the potential for use of evaporative cooler in low
   energy buildings and traditional buildings with lower insulation
   standard under Central European summer conditions. In addition, the
   influence of shading appliances, ventilation strategy, thermal
   insulation of the building and the humidity content of the outside walls
   is investigated.
   It has been found that evaporative coolers, together with a suitable
   ventilation strategy and sufficient shading are able to provide levels
   of thermal comfort comparable with those gained by mechanical air
   conditioning systems.}},

Abstract = {{Current cortico-centric models of cognition lack a cohesive
   neuroanatomic framework that sufficiently considers overlapping levels
   of function, from ``pathological{''} through ``normal{''} to
   ``gifted{''} or exceptional ability. While most cognitive theories
   presume an evolutionary context, few actively consider the process of
   adaptation, including concepts of neurodevelopment. Further, the
   frequent co-occurrence of ``gifted{''} and ``pathological{''} function
   is difficult to explain from a cortico-centric point of view. This
   comprehensive review paper proposes a framework that includes the
   brain's vertical organization and considers ``giftedness{''} from an
   evolutionary and neurodevelopmental vantage point. We begin by
   discussing the current cortico-centric model of cognition and its
   relationship to intelligence. We then review an integrated, dual-tiered
   model of cognition that better explains the process of adaptation by
   simultaneously allowing for both stimulus-based processing and
   higher-order cognitive control. We consider the role of the basal
   ganglia within this model, particularly in relation to reward circuitry
   and instrumental learning. We review the important role of white matter
   tracts in relation to speed of adaptation and development of behavioral
   mastery. We examine the cerebellum's critical role in behavioral
   refinement and in cognitive and behavioral automation, particularly in
   relation to expertise and giftedness. We conclude this integrated model
   of brain function by considering the savant syndrome, which we believe
   is best understood within the context of a dual-tiered model of
   cognition that allows for automaticity in adaptation as well as
   higher-order executive control.}},

Abstract = {{Resonant transformation of fast magnetosonic (FMS) wave flux in to
   Alfven and slow magnetosonic (SMS) oscillations is investigated in the
   one-dimensionally inhomogeneous magnetosphere. Spatial distribution of
   energy absorption rate of FMS oscillations penetrating into the
   magnetosphere from the solar wind is studied. The FMS wave energy
   absorption rate caused by magnetosonic resonance excitation is shown to
   be several orders of magnitude greater than that caused by Alfven
   resonance excitation at the same surface. It is connected with the
   spectrum of incident FMS waves. The Kolmogorov spectrum is used in
   numerical calculations. Magnitude of the Fourier harmonics exciting
   resonant Alfven oscillations is much smaller than that of the harmonics
   driving lower-frequency magnetosonic resonance. It is shown that
   resonant transformation of FMS waves in to SMS oscillations can be an
   effective mechanism of energy transfer from the solar wind to the
   magnetosphere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Osteonecrosis (ON) in the knee occurs as a localized inflammatory
   disease in relation to spontaneous or non-traumatic ON. Conservative
   treatment possibilities are limited, and prognosis appears to be poor;
   in most cases, ON results in knee arthroplasty. Bisphosphonates are
   suggested to prevent bone resorption and collapse of necrotic bone. In
   this observational, prospective study we investigated the effect of
   bisphosphonate treatment in patients with spontaneous or
   arthroscopy-induced ON of the knee. Twenty-eight patients with
   osteonecrotic lesions and bone marrow oedema in the knee were included.
   In 22 patients (80\%), ON was identified after arthroscopic surgery of
   the knee; six patients were diagnosed with spontaneous ON. Patients were
   initially given pamidronate 120 mg i.v. divided in 3-4 perfusions over 2
   weeks, followed by oral bisphosphonate treatment with alendronate 70 mg
   weekly for 4-6 months. Bisphosphonate treatment resulted in a rapid pain
   relief, VAS decreasing from 8.2 +/- A 1.2 at baseline to 5.02 +/- A 0.6
   after 4-6 weeks (p < 0.001). After 6 months, the VAS decreased by 80\%
   (p < 0.001). At the 6-month follow-up, symptoms had resolved completely
   in 15 patients out of 28; in 6 patients, minimal symptoms (VAS 1-2)
   remained. In two patients, treatment effect was unsatisfactory, and
   surgical intervention was needed (arthroplasty). Bone marrow oedema on
   MRI resolved completely in 18 patients out of 28 with substantial
   reduction in the remaining. Furthermore, osteonecrotic area resolved
   completely or demarcation with sclerotic changes of the necrotic area
   could be observed. Bisphosphonate treatment in patients with
   osteonecrosis of the knee was associated with a rapid improvement in
   pain score and radiological consolidation of the area of osteonecrosis.
   Further randomized, controlled trials are warranted to confirm the
   potential beneficial role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of
   osteonecrosis of the knee. Level of evidence: observational study, level
   IV.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the performance and risk-return characteristics of
   three major emerging art markets: Russia, China, and India. According to
   three national art market indices, built by hedonic regressions based on
   auction sales prices, the geometric annual returns are 10.00\%, 5.70\%.
   and 42.20\% for Russia (1985-2008), China (1990-2008), and India
   (2002-2008), respectively. The Russian art market exhibits positive
   correlations with most common financial assets and a positive market
   beta, whereas the Chinese art market demonstrates a negative correlation
   overall and a negative market beta, and the Indian art index reveals a
   negative market beta and varying correlation results. Portfolio
   optimization under a power utility framework suggests limited
   diversification potential, but with a downside beta of 0.43, investing
   in Chinese art offers hedging potential during financial market
   downswings. Investigating the linkages between art and the economy
   through co-integration and causality analyses proves that emerging art
   markets share a significant long-term relation with other financial
   market instruments, but short-term relations are largely absent. (C)

Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{The environment is changing and so are forests, in their functioning, in
   species composition, and in the species' genetic composition. Many
   empirical and process-based models exist to support forest management.
   However, most of these models do not consider the impact of
   environmental changes and forest management on genetic diversity nor on
   the rate of adaptation of critical plant processes. How genetic
   diversity and rates of adaptation depend on management actions is a
   crucial next step in model development.
   Modelling approaches of genetic and demographic processes that operate
   in forests are categorized here in two classes. One approach assumes
   equilibrium conditions in phenotype and tree density, and analyses the
   characteristics of the demography and the genetic system of the species
   that determine the rate at which that equilibrium is attained. The other
   modelling approach does not assume equilibrium conditions and describes
   both the ecological-and genetic processes to analyse how environmental
   changes result in selection pressures on functional traits of trees and
   the consequences of that selection for tree- and ecosystem functioning.
   The equilibrium approach allows analysing the recovery rate after a
   perturbation in stable environments, i.e. towards the same
   pre-perturbation stable state. The non-equilibrium approach allows, in
   addition to the equilibrium approach, analysing consequences of ongoing
   environmental changes and forest management, i.e. non-stationary
   environments, on tree functioning, species composition, and genetic
   composition of the trees in forest ecosystem.
   In this paper we describe these two modelling approaches and discuss
   advantages and disadvantages of them and current knowledge gaps.}},

Abstract = {{In 1930 the French historian Lucien Febvre and geographer Albert
   Demangeon were commissioned to coauthor a book on the Rhine. In
   preparation for this volume, and with war clouds gathering on the
   horizon, they took an upriver Rhineland journey into Europe's heart of
   darkness. Around this time, Febvre began taking notes for what would
   later become his magisterial study of Francois Rabelais. From the
   intellectual cross-fertilization of these apparently unrelated events
   this paper suggests Febvre inaugurates a political moment for European
   border studies, with important resonances for our day. This moment,
   derived from Febvre's analysis of the Rhine as a vast, integrating force
   in the modern period and his reading of Rabelais's own stubbornly
   persistent religiosity, suggests a method for border studies that takes
   into account the temporal specificity of borders in European history and
   trains attention on the everyday `mentalities' of those inhabiting lived
   borders, while foregrounding the problem of the Other as central to any
   proper understanding of the spatiality of borders. In thus posing the
   border as a geohistorical histoire-probleme, Febvre reinjects the notion
   of possibility into border studies and makes of border space a properly
   political object of re-worlding. The paper then reviews a selection of
   canonical texts in border studies dating from the mid to late 1990s and
   invites a dialogue with the smiling figure of Rabelais.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by aching of
   the proximal muscles and increased blood levels of markers of
   inflammation. Despite the muscle complaints, the current view is that
   symptoms are caused by inflammation in synovial structures. The purpose
   of this study was to elucidate the disease mechanisms in symptomatic
   muscles by measuring interstitial levels of cytokines before and after
   prednisolone treatment.
   Methods. Twenty glucocorticoid-naive patients newly diagnosed as having
   PMR and 20 control subjects were studied before and after 14 days of
   prednisolone therapy (20 mg/day). Interstitial concentrations of
   interleukin-1 alpha/beta (IL-1 alpha/beta), IL-1 receptor antagonist,
   IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and monocyte
   chemoattractant protein 1 were measured in symptomatic vastus lateralis
   and trapezius muscles using the microdialysis technique. Plasma levels
   were measured simultaneously.
   Results. Prednisolone abolished symptoms in all of the PMR patients
   within 1-2 days; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive
   protein levels were normalized on day 14. In both muscles, interstitial
   concentrations of all cytokines were markedly higher (P < 0.05) in the
   PMR patients than in the controls before treatment. In both patients and
   controls, interstitial levels of most cytokines were higher than plasma
   levels, with the exception of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha, which were lower
   in both groups. In the PMR patients, interstitial concentrations were
   normalized after prednisolone treatment.
   Conclusion. This study introduces a novel view of PMR, indicating that
   increased interstitial levels of inflammatory cytokines in symptomatic
   muscles play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease and that
   cytokines may be released locally. To explore the disease specificity,
   similar studies in other primary inflammatory conditions are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The developed approach for nondestructive diagnosis of solid objects is
   described in this article. This is accomplished by means of software
   analysis of oscillatory spectra (possibly acoustic emissions,) which is
   formed while running the monitored device or in unexpected situations.
   The principle of this method is based on the analysis of spectrum from
   received signal, its subsequent processing in MatLab and following
   sample comparison in Statistica program. The last step (comparison of
   samples) is the most important because it enables determination with
   some certainty the actual condition of the examined object. The
   processed samples are currently compared only visually. On the other
   hand, in applying this approach they are subject to the analysis with
   the assistance of neural network (Statistica program). If correct and
   high-quality input data are provided to initial network, it is capable
   of analyzing other samples and identifying the actual condition of
   certain object with success rate of around 70\% (minimum 70\%). The
   instructed neural network is then able to determine whether any critical
   condition occurred (e.g. escape of gas from burst pipe, loosened screws
   in critical places, etc.). Data from accelerometer (microphone) are
   evaluated with the assistance of MatLab program and a special newly
   defined filter is implemented. This filter ensures extraction of
   relevant data. Analogue signal is digitized with the help of special NI
   I/O module PCI 6221. The correlation of the spectrum and the condition
   of examined material (its internal defects) are obvious after
   implementation of FFT. Finally, it is possible to detect defects or
   upcoming hazardous conditions of examined object/material by using only
   one device which contains HW and SW parts. This kind of detection can
   lead to significant financial savings in certain cases (such as
   continuous casting of iron, which saves hundred of thousands of USD).}},

Abstract = {{Force-bearing linkages between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix
   are clearly important to normal cell viability as is evident in a
   disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which arises in the
   absence of the linkage protein dystrophin. Therapeutic approaches to DMD
   include antisense-mediated skipping of exons to delete nonsense
   mutations while maintaining reading frame, but the structure and
   stability of the resulting proteins are generally unclear. Here we use
   mass spectrometry to detect most dystrophin exons, and we express and
   physically characterize dystrophin ``nano{''}-constructs based on
   multiexon deletions that might find use in a large percentage of DMD
   patients. The primary structure challenge is addressed first with liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which can detect
   tryptic peptides from 53 of dystrophin's 79 exons; equivalent
   information from immunodetection would require 53 different
   high-specificity antibodies. Folding predictions for the nano-constructs
   reveal novel helical bundle domains that arise out of exon-deleted
   ``linkers,{''} while secondary structure studies confirm high helicity
   and also melting temperatures well above physiological. Extensional
   forces with an atomic force microscope nonetheless unfold the
   constructs, and the ensemble of unfolding trajectories reveal the number
   of folded domains, proving consistent with structure predictions. A
   mechanical cooperativity parameter for unfolding of tandem domains is
   also introduced as the best predictor of a multiexon deletion that is
   asymptomatic in humans. The results thereby provide insight and
   confidence in exon-skipped designs. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Ku superfamily are DNA-end-binding proteins involved in
   non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. The published crystal
   structure of human Ku-DNA complex reveals a heterodimer that forms a
   ring around dsDNA by means of the Ku core modules. These modules contain
   a highly conserved seven-stranded beta-barrel, which in turn contains an
   insertion, termed the bridge-region, between its second and third
   beta-strands. The bridge-region adopts an unusual beta-strand-rich
   structure critical for dsDNA-binding and Ku function, but its provenance
   remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the bridge-region of Ku is a
   novel member of the diverse Zn-ribbon fold group. Sequence analysis
   reveals that Ku from several Gram-positive bacteria and bacteriophages
   retain metal-chelating motifs, whereas they have been lost in the
   versions from most other organisms. Structural comparisons suggest that
   the Zn-ribbon from Ku-bridge-region is the first example of a circularly
   permuted, segment-swapped Zn-ribbon. This finding helps explain how Ku
   is likely to bind DNA as an obligate dimer. Further, we hypothesize that
   retention of the unusual conformation of the turns of the Zn-ribbons,
   despite loss of the Zn-binding sites, provides clues regarding the
   mechanism by which the Ku-bridge-regions sense the DNA state. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim was to test sampling and explore sample characteristics in
   a pilot study using a case management intervention for older people with
   functional dependency and repeated contact with the healthcare services
   as well as to investigate the effects of the intervention on perceived
   health and depressed mood after 3 months. The aim was also to explore
   internal consistency in the life satisfaction index Z, activities of
   daily living-staircase and Geriatric Depression Scale-20.
   Method: This pilot study was carried out in a randomised controlled
   design with repeated follow-ups. In all, 46 people were consecutively
   and randomly assigned to either an intervention (n = 23) or a control (n
   = 23) group. Two nurses worked as case managers and carried out the
   intervention, which consisted of four parts.
   Result: No differences were found between the groups at baseline. The
   results showed the participants had low life satisfaction (median 14 vs.
   12), several health complaints median 11) and a high score on the
   Geriatric Depression Scale (median 6) at baseline, indicating the risk
   of depression. No significant effects were observed regarding depressed
   mood or perceived health between or within groups at follow-up after 3
   months. Cronbach's alpha showed satisfactory internal consistency for
   group comparisons.
   Conclusions: The sampling procedure led to similar groups. The life
   satisfaction, functional dependency and symptoms of depression measures
   were reliable to use. No changes in perceived health and symptoms of
   depression were found after 3 months, indicating that it may be too
   early to expect effects. The low depression score is noteworthy and
   requires further research.}},

Abstract = {{The Valhall field is an overpressured, undersaturated Upper Cretaceous
   chalk reservoir located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The
   reservoirs consist of weak chalk. The weak chalk results in significant
   reservoir compaction, exceeding 10 m in places, and corresponding
   seafloor subsidence, exceeding 6 m above the center of the field.
   Previous papers have documented the increasing drilling challenges in
   the shale overburden at Valhall because of the subsidence. This paper
   presents the computational-geomechanics technology developed and
   implemented to assist drilling into the highly depleted and compacted
   crest from the new water-injection platform at Valhall. The work focuses
   on handling the stress changes occurring in the overburden above a
   compacting reservoir and not the more traditional situation associated
   with depletion-induced fracture-gradient changes in the reservoir
   itself. The technology is based on a history-matched full-field
   finite-element-based geomechanics model to calculate stresses, strains,
   and displacements. The results are exported from the finite-element
   model (FEM) to a geological modeling software to perform
   wellbore-stability calculations using BP best practices for prediction
   of wellbore stability. In this environment, one can also easily use as
   supporting data 4D seismic from the permanent life-of-field seismic
   array at Valhall. By calculating the operational mud-weight window over
   a high risk interval in the overburden, a good correlation to historical
   nonproductive time (NPT) was found. The methodology is used in detailed
   well planning where moving the well 50 m in one direction is the
   difference between problem-free drilling or huge drilling challenges.
   The paper presents the first application of this technology on a new
   water injector delivered 60 days ahead of schedule with reduced costs of
   approximately USD 20 million and with avoidance of a potential ``train
   wreck{''} that could have cost USD 60 million.}},

Abstract = {{P>During vertebrate embryogenesis, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) arise
   in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region. In the present study, we
   examined serial sections of 22-34 days post-insemination (dpi) bovine
   embryos, a species with a well-developed and functional mesonephros. We
   describe the temporo-spatial distribution of presumptive c-kit positive
   HSC and the occurrence of haematopoietic foci in the mesonephros and
   fetal liver using specific antibodies directed against haematopoietic
   cell markers and conventional electron microscopy. In the mesonephros,
   presumptive HSC were found at 23-24 dpi in the blood stream, in the
   endothelial lining of the filtering capillaries and in the septal stroma
   of the cranial part of the mesonephros, the mesonephric giant corpuscle
   (MGC), suggesting a colonalization via the blood stream from the
   haematopoietic clusters of the dorsal aorta. From 25 to 30 dpi,
   presumptive HSC predominate in the septal stroma of the MGC, were they
   first expand but then decline and disappear following 32 dpi. In
   parallel, we found ongoing erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis starting in
   the MGC at 24 dpi and extending during the complete observation period.
   In the embryonic liver, colonization with presumptive c-kit positive HSC
   occurs slightly later, at 25 dpi. Active formation of blood cells in the
   liver increases following 30 dpi. In conclusion, the mesonephros of
   bovine embryos, in particular its MGC, functions as a primitive
   haematopoietic organ, temporarily intercalated between extraembryonic
   erythropoiesis and haematopoiesis within in the fetal liver, thus
   recapitulating for a short period a phylogenetically old site of blood
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays an important role
   in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) by stimulating
   processes of angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell survival and
   metastases formation. Herein, we evaluate the significance of upstream
   proteins directly regulating the HIF pathway; the prolyl hydroxylases
   domain proteins (PHD)1, 2 and 3 and factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), as
   prognostic markers for ccRCC.
   Methods: Immunohistochemical marker expression was examined on a tissue
   microarray containing tumour tissue derived from 100 patients who
   underwent nephrectomy for ccRCC. Expression levels of HIF, FIH and PHD1,
   2 and 3 were correlated with overall survival (OS) and
   clinicopathological prognostic factors.
   Results: HIF-1 alpha was positively correlated with HIF-2 alpha (p <
   0.0001), PHD1 (p = 0.024), PHD2 (p < 0.0001), PHD3 (p = 0.004), FIH (p <
   0.0001) and VHL (p = 0.031). HIF-2 alpha levels were significantly
   associated with FIH (p < 0.0001) and PHD2 (p = 0.0155). Mutations in the
   VHL gene, expression variations of HIP-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and PHD1, 2,
   3 did not show a correlation to OS or clinicopathological prognostic
   factors. Tumour stage, grade, diameter, metastastic disease and
   intensity of nuclear FIH were significantly correlated to OS in
   univariable analysis (p = 0.023). Low nuclear FIH levels remained a
   strong independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis (p =
   0.009).
   Conclusion: These results show that low nuclear expression of FIH is a
   strong independent prognostic factor for a poor overall survival in
   ccRCC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, statistical and case study research has increasingly
   reached conflicting findings in terms of the factors explaining
   cross-national variations in the percentage of women elected to national

   medium-n technique, to study two populations of cases, Western and
   sub-Saharan African countries. In contrast to work predicated on
   assumptions of causal homogeneity and causal competition, the study
   reveals that multiple combinations of conditions lead to higher and
   lower levels of female representation. This finding corroborates the two
   guiding principles of QCA, causal combination and equifinality,
   suggesting that these methods may offer greater leverage than
   traditional techniques in discerning the various factors facilitating
   and hindering women's access to political office.}},

   FlexDx a reconfigurable diagnosis framework which reduces the

   running a subset of all tests that is sufficient to find new conflicts
   Tests in FlexDx are thresholded residuals used to indicate conflicts in
   the monitored system Special attention is given to the issues introduced
   by a reconfigurable diagnosis framework For example tests are added and
   removed dynamically tests are partially performed on historic data and
   synchronous and asynchronous processing are combined To handle these
   issues FlexDx has been implemented using DyKnow a stream-based knowledge
   processing middleware framework Concrete methods for each component in
   the FlexDx framework are presented The complete approach is exemplified
   on a dynamic system which clearly illustrates the complexity of the

Abstract = {{We obtained a self-similar solution of the problem of the isentropic
   compression of a gas by a wave. Initially, gas is supposed to be uniform
   and motionless. We used Lagrange variables; we transformed the problem
   to a form that allowed us to get the solution of the problem in a
   unified manner both in the cylindrical and spherical cases. So we
   unified the results of Zabadakhin and Simonenko (1978 Prikl. Mat. Mekh.
   42 573-6) and Stanyukovich (1971 Nonstationary Motion of Continuous
   Medium (Moscow: Nauka)). We derived a set of equations describing the
   evolution of small perturbations of the thin shell without inner
   structure when its acceleration depends on time. The mass of the shell
   considered is supposed to be much greater than the mass of the gas
   surrounding the shell. We considered the cases of plane, cylindrical and
   spherical shells. We considered the stability of shell motion, providing
   isentropic gas compression with respect to small perturbations given in
   the form of plane waves and angular harmonics. We showed that the growth
   of the amplitude of perturbation of the shell given in the form of plane
   waves is bounded both in plane and cylindrical geometry. We calculated
   the limit of such perturbations' growth. We also showed that there was
   no limit for the growth of angular harmonic-type perturbations, both in
   cylindrical and spherical geometries. The increment of growth for those
   perturbations was calculated.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Subterranean termites construct complicated tunnel networks for foraging
   below ground. Thus, they often encounter tunnel intersections during
   foraging activity. Directional selection by termites at intersections is
   likely to affect foraging efficiency because depending on their
   selection, the path length from food resources to the nest can vary
   significantly. In order to understand how termites are guided to choose
   the most economical path without the use of pheromones, we artificially
   excavated two tunnels of varying widths (W-1 and W-2; 2, 3, or 4 mm)
   that intersected at a 90 degrees angle in each of nine soil-filled
   arenas. We observed the directional selection of termites at
   intersections in arenas with combinations of W-1 (mm) and W-2 (mm) (W-1,
   W-2). For (W-1, W-2) = (2, 2) and (4, 4), termites statistically equally
   chose the three directions left, right, and straight, while for the (3,
   3) arena combination, termites preferentially decided to go straight. On
   the other hand, for (W-1, W-2) = (2, 3) (2, 4), and (3, 4), termites
   advancing from narrower tunnels into intersections tended to turn right
   or left, while termites coming from the wider tunnel were more inclined
   to go straight. On the assumption that a wider tunnel is more frequently
   used by termites in the field, we can deduce that the wider tunnel may
   represent the most efficient/shortest path. Thus, this simple selection
   mechanism can prevent termites from deviating from the most economical
   path.}},

Abstract = {{Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary disorder of mucociliary
   clearance causing chronic upper and lower airways disease. We determined
   the number of patients with diagnosed PCD across Europe, described age
   at diagnosis and determined risk factors for late diagnosis.
   Centres treating children with PCD in Europe answered questionnaires and
   provided anonymous patient lists.
   In total, 223 centres from 26 countries reported 1,009 patients aged <20
   yrs. Reported cases per million children (for 5-14 yr olds) were highest
   in Cyprus (111), Switzerland (47) and Denmark (46). Overall, 57\% were
   males and 48\% had situs inversus. Median age at diagnosis was 5.3 yrs,
   lower in children with situs inversus (3.5 versus 5.8 yrs; p<0.001) and
   in children treated in large centres (4.1 versus 4.8 yrs; p=0.002).
   Adjusted age at diagnosis was 5.0 yrs in Western Europe, 4.8 yrs in the
   British Isles, 5.5 yrs in Northern Europe, 6.8 yrs in Eastern Europe and
   6.5 yrs in Southern Europe (p<0.001).
   This strongly correlated with general government expenditures on health
   (p<0.001). This European survey suggests that PCD in children is
   under-diagnosed and diagnosed late, particularly in countries with low
   health expenditures. Prospective studies should assess the impact this
   delay might have on patient prognosis and on health economic costs
   across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a view of vulnerability attempting to capture a
   constitutive dimension of most disasters, that is their radically
   surprising moment. Therefore, it builds a conceptual framework, which
   captures the moment of surprise itself, as well as, its consequences for
   people by developing a dynamic and actor-oriented understanding of
   vulnerability. It begins with an outline about how to observe and
   explain vulnerability by offering a brief overview of how the discussion
   on vulnerability has evolved over the last 30 years or so. In a second
   step, the interrelation of knowledge, ignorance and vulnerability is
   specified. Therefore, a basic understanding of surprises is developed,
   which is then further distinguished in everyday surprises and `radical
   surprises'. The theoretical argument is substantiated by a case study on
   a city in Germany, which was severely affected by the 2002 August flood.
   The paper concludes with some more general implications for the
   discussion on the interrelation of local knowledge, the dynamics of
   vulnerability and the occurrence of `radical surprises'.}},

Abstract = {{There are a number of technical, economic, and business drivers that
   impact the selection of the right fiber to the home (FTTH) technology
   for an operator to deploy. We focus on an optimized total cost of

   for greenfield and brownfield deployment for both incumbent telcos and
   cable operators. In a network model with a large number of parameters it
   is often challenging to identify the key parameters that are critical to
   the decision making. An operator runs the risk of choosing a less than
   optimum technology strategy if any of these key parameters are not
   identified and cost optimized. We present the results obtained by
   network modeling the capital investments and operations expenses for
   some typical operator scenarios covering Gigabit passive optical network
   (GPON) and point-to-point/active Ethernet technologies. Our analysis
   specifically accounts for scenarios with government un-bundling

Abstract = {{Here in, we are reporting a new membrane modified electrode based on
   ferrocene (fc) mixed Nafion (Nf) system for enzyme-less and selective
   electrochemical sensing of catechol and dopamine without any
   interference from cysteine, uric acid, hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic
   acid at an applied potential of 200 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in pH 7 phosphate
   buffer solution. The working electrode, ferrocene-bound Nafion membrane
   modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/\{Nf-fc\}-MME) was prepared by
   manual mixing of 10 mg of ferrocene with 2\% of Nafion solution
   (optimal) followed by drop coating on the GCE surface, and
   electrochemical pretreatment by continuous potential cycling in pH 7
   PBS. The modified electrode showed well-defined redox behavior at an
   equilibrium potential (E-1/2) of 150 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in pH 7 PBS due to
   the electron-transfer reaction of fclfc(+) redox. The calculated
   exchange current density (I degrees) and apparent heterogeneous rate
   constant (k(h)(aPP)) were 6.16 x 10(-5) A and 4.51 x 10(-3) cm s(-1)
   respectively for catechol by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   which were about 100 times higher over the unmodified electrodes.
   Different domains of Nafion, namely hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites
   have a specific role to immobilize the ferrocene species and in turn to
   selectively mediate catechol and dopamine in a solution mixture
   containing common physiological interferents. Calibration plots were in
   the range of 250 mu M-2.5 mM and 250 mu M-5 mM for catechol and
   dopamine, respectively, with the corresponding detection limit (SIN = 3)
   values 10.8 mu M and 22.7 mu M. The current sensitivity was 1.1 mu A
   mM(-1) for both the compounds. The working electrode showed negligible
   variation in the detection current up to 2 days of measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Mating systems are generally thought to be important factors in
   determining the amount and nature of genetic variability in a
   population. Nearly 1,000 individuals at a single location (Lucknow) and
   over two years were crossed and subsequently scored for selfing versus
   outcrossing in 9-10 monohybrid populations of opium poppy (Papaver
   somniferum). Three different alleles of two marker loci (two-R/r and
   P/p-for anthocyanin locus and B/b for capsule size locus) were used to
   determine the male gametes that had effected fertilizations in F(2)
   recessives (rr, pp and bb). The estimates of the gene frequency-based
   outcrossing parameter (alpha) were found to vary with year, cross and
   marker locus used (alpha range: 7.21-71.03\%). Study of the two dihybrid
   crosses concerning the two marker loci simultaneously, further confirmed

Abstract = {{The genetic of heterosis in okra were elucidated in this study. The
   parent genotypes Punjab Padmini was found as good general combiner
   followed by Parbhani Kranti and Arka Anamika. Based on overall specific
   combining ability, the cross combinations viz., Parbhani Kranti x Punjab
   Padmini, MDU 1 x Mohanur Local and Arka Anamika x Mohanur Local were
   identified as good specific combiners. Standard heterosis upto a tune of
   86.80\% was recorded by the cross Punjab Padmini x Parbhani Kranti for
   fruit yield/plant. Most of the crosses which portrayed high standard
   heterosis, high per se and sca effects had both the parents with high
   gca effects or atleast one of the parents with high gca effects. The
   regression line of the V(r), W(r) graph indicated the existence of
   complete dominance for trait like fruit yield per plant. It was found
   that combining ability is important for heterosis and not the gene
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - The use of alteplase in patients who have had a prior stroke
   and concomitant diabetes is not approved in Europe To examine the
   influence of diabetes and prior stroke on outcomes we compared data on
   thrombolysed patients with nonthrombolysed comparators
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We selected patients with ischemic stroke
   on whom we had data on age pretreatment baseline National Institutes of
   Health Stroke Scale (b-NIHSS) and 90-day outcome measures (functional
   modified Rankin score {[}mRS]) and neurological measures {[}NIHSS]) in
   the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive We compared outcomes
   between thrombolysed patients and nonthrombolysed comparators in those
   with and without diabetes those who have had a prior stroke or both and
   report findings using the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and
   proportional odds logistic regression analyses We report an age adjusted
   and b NIHSS adjusted CMH P value and odds ratio (OR)
   RESULTS - Rankin data were available for 5 817 patients 1 585
   thrombolysed patients and 4 232 nonthrombolysed comparators A total 1
   334 (24 1\%) patients had diabetes 1 898 (33 7\%) patients have had a
   prior stroke and 491 (8\%) patients had both Diabetes and non-diabetes
   had equal b-NIHSS (median 13 P = 0 3) but patients who have had a prior
   stroke had higher b-NIHSS than patients who have not had a prior stroke
   (median 13 vs 12 P < 0 0001) Functional outcomes were better for
   thrombolysed patients versus nonthrombolysed comparators among both
   nondiabetic (P < 0 0001 OR 1 4 vertical bar 95\% CI 1 3-1 6]) and
   diabetic (P = 0 1 1 3 {[}1 05-1 6 ]) subjects Similarly outcomes were
   better for thrombolysed patients versus nonthrombolysed comparators
   among who have not had a prior stroke (P < 0 0001 1 4 {[}1 2-1 6]) and
   those who have (P = 002 1 3 {[}1 04-1 6]) There was no interaction of
   diabetes and prior stroke with treatment (P = 0 8) Neurological outcomes
   were consistent with the mRS
   CONCLUSIONS - Outcomes from thrombolysis are better among patients with
   diabetes and/or those who have had a prior stroke than in control
   subjects Withholding thrombolytic treatment from otherwise eligible
   patients may not be justified}},

Abstract = {{In the present study poly(2.2-(2,6-pyridin)-5.5-bibenzimidazole) was
   used for the preparation of novel MEAs for high-temperature polymer fuel
   cells (HT-PEMFCs). We prepared hybrid materials with two types of silica
   fillers in order to increase the MEA performances using this polymer.
   The membranes were characterized in terms of their microstructure and
   thermal stability. Cell operation tests and Electrochemical Impedance
   Spectroscopy were used for the characterization of the MEAs. A maximum
   power density of about 80 mW cm(-2) was obtained at 300 mA cm(-2) by
   using an imidazole-modified silica filler. The EIS technique showed that
   the fillers chiefly help to reduce the charge transfer resistance of the
   cathodic side. The gas transfer resistance may be neglected with respect
   to R-ct at least at low current densities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We have developed a metal-free and highly diastereoselective
   ammonium-directed dihydroxyl ation of 3-ammocyclohex-1-enes upon
   treatment with Cl3CCO2H followed by mCPBA. The reaction mechanism
   involves protection of the amine by protonahon hydrogen-bonded delivery
   of the oxidant by the allylic ammonium ion formed in situ followed by
   highly regioselective ring-opening of the intermediate syn-epoxide by
   trichloroacetic acid to give a 1 2-anti-2 3-syn amino diol alter
   deprotection Meanwhile oxidation of the corresponding tertiary amine
   N-oxide is entirely complementary and proceeds with high
   anti-diastereoselectivity to afford the corresponding 1 2-anti-2 3-anti
   amino diol after deprotection consistent with the epoxidahon reaction
   proceeding under steric or dipole control The ammonium-directed
   oxidation protocol is general for a range of cyclic allylic and
   homoallylic amines and facilitates the metal-free synthesis of all four
   diastereoisomers of the corresponding 3-amino-1 2-diols and has recently
   been employed as one of the key steps in the syntheses of

   examined. The chemical composition of the major extractive fraction, the
   n-C(6)H(14) extract, was evaluated and its antifungal properties were
   identified. Twelve diterpenoids including ten abietane-type components
   were isolated from the n-C(6)H(14) extract: 6,7-dehydroferruginol (1),
   ferruginol (2), 6,7-dehydroroyleanone (3), sandaracopimaric acid (4),
   taxodione (5), taxodal (6), taxodone (7), sugiol (8), xanthoperol (9),
   salvinolone (10), 5,6-dehydrosugiol (11), and 14-deoxycoleon U (12).
   Compounds 5 and 12 were highly active against both wood-decay fungi. In
   particular, the activities of these compounds against E palustris were
   potent. The results suggest that the position and the number of hydroxyl
   groups on abietane-type structures may be related to antifungal
   activities against T versicolor and E palustris.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we summarize the long-term effects of A-bomb radiation on
   the T-cell system and discuss the possible involvement of attenuated
   T-cell immunity in the disease development observed in A-bomb survivors.
   Our previous observations on such effects include impaired
   mitogen-dependent proliferation and IL-2 production, decreases in naive
   T-cell populations, and increased proportions of anergic and
   functionally weak memory CD4 T-cell subsets. In addition, we recently
   found a radiation dose-dependent increase in the percentages of
   CD25(+)/CD127(-) regulatory T cells in the CD4 T-cell population of the
   survivors. All these effects of radiation on T-cell immunity resemble
   effects of aging on the immune system, suggesting that ionizing
   radiation might direct the T-cell system toward a compromised phenotype
   and thereby might contribute to an enhanced immunosenescence.
   Furthermore, there are inverse, significant associations between plasma
   levels of inflammatory cytokines and the relative number of nave CD4 T
   cells, also suggesting that the elevated levels of inflammatory markers
   found in A-bomb survivors can be ascribed in part to T-cell
   immunosenescence. We suggest that radiation-induced T-cell
   immunosenescence may result in activation of inflammatory responses and
   may be partly involved in the development of aging-associated and
   inflammation-related diseases frequently observed in A-bomb survivors.

Abstract = {{Five decades ago, a novel mode of CO2 assimilation that was later
   described as C-4-photosynthesis was discovered on mature leaves of maize
   (Zea mays L.) plants. Here we show that 3- to 5-day-old developing maize
   leaves recapitulate the evolutionary advance from the ancient,
   inefficient C-3 mode of photosynthesis to the C-4 pathway, a mechanism
   for overcoming the wasteful process of photorespiration. Chlorophyll
   fluorescence measurements documented that photorespiration was high in
   3-day-old juvenile primary leaves with non-specialized C-3-like leaf
   anatomy and low in 5-day-old organs with the typical ``Kranz-anatomy{''}
   of C-4 leaves. Photosynthetic gas (CO2)-exchange measurements on
   5-day-old leaves revealed the characteristic features of C-4
   photosynthesis, with a CO2 compensation point close to zero and little
   inhibition of photosynthesis by the normal oxygen concentration in the
   air. This indicates a very low photorespiratory activity in contrast to
   control experiments conducted with mature C-3 sunflower (Helianthus
   annuus L.) leaves, which display a high rate of photorespiration.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggested that dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-driven
   alteration in the autocrine and paracrine factors may be a key to
   androgen-potentiated balding. Also, we recently claimed that
   DHT-inducible dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is one of the key factors involved in
   the androgen-potentiated balding. Here, we investigated whether
   l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Asc 2-P), a derivative of L-ascorbic acid,
   could attenuate DHT-induced DKK-1 expression in dermal papilla cells
   (DPCs) from balding scalp. We observed that DHT-induced DKK-1 mRNA
   expression was attenuated in the presence of Asc 2-P as examined by
   RT-PCR analysis. In addition, we found that DHT-induced activation of
   luciferase reporter activity was significantly repressed when Asc 2-P
   was added together with DHT. Moreover, Asc 2-P repressed DHT-induced
   DKK-1 protein expression as examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA). Although there will be many hurdles to apply our finding
   to actual remedies, these results suggest that it would be worthy to
   evaluate Asc 2-P or its derivatives for the treatment and prevention of
   androgen-driven balding.}},

Abstract = {{Bronchiectasis is one of the common chronic respiratory diseases and
   associated with respiratory morbidity and mortality. However, neither
   its prevalence nor its etiology is well-defined. We aimed to estimate
   the prevalence and risk factors of bronchiectasis in adults. In a
   retrospective study, we analyzed radiologic findings on chest computed
   tomography (CT) images performed as part of a health-screening program.
   From January to December 2008, 1,409 (24.6\%) of 5,727 participants in
   the screening program of a health promotion center at a university
   hospital underwent chest CT scans based on the subject's decision.
   Bronchiectasis was diagnosed, if there was abnormal bronchial dilatation
   in any area of both lungs on chest CT. Respiratory symptoms, smoking
   status, and past medical history were also analyzed to define clinical
   characteristics and risk factors of bronchiectasis. Of 1,409 patients
   (aged 23-86 years), who were screened for respiratory diseases using
   chest CT for one year in a health promotion center, 129 patients (9.1\%)
   were diagnosed with bronchiectasis. The prevalence of bronchiectasis was
   higher in females than in males (11.5\% vs. 7.9\%, p = 0.022) and
   increased with age. Respiratory symptoms were reported in 53.7\% of
   subjects. Previous history of tuberculosis (TB) (OR 4.61, 95\% Cl
   2.39-8.88, p = 0.001) and age (OR 2.49, 95\% Cl 1.56-3.98, p = 0.001)
   were significantly associated with bronchiectasis. This retrospective
   analysis of chest CT findings in health screening examinees revealed a
   very high prevalence of bronchiectasis in adults. Previous TB infection
   is one of the major causes of bronchiectasis.}},

   2010. First published September 22, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00679.2010. In
   rhythmic neural circuits, a neuron often fires action potentials with a
   constant phase to the rhythm, a timing relationship that can be
   functionally significant. To characterize these phase preferences in a
   large-scale, cell type-specific manner, we adapted multitaper coherence
   analysis for two-photon calcium imaging. Analysis of simulated data
   showed that coherence is a simple and robust measure of rhythmicity for
   calcium imaging data. When applied to the neonatal mouse hindlimb spinal
   locomotor network, the phase relationships between peak activity of
   >1,000 ventral spinal interneurons and motor output were characterized.
   Most interneurons showed rhythmic activity that was coherent and in
   phase with the ipsilateral motor output during fictive locomotion. The
   phase distributions of two genetically identified classes of
   interneurons were distinct from the ensemble population and from each
   other. There was no obvious spatial clustering of interneurons with
   similar phase preferences. Together, these results suggest that cell
   type, not neighboring neuron activity, is a better indicator of an
   interneuron's response during fictive locomotion. The ability to measure
   the phase preferences of many neurons with cell type and spatial
   information should be widely applicable for studying other rhythmic
   neural circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean ranges from thin new ice to thick deformed
   ridges. Changes in thickness are due to melting and freezing, and to
   physical rearrangement of existing ice to form leads and pressure
   ridges. As a brittle solid, fractures are created when the ice cover
   moves and deforms. Openings along fractures are sites of local heat
   exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, and of local ice production
   in the winter as ocean water freezes when exposed to the colder
   atmosphere. Closing of the ice forces it to raft or pile up into
   pressure ridges and to be forced down into keels, increasing the volume
   of sea ice that can be stored within a given area of the Arctic Ocean.
   This mechanical redistribution of sea ice affects ice strength and has a
   profound impact on ice behavior over a wide range of temporal and
   spatial scales. Accurate observation and simulation of the relative
   contributions of thermodynamics and dynamics to ice thickness
   distribution are thus critical for understanding the ice cover in terms
   of how it changes, and its vulnerability in a warming climate. Recent
   satellite altimetry and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imaging
   have provided near-basin-scale views of ice thickness and motion for use
   in quantifying changes, and for assessment and refinerneut of models.
   During this coming decade, several satellite missions are poised to
   provide improved, coordinated, and near-continuous measurements of
   thickness and motion that will advance our understanding of Arctic ice
   cover. Here, we provide an overview of our current capabilities and the
   future prospects for observing these parameters from space.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the effects of temperature on spatial and

   present in situ measurements of CO2-C emissions and assess their
   relation with soil temperature, using dynamic chambers. We found an
   exponential relation between CO2 emissions and soil temperature, with
   the value of Q(10) being close to 2.1. Mean emission rates were as low
   as 0.026 and 0.072 g of CO2-Cm-2 h(-1) for bare soil and soil covered
   with moss, respectively, and as high as 0.162 g of CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) for
   soil covered with grass, Deschampsia antarctica Desv. ( Poaceae). A
   spatial variability analysis conducted using a 60-point grid, for an

Abstract = {{Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility of percutaneous
   endovascular treatment of infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
   using the novel low profile modular Tripelay system (Tripelay, France).
   Background: Endovascular aortic aneurysm treatment (EVAR) has become
   more widely used as early mortality has been significantly reduced.
   Also, percutaneous access has become possible with the introduction of
   vascular closure devices and with the initial reduction in size of
   delivery catheters. However, percutaneous access is not commonly used
   and anatomical considerations, such as access vessel size and
   tortuousities, preclude a number of patients from being efficiently
   treated with EVAR. Methods: The novel Tripelay system enables two
   semicircular preshaped self-expandable stentgrafts to be positioned side
   by side on the aneurysm neck extending into the iliac arteries. Each
   stentgraft being smaller than the target vessel diameter, the delivery
   catheter is reduced in size (14F) and accommodates with smaller and more
   tortuous access vessels than conventional devices. This device was used
   to treat a 57-year-old male patient with significant comorbidities
   (previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and abdominal
   surgeries, smoking, hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia). Percutaneous
   access was made on both femoral arteries. The device was inserted,
   positioned, and deployed as planned. Iliac extensions were used
   bilaterally. Results: The EVAR procedure was performed successfully, and
   the patient was discharged on day 6. Follow-up computed tomography scans
   at 1, 6, and 12 months revealed perfect exclusion of the aneurysm sac,
   patent stentgraft, and vessels, and no prosthesis migration, endoleaks
   or stent fracture were observed. The patient remained asymptomatic and
   reported no adverse events during that period. Conclusion: The Tripelay
   system seemed as an effective and user friendly tool for treatment of
   AAAs. Of course, this procedure still needs further clinical evaluation
   with more cases and longer follow-up to confirm long-term efficacy and
   safety of this device. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic model analysis has been proposed to assess absorbed dose to an
   arbitrary tissue in {[}F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose ({[}F-18]-FDG) positron
   emission tomography (PET) imaging, whose efficiency is demonstrated in
   physiological brain, by comparing calculated estimates with human
   literature data. First, an analytic solution for the tissue {[}F-18]-FDG
   time-activity curve has been derived from kinetic model analysis,
   assuming reversible radiotracer trapping. Then, integrating this
   solution from the time of tracer administration to infinity yielded
   analytic solutions for cumulated activity (and hence for the ratio of
   cumulated/injected activity) and the percentage of tracer uptake for an
   arbitrary tissue. Calculated estimates from these analytic solutions for
   the whole gray and white matter have been found in very good agreement
   with human literature data: 7.55 versus 6.57 (+/- 1.51) MBq.hour (per
   unit of administered activity of 37 MBq), 0.204 versus 0.220 (+/- 0.090)
   hour, and 6.25\% versus 6.90\%, respectively. This study concludes that
   the proposed kinetic model analysis has proven effective in assessing
   absorbed dose to human brain in {[}F-18]-FDG PET imaging, under
   physiological conditions. This study suggests that this model could be
   further developed to assess absorbed dose to other tissues, either
   healthy or pathological, and also it could be further considered by
   involving other PET tracer features.}},

Abstract = {{Context.-Melanoma growing as a tumorigenic nodule is one of the most
   virulent neoplasms to which the flesh is heir. At a considerably small
   tumor size, it incurs significant risk for widespread metastatic
   dissemination. There are no effective means of surgical intervention,
   chemical therapy, or immunologic therapy for advanced and metastatic
   melanoma.
   Objective.-To review the literature and highlight recent cardinal
   advances in the understanding of melanoma vertical growth, with specific
   emphasis on how its recognition and characterization may be applied to
   diagnostic practice and development of novel investigative approaches.
   Data Sources.-Literature review, archival material, personal experience,
   and research collaborators.
   Conclusions.-The study of tumorigenic melanoma, both in primary lesions
   and in metastases, is the key to the eventual eradication of this highly
   virulent neoplasm that may disseminate widely when only occupying the
   volume of a grain of rice. Morphology often provides the first insight
   into structure and function. A growing database using meticulous and
   inclusive criteria to define tumor stem cells in the context of
   clinically relevant models now indicates that the key to melanoma
   heterogeneity may reside in a small subpopulation with the ability to
   self-renew and form tumors despite most cells present being
   significantly less virulent. Hopefully, from these insights into
   melanoma tumor progression from radial growth phase to heterogeneous and
   tumorigenic vertical growth phase will come additional answers to how
   smart therapies may be developed that specifically target those vertical
   growth phase cells that most pertain to patient survival. (Arch Pathol

Abstract = {{Background: Destruction of the thumb secondary to trauma presents a much
   more significant influence on daily living than do injuries to the other
   digits. Various surgical techniques contribute to repair distal defects
   of the fingers, especially thumb reconstruction.
   Methods: Seven patients received free medial plantar artery perforator
   (MPAP) flaps to resurface the palmar defects of their thumbs. The flaps
   can be harvested with or without the main trunk of the medial plantar
   artery. The perforator of the MPAP flap was anastomosed to a proper
   digital artery, and the superficial vein of the flap was anastomosed to
   the dermal vein of the injured finger. These thumbs had no severe length
   discrepancy or metacarpophalangeal joint injuries. All patients
   underwent examinations including static 2-point discrimination, moving
   2-point discrimination, and Semmes-Weinstein Test Score 6 months after
   reconstructive surgery. All tests were carried out by the same
   occupational therapist 6 months after reconstructive surgery.
   Results: Five male and 2 female patients were selected for free MPAP
   flap reconstruction from May 2006 to September 2007. The mobility of the
   fingers was not restricted after surgery. Six flaps survived completely,
   and 1 flap partially failed because of venous congestion. Sensory
   restoration was ideal for all 7 MPAP flaps.
   Conclusion: The MPAP flap is a suitable choice for reconstructing palmar
   defects of the fingers, with less donor site morbidity. The cushiony
   character of the MPAP flap is anatomically similar to the pulp tissue of
   fingers, and sensory restoration is ideal compared with that of other
   reconstructive methods. Technical difficulty is focused on anastomosis
   of perforators (diameter <= 0.8 mm).}},

Title = {{Mother-child interaction and child developmental capacities in toddlers
   with major birth defects requiring newborn surgery}},
Journal = {{EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{793-800}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evidence exists of the important role of the mother-child
   relationship in child development, yet with the exception of
   prematurity, little is known of the impact of biologic risk on this
   relationship.
   Aims: We investigated the quality of the mother-child interaction in
   association with early development in toddlers who had newborn surgery
   for major birth defects.
   Methods: Ninety-three toddlers (Mean age = 24.7 months, SD = 4.6)
   requiring newborn surgery for major birth defects, underwent
   developmental testing and participated in a videotaped free play
   interaction with their mothers. Interactions were rated using the
   National Institute of Child Health and Human Development schema.
   Interaction ratings were compared with normative data and within group
   differences were also examined in relation to child developmental
   status.
   Results: Overall mean interaction ratings were suboptimal and
   significantly different from normative data; with the exception of child
   negative mood. Forty-one children (44\%) had developmental delay. Mother
   and child interactive behaviour ratings were consolidated into three
   factors (Maternal Responsivity, Maternal Intrusiveness, and Child
   Positive Interactivity) for multivariate analyses. Compared to children
   developing normally, those with developmental delay showed significantly
   less positive interactivity and had mothers who were less responsive and
   more intrusive. Child behaviour with the tester was related to child
   behaviour with the mother.
   Conclusion: Quality of mother-child interaction is nonoptimal in
   children with major birth defects requiring newborn surgery. Mothers of
   infants with developmental delay are most at risk of interaction
   difficulties and may benefit from early identification and timely
   intervention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high
   risk for cardiovascular disease. In these analyses of the ADVANCE trial,
   we assessed the effects of a fixed combination of perindopril-indapamide
   on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes
   according to baseline CKD stage.
   Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to perindopril-indapamide
   (4 mg/1.25 mg) or placebo. Treatment effects on cardiovascular
   (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and renal
   outcomes were compared in subgroups defined by baseline Kidney Disease
   Outcome Quality Initiative CKD stage. Homogeneity in treatment effect
   was tested by adding interaction terms to the relevant Cox models. The
   study included 10 640 participants with known CKD status, of whom 6125
   did not have CKD, 2482 were classified as CKD stage 1 or 2, and 2033 as
   CKD stage >= 3. The relative treatment effects on major cardiovascular
   events were similar across all stages of CKD, with no heterogeneity in
   the magnitude of the effects for any outcome. In contrast, the absolute
   treatment effects approximately doubled in those with CKD stage >= 3
   when compared to those with no CKD. For every 1000 patients with CKD
   stage >= 3 treated for 5 years, active treatment prevented 12
   cardiovascular events when compared with six events per 1000 patients
   with no CKD.
   The treatment benefits of a routine administration of a fixed
   combination of perindopril-indapamide to patients with type 2 diabetes
   on cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and death, are consistent across
   all stages of CKD at baseline. Absolute risk reductions are larger in
   patients with CKD highlighting the importance of blood pressure-lowering
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported a novel affinity purification (AP) method termed
   modified chromatin immunopurification (mChIP), which permits selective
   enrichment of DNA- bound proteins along with their associated protein
   network. In this study, we report a large-scale study of the protein
   network of 102 chromatin-related proteins from budding yeast that were
   analyzed by mChIP coupled to mass spectrometry. This effort resulted in
   the detection of 2966 high confidence protein associations with 724
   distinct preys. mChIP resulted in significantly improved interaction
   coverage as compared with classical AP methodology for similar to 75\%
   of the baits tested. Furthermore, mChIP successfully identified novel
   binding partners for many lower abundance transcription factors that
   previously failed using conventional AP methodologies. mChIP was also
   used to perform targeted studies, particularly of Asf1 and its
   associated proteins, to allow for a understanding of the physical
   interplay between Asf1 and two other histone chaperones, Rtt106 and the

Abstract = {{Context: Although bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is currently regarded
   as the most effective treatment available for the management of
   non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), maintenance BCG is
   underutilised and debate still remains as to whether the routine use of
   maintenance therapy is required for optimal outcomes.
   Objective: To review evidence supporting the need for maintenance BCG
   and provide practical strategies for improving both patient and
   physician compliance with maintenance regimens.
   Evidence acquisition: Data from immunologic studies, animal studies,
   randomised clinical trials, and meta-analyses were reviewed during a
   satellite symposium at the 25th Annual European Association of Urology
   (EAU) Congress, held in Barcelona, Spain, in April 2010.
   Evidence synthesis: Three well-designed, long-term clinical trials and
   various meta-analyses have shown maintenance BCG to be significantly
   superior to intravesical chemotherapy and induction therapy alone in
   reducing recurrence, progression, and mortality in patients with
   intermediate-and high-risk NMIBC. Despite these findings, BCG therapy is
   underutilised. Experts have questioned whether this is solely due to
   BCG-associated adverse events or whether other patient-and
   physician-related factors, such as lack of patient knowledge and
   physician attitudes, may affect utilisation and adherence to BCG
   therapy.
   Conclusions: Recent evidence has addressed controversies surrounding the
   use of maintenance BCG. Maintenance BCG should now be considered the
   ``gold standard{''} therapy for the prophylaxis and management of
   intermediate-and high-risk NMIBC. Although BCG-associated adverse events
   are generally considered to be the primary reason for poor adherence,
   these adverse events can be prevented and successfully managed in most
   patients. Furthermore, other patient-and physician-related factors need
   to be addressed to help promote adherence to maintenance BCG and
   optimise outcomes in patients with NMIBC. (C) 2010 European Association

Abstract = {{Gametogenesis in Calcarea is still poorly known; therefore, in this
   work, we describe the gametogenesis of Paraleucilla magna (Porifera,
   Calcarea) using light and electron microscopy. Male and female gametes
   derived from choanocytes. Oocytes grew inside a follicle-like structure
   composed of pinacocyte-like cells and choanocytes. They were nourished
   through nutrient transfer from nurse cells and through bacteria
   phagocytosis, which was never documented for a calcarean species. Mature
   oocytes were typical, spherical, with nucleolated nuclei and a cytoplasm
   filled with different types of inclusions and digestive vesicles. Nuage
   was also found. Spermatogenesis occurred in the lumen of differentiated
   choanocyte chambers, and spermatic cysts were never formed. Spherical
   spermatogonia without flagellum or collar were derived from
   hourglass-shaped primordial germ cells. Spermatozoa were of the
   `aberrant type', showed a compact electron-dense nucleus and a
   homogeneous granulated body in its cytoplasm. The gametogenesis of P.
   magna is similar to what has been observed for other Porifera and
   Eumetazoa.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new single-lane cellular automaton model for
   traffic flow. The model takes into account normal drivers' spacing
   policies and transportation engineering practices to guarantee that
   microscopic vehicle behavior is more in line with vehicular movement in
   the real world. As a result, drivers' reactions are based on a safety
   analysis that determines the most appropriate action for a vehicle to
   take. Hence, the model introduces a new set of simple rules to change
   the speed of vehicles that incorporates three important thresholds
   required by the follower vehicle to accelerate, slow down or maintain
   its speed. Thus, the space gap, relative speed and limited
   acceleration/deceleration capabilities are introduced into simulations.
   Simulation results obtained from a system with periodic conditions show
   that the model can smooth the speed drop when vehicles approach the
   upstream front of the traffic jam. Therefore, the model avoids
   unrealistic deceleration behavior found in most previous cellular
   automata models. Besides, the model is also capable of reproducing most
   empirical findings including the three states of traffic flow, the
   backward speed of the downstream front of the traffic jam, and different
   congested traffic patterns induced by a system with open boundary
   conditions with an on-ramp. Moreover, the new model preserves the
   computational simplicity of the cellular automata models. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response is a classic model of
   sensorimotor gating. Robust PPI impairments can be induced by dopamine
   agonists such as the indirect agonist amphetamine. The antipsychotic
   clozapine can attenuate PPI impairment induced by dopamine agonists.
   Clozapine is a complex drug with antagonistic effects on a variety of
   receptors, including serotonin and histamine. The relative contribution
   of its component actions to its efficacy is still unclear.
   To better characterize the role of histamine and serotonin receptors in
   the modulation of PPI in rats, we studied the effects of the H-1
   histamine antagonist pyrilamine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) on
   amphetamine-induced (1 mg/kg) PPI deficits (Experiment 1); and the
   interaction of pyrilamine (20 mg/kg) with the 5-HT2 antagonist
   ketanserin (1 and 2 mg/kg) on the amphetamine-induced PPI disruption
   (Experiment 2).
   Tactile startle stimuli consisted of 30 PSI air-puffs. Three acoustic
   prepulse intensity levels were used: 68, 71, and 77 dB, presented on a
   65-dB background noise. In both experiments, all animals received all
   drug doses and combinations with different counterbalanced orders.
   Pyrilamine (20 mg/kg) was effective in counteracting the PPI impairment
   caused by amphetamine administration, whereas ketanserin exacerbated the
   amphetamine-induced PPI deficit.
   Based on its ability to reverse amphetamine-induced PPI deficits,
   blockade of histamine H-1 receptors seems to contribute to the
   therapeutic effect of the antipsychotic clozapine. Serotonin
   5-HT2-receptor blockade, though, does not appear to contribute to this
   effect, and may in fact detract from it.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Drug delivery systems (DDS) were designed using insulin as
   model drug and poly (lactic-co-glycolic) copolymers (PLGA) as polymeric
   matrix. The carriers were synthesized by direct self-assembly of the
   insulin and the polyester under mild conditions.
   RESULTS: The kind and level of association between the protein and the
   polymer were studied using computational methods (combined MM2/PM3) and
   spectroscopic tools (Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy
   dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XFS)). The
   effect of the number average molecular weight (M-n) of the copolymer on
   the association efficiency (AE) drug-polymer as well as on the release
   profile has been explored. Mathematical models were used to predict the
   insulin release kinetic and mechanism.
   CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory protein/PLGA association efficiencies (between
   77 and 99\%) were registered depending on the Mn of the PLGA.
   Hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions were detected between the
   protein and the polymeric network by computational analysis. In vitro
   release studies demonstrated that copolyesters of about 8600 and 1500 Da
   were suitable for the gradual release of insulin while PLGA oligomers of
   average molecular weight between 700 and 800 Da were unsuitable as DDS.
   The insulin release kinetics fits well with the Korsmeyer model,
   following the anomalous transport mechanism. (C) 2010 Society of

Abstract = {{Background: Voriconazole is an antifungal agent with in vitro activity
   and clinical efficacy against yeasts, molds, and dimorphic fungi (eg,
   Paracoccidioides brasiliensis). The safety profile of voriconazole
   includes transient visual adverse events (VAEs) that resolve while
   undergoing treatment or after its discontinuation.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the long-term (ie, 6-12
   months) visual safety of voriconazole in adult patients with
   paracoccidioidomycosis.
   Methods: Ophthalmic data were prospectively collected as part of a
   multicenter, open-label, comparative study. Patients aged >= 18 years
   with paracoccidioidomycosis were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
   either voriconazole (200 mg BID orally, after the loading dose of 400 mg
   BID on day 1) or itraconazole (100 mg BID orally, with no loading dose).
   Patients were expected to receive treatment for a minimum of 6 months,
   or longer if needed as determined by the investigator (maximum duration,
   1 year). Visual function tests and safety assessments were performed at
   baseline, week 12, week 24, end of treatment (EOT), and 8 weeks
   post-EOT. Ophthalmic examinations included visual acuity, color vision,
   contrast sensitivity, visual field, funduscopy, and slit lamp
   biomicroscopy. Treatment compliance was monitored via pill counts at
   each study visit.
   Results: Thirty-five patients (mean age, 48 years; 96.2\% male; 83.0\%
   white) were randomized to receive voriconazole and 18 to receive
   itraconazole. Fourteen voriconazole-treated patients received >6 months
   of treatment (median, 169 days). Efficacy and overall safety results
   have been published previously. Sixteen voriconazole-treated patients
   and 2 itraconazole-treated patients experienced drug-related VAEs; none
   was considered serious or severe or led to dose reductions or resulted
   in discontinuation. Overall, visual examination results were not
   clinically significantly different between patients treated with
   voriconazole or itraconazole. There was no apparent relationship between
   changes in visual function test results and the occurrence of VAEs in
   either treatment group.
   Conclusion: Clinical assessment in this study found no evidence of an
   effect of voriconazole on long-term visual function in these adult
   patients with paracoccidioidomycosis. (Clin Ther. 2010;32:2207-2217) (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction - Among pituitary adenomas thyrotropinomas were previously
   considered as extremely rare and resistant to therapy However the common

   Case reports - We here report three cases of TSH secreting pituitary
   adenoma that highlight the great diversity of the clinical hormonal and
   morphological presentation and their better prognosis In the presence of
   an inappropriate TSH secretion the main differential diagnosis is the
   syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance The role of somatostatin analogue
   prior to the surgical treatment of TSH secreting pituitary adenoma is
   also underlined in this report
   Conclusion - The increasing frequency and early diagnosis of TSH
   secreting pituitary adenoma may be explained by ultrasensitive methods
   now used for TSH measurement and progress in pituitary imaging mainly
   with MRI This changing spectrum in the presentation and the excellent

   the model, bagging of the rectum reduced carcass contamination
   significantly with pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica, but not with
   Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and alone it was insufficient to completely
   prevent the carcass contamination with enteropathogenic Yersinia. The
   hidden prevalence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica was higher at high
   production capacity than it was in low production capacity, but the 95\%
   credible intervals overlapped. Slaughterhouse environments can
   contaminate carcasses with enteropathogenic: Yersinia, but the plausible
   main contamination source is the pig carrying the pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular
   surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and
   tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. The
   purpose of the research was to examine the relation between Ocular
   Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and dry eye signs.
   Methods: Thirty dry eye patients were asked to fill OSDI questionnaire,
   which is a standardised instrument for dry eye symptom evaluation. All
   patients were previously diagnosed with dry eye disease on the basis of
   an abnormal Schirmer's test 1 result (< 10 mm) and subjective symptoms.
   Dry eye signs were assessed by fluorescein tear break-up time (FTBUT),
   Schirmer's test 1, corneal fluorescein staining, lissamine green
   staining and inter blink interval (IBI). All clinical tests were
   performed on the same day. Spearman correlation coefficients were used
   to evaluate the correlation between OSDI and dry eye signs.
   Results: There was no statistically significant correlation between OSDI
   and dry eye signs.
   Conclusions: The results of our study showed poor association between
   dry eye symptoms and signs. Further studies with larger number of
   patients have to be done to understand the relationship between
   subjective symptoms and clinical tests in dry eye disease.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to have strong effects on
   mediterranean-climate regions worldwide. In some areas, these effects
   will include increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall, which
   could have important implications for biological assessment programs of
   aquatic ecosystems. We used a consistently collected, 20-y benthic
   macroinvertebrate data set from 4 sites along 2 small northern
   California streams to examine potential climate-change effects on
   aquatic communities. The sites represented unique combinations of stream
   order and flow intermittency. The North Coast benthic macroinvertebrate
   index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for northern California
   streams was not influenced by temperature extremes (cool and warm) or
   precipitation extremes (wet and dry). Other common indices and metrics
   used in biological monitoring studies, such as the ratio of observed to
   expected taxa (O/E), \% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT)
   individuals, and total richness were unaffected by temperature and
   precipitation variability. For future monitoring of climate-change
   effects on small streams, we developed a local climate-change indicator
   that is composed of the presence/absence of 9 macroinvertebrate taxa,
   identified to genus level. This indicator detected significant
   differences between years that were grouped based on temperature,
   precipitation, and a combination of temperature and precipitation. It
   also detected significant differences between groups in an external data
   set including 40 reference sites throughout the San Francisco Bay area,
   a result that suggests this indicator could be used at larger spatial
   scales in this region. Two biological trait categories found in large,
   long-lived organisms decreased with increasing temperature and
   decreasing precipitation at the most intermittent site. This result
   indicates that climate change might selectively affect taxa with certain
   traits. The robustness of the North Coast B-IBI and other common indices
   and metrics to temperature and precipitation variability demonstrates
   their continued applicability for examining water quality under future
   climate-change scenarios, but suggests that they probably will not be
   good indicators for detecting climate-change effects. The effects of
   climate change in mediterranean-climate streams can be monitored
   effectively within the framework of existing biological assessment
   programs by using regional indicators based on specific taxa identified
   to the generic level and information on their species traits.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``Canadian literature{''} was popularized by early Canadian
   anthologists who viewed their collections as evidence of the country's
   coming of age. These editors were driven by a mix of evangelical
   nationalism, political allegiance, literary alliances, and the desire to
   profit from shifting perceptions of the country and its literature as
   Canada moved towards the twentieth century. The representation of Canada
   that emerges in these formative collections is intimately linked to the
   conditions surrounding their production, which impacted the anthologies
   as much as the editor's religious, political, or aesthetic values. These
   conditions influenced the representation of nation and affected the ways
   in which readers came to understand the meaning of ``country{''} as a
   textually constructed ideal. This essay examines seven anthologies of
   English-Canadian literature published in the nineteenth century in an
   attempt to determine the kind of values they promoted, the tensions
   their editors faced, and the extent to which they established canonical
   norms that would be inherited by their twentieth-century successors.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, nano-sized bismuth (Bi) binding technology has been
   developed in order to improve the electrochemical characteristics of Bi
   for detecting heavy metals. A Bi nanopowder synthesized by gas
   condensation (GC) method exhibits a size smaller than 100 nm. The Bi
   nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on a carbon surface with strong
   chemical bonding by using a Nafion solution. The optimum additional
   amount of Nafion is suggested for dispersion stability and phase
   stability of the Bi nanoparticles. The detection sensitivity and the
   detection limit of the nano-Bi fixed electrode are quantitatively
   estimated from analyses of square wave anodic stripping voltammograms
   (SWASV). The proposed ``mercury-free{''} carbon strip electrode,
   modified with a Bi nanopowder, is conveniently to use and is directly
   applicable to trace metal analysis with neither pre-deposition of Bi nor
   complicated surface polishing steps.}},

Title = {{Low Apgar score and mortality in extremely preterm neonates born in the
   United States}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the relationship between low Apgar score and
   neonatal mortality in preterm neonates.
   Methods: Infant birth and death certificate data from the US National
   Center for Health Statistics for 2001-2002 were analysed. Primary
   outcome was 28-day mortality for 690 933 neonates at gestational ages
   24-36 weeks. Mortality rates were calculated for each combination of
   gestational age and 5-min Apgar score. Relative risks of mortality, by
   high vs. low Apgar score, were calculated for each age.
   Results: Distribution of Apgar scores depended on gestational age, the
   youngest gestational ages having higher proportions of low Apgar scores.
   Median Apgar score ranged from 6 at 24 weeks, to 9 at 30-36 weeks
   gestation. The relative risk of death was significantly higher at Apgar
   scores 0-3 vs. 7-10, including at the youngest gestational ages, ranging
   from 3.1 (95\% confidence interval 2.9, 3.4) at 24 weeks to 18.5 (95\%
   confidence interval 15.7, 21.8) at 28 weeks.
   Conclusion: Low Apgar score was associated with increased mortality in
   premature neonates, including those at 24-28 weeks gestational age, and
   may be a useful tool for clinicians in assessing prognosis and for
   researchers as a risk prediction variable.}},

   materials exhibiting polytypism Demonstrated for GaN, our intriguing
   results provide fundamentally new insight into controlling one of the
   most important structural parameters of epitaxial films This approach
   might be readily extended to other III-nitrides and ZnO, which also
   exhibit polytypism Our procedures can be easily applied to tailor
   characteristics of epitaxial films, allowing investigations of new

Abstract = {{We have developed a wide contact structure for low-noise nanochannel
   devices based on a carbon nanotube (CNT) network. This low-noise CNT
   network-based device has a dumbbell-shaped channel, which has wide
   CNT/electrode contact regions and, in effect, reduces the contact noise.
   We also performed a systematic analysis of structured CNT networks and
   established an empirical formula that can explain the noise behavior of
   arbitrary-shaped CNT network-based devices including the effect of
   contact regions and CNT alignment. Interestingly, our analysis revealed
   that the noise amplitude of aligned CNT networks behaves quite
   differently compared with that of randomly oriented CNT networks. Our
   results should be an important guideline in designing low-noise
   nanoscale devices based on a CNT network for various applications such
   as a highly sensitive low-noise sensor.}},

Abstract = {{The configuration design of a mechanical product can be performed
   efficiently when it is based on a functional model. There are some
   function-based design methodologies that decompose functions from the
   abstract level to the concrete level by matching the functions to
   physical parts. However, executing innovative design is difficult when
   the function is matched only to pre-defined parts. This paper describes
   the configuration design process of a train bogie with a design expert
   system that uses function taxonomy and TRIZ. The design expert system
   can propose a functional model of a new part that is not on the existing
   parts list of train bogies. Levels of design knowledge which describe
   the operations of the mechanical product at different levels of
   abstraction are introduced. This is the theoretical basis for using TRIZ
   with the function taxonomy for configuration design. The design expert
   system is adequate for controlling the design knowledge, which is
   expressed as knowledge of parts, functional modeling, mapping rules
   between functions and parts, and TRIZ. The functional model of a new
   brake system in the bogie is introduced with the design expert system.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate the current status of cancer-related health
   disparities in cancer risk factors and the use of cancer screening
   services by Korean adults.
   Study design: Cross-sectional survey study.
   Methods: The disparities of behavioural cancer risk factors and use of
   cancer screening services according to equivalent monthly household
   income were evaluated, using multivariate logistic regression analysis,
   among 6466 subjects aged >= 30 years and who completed the health
   promotion knowledge, attitude and practice survey, which is part of the
   Third Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
   Results: In men, smoking (P for trend = 0.05) and physical inactivity (P
   for trend = 0.05) were more common in the lower-income group, while
   high-risk drinking (P for trend <0.01) was more common in the
   higher-income group. In women, physical inactivity (P for trend <0.01)
   was more common in the lower-income group, while smoking and high-risk
   drinking showed no income disparities. Income disparities were also
   found in the degree of participation in cancer screening programmes. Men
   in the highest income quintile underwent more screening for both
   colorectal and gastric cancer than men in the lowest income quintile and
   men in the second to fourth income quintiles (P for trend <0.01 for
   both). Women in the highest income quintile underwent more screening for
   cervical (P for trend <0.01) and gastric (P for trend - 0.04) cancer,
   while income disparities were not seen for participation in colorectal
   or breast cancer screening.
   Conclusions: In order to decrease behavioural risk factors and promote
   participation in cancer screening programmes, more targeted efforts are
   needed for cancer prevention among lower-income Koreans. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{RO5068760, a substituted hydantoin, represents a new class of potent,
   highly selective, non-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive MEK1/2
   inhibitors. The study aimed to determine the safety/tolerability,
   pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of
   RO5068760 in human healthy volunteers. All participants received a
   single dose followed by 48 hours of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
   and safety/tolerability assessments. The pharmacodynamics were measured
   by changes in ERK phosphorylation (pERK) in peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells, ex vivo stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).
   Forty-eight participants received 6 doses (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800
   mg). RO5068760 was well tolerated up to 800 mg. There were no clinically
   significant safety findings, including laboratory, electrocardiogram,
   ophthalmological assessment, and fecal occult blood tests. Of the total
   13 adverse events (n = 12), 11 were mild, 2 were moderate, and none were
   severe, and only 5 were considered by the investigator as possibly
   related to treatment. RO5068760 was absorbed with a t(max), of 2 hours.
   Disposition appeared to be biphasic with a terminal elimination t(1/2)
   of 5 to 9 hours. The variability was moderate to high, ranging from 38\%
   to 62\% for C-max and 41\% to 69\% AUC. Within the dose range tested,
   pERK inhibition was relatively modest with a mean maximal pERK
   suppression of 55\%.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fracture patterns of the nasal septum.
   STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cadaveric study.
   SETTING: Synthes research laboratories, Philadelphia, PA.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen cadavers were divided into three groups.
   Group A was subjected to low-level force administered to the nasal tip.
   Group B underwent moderate-level force and group C high-level force.
   Cadavers subsequently underwent dissection of the nose and nasal septum.
   RESULTS: Fracture patterns were apparent and related to the force
   applied. Fracture patterns were classified into three types depending on
   the location and extent. Group A was the most variable. Three cadavers
   were classified as type 1, two as type 2, and one as type 3. The average
   amount of force required to produce a fracture in this group was 100 N.
   Group B cadavers all developed type 3 fractures. Group C cadavers
   primarily developed type 3 fractures except for one that developed a
   type 1. Fractures were further classified in regard to the septum being
   displaced off the nasal spine.
   CONCLUSION: Based on our observation, we conclude that fracture patterns
   of the nasal septum do exist and appear to be related to the amount of
   force sustained. Copyright (C) 2010 American Academy of

Abstract = {{Owing to its unique electronic properties, graphene has recently
   attracted wide attention in both the condensed matter physics and
   microelectronic device communities. Despite intense interest in this
   material, an industrially scalable graphene synthesis process remains
   elusive. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, low-temperature,
   spatially controlled and scalable epltaxial graphene (EG) synthesis
   technique based on laser-induced surface decomposition of the Si-rich
   face of a SIC single-crystal. We confirm the formation of EG on SiC as a
   result of excimer laser irradiation by using reflection high-energy
   electron diffraction (RHEED), Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron-based
   X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM). Laser fluence controls the thickness of the
   graphene film down to a single monolayer. Laser-synthesized graphene
   does not display some of the structural characteristics observed in EG
   grown by conventional thermal decomposition on SIC (0001), such as Bemal
   stacking and surface reconstruction of the underlying SIC surface.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, platinum (Pt) metal loaded activated multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWNTs) were prepared with different structural
   characteristics for hydrogen storage applications. The process was
   conducted by a gas phase CO2 activation method at 1200 degrees C as a
   function of the CO2 flow time. Pt-loaded activated MWNTs were also
   formulated to investigate the hydrogen storage characteristics. The
   microstructures of the Pt-loaded activated MWNTs were characterized by
   XRD and TEM measurements. The textural properties of the samples were
   analyzed using N-2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K. The BET, D-R, and BJH
   equations were used to observe the specific surface areas and the
   micropore and mesopore structures. The hydrogen storage capacity of the
   Pt-loaded activated MWNTs was measured at 298 K at a pressure of 100
   bar. The hydrogen storage capacity was increased with CO2 flow time. It
   was found that the micropore volume of the activated MWNTs plays a key
   role in the hydrogen storage capacity. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Pesticide-containing food intake data are used to assess the extent of
   exposure to pesticide residues through food intake. But they still are
   not available in Korea. Therefore we attempted to build a database of
   the food commodity intake. Several mathematical methods were developed
   to build food recipes and estimate the food commodity intake by
   segregating the food mixtures. All unknown recipes were classified into
   three groups: food mixtures, foods with a single ingredient whose
   moisture content simply changes during processing or preparation, and
   foods whose parts are lost during processing. The mathematical
   principles for computation of ingredient proportions were based on the
   mass balance between ingredients and the finished foods, in terms of
   water and nutritional components such as carbohydrate, protein, lipid,
   ash, etc. Some reference books were used to obtain information
   associated with recipes of processed or prepared foods, and nutritional
   components. This approach was based on mathematical principles used with
   limited sources of food recipe information. The results were deemed
   preliminary data that could help in obtaining quality food commodity
   intake data that could be used in the exposure assessment to pesticide
   residues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bicalutamide is an oral nonsteroidal antiandrogenic drug
   used in the treatment of prostate cancer. A new generic 50-mg tablet
   formulation of bicalutamide has recently been developed.
   Objective: This study evaluated the relative bioavailability and
   tolerability of the new generic formulation of bicalutamide 50-mg
   tablets (test) and the currently marketed formulation (reference) in
   healthy Korean male subjects. The study was conducted to meet Korean
   regulatory requirements for authorization to market the generic
   formulation.
   Methods: This was a randomized-sequence, open-label study in which
   healthy Korean male subjects (aged 20-55 years) received single doses of
   the test and reference formulations in a 2-period crossover fashion,
   with a 6-week washout period between doses. Blood samples for the
   determination of plasma bicalutamide concentrations were obtained at
   regular intervals over 672 hours after dose administration.
   Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental
   methods. Relative bioavailability was evaluated by comparing the
   log-transformed C-max and AUC(0-672) of the 2 formulations; Korean
   regulatory requirements for the assumption of bioequivalence were met if
   the 90\% CIs fell within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. Tolerability was
   assessed based on physical examinations, vital signs, clinical
   laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse events (AEs)
   (spontaneously reported or observed by investigators).
   Results: Of 47 volunteers screened for inclusion, 38 were enrolled and
   32 completed the study (mean {[}SD] age, 24.9 {[}3.7] years; mean
   height, 173.8 {[}6.2] cm; mean weight, 66.1 {[}7.1] kg). Median T-max
   was 24 hours for both formulations. The C-max of the test and reference
   formulations was 1176.2 (191.6) and 1118.9 (209.5), mu g/L,
   respectively. The corresponding values for AUC(0-672) were 277,503
   (66,865) and 271,961 (75,597) mu g . h/L. The 90\% CIs for the geometric
   mean ratios of log-transformed C-max and AUC(0-672) were 1.00 to 1.11
   and 0.99 to 1.07, respectively. Thirty-three AEs were reported,
   including 17 events in 9 subjects who received the test formulation and
   16 events in 12 subjects who received the reference formulation. All AEs
   were mild, and no subjects discontinued the study because of AEs.
   Conclusions: In this single-dose study in healthy Korean male subjects,
   the pharmacokinetic parameters of the new generic formulation of
   bicalutamide 50-mg tablets did not differ significantly from those of
   the reference formulation. The new generic formulation met Korean
   regulatory criteria for the assumption of bioequivalence to the
   currently marketed formulation. Both formulations were well tolerated.

Abstract = {{Objectives: This community-based study examined perceived barriers to
   the initiation of mental health treatment among individuals with
   anxiety, mood, and alcohol use disorders. Methods: Face-to-face
   interviews were conducted with 5,201 respondents in Beijing and Shanghai
   using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic
   Interview. Perceived barriers to initiating treatment from various
   health practitioners were examined among 211 individuals who met
   criteria for 12-month DSM-IV disorders and did not receive treatment.
   Results: Most respondents (92\%) with DSM-IV disorders perceived a low
   need for treatment. Among respondents who perceived a need, 47\%
   reported structural barriers and 83\% reported attitudinal barriers.
   Respondents who had severe mental disorders and perceived a need
   reported more structural barriers (72\%) than attitudinal barriers
   (65\%). Lack of knowledge about service availability was the most common
   structural barrier. Conclusions: Future studies should examine the
   reasons for perceived low need for treatment and other treatment
   barriers among people with mental disorders. (Psychiatric Services

Title = {{Effectiveness of music intervention on the quality of life of older
   people}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{P>Aim.
   This paper is a report of a study of the effect of music on the quality
   of life of community-dwelling older Chinese people in Hong Kong.
   Background.
   Older people's quality of life can be improved by preparing for the
   transition into old age. Listening to music, as a vehicle for feeling,
   can facilitate the non-verbal expression of emotion, reaching people's
   inner feelings without being threatening, and it can be a tool for
   emotional catharsis.
   Method.
   A randomized controlled trial design was conducted from in 2007 in a
   community centre in Hong Kong. A total of 66 older people (31 in music
   group and 35 in control group), aged from 65 to 90 years were randomly
   assigned to undergo either a 30-minute music intervention or a rest
   period for 4 weeks; quality of life outcomes were then measured.
   Results.
   Quality of life improved weekly in the music group, indicating a
   cumulative dose effect, and a statistically significantly better quality
   of life was found over time in each sub-score for those in the music
   group compared with the controls. However, in the music group, there
   were no statistically significant improvements of quality of life in
   each sub-score over the 4 weeks.
   Conclusion.
   Being engaged in music activities can help a person to connect with
   their life experiences and with other people, and to be more stimulated.
   Music is a non-invasive, simple and inexpensive therapeutic method of
   improving quality of life in community-dwelling elders.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective was to develop and investigate an automated
   scoring scheme of the American College of Radiology (ACR) mammographic
   accreditation phantom (RMI 156, Middleton, WI) images.
   Methods: The developed method consisted of background subtraction,
   determination of region of interest, classification of fiber and mass
   objects by Mahalanobis distance, detection of specks by template
   matching, and rule-based scoring. Fifty-one phantom images were
   collected from 51 facilities for this study (one facility provided one
   image). A medical physicist and two radiologic technologists also scored
   the images. The human and computerized scores were compared.
   Results: In terms of meeting the ACR's criteria, the accuracies of the
   developed method for computerized evaluation of fiber, mass, and speck
   were 90\%, 80\%, and 98\%, respectively. Contingency table analysis
   revealed significant association between observer and computer scores
   for microcalcifications (p < 5\%) but not for masses and fibers.
   Conclusions: The developed method may achieve a stable assessment of
   visibility for test objects in mammographic accreditation phantom image
   in whether the phantom image meets the ACR's criteria in the evaluation
   test, although there is room left for improvement in the approach for
   fiber and mass objects. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that fatigue-induced performance
   decline in surgical residents is associated with changes in brain
   function as detected by functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
   Methods: Surgical residents (n = 7) participated in a prospective study
   involving 2-hourly objective measurements of neurocognitive skill
   (arithmetic calculations using Nintendo ``brain training{''}), technical
   performance (surgical knot tying on a trainer, and monitoring time
   taken, path length and number of movements), and introspective fatigue
   (questionnaire-based) across 10 hours of acute sleep deprivation (10:00
   PM to 8:00 PM). Simultaneously, changes in cortical oxyhemoglobin
   (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (HbT), inferring
   prefrontal function, were recorded by using functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy.
   Results: Arithmetic performance remained stable despite increasing
   levels of subject fatigue (time: P = 0.07, errors: P = 0.70, efficiency:
   P = 0.58). Technical skill improved between the first (10:00 PM) and the
   second (12:00 AM) sessions (P < 0.05) and stabilized thereafter (12:00
   AM to 8:00 AM). Greater activation was required to complete cognitive
   versus technical drills. Stimulus type (0: cognitive, 1: technical) was
   found to be an independent predictor of changes in cortical excitation
   (HbO(2): P < 0.01, HHb: P < 0.05, HbT: P < 0.01). Cortical responses to
   the cognitive task increased over the course of the simulated night
   shift. In addition, ``time interval{''} was observed to be an
   independent predictor of cortical hemodynamic change (HbO(2): P < 0.01,
   HbT: P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Neurocognitive tasks may tax the sleep-deprived resident
   more than well-learned technical skills. Performing cognitive skills at
   night, such as decision making, may depend upon enhanced prefrontal
   recruitment indicative of a focused attentional strategy and/or
   compensation to sleep deprivation. Further work should focus on
   determining whether errors in performance are associated with
   attentional lapses and failure of cortical compensation.}},

   and health problems among young people, however, there are no data about
   the overweight between adolescents. This study investigated the
   prevalence of overweight and associated factors in students from
   Tri-Border Region: Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Study participants
   were 1.183 students, ages from 15 to 18 years. The overweight was
   identified according to body mass index cut-off points proposed by the
   World Health Organization. The Global School-Based Student Health Survey
   questionnaire was used to identify sociodemographic (gender and age) and
   behavioral factors (physical activity outside of school, commuting to
   school, time watching TV and fruits, vegetables, sweet, and salty snack
   consumption) associated with overweight in adolescents. It was used the
   descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, chi-square and binary
   logistic regression, adopting p<0,05. Thirteen percent of students were
   overweight. Boys were approximately two times more likely to have
   overweight than girls, independently of nationality. Brazilian students
   that realized passive commuting to school and Argentineans students with
   low consumption of vegetables (< 1 time/day) were 2,2 and 2,9 times more
   likely to have overweight than their counterparts who performed active
   commuting to school and consumed vegetables daily, respectively. These
   results suggest that public policies to combat overweight should
   attention on promoting healthy lifestyle among young people from
   Tri-Border Region.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to promote migration of species. In ecotones,
   areas of ecological tension, disturbances may provide opportunities for
   some migrating species to establish in otherwise competitive
   environments. The size of and time since disturbance may determine the
   establishment ability of these species. We investigated gap dynamics of
   an old-growth red pine (Pinus resinosa Sol. ex Aiton) forest in the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest in northern Ontario, Canada, a
   transition zone between temperate and boreal forest. We investigated the
   effects of gaps of different sizes and ages on tree species abundance
   and basal area. Our results show that tree species from the temperate
   forest further south, such as red maple (Acer rubrum L.), red oak
   (Quercus rubra L.), and white pine (Pinus strobus L.), establish more
   often in large, old gaps; however, tree species that have more northern
   distributions, such as black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.), paper birch
   (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and red pine show no difference in
   establishment ability with gap size or age. These differences in
   composition could not be attributed to autogenic succession. We conclude
   that treefall gaps in this forest facilitate the establishment of
   northward migrating species, potentially providing a pathway for future
   forest migration in response to recent changes in climate.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the suitability of the Material Point Method (MPM) to
   simulate the equal channel angular pressing technique (ECAP). This
   severe plastic deformation process combines several interesting and
   challenging features in the context of numerical simulations, namely
   large displacements, large plastic deformations, as well as abrupt
   contact changes between the rigid tools and the work piece. Moreover,
   ECAP has been intensively studied, experimentally, numerically and
   theoretically, which makes it an ideal benchmark for testing MPM.
   Results from finite element analysis are also presented for comparison
   to MPM because this method is widely considered as a robust and reliable
   computational technique that has often been successfully applied to
   severe plastic deformation processes. In general, an excellent agreement
   is found in the predictions made by the two numerical methods. However.,
   we found that to successfully simulate such processes with MPM, prior
   contact methods should to be replaced with a new contact algorithm. The
   new contact method is presented and should improve other MPM simulations
   with contact as well.}},

   1995 by people with learning disabilities (personal communication,

   faced by individuals who might consider pursuing a claim against a

   legislative use of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in

Abstract = {{Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides capable of
   translocating across the plasma membrane of live cells and transporting
   conjugated compounds intracellularly. Fifteen years after discovering
   the first model cationic CPPs, penetratin and TAT, CPP internalization
   is still challenging many questions. Particularly it has been unknown
   whether CPPs enter the cells with or without mediation of a specific
   surface receptor. Here we report that syndecan-4, the universally
   expressed isoform of the syndecan family of transmembrane proteoglycans.
   binds and mediates transport of the three most frequently utilized
   cationic CPPs (penetratin, octaarginine and TAT) into the cells.
   Quantitative uptake studies and mutational analyses demonstrate that
   attachment of the cationic CPPs is mediated by specific interactions
   between the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-4 and the CPPs. Protein
   kinase C alpha is also heavily involved in the uptake mechanism. The
   collected data give the first direct evidence on the receptor-mediated
   uptake of cationic CPPs and may replace the long-thought, but already
   contradicted membrane penetration hypothesis. Thus our study might give
   an answer for a decade long debate and foster the development of
   rationalized, syndecan-4 targeted novel delivery technologies. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The construction industry has been recognized as a stressful industry,
   and a great deal of stress is placed on various construction
   professionals (CPs). However, due to the different ``values{''} among
   CPs in Hong Kong, susceptibility to stressors varies from individual to
   individual. People who grow up and live in different cultural
   environments have different values and this leads to different
   perceptions of stressors. This study aims to investigate the impact of
   Chinese values on the stressors of CPs in Hong Kong, one of the main
   cities in China. To achieve this aim, factor analysis, Pearson
   correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling were applied
   based on the survey data collected from CPs in Hong Kong. Four types of
   Chinese values and eight stressors are identified. The results reveal
   that: (1) social conventions value alleviate role ambiguity and poor
   workgroup relationship; (2) value of disciplined work ethos triggers
   work overload, although it alleviate poor workgroup relationship and
   work underload; (3) value of conservative personality alleviates work
   overload; (4) interpersonal integration value has indirect impacts on
   the various stressors; and (5) the objective poor working environment
   stressor has significant impact on the poor workgroup relationships and
   role ambiguity of individual CPs.}},

Abstract = {{The article explores how religious actors have increasingly shaped the
   nature of antiretroviral treatment (ART) services in Kabarole district,
   western Uganda. As have the regular health services, Christian donors,
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and churches in the district have
   also stepped up to provide money for antiretroviral drugs and care for
   people living with HIV. The article explains how, at the ground level,
   formal public structures in the district are sometimes superseded - both
   literally and figuratively - by religious actors: such as when ART
   services are attuned not only to the intentions of the Ministry of
   Health but also to those of the Catholic bishop, when ART service
   provision is restricted to the diocese's boundaries rather than those of
   the district, and when the coverage and nature of ART is discussed with
   NGOs and donors, both within and above the district-level, instead of
   with local government. Although Kabarole district's health department is
   formally involved as project owner, its position has been increasingly
   marginalised due to the power and wealth of religious actors.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation focused on late event-related potentials
   (ERPs) and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity in response to
   symptom provocation in 8- to 12-year-old spider phobic girls and
   compared results to those in non-fearful controls. Fourteen patients and
   14 controls were presented with phobia-relevant, generally
   fear-inducing, disgust-inducing and affectively neutral pictures in an
   EEG/EMG session. ERPs were extracted in the time-windows 340-500 ms
   (P300) and 550-770 ms (late positive potential, LPP). Relative to
   controls, phobics showed enhanced amplitudes of P300 and LPP in response
   to spider pictures. This result is interpreted to reflect motivated
   attention to emotionally salient stimuli. Moreover, phobics showed
   enhanced average facial EMG activity of the levator labii and the
   corrugator supercilii in response to spider pictures, reflecting the
   negative valence and disgust relevance of spiders. Additionally, spider
   phobic girls relative to controls showed higher overall disgust
   proneness and heightened average facial EMG activity in both muscle
   regions in response to disgust stimuli, possibly revealing a
   disgust-based origin of spider phobia in children. These aspects should
   be considered in psychotherapeutic treatment of childhood spider phobia.

Abstract = {{We argue that quantum theory should proceed not from a spacetime
   background but from a Lie algebra, which is treated as a symmetry
   algebra. Then the fact that the cosmological constant is positive means
   not that the spacetime background is curved but that the de Sitter (dS)
   algebra as the symmetry algebra is more relevant than the Poincare or
   anti de Sitter ones. The physical interpretation of irreducible
   representations (IRs) of the dS algebra is considerably different from
   that for the other two algebras. One IR of the dS algebra splits into
   independent IRs for a particle and its antiparticle only when Poincare
   approximation works with a high accuracy. Only in this case additive
   quantum numbers such as electric, baryon and lepton charges are
   conserved, while at early stages of the Universe they could not be
   conserved. Another property of IRs of the dS algebra is that only
   fermions can be elementary and there can be no neutral elementary
   particles. The cosmological repulsion is a simple kinematical
   consequence of dS symmetry on quantum level when quasiclassical
   approximation is valid. Therefore the cosmological constant problem does
   not exist and there is no need to involve dark energy or other fields
   for explaining this phenomenon (in agreement with a similar conclusion
   by Bianchi and Rovelli).}},

Title = {{Efficacy of Three Tourniquet Types for Intravenous Antimicrobial
   Regional Limb Perfusion in Standing Horses}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY SURGERY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1021-1024}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To determine (1) if clinically useful concentrations of amikacin sulfate
   can be obtained in synovial fluid during regional limb perfusion (RLP)
   performed above the carpus in standing sedated horses and (2) to
   determine the efficacy of 3 tourniquet types (narrow rubber {[}NR], wide
   rubber {[}WR], pneumatic {[}PN]).
   Animals
   Horses (n=9).
   Methods
   Bilateral forelimb RLP with amikacin sulfate (2.5 g) were administered
   through the cephalic vein in standing sedated horses. Limbs were
   randomly assigned to the 3 tourniquet types (NR, WR, PN) applied above
   the carpus. Metacarpophalangeal synovial fluid was obtained 0.5 hour
   after perfusion. Amikacin concentration in the synovial fluid was
   detected using fluorescence polarization immunoassay.
   Results
   Mean synovial concentrations of amikacin in the PN (mean 236 mu g/mL;
   range 23-913 mu g/mL) and WR (mean 64.2 mu g/mL; range 7-315 mu g/mL)
   were significantly higher (P=.000 and .032, respectively) than the NR
   tourniquet (mean 2.1 mu g/mL; range 0.9-3.3 mu g/mL).
   Conclusions
   The PN tourniquet resulted in the highest synovial fluid amikacin
   concentrations in all horses, although administration with PN and WR
   tourniquets achieved adequate amikacin concentrations. NR tourniquet is
   ineffective and should not be used for RLP above the carpus in the
   standing horse.}},

   published July 28, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00983.2009. A variety of
   studies have demonstrated enhanced blood oxygenation level dependent
   responses to auditory and tactile stimuli within occipital cortex as a
   result of early blindness. However, little is known about the
   organizational principles that drive this cross-modal plasticity. We
   compared BOLD responses to a wide variety of auditory and tactile tasks
   (vs. rest) in early-blind and sighted subjects. As expected, cross-modal
   responses were larger in blind than in sighted subjects in occipital
   cortex for all tasks (cross-modal plasticity). Within both blind and
   sighted subject groups, we found patterns of cross-modal activity that
   were remarkably similar across tasks: a large proportion of cross-modal
   responses within occipital cortex are neither task nor stimulus
   specific. We next examined the mechanisms underlying enhanced BOLD
   responses within early-blind subjects. We found that the enhancement of
   cross-modal responses due to early blindness was best described as an
   additive shift, suggesting that cross-modal plasticity within blind
   subjects does not originate from either a scaling or unmasking of
   cross-modal responsivities found in sighted subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Micronutrient status in soils can be affected by long-term fertilization
   and intensive cropping. A 19-year experiment (1990-2008) was carried out
   to investigate the influence of different fertilization regimes on
   micronutrients in an Aquic Inceptisol and maize and wheat grains in
   Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that soil total Cu and Zn markedly
   declined after 19 years with application of N fertilizer alone. Soil
   total Fe and Mn were significantly increased mainly due to atmospheric
   deposition. Applications of P and organic fertilizer with incorporation
   of straws resulted in dramatic increases in soil total Cu, Zn, Fe, and
   Mn. Soil diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable Cu in
   all treatments sharply decreased from initially 1.12 to about 0.8 mg
   kg(-1). The treatments with organic fertilizer had the highest soil
   DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn after 19 years of cropping and
   fertilization, thus demonstrating the important role of organic
   fertilizer application in improving available micronutrient status. Cu
   and Zn contents in wheat grains in the no-P treatments were
   significantly higher than those of the treatments with P application. In
   addition, Fe and Mn contents in wheat grains were positively correlated
   with their soil DTPA-extractable concentrations. These indicated that
   the long-term application of organic fertilizer resulted in significant
   increases in soil total and available micronutrient concentrations and
   remarkable reduction in wheat grain Cu and Zn contents, which was due to
   high soil available P. Key Words: Cu, organic fertilizer, soil available
   P, wheat, Zn}},

Abstract = {{Ultra wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) has important applications in high
   data rate communications, high precision positioning and penetrating
   target detection. Combined with cognitive radio (CR), UWB can also
   greatly alleviate the current spectrum scarcity. However, the existing
   UWB waveforms are faced with two challenges. The spectrum utilization of
   UWB signal is rather low, which reduces the communication reliability.
   Meanwhile, it appears difficult for UWB-IR to avoid spectrum collision
   with other incumbent services. So UWB will inevitably interfere other
   legal wireless systems. Motivated by these considerations, we model the
   UWB waveform design into an interpolation problem. Based on radial basis
   function neural network, a novel UWB pulse is presented in this paper.
   This UWB pulse is then realized though reasonable simplification on the
   already proposed theoretical network. The designed UWB pulses can
   adaptively track the external spectral environment where UWB devices
   work and reconfigure its emission spectrum according to the state of
   primer users without any modification on hardware. The frequency
   utilization is maximized when there is no active primary user. The
   adequate spectrum avoidance has also been achieved without much spectrum
   utilization degradation within the non-primary bands. Simulation and
   analysis show that our UWB-IR pulse is much superior to the other
   existing UWB signals in the frequency utilization, spectrum avoidance
   and in the transmission performance.}},

Abstract = {{It is thought that direct quenching of singlet oxygen and scavenging
   free radicals by macular pigment carotenoids is a major mechanism for
   their beneficial effects against light-induced oxidative stress.
   Corresponding data from human tissue remains unavailable, however. In
   the studies reported here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   spectroscopy was used to measure light-induced singlet oxygen generation
   in post-mortem human macula and retinal pigment epithelium/choroid
   (RPE/choroid). Under white-light illumination, production of singlet
   oxygen was detected in RPE/choroid but not in macular tissue, and we
   show that exogenously added macular carotenoids can quench RPE/choroid
   singlet oxygen. When the singlet oxygen quenching ability of the macular
   carotenoids was investigated in solution, it was shown that a mixture of
   meso-zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein in a ratio of 1:1:1 can quench
   more singlet oxygen than the individual carotenoids at the same total
   concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   empirical kinetic model, -In(1 - x) = kt was used to describe the
   dissolution kinetics of indium in sulphuric acid solutions, and the
   results showed that indium dissolution process was controlled by
   chemical reaction with the activation energies calculated to be 47

Abstract = {{Query authentication is an essential component in Outsourced DataBase
   (ODB) systems. This article introduces efficient index structures for
   authenticating aggregation queries over large datasets. First, we design
   an index that features good performance characteristics for static
   environments. Then, we propose more involved structures for the dynamic
   case. Our structures feature excellent performance for authenticating
   queries with multiple aggregate attributes and multiple selection
   predicates. Furthermore, our techniques cover a large number of
   aggregate types, including distributive aggregates (such as SUM, COUNT,
   MIN, and MAX), algebraic aggregates (such as the AVG), and holistic
   aggregates (such as MEDIAN and QUANTILE). We have also addressed the
   issue of authenticating aggregation queries efficiently when the
   database is encrypted to protect data confidentiality. Finally, we
   implemented a working prototype of the proposed techniques and
   experimentally validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
   methods.}},

   capacity of CO2 of Cu/Ce/CAC with the mass ratio of Cu/Ce=30 was
   improved at 298 and 303 K. In addition, the adsorption equilibrium data

Abstract = {{Blue noise sampling is widely employed for a variety of imaging,
   geometry, and rendering applications. However, existing research so far
   has focused mainly on isotropic sampling, and challenges remain for the
   anisotropic scenario both in sample generation and quality verification.
   We present anisotropic blue noise sampling to address these issues. On
   the generation side, we extend dart throwing and relaxation, the two
   classical methods for isotropic blue noise sampling, for the anisotropic
   setting, while ensuring both high-quality results and efficient
   computation. On the verification side, although Fourier spectrum
   analysis has been one of the most powerful and widely adopted tools, so
   far it has been applied only to uniform isotropic samples. We introduce
   approaches based on warping and sphere sampling that allow us to extend
   Fourier spectrum analysis for adaptive and/or anisotropic samples; thus,
   we can detect problems in alternative anisotropic sampling techniques
   that were not yet found via prior verification. We present several
   applications of our technique, including stippling, visualization,
   surface texturing, and object distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A major problem of using molecular amplicons for DNA amplification in
   mite systematics is that sufficient template cannot always be acquired
   from an individual mite. To solve this problem, we developed a nested
   PCR for DNA amplification of single Rhizoglyphus robini and R. setosus
   bulb mites. A dilution up to 10(5) of the DNA from a single egg, larva,
   nymph or adult contained enough templates for amplification of the
   target ribosomal region. However, the use of specific primers in the

Abstract = {{The focusing properties of a concentric piecewise vector Bessel-Gaussian
   beam are investigated in this paper. The beam consists of three
   portions: the center circular portion and outer annular portion are
   radially polarized, while the inner annular portion is generalized
   polarized with tunable polarized angle. Numerical simulations show that
   the evolution of focal pattern is altered considerably with different
   Bessel parameters in the Bessel term of the vector Bessel-Gaussian beam.
   The polarized angle also affects the focal pattern remarkably. Some
   interesting focal patterns may appear, such as two-peak, dark hollow
   focus; ring focus; spherical shell focus; cylindrical shell focus; and
   multi-ring-peak focus, and transverse focal switch occurs with
   increasing polarized angle of the inner annular portion, which may be
   used in optical manipulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   which is less than 0.007 angstrom. The valence state of Mg is larger

Abstract = {{Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist used for the
   treatment of opioid dependence that has several advantages over
   methadone. The principal route of buprenorphine disposition has been
   well established; however, little is known regarding the potential for
   buprenorphine to influence the metabolism and clearance of other drugs
   by affecting the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). Here,
   we investigate the effects of buprenorphine on the activation of
   pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), as
   well as the induction of DMEs, in both HepG2 cells and human primary
   hepatocytes (HPHs). In HepG2 cells, buprenorphine significantly
   increased human PXR-mediated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 reporter activities.
   CYP2B6 reporter activity was also enhanced by buprenorphine in HepG2
   cells cotransfected with a chemical-responsive human CAR variant.
   Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis
   revealed that buprenorphine strongly induced CYP3A4 expression in both
   PXR- and CAR-transfected HepG2 cells. However, treatment with the same
   concentrations of buprenorphine in HPHs resulted in literally no
   induction of CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 expression. Further studies indicated that
   buprenorphine could neither translocate human CAR to the nucleus nor
   activate CYP2B6/CYP3A4 reporter activities in transfected HPHs.
   Subsequent experiments to determine whether the differential response
   was due to buprenorphine's metabolic stability revealed a dramatically
   differential rate of elimination for buprenorphine between HPHs and
   HepG2 cells. Taken together, these studies indicate that metabolic
   stability of buprenorphine defines the differential induction of DMEs
   observed in HepG2 and HPHs, and the results obtained from PXR and CAR
   reporter assays in immortalized cell line require cautious
   interpretation.}},

   acting on VEGFR-2 was established. Through a 10-port column switcher,
   factions separated by VEGFR-CMC column (first dimension) were
   transferred and were adsorbed on an enrichment column. Then, these
   fractions were sent into LC/MS system (second dimension) immediately and
   directly for separation and preliminary identification, respectively.
   Sunitinib malate (SN) was used as positive control, while nifedipine
   (NF), dexamethasone acetate (DX), methoxyamine hydrochloride (MT) and
   atenolol (AT) as negative controls. The specification of this
   VEGFR-CMC-online-LC/MS method was validated by competitive displacement
   test. As a result, mesaconitine (MSC), aconitine (AC), and hypaconitine
   (HPC) were identified as the active constituents acting on VEGFR-2. The
   in vitro inhibition activity of starting extract of Aconitum carmichaeli
   Debx., MSC, AC, and HPC on HEK293/VEGFR cell viability by MTT test,
   separately. The in vitro inhibition activity of MSC, AC, and HPC on
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion of HEK293/VEGFR cell
   was tested by VEGF-ELISA assay. The screening results given by the
   system offered additional exemplification supporting this online
   coupling method and gave new evidence to the development of anti-tumor

Abstract = {{MnxNi0.5-xZn0.5Fe2O4 nanorods were successfully synthesized by the
   thermal treatment of rod-like precursors that were fabricated by the
   co-precipitation of Mn2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ in the lye. The phase,
   morphology, and particle diameter were examined by the X-ray diffraction
   and transmission electron microscopy. The magnetic properties of the
   samples were studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The results
   indicated that pure Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanorods with a diameter of 35 nm
   and an aspect ratio of 15 were prepared. It was found that the diameter
   of the MnxNi0.5-xZn0.5Fe2O4 (0 <= x <= 0.5) samples increased, the
   length and the aspect ratio decreased, with an increase in x value. When
   x=0.5, the diameter and the aspect ratio of the sample reached up to 50
   nm and 7-8, respectively. The coercivity of the samples first increased
   and then decreased with the increase in the x value. The coercivity of
   the samples again increased when the x value was higher than 0.4. When
   x=0.5, the coercivity of the MnxNi0.5-xZn0.5Fe2O4 sample reached the
   maximal value (134.3 Oe) at the calcinatiou temperature of 600 degrees
   C. The saturation magnetization of the samples first increased and then
   decreased with the increase in the x value.. When x=0.2, the saturation
   magnetization of the sample reached the maximal value (68.5 emu/g) at
   the calcination temperature of 800 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{The relativistic magnetron with diffraction output (MDO) is promising to
   be the most compact narrow band high power microwave source. In this
   paper, based on the theory of S-parameters, a method named ``choosing

   band. By means of S-parameters, the pi-TE31 mode conversion efficiencies
   of an S band MDO are calculated and then verified by three-dimensional
   particle-in-cell simulations. In order to illustrate the advantage of
   the choosing optimum method, the S-parameters of another L-band MDO are
   computed in a wide range of structure parameters and two results are
   chosen with detail information. Compared with the conventional method,
   the choosing optimum method is not only a shortcut, but also a
   convenient and easy way for choosing the high efficient MDOs in any wave
   band to meet the needs of different applications. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Existing works on distributed consensus explore linear iterations based
   on reversible Markov chains, which contribute to the slow convergence of
   the algorithms. It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive
   behavior of reversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from
   reversible ones mix substantially faster than the original chains. In
   this paper, the idea of Markov chain lifting is studied to accelerate
   the convergence of distributed consensus, and two general
   pseudoalgorithms are presented. These pseudoalgorithms are then
   instantiated through a class of location-aided distributed averaging
   (LADA) algorithms for wireless networks, where nodes' coarse location
   information is used to construct nonreversible chains that facilitate
   distributed computing and cooperative processing. Our first LADA
   algorithm is designed for grid networks; for a k x k grid network, it
   achieves an epsilon-averaging time of O(k log(epsilon(-1))). Based on
   this algorithm, in a wireless network with transmission range r, an
   epsilon-averaging time of O(r(-1) log(epsilon(-1))) can be attained
   through a centralized algorithm. Subsequently, a distributed LADA
   algorithm is presented, achieving the same scaling law in averaging time
   as the centralized scheme in wireless networks for all r satisfying the
   connectivity requirement; the constructed chain also attains the optimal
   scaling law in terms of an important mixing metric, the fill time, in
   its class. Finally, a cluster-based LADA algorithm is proposed, which,
   requiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of
   reduced message complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-dependent light curves and phase-resolved spectra of high-energy
   gamma-ray emission from the Crab pulsar have been detected recently by
   the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Within the framework of a
   two-pole, three-dimensional outer gap model, we calculate the
   energy-dependent light curves and phase-resolved spectra in the inertial
   observer's frame. Our results show that (1) the observed gamma-ray
   properties from both Fermi LAT and MAGIC can be reproduced well in this
   model; (2) the first peak of the light curves in the energy region less
   than similar to 10 GeV comes from the sum of emissions from both the
   north and south poles, and the second peak comes only from the emission
   from the south pole; however, the relative contribution of the two poles
   to the first peak changes with increasing gamma-ray energy, and the
   light curve in the energy region greater than similar to 20 GeV comes
   completely from the emission of the south pole; and (3) gamma-rays in
   the energy region greater than 100 MeV are produced through inverse
   Compton scattering from secondary pairs and the survival curvature
   photons, where the latter dominate over gamma-ray emission in the energy
   region greater than several GeV.}},

Abstract = {{Previous geochemical and microbiological studies in the Cariaco Basin
   indicate intense elemental cycling and a dynamic microbial loop near the
   oxic-anoxic interface. We obtained detailed distributions of sulfur
   isotopes of total dissolved sulfide and sulfate as part of the on-going
   CARIACO time series project to explore the critical pathways at the
   level of individual sulfur species. Isotopic patterns of sulfate
   (delta(34)S(SO4)) and sulfide (delta(34)S(H2S)) were similar to trends
   observed in the Black Sea water column: delta(34)S(H2S) and
   delta(34)S(SO4) were constant in the deep anoxic water (varying within
   0.6 parts per thousand for sulfide and 0.3 parts per thousand for
   sulfate), with sulfide roughly 54 parts per thousand depleted in (34)S
   relative to sulfate. Near the oxic anoxic interface, however, the
   delta(34)S(H2S) value was similar to 3 parts per thousand heavier than
   that in the deep water, which may reflect sulfide oxidation and/or a
   change in fractionation during in situ sulfide production through
   sulfate reduction (SR). delta(34)S(H2S) and Delta(33)S(H2S) data near
   the oxic anoxic interface did not provide unequivocal evidence to
   support the important role of sulfur-intermediate disproportionation
   suggested by previous studies. Repeated observation of minimum
   delta(34)S(SO4) values near the interface suggests `readdition' of
   (34)S-depleted sulfate during sulfide oxidation. A slight increase in
   delta(34)S(SO4) values with depth extended over the water column may
   indicate a reservoir effect associated with removal of (34)S-depleted
   sulfur during sulfide production through SR. Our delta(34)S(H2S) and
   Delta(33)S(H2S) data also do not show a clear role for
   sulfur-intermediate disproportionation in the deep anoxic water column.
   We interpret the large difference in delta(34)S between sulfate and
   sulfide as reflecting fractionations during SR in the Cariaco deep
   waters that are larger than those generally observed in culturing
   studies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   Population TB Control Pilot Project from Global Fund Round Five (GFR5)
   TB Control Program in China. During October 2006 to September 2008, the
   pilot project was implemented gradually in 60 counties in Tianjin,
   Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong and Guangdong. All
   quarterly reports of the pilot project were collected, and these
   materials were summarized and analyzed. In seven coastal provinces,
   19,584 active pulmonary TB (PTB) cases were registered among floating
   population in 2 years. Among the active PTB cases, 87.2\% were 15-45
   years old, and 62.8\% were male. In second year, 15,629 active PTB cases
   were registered, and the overall registration rate was 68 per 100,000
   people. DOT treatments were provided for 18,125 active PTB cases in 2
   years, and overall DOT treatment rate was 92.6\%. There were 3,955
   active PTB cases registered in first year, and the overall cure rate was
   86.0\%. Through the implementation of the pilot project, the TB case
   detection and treatment among floating population have been enhanced in
   pilot areas of China. The useful experience and results from the pilot

Abstract = {{It is inherent to food supply chain networks that performance deviations
   occur occasionally due to variations in product quality and quantity. To
   reduce losses, one wants to be informed about such deviations as soon as
   possible, preferably even before they occur. Then it is possible to take
   actions to prevent or reduce negative consequences.
   In practice, extensive operational data is recorded, forming a valuable
   source for early warning and proactive control systems, i.e. decision
   support systems for prediction and prevention of such performance
   problems. Data mining methods are ideal for analyzing such data sources
   and extracting useable information from them. In this paper, we present
   a novel framework for early warning and proactive control systems that
   combine expert knowledge and data mining methods to exploit recorded
   data. We discuss the implementation of a prototype system and the
   experiences from a case study regarding the applicability of the

Abstract = {{This work developed a two-steps synthesis of silver-copper composite
   nanoparticles by dextrose reduction and with the addition of urea.
   Wherein, a part of the silver nanoparticles were prepared at first and
   were characterized by TEM image and EDX analysis, such that they could
   be the seeds for following the reduction of silver incorporated with
   copper in the colloids. In addition, the results of the study on thermal
   behavior of these kinds of particles has shown that with 5 h-heating,
   the copper on the particle surface would be partially oxidized at 200
   degrees C, and complete oxidation of all the copper inside the composite
   occurred at 350 degrees C. After proper purification and concentration,
   20 wt\% Ag-Cu colloids as an ink was filled into a felt-tip pen and
   written on a substrate to make conducting lines. We also have
   demonstrated that the addition of copper to silver was helpful in
   reducing the electrical migration encountered by pure silver conducting
   lines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effective tiller number is one of the most important traits for wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, but the inheritance of tillering is poorly
   understood. A set of 168 doubled haploid (DH) lines derivatives of a
   cross between two winter wheat cultivars (Huapei 3 and Yumai 57), and an
   immortalized F-2 (IF2) population generated by randomly permutated
   intermating of these DHs were investigated, and QTLs of tillering
   related to the maximum tillering of pre-winter (MTW), maximum tillering
   in spring (MTS), and effective tillering in harvest (ETH) were mapped.
   Phenotypic data were collected for the two populations from two
   different environments. Using inclusive composite interval mapping
   (ICIM), a total of 9 and 18 significant QTL were detected across
   environments for tillering in the DH and IF2 populations, respectively.
   Four QTLs were common between two populations. A major QTL located on
   the 5D chromosome with the allele originating from Yumai 57 was detected
   and increased 1.92 and 3.55 tillers in MTW and MTS, respectively. QTLs
   (QMts6D, QEth6D) having a neighbouring marker interval at Xswes679.1 and
   Xcfa2129 on chromosome 6D was detected in MIS and ETH. These results
   provide a better understanding of the genetic factors for selectively
   expressing the control of tiller number in different growth stages and
   facilitate marker-assisted selection strategy in breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The data from typical boreholes in the southern Jianghan basin were
   modeled using the geothermal history simulation system of
   hydrocarbon-bearing basin, and the thermal history and burial history
   were reconstructed. Based on the thermal history, maturity evolution of
   the Lower Silurian source rocks was modeled. The results show that the
   basin was in a stable stage before Indosinian movement, the paleo-heat
   flow was between 50 mW/m(2) and 55 mW/m(2). After Indosinian period, the
   heat flow was elevated in the whole basin. In Yanshan period (155 Ma or
   so), The heat flow reached their maximum values of 72 mW/m2 at 155 Ma in
   the north of the Qianbei Fault, The heat flows reached their maximum
   values of similar to 76 mW/m(2) at 40 Ma in the south of the Qianbei
   Fault. Since the late Himalayan epoch, the Jianghan basin was subjected
   to a deposition withering period accompanied by a cooling episode. In
   early Triassic, the maturity of source rocks in Zhijiang, Dangyang and
   Mianyang depression area first reached oil generation threshold, the
   maturity of source rocks increased rapidly during early Jurassic to
   early Cretaceous. The maturity was higher in the north of the Qianbei
   Fault than in the south of the Qianbei Fault. Based on this, in Late
   Cretaceous, the maturity of source rocks in the east area was higher
   than in the west area. The thermal evolution of source rocks terminated
   in the later Neogene. The heat flow history and Lower Silurian source
   rocks maturity evolution was calculated, which provides the basic data
   for source rocks evolution, hydrocarbon generation and expulsion
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{The mollusk shell mobilizes calcium from environment for skeletal
   mineralization. This occurs through synthesizing solids in solution in
   the presence of organic molecules of specific interior regions of the
   conch shell. The ultrastructure and microhardness of the Hemifusus tuba
   conch shell living in the Huang/Bo sea area are investigated in the
   paper. It is shown that the composition and microstructure of the
   mollusk shell vary in different positions. The prodissoconch shell
   consists only of aragonite with the crossed-lamellar microstructure.
   While the spiral shell and the body shell of the Hemifusus tuba conch
   shell are composed of one calcite layer and several aragonite layers.
   The calcite layer consists of cylindrical grains, but the aragonite
   layers are crossed-lamellar ultrastructure at three size scales. The
   minimum structure size (the third-order lamella) is at about 20 nm - 80
   nm. The margin of shell aperture is only composed of calcite with
   cylindrical grains. This natural optimization of the shell
   microstructure is intimately due to the growth of the organic matrix. At
   different positions the microhardness of mollusc shell is different due
   to different crystal structures and crystal arrangements. The growth
   process of shells allows a constant renewal of the material, thus
   enabling their functional adaptation to external environments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tourette Syndrome (TS) has been linked to both genetic and
   environmental factors. Gene-expression studies provide valuable insight
   into the causes of TS; however, many studies of gene expression in IS do

   investigate the effects of medication on gene expression in TS patients,
   RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of 20 medicated TS subjects
   (MED) and 23 unmedicated TS subjects (UNMED), and quantified using
   whole-genome Affymetrix microarrays. Results: D2 dopamine receptor
   expression correlated positively with tic severity in MED but not UNMED.
   GABA(A) receptor epsilon subunit expression negatively correlated with
   tic severity in UNMED but not MED. Phenylethanolamine
   N-methyltransferase expression positively correlated with tic severity
   in UNMED but not MED. Conclusion: Modulation of tics by TS medication is
   associated with changes in dopamine, norepinephrine and GABA pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) on the physical properties of
   poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and on the formation of crystalline domains
   was investigated. The presence of CO(2) in the matrix was found to
   induce crystallization in PLLA, with the crystallinity increasing with
   increasing CO(2) pressure. The combination of saturation conditions and
   formation of crystalline domains was studied for its effect on the
   formation of porous morphologies in PLLA. Moreover, the effect of CO(2)
   on PLLA properties and formation of porous structures was further
   exploited by first creating crystalline domains in samples using CO(2)
   at various pressures at 25 degrees C and then re-saturating the same
   samples with CO(2) at a constant pressure of 2.8 MPa and 0 degrees C.
   This paper reports on the solubility of CO(2) at 25 and 0 degrees C in
   PLLA, crystallization and subsequent effect on foam morphologies when
   processed using different saturation cycles. Unique and intriguing
   morphologies were obtained by specifically controlling the properties of

Abstract = {{Children often talk themselves through their activities, producing
   private speech that is internalized to form inner speech. This study
   assessed the effect of articulatory suppression (which suppresses
   private and inner speech) on Tower of London performance in 7- to
   10-year-olds, relative to performance in a control condition with a
   nonverbal secondary task. Experiment 1 showed no effect of articulatory
   suppression on performance with the standard Tower of London procedure;
   we interpret this in terms of a lack of planning in our sample.
   Experiment 2 used a modified procedure in which participants were forced
   to plan ahead. Performance in the articulatory suppression condition was
   lower than that in the control condition, consistent with a role for
   self-directed (private and inner) speech in planning. On problems of
   intermediate difficulty, participants producing more private speech in
   the control condition showed greater susceptibility to interference from
   articulatory suppression than their peers, suggesting that articulatory
   suppression interfered with performance by blocking self-directed
   (private and inner) speech. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the oil industry, colloidal stability indices based only on the crude
   oil composition are used to evaluate asphaltene stability. However, as
   shown in the literature, such indices are unable to correctly determine
   the behavior of asphaltenes in crude oils. In this study, the dipole
   moments of the model structures of asphaltene molecules were calculated,
   and it was found that asphaltenes from unstable crude oils are more
   polar than those from stable crude oils. Thus, asphaltene precipitation
   and deposition depend on the polarity of asphaltenes. On the basis of
   obtained results, a new colloidal stability index for crude oils is
   proposed. It takes into account both the crude oil composition and the
   polarity of crude oil components. Using sixteen crude oils as an
   example, it was shown that the new index is capable of predicting
   asphaltene precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of predatory phantom midge (Chaoborus flavicans) larvae on
   the density and size estimates of crustacean zooplankton with different
   time lags between sampling and sample preservation were studied.
   Chaoborid larvae may easily be included in zooplankton samples,
   especially if samples are taken with net hauls. Five larvae included in
   a sample had a significant negative effect on the density estimate of
   daphnids, cyclopoid and calanoid copepods, and cyclopoid nauplii. When
   chaoborids were included in the samples, a three-hour preservation lag
   caused a >5\% underestimation of population density estimate of
   cyclopoids and a six hour lag resulted in a 10\% error. In field
   studies, chaoborids usually prefer small cladocerans such as bosminids
   as prey, but in the restricted space of the sample containers escape
   ability of cyclopoids was diminished. As a result, cyclopoids were the
   main prey of chaoborids. Chaoborids had no effect on the mean individual
   size of any of the taxa, but in the reference samples the mean size of
   daphnids and calanoids was reduced. This, as well as the reduced density
   of cyclopid nauplii in the reference samples, was attributed to
   predation by cyclopoids. The results emphasized that zooplankton samples
   should be preserved immediately after the sample haul.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Motor neurone disease has traditionally been considered a pure motor
   syndrome which spares aspects of cognition and behaviour, although in
   recent years it has been suggested that up to 50\% of patients with
   motor neurone disease may develop frontal dysfunction which, in some
   cases, is severe enough to reach criteria for frontotemporal dementia.
   We review the cognitive and behavioural changes in motor neurone disease
   emphasizing the recent advances.
   Recent findings
   A major advance in pathology has been the recent discovery of TDP-43 and
   FUS inclusions as the key components in cases of motor neurone disease,
   frontotemporal dementia-motor neurone disease and some cases with pure
   frontotemporal dementia. In addition, mutations in TARDBP and FUS genes
   have been reported in recent years. Longitudinal studies showed that
   progression of cognitive impairment over the course of motor neurone
   disease appears to be mild and occurs only in a proportion of motor
   neurone disease patients. The presence of cognitive impairment seems to
   be related to a faster disease and a shorter survival.
   Summary
   Motor neurone disease is a multi-system disorder which overlaps with
   frontotemporal dementia. Behavioural and cognitive changes appear to
   occur in a subset of patients with motor neurone disease, but the cause
   of this variability remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Although the positive association between religiosity and life
   satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical
   controversy surrounds the question of how religion actually shapes life
   satisfaction. Using a new panel dataset, this study offers strong
   evidence for social and participatory mechanisms shaping religion's
   impact on life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that religious people
   are more satisfied with their lives because they regularly attend
   religious services and build social networks in their congregations. The
   effect of within-congregation friendship is contingent, however, on the
   presence of a strong religious identity. We find little evidence that
   other private or subjective aspects of religiosity affect life
   satisfaction independent of attendance and congregational friendship.}},

Abstract = {{The development of larvae and pupae of Idaea inquinata (Scopoli) was
   studied at two different temperatures, relative humidities and
   photoperiods. Tests were carried out at 26 +/- 1 degrees C and 29 +/- 1
   degrees C, 50 +/- 5\% RH and 70 5\% RH, photoperiod 16L:8D and 0L:24D.
   The highest mortality was observed at 29 degrees C, with 50 and 70\% RH
   and 16L:8D. The larval development was longest (64 days) at 26 and 29
   +/- 1 degrees C, 50 +/- 5\% RH and 16L:8D, and shortest (23 days) at 29
   +/- 1 degrees C, 50 and 70 5\% RH, and 0L:24D. The analysis of the mean
   lengths of the development of larvae at different temperatures and
   relative humidity with the 16L:8D showed that the developmental time of
   larvae decreases with increasing relative humidity. This factor was
   significant, while the effect of the increase of temperature and the
   interaction between the temperature and relative humidity was not
   significant. At 0L:24D a decrease of the developmental time of larvae
   was observed when temperature was increased, both at 50 and at 70\% RH.
   The developmental time of pupae was between 4 and 15 days, the shortest
   mean developmental time with a highest number of alive individuals was
   observed at 29 +/- 1 degrees C, and 0L:24D, and both levels of relative
   humidity. The pupal developmental time showed small differences at the
   two relative humidities, with the exception of 26 +/- 1 degrees C and
   16L:8D at 50 +/- 5 \% RH where the mean development time was 10.7 days
   (+/-1.3 SD), and at 70 +/- 5 \% RH with mean duration of 9.1 days
   (+/-1.6 SD). The photoperiod influenced the length of development in I.
   inquinato as the shortest mean development periods were observed in the
   tests carried out with 0L:24D.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer solar cells (PSC) based on blended poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   and {[}6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were fabricated
   with a non-halogenic solvent-tetralin-as the casting solvent for the
   active layer, and the morphology of the active layer was optimized by
   varying the casting conditions to obtain high efficiency and thermal
   stability from the PSCs. Tetralin as the casting solvent caused
   excessive P3HT and PCBM aggregations and hence dismal performance
   {[}power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 0.5\%] due to its low volatility
   and high dissolution power, which enhanced the plasticizing effect of
   residual solvent during the formation of the active layer. Accelerated
   removal of the residual solvent by a vacuum drying treatment greatly
   reduced the aggregations and improved the PCE to 2.4\%, but the
   improvement was limited because the rapid drying inhibited full
   developments of continuous charge-transport pathways and of P3HT
   crystallinity, both of which are critical for charge transport through
   the device. The desirable morphology-minimal aggregations but high phase
   continuity and P3HT crystallinity-was obtained with a low-temperature
   drying process, which limited P3HT/PCBM aggregations and enhanced
   nucleation of P3HT crystallites, resulting in a finely interconnected
   P3HT crystal network that provided both large bulk-heterojunction area
   and facile hole-transport pathways. The resultant PSCs obtained a high
   PCE of 3.7\%, and because of the morphological rigidity of the P3HT
   crystal network, showed excellent stability for extended duration at
   elevated temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification
   of oxyresveratrol analog trans-2,4,3 `, 5 ` tetramethoxystilbene
   (oxyresveratrol tetramethyl ether, OTE) in rat plasma. Chromatographic
   separation was achieved on an RP-HPLC column, which was protected by a
   guard column through a 12 min gradient delivery of a mixture of
   acetonitrile-water at 50 degrees C. The UV absorbance at 325 nm was
   recorded. The retention time of OTE and trans-stilbene (internal
   standard) was about 7.7 and 8.4 min, respectively. The calibration
   curves were linear (R-2 >= 0.9986) with a lower limit of quantification
   of 15 ng/mL. The intra-and inter-day variations, in terms of RSD, were
   all lower than 9.8\% while the intra-day and inter-day bias ranged from
   -8.3 to +9.2\%. The pharmacokinetics of OTE was assessed in rats using
   2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as a dosing vehicle. After intravenous
   administration, OTE possessed a long terminal elimination half-life
   (t(1/2 lambda z) = 481 +/- 137 min) and slow clearance (Cl = 29.1 +/-
   3.7 mL/min/kg). Upon oral administration, OTE was rapidly absorbed.
   However, it only displayed minimal plasma exposure and its absolute oral
   bioavailability (F) was as low as 4.5 +/- 3.2\%. Fortunately, the levels
   of OTE after single oral administration were sufficient to inhibit human
   cytochrome P450 1B1. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of water treatment at 473 K on the phase and morphology of
   the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics was studied. It was implied that a AlO(OH)
   layer was formed on the surface of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics, at the
   same time LiAl2(OH)(7)center dot xH(2)O was obtained in the water. The
   process of the interaction between gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics and water was
   deduced. The attempts to improve the water compatibility of gamma-LiAlO2
   ceramics were made. It was confirmed that the surface modification by
   LiAl5O8 decreased the surface alkalinity and restrained the hydrolysis
   of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics in water due to the low hydrolysis of the
   lithium deficient phase LiAl5O8. The experimental results revealed that
   the introduction of the lithium deficient phase. LiAl5O8, effectively
   improved the water compatibility of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Microaggregation is commonly used to protect microdata from individual
   identification by anonymizing dataset records such that the resulting
   dataset (called the anonymized dataset) satisfies the k-anonymity
   constraint. Since this anonymizing process degrades data quality, an
   effective microaggregation approach must ensure the quality of the
   anonymized dataset so that the anonymized dataset remains useful for
   further analysis. Therefore, the performance of a microaggregation
   approach should be measured by the quality of the anonymized dataset
   generated by the microaggregation approach. Previous studies often refer
   to the quality of an anonymized dataset as information loss. This study
   takes a different approach. Since an anonymized dataset should support
   further analysis, this study first builds a classifier from the
   anonymized dataset, and then uses the prediction accuracy of that
   classifier to represent the quality of the anonymized dataset.
   Performance results indicate that low information loss does not
   necessarily translate into high prediction accuracy, and vice versa.
   This is particularly true when the information losses of both anonymized
   datsets do not differ significantly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to obtain a high-performance surface on P110 steel that can
   meet the requirements in oil/gas field environment, the chromium
   coatings were fabricated by pack cementation. The chromium coatings
   differed in with/without the addition of La2O3. Scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), X-ray
   diffractometer (XRD) and microhardness tester were employed to
   investigate the surface morphologies, surface element distributions,
   microstructures, phase constitutions and microhardness of the coatings.
   Friction-wear tests of the P110 steel substrate and the coatings were
   conducted in air at ambient temperature and humidity. The results show
   that uniform and continuous coatings are formed on P110 steel regardless
   of adding La2O3 or not. The chromium coatings consist of Cr23C6, Cr7C3,
   and (Cr, Fe)(7)C-3. The La2O3-added chromium coating is more beneficial
   in terms of surface morphology, microstructure, thickness and
   microhardness as compared with the coating without adding La2O3.
   Chromizing treatment significantly improves the surface hardness and
   wear resistance of the P110 steel. The wear resistance of the tested
   samples can be sorted in the following sequence: La2O3-coating>no
   RE-coating>bare P110 steel.}},

Abstract = {{All living cells need zinc ions to support cell growth. Zrt-, Irt-like
   proteins (ZIPs) represent a major route for entry of zinc ions into
   cells, but how ZIPs promote zinc uptake has been unclear. Here we report
   the molecular characterization of ZIPB from Bordetella bronchiseptica,
   the first ZIP homolog to be purified and functionally reconstituted into
   proteoliposomes. Zinc flux through ZIPB was found to be nonsaturable and
   electrogenic, yielding membrane potentials as predicted by the Nernst
   equation. Conversely, membrane potentials drove zinc fluxes with a
   linear voltage-flux relationship. Direct measurements of metal uptake by
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy demonstrated that ZIPB is
   selective for two group 12 transition metal ions, Zn2+ and Cd2+, whereas
   rejecting transition metal ions in groups 7 through 11. Our results
   provide the molecular basis for cellular zinc acquisition by a
   zinc-selective channel that exploits in vivo zinc concentration
   gradients to move zinc ions into the cytoplasm.}},

Abstract = {{In a global economic environment, many enterprises expend their overseas
   markets and implement outsourcing of logistics activities to external
   carriers. Many enterprises pay close attention to successful delivery of
   their freight. Hence, how to determine the optimal carrier selection is
   a very critical issue for global enterprises. Generally, there are
   several carriers to serve on each route connecting two cities (or
   transfer stations) in the logistics network. Each carrier owns multiple
   available capacities with a probability distribution because the
   carrier's capacity may be partially reserved for other orders. A carrier
   selection means selecting exact one carrier on each route, and the
   logistics network according to the carrier selection is thus a
   stochastic logistic network. The network reliability is a performance
   index of freight delivery for supply chain management and is defined as
   the probability that d units of commodity are successfully transmitted
   from a supplier to a customer. This study focuses on the optimal carrier
   selection problem based on network reliability criterion. A GA-based
   algorithm that combines the minimal paths and the recursive sum of
   disjoint products is developed to determine the optimal carrier
   selection with the maximal network reliability. A practical logistics
   example of the LCD monitors delivery from Asia to Europe is presented to
   illustrate the solution procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background aims. In vitro cultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are
   characterized by a short proliferative lifespan, an increasing loss of
   proliferation capacity and progressive reduction of differentiation
   potential. Laminin-1, laminin-5, collagen IV and fibronectin are
   important constituents of the basement membrane extracellular matrix
   (ECM) that are involved in a variety of cellular activities, including
   cell attachment and motility. Methods and results. The in vitro
   proliferation capacity of MSC was significantly improved when the cells
   were incubated in the presence of basement membrane ECM proteins. For
   example, a mixture of proteins improved proliferation capacity 250-fold
   in comparison with standard conditions after five passages. Furthermore,
   in colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assays colony numbers and size
   were significantly extended. Blocking specific integrin cell-surface
   receptors, positive effects on the proliferation capacity of MSC were
   inhibited. Additionally, when MSC were co-cultivated with ECM proteins,
   cells maintained their multipotential differentiation capacity
   throughout many culture passages in comparison with cells cultivated on
   plastic. However, expansion of MSC on laminin-5 suppressed any
   subsequent chondrogenic differentiation. Conclusions. Our results
   suggest that expansion of bone marrow-derived MSC in the presence of ECM
   proteins is a powerful approach for generating large numbers of MSC,
   showing a prolonged capacity to differentiate into mesodermal cell
   lineages, with the exception of the lack of chondrogenesis by using
   laminin-5 coating.}},

Abstract = {{A 60-day feeding trial was carried out to investigate the effect of iron
   on growth, body composition and digestive enzyme activities Diets with
   seven levels of iron (53 9, 90 0, 115 6, 146 1 1760, 215 8 and 266 0 mg
   iron kg(-1) diet) were fed to Jian carp (initial weight 11 4 +/- 0 0 g)
   Per cent weight gain (PWG), feed efficiency (FE) and protein efficiency
   ratio were the lowest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0 05) Body protein
   content was increased with the increasing iron levels (P < 0 05) but
   moisture lipid and ash of fish were not significantly affected by
   dietary iron levels (P > 0 05) Activities of trypsin lipase alpha
   amylase Na+ K I ATPase alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl
   transpeptidase were improved with increasing dietary iron levels Serum
   iron were significantly enhanced with dietary iron levels up to 146 1 mg
   iron kg(-1) diet, and plateaued In conclusion iron improved digestive
   enzyme activities of juvenile Jian carp and the dietary iron requirement
   for serum iron of juvenile Jian carp (11 4-64 0 g) was 147 4 mg iron

Abstract = {{Intrusive imagery is considered to be an important feature in
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The aim of the present study was to
   investigate whether this imagery has distinctive features relative to
   other anxiety disorders. Twenty out of twenty-one (95\%) individuals
   with OCD and twenty out of twenty-two (90\%) anxious controls reported
   intrusive images. The groups were compared on the prevalence, number,
   frequency, characteristics and content of the images, together with
   associated beliefs, interpretations, and memories of earlier adverse
   events. Intrusive images in OCD were distinguished from those in other
   anxiety disorders by their greater frequency, more frequent adoption of
   a field perspective, and lesser degree of association with memories.
   Their content more often contained themes of `unacceptable ideas of
   harm', and implied a `dangerous self. These findings have implications
   for the use of therapeutic interventions in OCD and suggest that imagery
   rescripting may have a useful role to play. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   critical for STIM1-mediated gating}},

Abstract = {{Store-operated Ca2+ entry is controlled by the interaction of stromal
   interaction molecules (STIMs) acting as endoplasmic reticulum ER Ca2+
   sensors with calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels
   (CRACM1/2/3 or Orai1/2/3) in the plasma membrane. Here, we report
   structural requirements of STIM1-mediated activation of CRACM1 and
   CRACM3 using truncations, point mutations, and CRACM1/CRACM3 chimeras.
   In accordance with previous studies, truncating the N-terminal region of
   CRACM1 or CRACM3 revealed a 20-amino acid stretch close to the plasma
   membrane important for channel gating. Exchanging the N-terminal region
   of CRACM3 with that of CRACM1 (CRACM3-N(M1)) results in accelerated
   kinetics and enhanced current amplitudes. Conversely, transplanting the
   N-terminal region of CRACM3 into CRACM1 (CRACM1-N(M3)) leads to severely
   reduced store-operated currents. Highly conserved amino acids (K85 in
   CRACM1 and K60 in CRACM3) in the N-terminal region close to the first
   transmembrane domain are crucial for STIM1-dependent gating of CRAC
   channels. Single-point mutations of this residue (K85E and K60E)
   eliminate store-operated currents induced by inositol
   1,4,5-trisphosphate and reduce store-independent gating by
   2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. However, short fragments of these mutant
   channels are still able to communicate with the CRAC-activating domain
   of STIM1. Collectively, these findings identify a single amino acid in
   the N terminus of CRAC channels as a critical element for store-operated
   gating of CRAC channels.}},

Abstract = {{Policy-making in Europe with respect to migrant population problems
   builds on an integration-citizenship-social cohesion nexus representing
   a holistic ambition where each nation state manifests its own presumed
   national-cultural order as normative. Migrant-related issues thus become
   couched in idioms focusing on culture, ethnicity and identity. The
   shortcomings of this approach are discussed with reference to the shape
   of immigration-related social issues. The article also indicates how the
   representation of problem issues through the
   integration-citizenship-social cohesion nexus opens for conflicts, not
   just between migrants and autochthonous, but also between segments in
   the host populations. A main argument is made to the effect that we need
   a much better understanding of how the receiving countries' national and
   other contingencies shape migrant lives.}},

Abstract = {{Pitch-based spherical activated carbon (PSAC) was modified by gas
   mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen adsorption was used to obtain
   the pore structure of the PSAC. The phenol adsorption performance of the
   PSAC before and after modification was investigated. Results showed that
   there is no obvious texture change of PSAC after air oxidation. When the
   PSAC was modified with a gas mixture having an oxygen content of 20\%
   for 5 h at 400 degrees C and 450 degrees C, the surface acidic groups
   increased from 0. 11 to 1. 22, 1. 60 meq/g, while basic groups decreased
   from 0.52 to 0.03, 0.02 meq/g, respectively. The adsorption capacity of
   phenol on the PSAC decreased as the surface acidic groups increased
   because its wettability was improved. Water molecules were more
   competitive for the adsorption sites than the adsorbate in such a
   situation. The adsorption isotherms of phenol on PSAC changed from type
   L to type S with an increase of surface acidic groups.}},

Abstract = {{Time-stability of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnet with lower content of oxygen
   at different temperatures and humidity conditions for 400 d was
   investigated. Results showed that the magnetic flux loss was -0.68\% for
   the non-electroplating samples and -0.43\% for the electroplating
   samples at room temperature and average humidity was 25\% during 400 d,
   respectively. The magnetic flux loss of the plated samples was lower
   than non-plated samples under the conditions of room temperature and
   with the average humidity of 54\%, but the magnetic flux loss of the
   plated samples was larger than that of the non-plated sample at 80
   degrees C. The magnetic flux loss of electroplated and non-electroplated
   sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets was less than 1\% for 400 d, which showed that
   the N40SH grade magnets have good time stability.}},

Abstract = {{A novel miniature monopole tag antenna for passive Ultra-High Frequency
   (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) operation is presented. The
   antenna possesses a two-sided structure that is printed on an FR4
   substrate and fed by a 50-Omega microstrip line. Be properly using
   helical strips and vial, the antenna size can be reduced to a small
   volume of 10 (L) X 9.5 (W) x 0.8 (H) mm(3) to be easily integrated
   within various portable devices. A miniaturized quasi-lumped circuit is
   also designed to attain a good impedance matching between the antenna
   and the chip. Experimental results demonstrate that the antenna has a
   suitable operating band about 914-939 MHz and also quite omnidirectional
   radiation pattern with appreciable gain. Moreover, the proposed compact
   tag antenna, capable of achieving a maximum readable range of about 5.6
   m with an EIRP equal to 4 W, is well suited for RFID applications. (C)

   investigate the effect of alloy elements (Al, Mn and Si in the steel

Abstract = {{Separation of bacterial cells from soil is a key step in the
   construction of metagenomic BAC libraries with large DNA inserts. Our
   results showed that when combined with sodium pyro-phosphate and
   homogenization for soil dispersion, sucrose density gradient
   centrifugation (SDGC) was more effective at separating bacteria from
   soil than was low speed centrifugation (LSC). More than 70\% of the
   cells, along with some soil colloids, were recovered with one round of
   centrifugation. A solution of 0.8\% NaCl was used to resuspend these
   cell and soil pellets for purification with nycodenz density gradient
   centrifugation (NDGC). After purification, more than 30\% of the
   bacterial cells in the primary soil were extracted. This procedure
   effectively removed soil contamination and yielded sufficient cells for
   high molecular weight (HMW) DNA isolation. Ribosomal intergenic spacer
   analysis (RISA) showed that the microbial community structure of the
   extracted cells was similar to that of the primary soil, suggesting that
   this extraction procedure did not significantly change the the soil
   bacteria community structure. HMW DNA was isolated from bacterial cells
   extracted from red soil for metagenomic BAC library construction. This
   library contained DNA inserts of more than 200 Mb with an average size

Abstract = {{The in vivo effects of oral administration of the high-chromium yeast to
   healthy and diabetic mice are described. Given that these complexes are
   proposed to function by potentiating the actions of insulin and
   activating the insulin receptor kinase, changes in lipid and
   carbohydrate metabolism would be expected. After 15 weeks administration
   (500 mu g Cr/kg body mass) to healthy mice, abnormal metabolism and
   pathological change were not observed. After 15 weeks of treatment
   (0-1,000 mu g Cr/kg body mass) of diabetic mice, the effect of
   high-chromium yeast on blood lipids and blood glycosylated hemoglobin
   (GHb) of diabetes are not consistent. High-chromium yeast results in a
   lowering (P<0.05) of GHb and triglyceride, lowering (P<0.01) of total
   cholesterol, and restoration (P<0.01) of insulin; these results are in
   stark contrast to those of diabetic mice of administration of normal
   yeast, which have no effect on these parameters and serve as control
   group. The histopathological analysis of pancreas islet shows that
   high-chromium yeast could profoundly protect the impaired pancreatic

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate color and microvascular blood flow of the
   tongue in the mini-swine with immune hepatic injury.
   Methods: Six Chinese. mini-swine for experimental use, 3 males and 3
   females, were randomly divided into two groups, normal group and model
   group, 3 swine in each group. The swine in the model group was
   administrated by injection of 5 mg/kg ConA into the vein of auricular
   back, once every other day, 3 times each week, for 2 weeks in total. The
   animal in the control group was administrated with equal volume of
   saline. At 9 o'clock in the morning of the 15th day of the experiment,
   each swine was anesthetized with intramuscular injection of 9 ml 2.5\%
   pentobarbital sodium and 3 ml Maleate, and then picture of the tongue
   was taken, microvascular blood flow on the tongue and the liver was
   detected with a laser Doppler blood flowmeter; Blood was taken from the
   precaval vein. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST),total bilirubin (Tbil) and total protein (TP)
   were determined; Pathological changes of the liver and tongue tissues
   were investigated by means of HE staining; Serum TNF-alpha content was
   detected with ELISA assay.
   Results: In the mini-swine with immune hepatic injury induced by ConA,
   the tongue color showed cyanotic color, microvascular perfusion in the
   liver and the tongue, and partial pressure of oxygen in the tongue
   tissue significantly decreased; and the microcirculatory perfusion of
   the tongue was significantly correlated with that of the liver and,the
   HIS color spatial value of the tongue; Serum TNF-a content significantly
   increased.
   Conclusion: The mini-swine with immune hepatic injury induced by ConA
   conforms to pathological characteristics. of immune hepatic injury.
   Formation of the cyanotic tongue is related with microcirculatory
   disturbance of the tongue, which can indirectly reflect hepatic
   microcirculatory state in the immune hepatic injury.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a load dispatch model for the system consisting of both
   thermal generators and wind turbines is developed. The stochastic wind
   power is included in the model as a constraint. It is shown that, under
   certain conditions, the presented model has a set of closed-form
   solutions. The availability of closed-form solutions is helpful to gain
   more fundamental insights, such as the impact of a particular parameter
   on the optimal solution. Moreover, the feasible ranges of optimal
   solutions are given in the case that the output power of thermal
   turbines is restricted. Furthermore, the probability distribution and
   the average of solutions are derived. This is called the wait-and-see
   approach in the discipline of stochastic programming. The present work
   shows that the effects of random wind speed on the generated power can
   be readily assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge (SMB) has been widely used as a traditional
   Chinese medicine for a long time, and today more and more attention has
   been paid to the effective components in Chinese traditional medicine,
   especially to rare earth elements (REEs). 14 kinds of REEs in SMB from
   different areas were analyzed by the methods of ICP-MS. The results
   showed that the total concentration of REEs (as REO, the same below)
   ranged from 8.43 (as dry weight, the same below) to 37.30 mg/kg, and the
   concentrations of La, Ce and Nd were higher than 2 mg/kg except Nd in
   SMB from Beijing. So the total concentration of REEs in SMB was much
   higher than that in rice, corn and barley, which could be the mechanism
   of curative effect of SMB on cardiovascular cerebrovascular system,
   digestive system, respiratory system, countershock and antibiotic. The
   character of other elements and the content of REEs in soil from
   different areas should be responsible for the difference, but the
   allocation mechanism of REEs in SMB should be further studied.}},

Abstract = {{The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) yellow variegated2 (var2) mutant
   has green- and white-sectored leaves due to loss of VAR2, a subunit of
   the chloroplast FtsH protease/chaperone complex. Suppressor screens are
   a valuable tool to gain insight into VAR2 function and the mechanism of
   var2 variegation. Here, we report the molecular characterization of
   004-003, a line in which var2 variegation is suppressed. We found that
   the suppression phenotype in this line is caused by lack of a
   chloroplast pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that we named
   SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION7 (SVR7). PPR proteins contain tandemly
   repeated PPR motifs that bind specific RNAs, and they are thought to be
   central regulators of chloroplast and mitochondrial nucleic acid
   metabolism in plants. The svr7 mutant has defects in chloroplast
   ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing that are different from those in other
   svr mutants, and these defects are correlated with reductions in the
   accumulation of some chloroplast proteins, directly or indirectly. We
   also found that whereas var2 displays a leaf variegation phenotype at 22
   degrees C, it has a pronounced chlorosis phenotype at 8 degrees C that
   is correlated with defects in chloroplast rRNA processing and a drastic
   reduction in chloroplast protein accumulation. Surprisingly, the
   cold-induced phenotype of var2 cannot be suppressed by svr7. Our results
   strengthen the previously established linkage between var2 variegation
   and chloroplast rRNA processing/chloroplast translation, and they also
   point toward the possibility that VAR2 mediates different activities in
   chloroplast biogenesis at normal and chilling temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{How to extract optimal composite attributes from a variety of
   conventional seismic attributes to detect reservoir features is a
   reservoir predication key, which is usually solved by reducing
   dimensionality. Principle component analysis (PCA) is the most
   widely-used linear dimensionality reduction method at present. However,
   the relationships between seismic attributes and reservoir features are
   non-linear, so seismic attribute dimensionality reduction based on
   linear transforms can't solve non-linear problems well, reducing
   reservoir prediction precision. As a new non-linear learning method,
   manifold learning supplies a new method for seismic attribute analysis.
   It can discover the intrinsic features and rules hidden in the data by
   computing low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of
   high-dimensional inputs. In this paper, we try to extract seismic
   attributes using locally linear embedding (LLE), realizing inter-horizon
   attributes dimensionality reduction of 3D seismic data first and discuss
   the optimization of its key parameters. Combining model analysis and,
   case studies, we compare the dimensionality reduction and clustering
   effects of LLE and PCA, both of which indicate that LLE can retain the
   intrinsic structure of the inputs. The composite attributes and
   clustering results based on LLE better characterize the distribution of
   sedimentary facies, reservoir, and even reservoir fluids.}},

Abstract = {{In gasohol, the concentration of aqueous ethanol should be further
   increased from 95.6 \% (by mass) to 99.5 \% (by mass) by dehydration. In
   industrial processes, zeolite 3A is usually applied for alcohol - water
   separation. However, it adsorbs ethanol and water at a similar level
   (uptake of water/uptake of ethanol =. 2.01), resulting in inefficient
   separation. In this study, potato starch was chosen as an adsorption
   material because of its very high selectivity and greater capacity for
   water (uptake of water/uptake of ethanol = 64.18). Conversely, the
   adsorption capacity of potato starch after regeneration will be
   substantially reduced, requiring further modification of the material.
   After regeneration, the unmodified starch decreased its adsorption
   capacity by 19.70 \%, while the immobilized starch had a slight decrease
   of only 0.56 \%. The sol gel process was used to immobilize the starch,
   and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm was obtained to describe the
   immobilized sorbent. The selectivity of the immobilized starch sorbent
   had a ratio of 4.39 (water to ethanol). Compared to the zeolite 3A in
   the industrial dehydration process, this selectivity of immobilized
   starch is almost double that of zeolite 3A. The Langmuir model best
   describes the experimental isotherm curve of the selected sorbents.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the functional profile of dendritic cells
   (DCs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the effects of
   simvastatin on the function of DCs. A total of 40 patients who was
   recently diagnosed as having RA were equally assigned to two groups: the
   routine treatment group (group R) and the routine treatment plus
   simvastatin group (group R+S). Twenty healthy individuals served as
   control. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
   before and 4 weeks after the treatment and then cultured with
   interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory
   factor (GM-CSF) to prepare mature DCs. The expression of co-stimulating
   factor CD86 on the surface of DCs was assessed by flow cytometry. And
   the stimulating capacity of DCs was measured by mixed lymphocyte
   reaction (MLR). The contents of cytokines in culture supernatants of DCs
   in MLR were detected by ELISA. Blood lipids and high-sensitivity
   C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were detected. The relationship between the
   expression of CD86 and the blood CRP level was also investigated. The
   results showed that, as compared with the control group, the CD86
   expression and the level of cytokines secreted by DCs were significantly
   increased in RA patients and greater stimulating capacity of DCs in MLR
   was demonstrated in RA patients. T lymphocytes in MLR secreted higher
   levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-17, TNF-alpha and
   INF-gamma) and lower level of anti-inflammation cytokine (IL-10). The
   function of DCs was markedly weakened and the level of hs-CRP and
   low-density lipoprotein was substantially lowered in group R+S in
   comparison to group R. The CD86 expression was positively correlated
   with hs-CRP. It was concluded that DCs in RA are highly activated and
   DC-initiated immune reaction may play an important role in the
   pathogenesis of RA. Simvastatin administration can significantly inhibit
   the DCs function and reduce the level of hs-CRP, indicating the
   suppression on inflammatory reaction may be one of the mechanisms by
   which simvastatin exerts its effect in treating RA.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C, which is most
   predominant in sub-Saharan Africa as well as in Asia and India, is the
   most prevalent subtype worldwide. A large number of transcription factor
   families have been shown to be involved in regulating HIV-1 gene
   expression in T lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte-macrophage
   lineage. Among these, proteins of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
   (C/EBP) family are of particular importance in regulating HIV-1 gene
   expression within cells of the monocytic lineage during the course of
   hematologic development and cellular activation. Few studies have
   examined the role of C/EBPs in long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed viral
   gene expression of HIV-1 subtypes other than subtype B. Within subtype B
   viruses, two functional C/EBP sites located upstream of the TATA box are
   required for efficient viral replication in cells of the
   monocyte-macrophage lineage. We report the identification of three
   putative subtype C C/EBP sites, upstream site 1 and 2 (C-US1 and C-US2)
   and downstream site 1 (C-DS1). C-US1 and C-DS1 were shown to form
   specific DNA-protein complexes with members of the C/EBP family (C/EBP
   alpha, beta, and delta). Functionally, within the U-937 monocytic cell
   line, subtype B and C LTRs were shown to be equally responsive to C/EBP
   beta-2, although the basal activity of subtype C LTRs appeared to be
   higher. Furthermore, the synergistic interaction between C/EBP beta-2
   and Tat with the subtype C LTR was also observed in U-937 cells as
   previously demonstrated with the subtype B LTR. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Microstructural evolution and flow behaviour during hot compression of
   twin roll cast ZK60 magnesium alloy were characterised by employing
   deformation temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 degrees C and strain rate
   ranging from 10(-3) to 100 s(-1). When compressed at 10(-3) s(-1), all
   stress-strain curves at different temperatures (300, 350 and 400 degrees
   C) showed a flow softening behaviour due to active dynamic
   recrystallisation. When compressed at 10(-2) s(-1) and elevated
   temperatures (300, 350 and 400 degrees C), all stress-strain curves
   showed a flow stress drop after peak stress due to twinning for 300 and
   350 degrees C deformation and recrystallisation for 400 degrees C
   deformation. The balance between shear deformation and recrystallisation
   resulted in a steady flow behaviour after the true strain reached 0.22.
   When strain rate increased to 10(-1) s(-1), a small fraction of dynamic
   recrystallisation in shear deformation region was responsible for slight
   flow softening behaviour during compression. A flow hardening appeared
   due to basal and non-basal slips when deformed at 100 s(-1). It is
   suggested that the flow behaviour during hot compression of twin roll
   cast ZK60 alloy depends on the separating effect or combined effects of
   shear deformation, twinning and recrystallisation.}},

Abstract = {{Several compositions of NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 (0 <= x <= 1 0) ceramics were
   prepared by pressureless-sintering method at 1973 K for 10h in air The
   relative density microstructure and electrical conductivity of
   NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 ceramics were analyzed by the Archimedes method X-ray
   diffraction scanning electron microscopy and impedance plots
   measurements NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 (0 <= x <= 0 3) ceramics have a single
   phase of defect fluorite-type structure and NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 (0 7 <= x <=
   1 0) ceramics exhibit a single phase of pyrochlore-type structure
   however the NdYb0 5Gd0 5Zr2O7 composition shows mixed phases of both
   defect fluorite-type and pyroch lore-type structures The measured values
   of the grain conductivity obey the Arrhenius relation The grain
   conductivity of each composition in NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 ceramics gradually
   increases with increasing temperature from 673 to 1173 K.
   NdYb1-xGdxZr2O7 ceramics are oxide-ion conductor in the oxygen partial
   pressure range of 1 0 x 10(-4) to 1 0 atm at all test temperature levels
   The highest grain conductivity value obtained in this work is 1 79 x
   10(-2)S cm(-1) at 1173 K for NdYb0 3Gd0 7Zr2O7 composition (C) 2010

   the effect of metal pollution on the macroinvertebrate community
   composition in Andean streams between 3 500 to 4 500 meters above sea
   level (masl) during wet and dry seasons At polluted sites showing a high

   49 mg/L Mn 19 65 mg/L Pb 0 876 mg/L Zn 16 08 mg/L) ranged from 8 fold up
   to 3 500 fold higher than at reference sites The cumulative criterion
   unit allowed quantifying the potential toxicity of metal mixtures at the
   contaminated sites Principal component analysis of physical chemical
   variables showed that reference sites were more likely to be structured
   by transparency water discharge and current velocity while polluted
   sites appeared to be determined by metals and conductivity Canonical
   correspondence analysis indicated a strong influence of highly
   correlated metals in structuring Invertebrate communities which were
   dominated by dipterans coleopterans collembolans and mites at polluted
   sites At reference sites crustaceans ephemeropterans plecopterans and
   trichopterans were the most representative taxa We concluded that severe
   metal pollution induced changes in macroinvertebrate community

Abstract = {{Geographic features change over time, this change being the result of
   some kind of event. Most database systems used in GIS are relational in
   nature, capturing change by exhaustively storing all versions of data,
   or updates replace previous versions. This stems from the inherent
   difficulty of modelling geographic objects and associated data in
   relational tables, and this is compounded when the necessary time
   dimension is introduced to represent how these objects evolve. This
   article describes an object-oriented (OO) spatio-temporal conceptual
   data model called the Feature Evolution Model (FEM), which can be used
   for the development of a spatiotemporal database management system
   (STDBMS). Object versioning techniques developed in the fields of
   Computer Aided Design (CAD) and engineering design are utilized in the
   design. The model is defined using the Unified Modelling Language (UML),
   and exploits the expressiveness of OO technology by representing both
   geographic entities and events as objects. Further, the model overcomes
   the limitations inherent in relational approaches in representing
   aggregation of objects to form more complex, compound objects. A
   management object called the evolved feature maintains a temporally
   ordered list of references to features thus representing their
   evolution. The model is demonstrated by its application to road network
   data.}},

   pre rigor predicted values obtained from quantitative models were shown
   to be poorly correlated against glycogen and pH(u) (r(2) = 0.23 and
   0.20, respectively). Qualitative models developed to categorise each
   muscle according to their pH were able to correctly categorise 42\% of
   high pH samples. Optimum qualitative and quantitative models derived
   from NIR spectra found low correlation between predicted values and

Abstract = {{The Social Inclusion Agenda ('SIA') was introduced by the Australian
   Labor Party ('ALP') in the lead up to the 2007 federal election. The
   rhetoric was hopeful, proposing to reframe the government's approach to
   disadvantage. Rhetoric aside, what the then opposition meant when it
   talked of building social inclusion ('SI') was less clear than may have
   immediately met the eye.
   This paper offers an introductory analysis and review of the SIA. It
   first considers why Australia might benefit from a readjustment in its
   social policy direction, reflecting on the concepts of poverty and
   Amartya Sen's `capabilities approach'. Second, it offers a critical
   overview of the main conceptions of SI/Social Exclusion. Third, it
   applies these first two parts of analysis to developments to date with
   the SIA. This part, whilst limited in scope and preliminary at best,
   offers some general comments as to the possibilities and pitfalls of the
   SIA and proposes the way forward from an analytical perspective in terms
   of guiding the SIA in a desirable direction.}},

Title = {{Dysfunction of Heterotrimeric Kinesin-2 in Rod Photoreceptor Cells and

Abstract = {{Due to extensive elaboration of the photoreceptor cilium to form the
   outer segment, axonemal transport (IFT) in photoreceptors is
   extraordinarily busy, and retinal degeneration is a component of many
   ciliopathies. Functional loss of heterotrimeric kinesin-2, a major
   anterograde IFT motor, causes mislocalized opsin, followed by rapid cell
   death. Here, we have analyzed the nature of protein mislocalization and
   the requirements for the death of kinesin-2-mutant rod photoreceptors.
   Quantitative immuno EM showed that opsin accumulates initially within
   the inner segment, and then in the plasma membrane. The light-activated
   movement of arrestin to the outer segment is also impaired, but this
   defect likely results secondarily from binding to mislocalized opsin.
   Unlike some other retinal degenerations, neither opsin-arrestin
   complexes nor photoactivation were necessary for cell loss. In contrast,
   reduced rod opsin expression provided enhanced rod and cone
   photoreceptor survival and function, as measured by photoreceptor cell
   counts, apoptosis assays, and ERG analysis. The cell death incurred by
   loss of kinesin-2 function was almost completely negated by Rho(-/-).
   Our results indicate that mislocalization of opsin is a major cause of
   photoreceptor cell death from kinesin-2 dysfunction and demonstrate the
   importance of accumulating mislocalized protein per se, rather than
   specific signaling properties of opsin, stemming from photoactivation or
   arrestin binding.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio has recently emerged as a promising solution to
   conciliate the existing conflicts between spectrum demand growth and
   spectrum underutilisation. The basic underlying idea is to allow
   unlicensed users to access in an opportunistic and non-interfering
   manner some licensed bands temporarily unoccupied by the licensed users.
   Within the framework of cognitive radio, several spectrum measurement
   campaigns have been performed in diverse locations and scenarios in
   order to assess the degree to which allocated spectrum bands are
   currently being used in real wireless communication systems. Although
   such measurement campaigns follow similar approaches, there is a lack of
   common and appropriate evaluation methodology, which would be desirable
   not only to prevent inaccurate results but also to enable the direct
   comparison of results from different sources. In this context, this work
   presents a comprehensive and in-depth discussion of several important
   methodological aspects that need to be accounted for when evaluating
   spectrum occupancy in the context of cognitive radio. Moreover, a
   quantitative evaluation of the impact of different factors on the
   obtained results along with various useful guidelines is also provided.
   The results presented in this work highlight the importance of carefully
   designing an appropriate methodology when evaluating spectrum occupancy
   in the context of cognitive radio. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The current approach to the prevention of diabetic retinopathy
   relies on intensive anti-diabetes treatment and is only partially
   successful. A marker of retinopathy risk would enable strategies of
   surveillance, screening of adjunct drugs, and targeted drug
   interventions. The authors sought to identify early abnormalities of
   retinal vessels that are not prevented by the current therapeutic
   approach.
   METHODS. Retinal thickness (an informer of vascular permeability) and
   hemodynamic parameters at baseline and longitudinally were measured in
   27 subjects (age, 32 +/- 9 years {[}mean +/- SD]) with well-controlled
   type 1 diabetes of 12.4 +/- 6.4 years' duration and no retinopathy, and
   in 27 control subjects. In a subset of 17 patients and 11 controls, the
   hemodynamic response to reclining, a postural change that increases
   retinal perfusion pressure, was measured.
   RESULTS. Baseline foveal thickness and hemodynamic parameters were
   similar in the diabetic and control subjects. Foveal thickness increased
   over 12 months in the diabetic subjects, from 217 +/- 22 mu m to 222 +/-
   20 mu m (P = 0.0036), remaining however within the normal range.
   Reclining uncovered in 47\% of diabetic subjects (P = 0.016 compared
   with controls) an absent myogenic response (i.e., unchanged or increased
   arterial diameter instead of the normal decrease). The patterns were
   repeatable. Only the diabetic group with defective vasoconstriction
   showed widening arterial diameter over 12 months, a change presaging
   vascular dilatation in diabetic retinopathy.
   CONCLUSIONS. Defective myogenic response to pressure was the first
   detectable abnormality of retinal vessels in subjects with
   well-controlled type 1 diabetes. Because of its selective occurrence,
   interpretability in individual patients, and pathogenic potential, the

Abstract = {{Up to now the basic theoretical description of charge extraction by
   linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) is solved for a low conductivity
   approximation only. Here we present the full analytical solution, thus
   generalize the theoretical framework for this method. We compare the
   analytical solution and the approximated theory, showing that especially
   for typical organic solar cell materials the latter approach has a very
   limited validity. Photo-CELIV measurements on poly(3-hexyl
   thiophene-2,5-diyl):{[}6,6]-phenyl-C-61 butyric acid methyl ester based
   solar cells were then evaluated by fitting the current transients to the
   analytical solution. We found that the fit results are in a very good
   agreement with the experimental observations, if ambipolar transport is
   taken into account, the origin of which we will discuss. Furthermore we
   present parametric equations for the mobility and the charge carrier
   density, which can be applied over the entire experimental range of
   parameters. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Title = {{Relationship between blood harmane and harmine concentrations in
   familial essential tremor, sporadic essential tremor and controls}},
Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{674-679}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Harmane, a potent tremor-producing beta-carboline
   alkaloid, may play a role in the etiology of essential tremor (ET).
   Blood harmane concentrations are elevated in ET cases compared with
   controls yet the basis for this elevation remains unknown. Decreased
   metabolic conversion (harmane to harmine) is one possible explanation.
   Using a sample of >500 individuals, we hypothesized that defective
   metabolic conversion of harmane to harmine might underlie the observed
   elevated harmane concentration in ET, and therefore expected to find a
   higher harmane to harmine ratio in familial ET than in sporadic ET or
   controls.
   Methods: Blood harmane and harmine concentrations were quantified by
   high performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: There were 78 familial ET cases, 187 sporadic ET cases, and 276
   controls. Blood harmane and harmine concentrations were correlated with
   one another (Spearman's r = 0.24, p < 0.001). The mean (+/- SD)
   harmane/harmine ratio = 23.4 +/- 90.9 (range = 0.1-987.5). The
   harmane/harmine ratio was highest in familial ET (46.7 +/- 140.4),
   intermediate in sporadic ET (28.3 +/- 108.1), and lowest in controls
   (13.5 +/- 50.3) (p = 0.03). In familial ET cases, there was no
   association between this ratio and tremor severity (Spearman's r = 0.08,
   p = 0.48) or tremor duration (Spearman's r = 0.14, p = 0.24).
   Conclusion: The basis for the elevated blood harmane concentration,
   particularly in familial ET, is not known, although the current findings
   (highest harmane/harmine ratio in familial ET cases) lends support to
   the possibility that it could be the result of a genetically-driven
   reduction in harmane metabolism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In Greece, the National Newborn Screening Program was initiated in 1974
   and is performed by the Institute of Child Health (ICH). However, there
   is a complete absence of conditions that have high rates of mortality
   and a relatively high prevalence listed in the Catalogue of Disorders
   screened by the ICH. Our laboratory has expanded the existing NBS
   program to include newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism,
   screening for cystic fibrosis (the most common congenital disorder in
   the Greek population), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and for
   biotinidase deficiency. From July 2007 to December 2009, 45,000 dried
   blood spots (DBS) were collected from infants born in Athens, Greece,
   and were analyzed. We present a report of our 30-month experience in the
   newborn screening area. The samples were tested for amino acidopathies,
   fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD), and organic acid metabolic
   disorders by applying flow injection analysis-electrospray
   ionizationtandem mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-MS/MS); for cystic fibrosis
   by immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) measurement (time-resolved
   fluoroimmunoassay); for congenital adrenal hyperplasia by
   fluoroimmunoassay to measure the 17 hydroxy-progesterone level; and for
   biotinidase deficiency using a colorimetric method and a
   semiquantitative fluoroimmunoassay to determine biotinidase activity.
   Sample analysis resulted in establishing cutoff values for the
   respective disease markers for the first time in the Greek population.
   Four infants were identified with cystic fibrosis, two with congenital
   adrenal hyperplasia, two with phenylketonuria (PKU), one with
   medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), and one with
   biotinidase deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   article reporting the status of expanded newborn screening in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{Fibre properties may be an important source of information to identify,
   conserve and protect intraspecific diversity within culturally
   significant fibre plants such as harakeke (Phormium tenax, New Zealand
   flax). Maori weavers recognise differences in whitau({*}) (fibre
   aggregate prepared using traditional practices) extracted from leaves of
   different harakeke cultivars. However, tensile properties of fibre
   aggregates are reportedly highly variable. The aim of this study was to
   investigate variation in fibre aggregate physical and mechanical
   properties among leaves harvested from different fans within two bushes
   representing different cultivars of harakeke. Tenacity, extension to
   maximum load, specific modulus and specific energy to maximum load of
   fibre aggregates differed between the bushes, and also among leaves
   within each bush. Leaf width and thickness were weakly correlated with
   fibre aggregate properties suggesting that wider, thicker leaves yield
   tougher and more pliable fibre aggregates. Variability among leaves
   differed according to the property measured, and was highest for fibre
   aggregate length and lowest for specific energy to maximum load.
   Although fibre aggregate tenacity (or strength) is commonly used to
   compare intra and interspecific fibre properties, specific modulus,
   extension at maximum load and specific energy to maximum load were all
   more appropriate for identifying intraspecific differences in harakeke
   fibre properties.}},

   distribution of individual trees was done in proportion to their degree
   of genetic relatedness The MI orchard design accommodates a variable
   number of unrelated or related clones with equal or variable sizes, and
   it is not restricted by the orchard's spatial configuration (shape or
   size) The proposed design is suitable for advanced generation
   populations that commonly harbor complicated pedigree relationships The
   MI design was compared with the commonly used permutated neighborhood
   design and the completely randomized scheme, resulting in aggregate

   combine the advantages of two computationally simple operators by using
   FAST as the feature detector, and LBP and CS-LBP operators as feature
   descriptors. The matching experiments of the panoramic images from the
   COLD database were performed to determine their optimal parameters, and
   to evaluate and compare their performance with SIFT. The experimental
   results show that our algorithms perform better, and features can be

   discrimination ability toward 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol as evidenced by H-1 NMR
   study, where the characteristic hydroxyl proton signal was split into
   two peaks that ascribed respectively to the levo-and dextro-isomer;
   furthermore, the splitting magnitude was linearly correlated with the

Abstract = {{The crossing in magnetic levitation force-gap hysteresis curve of melt
   high-temperature superconductor (HTS) vs. NdFeB permanent magnet (PM)
   was experimentally studied. One HTS bulk and PM was used in the
   experiments. Four experimental methods were employed combining of
   high/low speed of movement of PM with/without heat insulation materials
   (HIM) enclosed respectively. Experimental results show that crossing of
   the levitation force-gap curve is related to experimental methods. A
   crossing occurs in the magnetic force-gap curve while the PM moves
   approaching to and departing from the sample with high or low speed of
   movement without HIM enclosed. When the PM is enclosed with HIM during
   the measurement procedures, there is no crossing in the force-gap curve
   no matter high speed or low speed of movement of the PM. It was found
   experimentally that, with the increase of the moving speed of the PM,
   the maximum magnitude of levitation force of the HIS increases also. The
   results are interpreted based on Maxwell theories and flux flow-creep
   models of HTS. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Individual and environmental determinants of early brood survival in
   black grouse Tetrao tetrix}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In black grouse Tetrao tetrix the survival of juveniles from hatching
   until recruitment is a critical determinant of population growth. The
   proportion of juvenile survivors from hatching until recruitment
   declines continually, but juvenile mortality rates are commonly highest
   during approximately the first 10 days after hatching. Likely causes of
   mortality include adverse weather, predation and availability of food.
   Little is known, however, about how individual properties, such as body
   mass of hen or chicks and properties of the brood rearing environment
   (e.g. vegetation characteristics or weather conditions) interact with
   each other and/or with fluctuating levels of predator abundance in
   determining early brood survival, simply because such data are very
   scarce. Using an information-theoretic approach, our paper identifies
   determinants of early daily survival rates of black grouse chicks in a
   managed forest landscape of central Finland. During the three years of
   our study, the proportion of hens losing their broods within 10 days
   after hatching varied between 0.08 and 0.36.The variation in daily
   survival rates of chicks was largely mediated by a combination of four
   key explanatory variables. Brood survival clearly increased with the
   extent of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus cover, and was further affected
   by interactions of temperature and hatching date as well as temperature
   and chick body mass. Low temperatures consistently resulted in lower
   daily survival rates. An increase in temperature, however, was more
   beneficial for early hatchers and heavy chicks. There was no difference
   in survival between broods from yearling and adult hens and we found no
   effect of predator density, be it as main effect or as interaction with
   other variables, on the daily survival rates of chicks. Improving black
   grouse breeding success can be regarded as a key management target which
   may be critical for their recovery. Our results suggest that such
   management should favour protection or local recovery of bilberry, as
   well as integrate weather and climate changes into the equation of
   hunting management.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of regenerating diseased myocardium by implanting engineered
   heart tissue (EHT) is intriguing. Yet it was limited by immune rejection
   and difficulties to be generated at a size with contractile properties.
   Somatic cell nuclear transfer is proposed as a practical strategy for
   generating autologous histocompatible stem (nuclear transferred
   embryonic stem {[}NT-ES]) cells to treat diseases. Nevertheless, it is
   controversial as NT-ES cells may pose risks in their therapeutic
   application. EHT from NT-ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes was generated
   through a series of improved techniques in a self-made mould to keep the
   EHTs from contraction and provide static stretch simultaneously. After 7
   days of static and mechanical stretching, respectively, the EHTs were
   implanted to the infarcted rat heart. Four weeks after transplantation,
   the suitability of EHT in heart muscle repair after myocardial
   infarction was evaluated by histological examination, echocardiography
   and multielectrode array measurement. The results showed that large
   (thickness/diameter, 2-4 mm/10 mm) spontaneously contracting EHTs was
   generated successfully. The EHTs, which were derived from NT-ES cells,
   inte grated and electrically coupled to host myocardium and exerted
   beneficial effects on the left ventricular function of infarcted rat
   heart. No teratoma formation was observed in the rat heart implanted
   with EHTs for 4 weeks. NT-ES cells can be used as a source of seeding
   cells for cardiac tissue engineering. Large contractile EHT grafts can
   be constructed in vitro with the ability to survive after implantation
   and improve myocardial performance of infarcted rat hearts.}},

Abstract = {{Nutritional ecology of Microtus arvalis (Pallas, 1779) in sown wild
   flower fields and quasi-natural habitats. - Recently, sown wild flower
   fields (SWFF) were established as ecological compensation areas to
   enhance and preserve animal and plant biodiversity. Besides their
   positive effects, SWFF can also shelter potential pest species, like
   Microtus arvalis, which stay preferentially in those fields. To analyse
   the nutritional ecology of M. arvalis in SWFF and in quasi-natural
   habitats, 100 voles were trapped in each habitat type near Bern, from
   October 2006 to July 2007. Stomach content and faecal pellets were
   examined microscopically. Ingested plant fragments were identified using
   reference slides. The ingested quantity of each plant was assessed
   according to the covered surface on a microscopic slide. Rank preference
   indices of Johnson were calculated by comparing food-composition with
   food-offer in the vegetation. The food spectrum was rather wide,
   including numerous grasses and herbs. Monocots constituted the main part
   in both habitats, although they were not as frequent in SWFF as dicots.
   Neither for monocots nor for dicots a clear preference was found. SWFF
   seem not to be the main reason for the frequent occurrence of M. arvalis
   in these areas. Further studies are needed to determine why common voles
   are attracted by the naturally growing grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Cancer-testis (CT) antigens represent attractive targets for
   tumor immunotherapy based on their tumor-restricted expression and
   immunogenicity. However, a broad picture of the expression of CT
   antigens and associated humoral immune responses in chronic myeloid
   leukemia (CML) is still missing.
   Methods: We screened CML cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples from
   healthy donors by RT-PCR for the expression of 31 CT antigens before and
   after treatment with epigenetic agents. Expression of tumor-restricted
   antigens was further examined in 60 CML patients and humoral immune
   responses against 15 CT antigens were screened by ELISA.
   Results: In untreated cell lines we detected the expression of 17 CT
   antigens that were absent from normal BM. Expression of most antigens
   increased following demethylating treatment with
   5'-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine. In these samples, only PRAME was repeatedly
   detected and expression correlated with several clinicopathological
   parameters and decreased overall survival. We further show that a lower
   frequency of PRAME-positive samples during imatinib treatment was not
   caused by gene-specific downregulation. Analyzing the patients' antibody
   responses we found that the vast majority of patients lacked spontaneous
   immunity against CT antigens including PRAME.
   Conclusions: CT antigen expression can be increased by the application
   of epigenetic agents and the expression of PRAME correlates with
   clinicopathological parameters and overall survival in patients with
   CML, but does not lead to humoral immune responses. PRAME-specific
   immunotherapy might represent a promising approach for the eradication
   of residual therapy-resistant leukemic cells due to its frequent
   expression and stability under imatinib treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Considerable concern has been expressed about the possible health risks
   of mobile-phone use. The brain has greater exposure to mobile-phone
   radiation (MPR) than the rest of the body, and there are experimental
   findings suggesting that electromagnetic fields may modulate the
   activity of neural networks. The tendency towards electrical instability
   of the neural networks of epileptics suggests that these persons may be
   especially sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. In this study, we
   determined the effects of mobile-phone radiation on the
   electroencephalographic (EEG) spectra of nine epileptic patients
   undergoing routine video-EEG monitoring. For each of nine scalp areas
   and four wavebands ( alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), three spectral
   features were extracted from EEG segments recorded before, during, and
   after 20 minutes of continuous exposure to mobile-phone radiation.
   Statistical analyses showed associations between mobile-phone radiation
   and increased EEG activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma wavebands. The
   increase In alpha-wave power was similar to that reported for
   non-epileptic individuals. The increase in beta- and gamma-wave power
   may be related to epileptic alterations.}},

   and molecular biomarkers of oxidative stress in organs of the Redlip
   Mullet (Liza haematocheila) analyzed. The amount of wastewater and

   rhetorical use of already established subject positions drawn from the
   fields of production and reproduction, and from discourses on productive

Abstract = {{Trichoderma spp. are well-known biocontrol agents because of their
   antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal phytopathogens.
   However, the biochemical mechanism of their antiviral activity remains
   largely unknown. In this study, we found that Trichokonins,
   antimicrobial peptaibols isolated from Trichoderma pseudokoningii SMF2,
   could induce defense responses and systemic resistance in tobacco
   (Nicotiana tabacum var. Samsun NN) against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
   infection. Local Trichokonin (100 nM) treatment led to 54\% lesion
   inhibition, 57\% reduction in average lesion diameter and 30\% reduction
   in average lesion area in systemic tissue of tobacco compared with
   control, indicating that Trichokonins induced resistance in tobacco
   against TMV infection. Trichokonin treatment increased the production of
   reactive oxygen species and phenolic compounds in tobacco. Additionally,
   application of Trichokonins significantly increased activities of
   pathogenesis-related enzymes PAL and POD, and upregulated the expression
   of several plant defense genes. These results suggested that multiple
   defense pathways in tobacco were involved in Trichokonin-mediated TMV
   resistance. We report on the antivirus mechanism of peptaibols, which
   sheds light on the potential of peptaibols in plant viral disease
   control.}},

Title = {{Parent perceptions of adolescent pain expression: The adolescent pain
   behavior questionnaire}},
Journal = {{PAIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{151}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{834-842}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pain behaviors provide meaningful information about adolescents in
   chronic pain, enhancing their verbal report of pain intensity with
   information about the global pain experience. Caregivers likely consider
   these expressions when making judgments about their adolescents' medical
   or emotional needs. Current validated measures of pain behavior target
   acute or procedural pain and young or non-verbal children, while
   observation systems may be too cumbersome for clinical practice. The
   objective of this research was to design and evaluate the Adolescent
   Pain Behavior Questionnaire (APBQ), a parent-report measure of
   adolescent (11-19 years) pain expressions. This paper provides
   preliminary results on reliability and validity of the APBQ.
   Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 138) seen in a multidisciplinary pain
   management clinic completed the APBQ and questionnaires assessing pain
   characteristics, quality of life, functional disability, depressive
   symptoms, and pain catastrophizing. Principal components analysis of the
   APBQ supported a single component structure. The final APBQ scale
   contained 23 items with high internal consistency (alpha = 0.93). No
   relationship was found between parent-reported pain behaviors and
   adolescent-reported pain intensity. However, significant correlations
   were found between parent-reported pain behaviors and parent-and
   adolescent-reported functional disability, pain catastrophizing,
   depressive symptoms, and poorer quality of life. The assessment of pain
   behaviors provides qualitatively different information than solely
   recording pain intensity and disability. It has clinical utility for use
   in behavioral treatments seeking to reduce disability, poor coping, and
   distress. (C) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Based on a consecutive 16-year field trial and meteorological data, the
   effects of fertilization on the nutrient budget and nitrogen use
   efficiency in farmland soil under different precipitation years were
   studied. With no fertilization treatment, the grain yield of maize was
   3,520 kg ha(-1) (mean yield over 13 years). But the maximum yield
   increased to 7,470 kg ha(-1) when treated with mineral N, P and K
   fertilizers and recycled manure. The nutrient uptake also increased by
   twofold to threefold in NPKM treated field compared with that in the
   control treatment. The highest yields were obtained in years with normal
   precipitation, despite the different fertilization schemes. The lowest
   yields were obtained in drought or waterlogging years, which were
   44.7-58.5\% of the yields in years with normal precipitation. It also
   appeared that the deficits of N, P and K were greater in the years with
   proper precipitation than those in arid or flood years, because more
   production was removed from the field. Soil total N decreased
   significantly when treated with mineral fertilizer or recycled manure
   alone. The maximum deficit of soil total N was observed in control
   treatment (557 kg ha(-1)) from 1990 to 2005. The N treatment resulted in
   a significant negative balance of P, due to the high yield of the crop
   in response to applied N. The application of NP or N to soils resulted
   in a greater negative K balance than that of the control. The greatest
   negative balance of total P and available P were obtained under the
   control and N treatment, and the highest deficit of soil total K and
   exchangeable K were obtained under NP treatment. We found that the rate
   of 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was inadequate for maintaining soil N
   balance, and amendment of soil with organic source could not stop the
   loss of soil P and K. The applying rates of 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), 25
   kg P ha(-1) year(-1), and 60 kg K ha(-1) year(-1) combined with 2-3 t
   ha(-1) organic manure were recommended to maintain soil fertility level.
   The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was greatly improved in the years with
   proper precipitation and balanced fertilization. Higher NUE and grain
   yields were achieved under NPK and NPKM treatments in years with normal
   precipitation. The results clearly demonstrated that both organic and
   mineral fertilizers were needed to increase crop production, improve NUE
   and maintain soil fertility level.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
   have been used in the treatment of human cancer, including leukemia.
   Several studies have established PR1 peptide, an HLA-A2.1-restricted
   peptide derived from proteinase 3 (P3), as a human leukemia-associated
   antigen. PR1-specific CTL elicited in vitro from healthy donors have
   been shown to lyse P3-expressing AML cells from patients. We
   investigated whether PR1-CTL can be adoptively transferred into NOD/SCID
   mice to eliminate human leukemia cells. Methods. PR1-CTL were generated
   in bulk culture from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
   stimulated with autologous dendritic cells. Human acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML) patient samples were injected and engrafted in murine bone marrow
   at 2 weeks post-transfer. Results. Following adoptive transfer, bone
   marrow aspirate from mice that received AML alone had 72-88\% blasts in
   a hypercellular marrow, whereas mice that received AML plus PR1-CTL
   co-infusion had normal hematopoietic elements and only 3-18\% blasts in
   a hypocellular marrow. The PR1-CTL persisted in the bone marrow and
   liver and maintained a CD45RA<SU-</SU CD28<SU+</SU effector phenotype.
   Conclusions. We found that adoptive transfer of PR1-CTL generated in
   vitro is associated with reduced AML cells in NOD/SCID mice. PR1-CTL can
   migrate to the sites of disease and maintain their capacity to kill the
   AML cells. The surface phenotype of PR1-CTL was consistent with their
   trafficking pattern in both vascular and end-organ tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Total energy and electronic structure calculations for Fe3Al1-xSix
   alloys with DO3-type structure have been performed to understand
   structural and magnetic properties using plane-wave pseudopotential
   method. With the increase of Si content, the equilibrium lattice
   constants reduce linearly and the saturation magnetic moments per unit
   cell of Fe3Al1-xSix alloys decrease, which are in good agreement with
   the experimental results. To illustrate the origin of magnetism of
   Fe3Al1-xSix alloys, spin-polarized density of states and local magnetic
   moments are investigated. The results show that the difference in local
   moments of Fe(A,C) and Fe(B) is due to different local environment in
   DO3-type structure and the relative affinity of Si and Al for Fe. In
   addition, to analyze the effect of Si on the magnetism of Fe3Al, the
   Mulliken charge and bond population are used to study the charge
   transfer and the bonding types, respectively. The calculated results
   give a reasonable explanation of recent experimental findings. (C) 2010

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{MacInnis, Martin J., Michael S. Koehle, and Jim L. Rupert. Evidence for
   a genetic basis for altitude illness: 2010 update. High Alt. Med. Biol.
   11: 349-368, 2010.-Altitude illness refers to a group of environmentally
   mediated pathophysiologies. Many people will suffer acute mountain
   sickness shortly after rapidly ascending to a moderately hypoxic
   environment, and an unfortunate few will develop potentially fatal
   conditions such as high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude
   cerebral edema. Some individuals seem to be predisposed to developing
   altitude illness, suggesting an innate contribution to susceptibility.
   The implication that there are altitude-sensitive and altitude-tolerant
   individuals has stimulated much research into the contribution of a
   genetic background to the efficacy of altitude acclimatization. Although
   the effect of altitude attained and rate of ascent on the etiology of
   altitude illness is well known, there are only tantalizing, but rapidly
   accumulating, clues to the genes that may be involved. In 2006, we
   reviewed what was then known about the genetics of altitude illness.
   This article updates that review and attempts to tabulate all the
   available genetic data pertaining to these conditions. To date, 58 genes
   have been investigated for a role in altitude illness. Of these, 17 have
   shown some association with the susceptibility to, or the severity of,
   these conditions, although in many cases the effect size is small or
   variable. Caution is recommended when evaluating the genes for which no
   association was detected, because a number of the investigations
   reviewed in this article were insufficiently powered to detect small
   effects. No study has demonstrated a clear-cut altitude illness gene,
   but the accumulating data are consistent with a polygenic condition with
   a strong environmental component. The genes that have shown an
   association affect a variety of biological pathways, suggesting that
   either multiple systems are involved in altitude pathophysiology or that
   gene-gene interactions play a role. Although numerous studies have been
   performed to investigate specific genes, few have looked for evidence of
   heritability or familial transmission, or for epidemiological patterns
   that would be consistent with genetically influenced conditions. Future
   trends, such as genome-wide association studies and epigenetic analysis,
   should lead to enhanced understanding of the complex interactions within
   the genome and between the genome and hypoxic environments that
   contribute to an individual's capacity to acclimatize rapidly and
   effectively to altitude.}},

Abstract = {{A cDNA encoding a myostatin (Mstn)-like gene from an astacuran
   crustacean, Homarus americanus, was cloned and characterized Mstn
   inhibits skeletal muscle growth in vertebrates and may play a role in
   crustacean muscle as a suppressor of protein synthesis. Sequence
   analysis and three-dimensional modeling of the Ha-Mstn protein predicted
   a high degree of conservation with vertebrate and other invertebrate
   myostatins Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated
   ubiquitous expression of transcript in all tissues, including skeletal
   muscles Quantitative PCR analysis was used to determine the effects of
   natural molting and eyestalk ablation (ESA) on Ha-Mstn expression in the
   cutter claw (CT) and crusher claw (CR) closer muscles and deep abdominal
   (DA) muscle In intermolt lobsters, the Ha-Mstn mRNA level in the DA
   muscle was significantly lower than the mRNA levels in the CT and CR
   muscles. Spontaneous molting decreased Ha-Mstn mRNA during premolt, with
   the CR muscle, which is composed of slow-twitch (S-1) fibers, responding
   preferentially (82\% decrease) to the atrophic signal compared to fast
   fibers in CT (51\% decrease) and DA (69\% decrease) muscles. However,
   acute increases in circulating ecdysteroids caused by ESA had no effect
   on Ha-Mstn mRNA levels in the three muscles These data indicate that the
   transcription of Ha-Mstn is differentially regulated during the natural
   molt cycle and it is an important regulator of protein turnover in

Abstract = {{Filarial thiordoxin peroxidase is a major antioxidant that plays a
   crucial role in parasite survival. Although Brugia malayi TPx has been
   shown to be a potential vaccine candidate, it shares 63\% homology with
   its mammalian counterpart, limiting its use as a vaccine or drug target.
   In silico analysis of TPx sequence revealed a linear B epitope in the
   host's nonhomologous region. The peptide sequence (TPx peptide(27-48))
   was synthesized, and its reactivity with clinical sera from an endemic
   region was analyzed. The peptide showed significantly high reactivity (P
   < 0.05) against the sera of putatively immune individuals compared to
   the nonendemic control sera. It also showed high reactivity against the
   sera of patients with chronic pathology and patent infection. The high
   reactivity of the peptide with endemic immune sera equivalent to that of
   whole protein shows that it forms a dominant B epitope of TPx protein
   and thus could be utilized for incorporation into a multiepitope vaccine
   construct for filariasis.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3563-3571}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of ocean fishing, and
   particularly the mechanisms driving them, are poorly understood. Most
   studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of
   predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of
   lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where
   and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large
   gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern
   Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system,
   we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral
   responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These
   responses were observed as a function of both short-term ({''}acute'')
   risk and longer-term ({''}chronic'') risk, as well as when prey were
   exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation
   risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical
   prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can
   potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire
   assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially
   instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich
   body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of
   predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our
   results draw together these lines of research and provide the first
   empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a
   natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral
   changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef
   food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this work was to investigate the low-level laser
   therapy (LLLT) effect on alveolar macrophages (AM) activated by
   oxidative stress and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Background data: LLLT has
   been reported to actuate positively relieving the late and early
   symptoms of airway and lung inflammation. It is not known if the
   increased MIP-2mRNA expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) generation observed in acute lung inflammation (ALI) can be
   influenced by LLLT. Materials and Methods: Rat AM cell line (AMJ2-C11)
   was cultured with LPS or H2O2 and laser irradiated. MIP-2mRNA and ROS
   production in the AM were evaluated by Real Time-PCR and the
   2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) respectively. The NF-kappa
   B protein in the AM was measured by the enzyme linked immunoassay
   method. To investigate the antioxidant effect of laser, the AM were
   prebathed with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and then irradiated with laser.
   LLLT was also studied in the presence of an inhibitor of NF-kappa B (BMS
   205820). In addition, the effect of LLLT on NF-kappa B protein was
   investigated. Results: LLLT attenuated the MIP-2mRNA expression and
   intracellular ROS generation after LPS or H2O2. When the AM were
   pretreated with NAC, the laser effect was potentiated. BMS 205820
   suppresses the effect of LLLT on MIP-2mRNA expression and ROS
   generation, stimulated by LPS or H2O2. On NF-kappa B transcription
   factor, both the LLLT and NAC reduced this protein in the AM exposed to
   LPS or H2O2. The synergistic effect between LLLT and NAC on the
   reduction the NF-kappa B was also evidenced. Conclusion: Results
   indicate that there is a synergistic action of LLLT with NAC on
   MIP-2mRNA expression from LPS-or H2O2-stimulated AM, and that both ROS
   intracellular generation and NF-kB signaling seem to be involved.}},

Title = {{Common Loons can differentiate yodels of neighboring and non-neighboring
   conspecifics}},

Abstract = {{Although previous studies have identified elements of the yodel calls of
   male Common Loons (Gavia immer) that might be important for
   neighbor/non-neighbor discrimination, no one to date has determined
   whether loons can distinguish between the yodels of neighbors and
   non-neighbors. Our objectives were to determine if Common Loons respond
   differently to playback recordings of yodels of neighbor and
   non-neighbors and, if so, if elements of the introductory phrase or the
   repeat phrases are important in such differentiation. We studied loons
   occupying single-lake territories in Oneida County, Wisconsin, in 2001
   (N = 20 pairs) and 2007 (N = 16 pairs). Playback experiments revealed no
   significant difference in number of different types of vocalizations
   (yodels, tremolos, and wails) loons gave in response to neighbor and
   non-neighbor yodels. However, loons gave significantly more tremolos in
   response to yodels lower in peak frequency than those of resident male
   (P = 0.01), indicating they were more threatened by such calls. In
   addition, loons gave significantly more tremolos (P < 0.01) and yodels
   (P < 0.01) in response to the lower frequency yodels of non-neighbors
   than neighbors. Because previous studies have revealed that males with
   greater resource-holding ability produce lower frequency yodels, our
   results suggest that the response of Common Loons to unfamiliar yodels
   depends on perceived condition-dependent fighting ability. When we used
   playbacks containing a non-neighbor's introductory phrase and a
   neighbor's repeat syllables, we found that loons uttered more tremolos
   (P = 0.01) and yodels (P = 0.01), suggesting that the introductory
   phrase is more important than the repeat phrases for
   neighbor/non-neighbor discrimination. Thus, the yodels of male Common
   Loons appear to provide conspecifics with information about their status
   (neighbor or non-neighbor) as well as their condition and aggressive
   motivation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate chronomodulated
   rupturable pulsatile drug delivery of theophylline for the treatment of
   nocturnal asthma. Core tablets containing theophylline were coated with
   two consecutive layers, an inner swelling layer and an outer rupturable
   coating layer. The effect of formulation variables such as molecular
   weight of outer rupturable coating layer, type and amount of swelling
   layer, weight gain of coating film and influence of paddle speed on drug
   release were investigated. The drug release from the pulsatile tablets
   exhibited an initial lag period, followed by a stage of rapid drug
   release. The optimal level of swelling layer (crospovidone) to achieve a
   fast and complete release was 20 \% w/w. The results indicated that lag
   time was prolonged with the increased weight gain of coating film. Also
   no significant difference in the drug release was observed for different
   rotational speeds. In accordance with the chronomodulated therapy of
   asthma, the lag time criterion of 5 hours was satisfied by formulation
   having 11 \% weight gain of outer rupturable layer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Deficiency of alpha(1)-antitrypsin (alpha(1)AT) may be a
   determinant of susceptibility to Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Several
   previous, mainly small, case-control studies have shown that 5-27\% of
   patients with WG carried the alpha(1)AT deficiency Z allele. It is not
   clear whether the S allele, the other major alpha(1)AT deficiency
   variant, is associated with WG. This study investigated the relationship
   of the alpha(1)AT deficiency Z and S alleles with the risk of developing
   WG in a large cohort.
   Methods. We studied the distribution of the alpha(1)AT deficiency
   alleles Z and S in 433 unrelated Caucasian patients with WG and 421
   ethnically matched controls. Genotyping was performed using an allele
   discrimination assay.
   Results were compared between cases and controls using exact statistical
   methods. Results. Among the patients with WG, the allele carriage
   frequencies of Z and S were 7.4\% and 11.5\%, respectively. The
   frequencies of the 6 possible genotypes differed in a statistically
   significant manner between cases and controls (P = 0.01). The general
   genetic 2-parameter codominant model provided the best fit to the data.
   Compared with the normal MM genotype, the odds ratio (OR) for MZ or MS
   genotypes was 1.47 (95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI] 0.98-2.22), and
   the OR for ZZ, SS, or SZ genotypes was 14.58 (95\% CI 2.33-infinity).
   ORs of similar direction and magnitude were observed within the
   restricted cohorts that excluded cases and controls carrying >= 1 Z or
   >= 1 S allele.
   Conclusion. Both Z and S alleles display associations with risk of WG in
   a codominant genetic pattern. These findings strengthen the evidence of
   a causal link between alpha(1)AT deficiency and susceptibility to WG.}},

Abstract = {{A scale to measure adult decisional balance to eat more fruits and
   vegetables was developed and confirmed, and its psychometric properties
   were assessed. Two simple random samples of adults ages 25-60 years were
   selected from a nationally representative sampling frame. The
   development survey had a 72\% response rate (n = 231). The confirmation
   survey had a 67.4\% response rate (n = 2132). In both surveys, a
   self-administered questionnaire assessed demographics, fruit and
   vegetable intakes, stages of change, and decisional balance. Principal
   components analysis with varimax rotation and confirmatory factor
   analysis were performed. The decisional balance scale had three reliable
   subscales: ``health pros,{''} ``non-health pros,{''} and ``cons.{''}
   Model fit was adequate for a ``pros{''} and ``cons{''} hierarchical
   structure. For both fruits and vegetables, health pros increased
   significantly between precontemplation and contemplation stages,
   surpassing the cons. Non-health pros increased significantly between
   precontemplation and contemplation fruit stages, surpassing the cons in
   preparation stage. Between precontemplation and action stages, health
   pros increased (mean effect size = 0.90 {[}fruit] and 0.80
   {[}vegetables]) and cons decreased (mean effect size = 0.27 {[}fruit]
   and 0.35 {[}vegetables]). Heterogeneity in this sample may have diluted
   these effect sizes. This decisional balance scale is valid and reliable.

Abstract = {{In this work we have proposed a combined experimental-numerical
   technique to elicit important quantitative information about the
   dielectric properties of the interphase region surrounding a
   nanoparticle embedded in a polymer matrix. The method involves
   performing permittivity measurements through dielectric spectroscopy and
   combining with concurrent unit cell based Finite Element solutions of
   the electrostatic fields. The analysis has to be supplemented with some
   information about the degree of agglomeration in the nanocomposites
   which are estimated from electron microscopy done at several
   resolutions. For an epoxy matrix with 40 nm alumina nanoparticles, our
   analysis indicates the presence of an interphase region about 200 nm
   thick and having permittivity lower than that of epoxy. Heating the
   nanoparticles prior to the synthesis of the nanocomposite makes the
   interphase region thicker and lowers its permittivity slightly. At
   higher volume fractions of the nanoparticles, agglomeration sets in and
   creates regions of even higher volume fraction within the matrix. Our
   analysis also revealed that at 2\% volume fraction of alumina
   nanoparticles, 600 nm sized agglomerates exist in the matrix leading to
   local particle volume fraction as high as 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent parotid pleomorphic adenoma surgery increases the risk of
   facial nerve injury, and there is also a risk of ulterior recurrence.
   Postoperative results from 62 consecutive patients operated for
   recurrent pleomorphic adenoma were analyzed. It was the first recurrence
   for 49 patients (79\%), the second or more for 13 patients (21\%).
   Total parotidectomy was performed in 69.4\% of cases. Skin resection was
   performed in 47 patients (75.8\%). Resection of a facial nerve branch
   was performed in seven patients (11.3\%). Pathologic examination
   findings revealed carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma in 10/62 cases
   (16.1\%) and microscopic multinodular disease in 39 patients (62.9\%).
   Nine patients had preoperative facial palsy, 95\% had postoperative
   facial paralysis a parts per thousand yengrade II (House-Brackmann
   scale), and 11.3\% still had a parts per thousand yengrade III facial
   palsy after 1 year. Six patients developed another recurrence after our
   intervention (9.68\%). Moreover, carcinoma was discovered after a new
   intervention in 40\% of these patients. Initial partial parotid surgery
   {[}hazard ratio (HR) = 8.477, P = 0.008], microscopic multinodular
   recurrent disease (HR = 11.717, P = 0.005), and a parts per thousand
   yen1 recurrence number (HR = 10.608, P = 0.01) were associated with
   increased risk of ulterior recurrence.
   Surgery is recommended in pleomorphic adenoma recurrence because of the
   high rate of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (16.1\%). Nevertheless, a
   definitive facial paralysis a parts per thousand yengrade III rate of
   11.3\% is reported after multiple nerve dissection. New recurrence after
   surgery is less frequent if the initial treatment for pleomorphic
   adenoma is total parotidectomy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Peanut allergenicity has been reported to be influenced by
   heat treatment, yet the commonly available extracts for skin prick
   testing (SPT) are derived from raw extracts.
   Objective: To assess the effect of heat treatment on the SPT reactivity
   and specific IgE binding to peanut.
   Methods: Three commercial extracts and 3 laboratory-prepared extracts,
   including raw, roasted, and boiled, were used for SPT in 19 patients
   with suspected peanut allergy and in 4 individuals who eat peanut
   without any symptoms. Serum samples were obtained to measure total IgE
   in addition to specific IgE binding to the study extracts by
   immunoblotting. Peanut allergy was confirmed with challenge test unless
   the individual had a convincing history of a severe reaction.
   Results: Eleven study participants were considered peanut allergic based
   on a strong history or positive challenge test result. SPT with the
   prepared and commercial reagents showed that the boiled extract had the
   highest specificity (67\% vs 42\%-63\% for the other extracts). The
   prepared extracts showed similar SPT sensitivity (81\%). Three patients
   with a history of severe reaction and elevated specific IgE levels to
   peanut to the 3 study extracts had variable SPT reactivity to 1 or more
   of the commercial extracts. IgE binding to Ara h 2 was found in nearly
   all patients, regardless of their clinical reactivity.
   Conclusions: None of the extracts tested showed optimal diagnostic
   reliability regarding both sensitivity and specificity. Perhaps testing
   should be performed with multiple individual extracts prepared by
   different methods. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2010;105:451-457.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Basal cell carcinomas are the most prevalent of all skin
   cancers worldwide and form the majority of the surgical workload for
   most modern cutaneous malignancy centres. Primary surgical removal of
   basal cell carcinomas remains the gold standard of treatment but,
   despite almost two centuries of surgical experience, rates of incomplete
   surgical excision of up to 50\% are still reported.
   The aim of this study was to assess, quantify and perform comparative
   analysis of the outcomes and predictive factors of consecutive
   primarily-excised basal cell carcinomas in a tertiary centre over a
   six-year period.
   Methods: Retrospective audit was conducted on all patients who underwent
   surgical excision of basal cell carcinomas from January 2000 to December
   2005. Assessment parameters included patient biographics, tumour
   management differences and detailed histopathological analysis of tumour
   margins and subtypes.
   Results: One thousand eight hundred and thirty two basal cell carcinomas
   were excised from 1329 patients over the designated time period. Two
   hundred and fifty one (14\%) lesions were incompletely excised with 135
   (7.4\%) involving the peripheral margin only, 48 (2.6\%) the deep margin
   only and 41 (2.2\%) involving both. Nasal location was the most common
   predictor of incomplete excision.
   Conclusions: Overall basal cell carcinomas excision rates compared
   favourably with international reported standards but attention to a
   variety of surgical and histological risk factors may improve this
   further. (C) 2010 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and

Abstract = {{The femtosecond laser-induced multi-photon polymerization of a
   zirconium-silicon based sol-gel photopolymer was employed for the
   fabrication of a series of micro-optical elements with single and
   combined optical functions: convex and Fresnel lenses, gratings, solid
   immersion lenses on a glass slide and on the tip of an optical fiber.
   The microlenses were produced as polymer caps of varying radii from 10
   to 90 mu m. The matching of refractive indices between the polymer and
   substrate was exploited for the creation of composite glass-resist
   structures which functioned as single lenses. Using this principle,
   solid immersion lenses were fabricated and their performance
   demonstrated. The magnification of the composite solid immersion lenses
   corresponded to the calculated values. The surface roughness of the
   lenses was below similar to 30 nm, acceptable for optical applications
   in the visible range. In addition, the integration of micro-optical
   elements onto the tip of an optical fiber was demonstrated. To increase
   the efficiency of the 3D laser polymerization, the lenses were formed by
   scanning only the outer shell and polymerizing the interior by exposure
   to UV light.}},

Abstract = {{The most northerly population of American shad (Alosa sapidissima),
   located in the St. Lawrence River, is considered vulnerable because of
   low population abundance and limited spawning habitat located at the
   upstream extent of the population's anadromous migration. Here, we aimed
   to establish the temporal and spatial extent of spawning based on a
   novel hatch-date analysis of juveniles. Spawning activity lasted from
   early May to early July. We found that juveniles captured downstream
   during the summer hatched later in the year than those captured further
   upstream. As a result, younger juveniles were distributed somewhat
   further downstream. In addition, we found significant multimodality in
   hatch-date distributions at midstream and downstream sampling stations.
   Together, these results provide evidence that the 2-month spawning
   period involved numerous spawning events that progressed in a downstream
   direction as the season advanced, rather than being restricted to
   upstream sites over the spawning season.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of co(variance) components and genetic parameters were
   obtained for birth weight in Jakhrana goat maintained at the Central
   Institute for Research on Goats, Makhdoom, Mathura, India, over a period
   of 5 years (2005 to 2009). Records of 498 kids from 140 does sired by 29
   bucks were used in the study. Analyses were carried out by REML fitting
   an animal model and ignoring or including maternal genetic or permanent
   environmental effects. Four different animal models were fitted for
   birth weight. Direct heritability estimates were inflated substantially
   for the trait when maternal effects were ignored. Direct heritability
   estimates for birth weight ranged from 0.40 to 0.61 depended on models
   used. Maternal heritability for this trait was 0.10, whereas, the
   estimates of the fraction of variance due to maternal permanent
   environmental effects was 0.11. Results suggest that the maternal
   effects (i.e. both maternal additive and/or permanent environmental
   maternal effect) were also important for birth weight. These results
   indicate that there is ample scope of genetic progress through selection
   for this trait.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-92}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of exclusive contracting between vendors of
   platforms (such as video game consoles) and vendors of complements (such
   as video games). The main questions of interest are: When do we observe
   complement exclusivity, and what is the impact of exclusive contracting
   on prices, profits and efficiency? We answer these questions by
   developing a model of competition between platforms in an industry with
   indirect network effects, and deriving some insightful analytical and
   numerical results. While complement vendors have natural incentives to
   be available on all platforms, we establish conditions under which they
   can be contracted for exclusive supply on a single platform. Exclusivity
   eases competition in the platform market and can significantly help
   increase a platform's adoption. However, exclusivity choice presents a
   key trade-off for the complement vendor a larger platform offers access
   to a larger market, but also more competition, as compared to a smaller
   platform. We find that exclusivity is more likely in the nascent and
   very mature stages of the platform market, whereas non-exclusivity is
   more likely in the intermediate stages. Interestingly, our numerical
   analysis suggests that a complement vendor might sometimes prefer being
   exclusive on the smaller platform, rather than the larger one. (C) 2010

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of optical ages derived from tidal sediments depends
   largely upon the transport processes. These processes constrain the
   degree of bleaching by the time of deposition and the choice of grain
   size for dating. This study looks at flow regime, sediment bedding,
   particle size and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) over tidal
   flats in order to identify the tidal sub-environment from which reliable
   multigrain optical ages are most likely to be achieved. The resulting
   conceptual model is then compared with empirical OSL data obtained from
   Holocene sediments of the southern North Sea tidal coastal plain of
   continental Europe. Optical dating of the tidal sediments included
   single-aliquot-regenerative dose protocol applied to multigrain aliquots
   of fine sand and fine silt, statistical analysis using weighted
   skewness, standardised kurtosis and over-dispersion. It is inferred from
   the model that smaller grains should be better bleached than larger
   grains. However, because transport and deposition processes are
   extremely variable in both space and time, unequivocal ``bleaching
   rules{''} could not be assigned to a particular tidal sub-environment.
   In this context more than 85\% of our samples return accurate ages and
   around 13\% of our optical ages are overestimated when compared with
   ages from established well-constrained stratigraphic frameworks. The
   empirical study confirms the concept of ``variable bleaching rules{''}:
   both accurate and inaccurate ages are obtained from silty and sandy OSL
   samples regardless of the sub-environment and well-bleached samples may
   be obtained from all tidal sub-environments. Although our study is based
   on multiple-grain aliquots it also shows that an independent statistical
   treatment of equivalent dose data is an indispensable procedure to
   detect and correct for insufficient bleaching. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   MRI is an excellent imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with

   soft tissue contrast are extremely useful in the detection of deeply
   infiltrating endometriotic implants, even in the setting of intense

   posterior cul-de-sac and fixed retroversion of the uterus, which limits
   the scope of laparoscopy. The use of endovaginal and rectal contrast is
   helpful to better delineate the anatomy of interest and map out the

Abstract = {{Background Severe or extreme obesity in children and adolescents is a
   progressive damaging disease, increasingly requiring surgical treatment.
   Timing and choice of operation are controversial.
   Method In the last 16 years, we performed open biliopancreatic diversion
   with duodenal switch (DS) in 13 adolescents aged 15-17 years, who have
   been followed up for 2-16 years (mean, 10.6 years); three with
   Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are presented separately.
   Results Among the ten non-PWS children (7 girls), no deaths or
   perioperative complications were reported, mean body mass index (BMI)
   decreased from 55.9 +/- 14.0 to 28.8 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2) (\% excess weight
   loss (EWL) = 82.1 +/- 10.5\%), and none have regained weight. All
   comorbidities were cured except asthma, which improved in one patient.
   There were two reoperations: one for intestinal obstruction and one for
   post-anastomotic ulcer. Glucose and lipid metabolism improved, while
   vitamin and mineral deficiencies were mild and rare. Five of the seven
   girls gave birth to 11 children, aged 2-12 years, two of whom are
   overweight but not severely obese. Neurodevelopment is age-appropriate
   in all 11 individuals. PWS children, aged 15-16 years, had postoperative
   respiratory and infectious complications necessitating hospitalizations
   of 13-22 days (versus 5.1 +/- 1.2 days in non-PWS). Weight loss and
   comorbidity improvement lasted approximately 5 years, providing improved
   quality of life for patient and family. One PWS patient died from
   complications after reoperation for weight regain after 4 years. One was
   reoperated after 6 years and the third is considering reoperation 14
   years after primary DS.
   Conclusion The beneficial effects of DS in adolescents exceed the risks,

Abstract = {{Objective-To design and manufacture free form biodegradable
   polycaprolactone (PCL) bone plates and to compare mechanical properties
   of femoral constructs with a distal physeal fracture repaired by use of
   5 stabilization methods
   Sample Population-40 canine femoral replicas created by use of additive
   manufacturing and rapid tooling
   Procedures-Surgery duration mediolateral and craniocaudal bending
   stiffness and torsional stiffness of femoral physeal fracture repair
   constructs made by use of 5 stabilization methods were assessed The
   implants included 2 Kirschner wires inserted medially and 2 inserted
   laterally (4KW) a commercial stainless steel plate (CSP) a custom
   free-form titanium plate (CTP) thin (2-mm-thick) biodegradable PCL
   plates (TNP) placed medially and laterally and thick (4-mm-thick) PCL
   plates (TKP) placed medially and laterally
   Results-Surgical placement of 4KW was more rapid than placement of other
   implants The mean caudal cantilever bending stiffness of CTP and CSP
   constructs was greater than that for TNP TKP and 4KW constructs and the
   mean caudal cantilever bending stiffness of TNP and TKP constructs was
   greater than that for 4KW constructs The mean lateral cantilever bending
   stiffness of TKP constructs was greater than that for 4KW constructs
   Differences among construct types were not significant in yield strength
   ultimate strength yield torque and ultimate torque
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The mechanical properties of fracture
   repair constructs made from free-form PCL biodegradable plates compared
   favorably with those of constructs made from Kirschner wires The impact
   of PCL plates on musculoskeletal soft tissues bone healing and bone
   growth should be evaluated before clinical use (Am J Vet Res 2010 71

Abstract = {{In order to establish a joint pandemic strategy, the German states
   ({''}Lander{''}) together with the German federal government
   ({''}Bund{''}) agreed on joint preparations for pandemic scenarios. This
   included the description of procedures, such as infection control
   measures, stockpiling of antiviral drugs, and contracts with vaccine
   manufacturers to ensure supply of vaccines in the event of a pandemic.
   The situation during the influenza H1N1 pandemic differed from that
   planned so that many short-term adjustments were required. It
   highlighted the need to make pandemic planning more flexible. In spite
   of several obstacles which had to be overcome during the situation, the
   states managed to achieve a relatively coordinated procedure and
   provided the availability of vaccines. In the course of the pandemic,
   gaps and shortcoming in existing surveillance systems were identified,
   which should lead to further improvements. A key point for future
   pandemic events is successful communication between all interested
   parties, especially with the medical profession, to increase the
   acceptance of public policies.}},

Abstract = {{k-t Sensitivity-encoded (k-t SENSE) acceleration has been used to
   improve spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and slice coverage in
   first-pass cardiac magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging. This
   study compares the effect of investing the speed-up afforded by k-t
   SENSE acceleration in spatial or temporal resolution. Ten healthy
   volunteers underwent adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging using
   four saturation-recovery gradient echo perfusion sequences: a reference
   sequence accelerated by sensitivity encoding (SENSE), and three k-t
   SENSE-accelerated sequences with higher spatial resolution ({''}k-t
   High{''}), shorter acquisition window ({''}k-t Fast{''}), or a shared
   increase in both parameters ({''}k-t Hybrid{''}) relative to the
   reference. Dark-rim artifacts and image quality were analyzed.
   Semiquantitative myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) and
   Fermi-derived quantitative MPR were also calculated. The k-t Hybrid
   sequence produced highest image quality scores at rest (P = 0.015). Rim
   artifact thickness and extent were lowest using k-t High and k-t Hybrid
   sequences (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in MPRI and
   MPR values derived by each sequence. Maximizing spatial resolution by
   k-t SENSE acceleration produces the greatest reduction in dark rim
   artifact. There is good agreement between k-t SENSE and standard
   acquisition methods for semiquantitative and fully quantitative
   myocardial perfusion analysis. Magn Reson Med 64:1616-1624, 2010. (C)

Abstract = {{Radiation methods are largely used for polymerisation and polymer
   modification, since irradiation induces transformations in the structure
   of materials which can be exploited to improve their performance. On the
   other hand, combined action of ionising radiation and oxygen may lead to
   degradation of the polymer, with worsening of properties such as
   mechanical strength or electrical insulation resistance. Therefore, the
   change of the chemical and physical properties of polymers under
   irradiation is a dynamic topic of research. In this work there are
   discussed data on the physical features of a polyester, poly(ethylene
   isophthalate) (PEI), subjected to gamma irradiation up to 1 MGy. PEI is
   a semicrystalline polymer with a structure similar to polyethylene
   terephthalate. Viscosity and differential scanning calorimetry
   measurements were carried out which allowed the monitoring of changes in
   the structure in terms of variations in the molecular weight, as well as
   of the percentage crystallinity depending on the dose. Furthermore,
   positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy supplied information on the
   free volume present in the amorphous phase of the irradiated polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Echinaster (Othilia) guyanensis Clark, 1987 is an endangered starfish
   distributed throughout the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. Even though it

   E. (O.) guyanensis. Individuals were collected monthly for one year,
   including four complete lunar phases. The gonad index (GI) was
   calculated to determine annual and monthly reproductive peaks.
   Gametogenesis stages were also determined. Sex ratio was 1:1.33 (M:F).
   Gonadosomatic index, body weight, central disc width and arm length were
   similar for both sexes. Gonads were present in all animals with arm
   length greater than 36.2 mm. Lunar phase was not associated with E. (O.)
   guyanensis reproduction. GI and gametogenesis patterns suggest that
   starfish have an annual reproductive peak with spawning during autumn
   months (March to May).}},

Abstract = {{Transient four stranded joint DNA molecules bridging sister chromatids
   constitute an intriguing feature of replicating genomes. Here, we
   studied their structure and frequency of formation in Physarum

   four continuous DNA strands. Discontinuities, which do not interfere
   with the unique propensity of the joint DNA molecules to branch migrate
   in vitro, are linked to the crossover, enhanced by RNaseA, and affect at
   most half of the DNA strands. We propose a structural model of joint DNA
   molecules containing ribonucleotides inserted within one strand, a
   gapped strand, and two continuous DNA strands. We further show that
   spontaneous joint DNA molecules are short-lived and are as abundant as
   replication forks. Our results emphasize the highly frequent formation
   of joint DNA molecules involving newly replicated DNA in an untreated
   cell and uncover a transitory mechanism connecting the sister chromatids
   during S phase.}},

   4-amino-3-cyano-1,2-dihydrospiro(naphthalene-2,1'-cyclopentane) with
   gamma-chlorobutyryl chloride and aromatic acid chlorides yielded amides
   that were cyclized into 2-substituted
   4-oxo-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrospiro(benzo{[}h]quinazoline-5,1'-cyclopentanes).
   Replacement of the chlorides by nucleophilic reagents (alkoxides,
   secondary amines, thiolates) was studied. It was established that
   2-(gamma-chloropropyl)-4-oxo-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrospiro(benzo{[}h]quinazoli
   ne-5,1'-cyclopropane) underwent intramolecular cyclization to form
   6-oxo-2,3,4,5,7,8-hexahydrospiro(benzo{[}h]pyrrolo{[}2,1-b]quinazoline-7
   ,1'-cyclopentane) whereas
   2-chloromethyl-4-oxo-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrospiro(benzo{[}h]quinazoline-5,1'-
   cyclopentane) formed substitution products. The antimonoamineoxidase and
   antineoplastic properties of the synthesized compounds were studied.}},

Abstract = {{The positioning of single molecules between nanoscale electrodes(1-8)
   has allowed their use as functional units in electronic devices.
   Although the electrical transport in such devices has been widely
   explored, optical measurements have been restricted to the observation
   of electroluminescence from nano-crystals and nanoclusters(9,10) and
   from molecules in a scanning tunnelling microscope setup(11,12). In this
   Letter, we report the observation of electroluminescence from the core
   of a rod-like molecule between two metallic single-walled carbon
   nanotube electrodes forming a rigid solid-state device. We also develop
   a simple model to explain the onset voltage for electroluminescence.
   These results suggest new characterization and functional possibilities,
   and demonstrate the potential of carbon nanotubes for use in molecular
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Tri-generation is a novel application of energy technologies which

   involving an energy conversion ratio and newly defined
   heating-to-cooling and electric-to-cooling load ratios to usual system
   component thermodynamic parameters (such as coefficient of performance
   or prime mover thermal efficiency) was carried out. To illustrate the
   usefulness of the criterion, a tri-generation pilot plant set up in an

Abstract = {{Background Body mass index (BMI) is related with cardiorespiratory
   fitness (CRF), but less is known regarding the combined relationships
   between BMI and body fat (BF) on CRF.
   Design Cross-sectional study included 2361 girls and 2328 boys aged
   10-18 years living in the area of Lisbon, Portugal. BMI was calculated
   by measuring height and weight, and obesity was assessed by
   international criteria. BF was assessed by bioimpedance. CRF was
   assessed by the 20-m shuttle run and the participants were classified as
   normal-to-high or low-CRF level according to Fitnessgram
   criterion-referenced standards.
   Results The prevalence of low CRF was 47 and 39\% in girls and boys,
   respectively. The corresponding values for the prevalence of obesity
   were 4.8 and 5.6\% (not significant) and of excess BF of 12.1 and 25.1\%
   (P < 0.001), respectively. In both sexes, BMI and BF were inversely
   related with CRF: r = -0.53 and -0.45 for BMI and \% BF, respectively,
   in boys and the corresponding values in girls were -0.50 and -0.33 (all
   P < 0.01). When compared with a participant with normal BMI and BF, the
   odds ratios (95\% confidence interval) for low CRF were 1.94 (1.46-2.58)
   for a participant with normal BMI and high BF, and 6.19 (5.02-7.63) for
   a participant with high BMI and high BF.
   Conclusion The prevalence of low-CRF levels is high in Portuguese
   youths. BF negatively influences CRF levels among children/adolescents
   with normal BMI. Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 17:649-654 (C) 2010 The
