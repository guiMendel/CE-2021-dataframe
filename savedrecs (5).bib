Abstract = {{Syzygium aqueum is a well-known edible fruit-bearing plant species. The
   tribal people in Malaysia used different parts of the plant to cure
   various ailments. The previous studies on phytochemical evaluation of S.
   aqueum are very limited. The present study aims to conduct a detailed
   investigation of phytochemicals present in the leaves of S. aqueum and
   also its potential use as an effective antioxidant agent. In this study,
   the methanolic leaf extract of S. aqueum was tested to determine its
   chemical composition and its antioxidant activity. The result of the
   preliminary phytochemical investigation in leaf extract of S aqueum
   revealed the presence of several bioactive secondary metabolites such as
   phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, and terpenoids.
   Quantification results showed that the total phenol was found to be
   62.89 +/- 1.48\% GAE and the flavonoid content was 15.05 +/- 0.36\% QE.
   Further analysis of the antioxidant activity in leaf extract of S.
   aqueum using different antioxidant assays proved that the extract
   effectively scavenging diverse types of free radicals. In different
   antioxidant assays, the leaf extract showed different IC50 values viz.,
   an IC50 of 83.53 mu g/mL in 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl- hydrazyl (DPPH)
   scavenging assay, an IC50 of 721.59 mu g/mL in Hydrogen peroxide radical
   scavenging assay, an IC50 of 1338.73 mu gg/mL in Superoxide radical
   scavenging assay, an IC50 of 3268.99 mu g/mL in Nitric oxide radical
   scavenging activity, an IC50 of 1441.0 mu g/mL in Hydroxyl radical
   scavenging assay, an IC50 of 2802.521 mu g/mL in ABTS scavenging assay.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of the inorganic scales of ten species of centrohelid
   heliozoans collected from various types of aquatic habitats in Vietnam

   spine scales of Acanthocystis turfacea are distinguished by the
   characteristic conically pointed tips of furcae and longer furcae
   relative to the shaft length in long spine scales. Morphologically, the
   plate scales of Pterocystis tropica examined correspond to those of the
   subspecies P. tropicapaucistriata; the spine scales, to those of the
   subspecies P. tropicatropica. The examined plate scales of Raineriophrys
   erinaceoidesundulata lack radial slits, unlike those indicated in the
   original description of this subspecies. Two new species of centrohelid
   heliozoans are described. Pterocystis vietnamica sp. n. is characterized
   by leaf-shaped spine scales with transverse slits on the lateral wings

Abstract = {{Rickettsial zoonotic diseases, in particular scrub typhus, murine
   typhus, and tick typhus, are caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi,
   Rickettsia typhi, and Rickettsia honei infections. Rickettsiae exposure
   is typically related to a rodent host in various habitats of marginal
   regions, including between rural areas and communities such as the
   Salaya suburb. This allows the oriental house rat (OHR), a highly
   adaptive species, to live in close proximity to the community and
   possibly introduce rickettsial diseases. To understand rickettsial
   exposure in the OHR from different habitats, knowledge of disease
   exposure can serve as baseline information for disease management and
   prevention. A total of 185 OHRs from three unrelated habitats were
   assessed using a standard indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for
   specific antibody reaction to O. tsutsugamushi, R. typhi, and R. honei.
   The presence of antibody in the OHR to rickettsiae, either scrub or
   murine typhus, was associated with the habitat, whereas tick typhus had
   general exposure. This finding shows the OHR to be a potential reservoir
   host for rickettsial diseases along the borders of geographic regions in
   the suburban environment.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of aluminium (Al) in the brain is known to be a toxic
   insult that result in neurodegenerative diseases and melatonin is known
   to have neumprotective role. The present study was designed to
   investigate the neuroprotective effects of melatonin for aluminium
   chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Twelve-week old male
   Wistar rats were orally received 175 mg/kg AlCl3 with or without 5 mg/kg
   melatonin intraperitoneal pretreatment. Group 3 intraperitoneally
   recieved 5 mg/kg melatonin and group 4 rats were orally treated with
   saline solution for 8 weeks. A series of behavioral tests, biochemical
   analysis and expression of AD-associated proteins in the brain were
   determined after 7 weeks of all treatments. Our results indicated that
   AlCl3 treatment tends to induce memory and cognitive impairment.
   However, melatonin treatment attenuated amyloid beta (A beta) (1-42)
   level by decreasing beta-secretase, augmented low-density lipoprotein
   receptor-related protein 1, and neprilysin protein expression. Moreover,
   AlCl3-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress was
   attenuated by melatonin supplementation. In conclusion, these findings
   demonstrate a protective role of melatonin against A beta peptide
   accumulation, ER stress and oxidative stress in the AlCl3-treated AD
   model. Hence, the melatonin supplement might be an alternative way to
   alleviate the development of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Silane cross-linked polyethylene was examined by electron paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR) spectroscopy before and after gamma-irradiation at a
   dose rate of 77.7 Gy/h to a dose of 374 kGy, which corresponds to
   approximately 40 years of radiation aging in nuclear power plants (NPP).
   Radicals generated after post-aging by gamma radiation at 77 K (10 kGy,
   2.2 kGy/h) were identified in a polymer unprotected, doped with phenolic
   antioxidant, thioether antioxidant or both. The radical processes in
   non-aged and long-term aged polyethylene differed significantly. In the
   second case, peroxyl radicals dominated at lowest temperatures, while
   the content of secondary alkyl radicals increased gradually during
   thermal annealing to 220 K, whereas above ambient temperature tertiary
   or primary alkyl radicals appeared. The stability of alkyl radicals was
   related to the rapid consumption of oxygen and, consequently, its
   depletion in earlier stages of radical processes. Phenolic antioxidant
   suppressed the above effects and protected the cross-linked structure of
   the polymer matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our research is to analyze how board characteristics
   influence firm performance. In this paper, we specifically examine how
   board size, board independence, CEO duality, female directors and board
   compensation affect firm performance in a sample of international firms.
   The final panel data sample is composed of 10,314 firm-year observations
   belonging to 34 countries that have been grouped into six geographic
   zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania.
   Drawing on agency theory and dependence resource theory, we posit five
   hypotheses. The results show that some board characteristics, such as
   board size, board independence and having a female director, are
   positively associated with firm performance, whereas CEO duality,
   contrary to our expectations, also impacts positively on firm
   performance. Moreover, board compensation is not associated with firm
   performance. Tobin's Q was used to measure firm performance, although an
   accounting measure was also employed for robustness analyses and to
   provide more validity to our results.}},

Abstract = {{Background Coronary artery bypass grafting is the first-line therapy for
   severe multivessel coronary artery disease. We aimed to investigate the
   clinical outcome in patients undergoing isolated off-pump surgery with
   the single or bilateral internal mammary artery (SIMA or BIMA) approach.
   Methods We performed a propensity score-matched analysis in 1,852
   consecutive patients, aged 50 to 70 years, who underwent myocardial
   revascularization at our institution between July 2009 and August 2016.
   Primary end point was the probability of survival.
   Results Mean follow-up was 36.3 (range: 0.1-89.6) months. The
   probability of survival in the SIMA and BIMA groups was 98.6 and 99.0\%
   at year 1, 92.0 and 92.5\% at year 5, and 85.6 and 81.6\% at year 7,
   respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of mortality for the BIMA group
   versus the SIMA group of 0.98 (95\% confidence interval{[}CI]:
   0.64-1.52; p =0.94). There was evidence for interaction between diabetes
   and study group on mortality risk (HR=2.59, 95\% CI: 1.07-6.23; p
   =0.034). Freedom from mediastinitis/wound infection was higher in the
   SIMA group than in the BIMA group (99.5 and 96.9\%, respectively; HR of
   an event=6.39, 95\% CI: 2.88-14.18; p <0.001). The corresponding values
   in the subgroups of diabetic patients were 98.6 and 90.9\%, respectively
   (HR=6.45, 95\% CI: 2.24-18.58; p =0.001). Mediastinitis/wound infection
   was associated with increased mortality risk (HR=2.96, 95\% CI:
   1.29-6.78; p =0.010).
   Conclusion Overall, our data indicate similar probability of survival up
   to a maximum follow-up of 7 years by off-pump surgery with the SIMA or
   BIMA approach. However, in diabetic patients, the clinical outcome
   indicates caution regarding the use of the BIMA approach.}},

Abstract = {{Preworkout multi-ingredient admixtures are used to maximise exercise
   performance. The present double-blind, cross-over study compared the
   acute effects of ingesting a preworkout multi-ingredient (PREW)
   admixture vs. carbohydrate (CHO) over a week (microcycle) comprising
   three resistance training (RT) workouts alternated with two 30-min
   low-intensity endurance sessions (END) on RT volume (kg lifted) and END
   substrate oxidation. Additionally, postworkout decreases of muscle
   function and subjective responses were analysed. Following a baseline
   assessment, fourteen recreationally trained, middle-aged adults (seven
   females, 48.8 +/- 4.7 years old) completed two identical microcycles
   separated by a two-week washout period while receiving either PREW or
   CHO (15 min prior to workout). The RT volume, per session (SVOL) and for
   the entire week (WVOL), was calculated. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
   during 30-min cycling corresponding to their individually determined
   maximal fat oxidation was measured using expired gasses and indirect
   calorimetry. Assessments of performance and tensiomyography were
   conducted within 20 min after each RT. Higher (p = 0.001) SVOL and WVOL
   along with a larger proportion of FAO (p = 0.05) during the second END
   workout were determined under the PREW treatment. No other statistically
   significant differences were observed between conditions. Compared to
   CHO, a preworkout multi-ingredient appears to increase resistance volume
   and favour fat oxidation during low-intensity endurance exercises.}},

Abstract = {{Unexpected failure of industrial motors is costly in production loss and
   is time consuming in repairing process. Motor current signature analysis
   has been used for fault diagnosis and detection but this method is
   depended on the voltage input quality and motor loading level in order
   to achieve accurate results. In this study, a novel motor fault
   detection and diagnosis method is proposed. The method is a preliminary
   study of a new approach in model-based fault detection and diagnosis
   method. It works by analyzing the bode diagram of the induction motor
   that will be generated by using current per voltage ratio in
   frequency-domain. Five industrial induction motors with three different
   conditions are the examples in this study. Two induction motors are in
   healthy condition, two induction motors are operated under
   misalignment/unbalance fault, and one induction motor is operated under
   bearing fault condition. The study results show that the proposed bode
   diagram approach can be used to detect the motor faults and the
   difference patterns appeared are visibly notable for the fault detection
   and diagnosis (FDD) of motor condition.}},

Abstract = {{The threat caused by plants fungal and fungal-like pathogens is a
   serious problem in the organic farming of soft fruits. The European
   Commission regulations prohibit some commercially available chemical
   plant protection products, and instead recommend the use of natural
   methods for improving the microbial soil status and thus increasing
   resistance to biotic stresses caused by phytopathogens. The solution to
   this problem may be biopreparations based on, e.g., bacteria, especially
   those isolated from native local environments. To select proper
   bacterial candidates for biopreparation, research was provided to
   preliminarily ensure that those isolates are able not only to inhibit
   the growth of pathogens, but also to be metabolically effective. In the
   presented research sixty-five isolates were acquired and identified.
   Potentially pathogenic isolates were excluded from further research, and
   beneficial bacterial isolates were tested against the following plant
   pathogens: Botrytis spp., Colletotrichum spp., Phytophthora spp., and
   Verticillium spp. The eight most effective antagonists belonging to
   Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Rhodococcus genera were
   subjected to metabolic and enzymatic analyses and a resistance to

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Underwater acoustic transducers are used to detect and track targets by
   using sound waves in underwater environments. To enhance the
   performance, they can be arranged in various formations to create
   arrays. However, acoustic interaction between the constituent channels
   of array transducers is inevitable, and it distorts their
   characteristics. In this study, the transmitting voltage response (TVR)
   spectrum of an acoustic planar array transducer is analyzed by
   considering the crosstalk between channels. The transmitting performance
   of an array transducer is frequently analyzed using the conventional
   finite element method (FEM). However, when the size of the array is
   large, the time and cost of computation using the FEM increase to almost
   prohibitive levels. To overcome this problem, a new equivalent circuit
   method (ECM) is developed to analyze the acoustic characteristics of an
   underwater array transducer. The ECM is validated by comparing its TVR
   spectrum with that analyzed using the FEM. After validation, the ECM is
   utilized to design the optimal structure of a planar array transducer
   having the broadest bandwidth. The sample analysis conducted using the
   ECM was approximately 1780 times faster than that by the FEM. Therefore
   the ECM developed in this work can facilitate the design of an
   underwater planar array transducer with a superior speed and efficiency
   compared with those achievable with the conventional numerical analysis
   methods such as the FEM.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I posit that the transformation of monastic habits is

   at the schools founded by religious orders, mainly by Protestant and
   Catholic missionaries, could have manifested faith and religious
   identity. These religious authorities, who acted as managers of civic
   education, coincided with other public and private schools founded in
   secular contexts, unlike the religious emblems of those groups in their
   home countries. Many schools founded by Christian missionaries in East
   Asia in the early twentieth century eliminated a ``sacred versus
   profane{''} dichotomy in their school uniforms and school symbols. In
   the formulation of a nation state in East Asia, homogeneity among
   inhabitants was more important than a faith-based religious identity by
   each Christian missionary group. Wearers of school uniforms in East Asia
   were taught to nurture civic identity along with the faith.}},

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic halide organometal perovskites have demonstrated very
   promising performance in optoelectronic applications, but their
   relatively poor chemical and colloidal stability hampers the further
   improvement of devices based on these materials. Perovskite material
   engineering is crucial for achieving high photoluminescence quantum
   yields (PLQYs) and long stability. Herein, these goals are attained by
   incorporating bulk-structure CsPbBr3, which prevents colloidal
   degradation, into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer in thin-disk
   form. This technology can potentially realize future disk lasers with no
   optical and structural contributions from the polymer. The
   polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite particles were simply obtained by
   using a mechanical processing technique. The CsPbBr3 was then
   incorporated into the PMMA polymer using a solution blending method. The
   polymer enhanced the PLQYs by removing the surface trap states and
   increasing the water resistance and stability under ambient conditions.
   In our experimental investigation, the CsPbBr3/PMMA composites were
   extraordinarily stable and remained strongly luminescent after water
   immersion for three months and air exposure for over one year,
   maintaining 80\% of their initial photoluminescence intensity. The
   CsPbBr3/PMMA thin disk produced amplified spontaneous emission for a
   long time in air and for more than two weeks in water.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates a dramatic improvement in the mechanical
   characteristics of PLGA by blending with PTMC. The addition content of 1
   wt\% PTMC to PLGA matrix had the highest tensile strength and tensile
   modulus, the values were 57.46 MPa and 1.06 GPa respectively. It is
   shown that the interfacial compatibility between the component polymers
   contributes to the formation of super- tough PLGA materials. The result
   of the FTIR showed that there was no chemical reaction between the two
   polymers. The thermal stability of blends was slightly reduced,
   comparing with the PLGA. Crystallization morphology of PLGA/PTMC
   composites was spherulite. The degradation properties of PLGA/PTMC
   composites were studied initially after soaking in PBS. The intrinsic
   viscosity of samples decreased with respect to the soaking time, mass
   loss decreased more remarkable at 8 weeks, and the tensile strength
   could maintain 4 weeks. All the results suggested that the PLGA/PTMC
   composites might develop a novel material to be used as bone repair
   materials in the future.}},

Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{351}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Three major late Neoproterozoic global cryochrons mark the coldest
   climate state in Earth history, with glaciers covering most, if not all,
   continents. However, the terrestrial paleosurface temperature
   differential between cryochmn and nonglacial interlude is unknown.
   Time-equivalent Cryogenian and Ediacaran sedimentary successions from
   South China and Oman show multiple negative excursions of the corrected
   values of their chemical index of alteration (CIA(corr)). These
   excursions reflect climate cooling and correlate with the Sturtian,
   Marinoan and Gaskiers cryochrons. Based on the tau(Na)-MAT transfer
   function (sodium chemical depletion index-mean annual temperature), we
   estimate the temperature differential between Cryogenian cryochron and
   nonglacial interlude reached 20 +/- 5.4 degrees C at around 30 degrees
   paleolatitude, and 12 +/- 5.4 degrees C temperature difference between
   the Ediacaran cryochmn and nonglacial interlude near the equator. The
   fluctuation of CIA(corr) and MAT trends within individual cryochmns
   likely indicate cold-warm climate cycling during the Cryogenian
   cryochron.}},

Abstract = {{Under the ``Internet+{''} environment, the R\&D intensity of products
   and services has increased; hence, organizations need to improve their
   ability to integrate knowledge and technology resources. Knowledge gaps
   will arise when an organization's knowledge reserves fail to meet the
   needs of innovation activities. This research established a network of
   complete knowledge topics under the ``Internet+{''} environment based on
   the Word2Vec model. The word vectors and word frequencies of
   organizational reserve knowledge texts were analyzed to establish an
   organizational reserve knowledge topic network. The Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency algorithm was used to identify the
   demanded knowledge topic. The satisfaction capability of demanded
   knowledge in the reserve knowledge topic network was calculated via the
   eigenvector centrality and the fuzzy evaluation method. The
   corresponding strategies were then put forward to make up the knowledge
   gap. Finally, a case study was conducted and compared with SWOT
   (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) and Venn diagram
   analysis on the economic and management college of a university in
   Beijing to verify the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{The routine assessment to determine the genetic etiology for fetal
   ultrasound anomalies follows a sequential approach, which usually takes
   about 6-8 weeks turnaround time (TAT). We evaluated the clinical utility
   of simultaneous detection of copy number variations (CNVs) and single
   nucleotide variants (SNVs)/small insertion-deletions (indels) in fetuses
   with a normal karyotype with ultrasound anomalies. We performed CNV
   detection by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or low pass
   CNV-sequencing (CNV-seq), and in parallel SNVs/indels detection by
   trio-based clinical exome sequencing (CES) or whole exome sequencing
   (WES). Eight-three singleton pregnancies with a normal fetal karyotype
   were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Pathogenic or
   likely pathogenic variations were identified in 30 cases (CNVs in 3
   cases, SNVs/indels in 27 cases), indicating an overall molecular
   diagnostic rate of 36.1\% (30/83). Two cases had both a CNV of uncertain
   significance (VOUS) and likely pathogenic SNV, and one case carried both
   a VOUS CNV and an SNV. We demonstrated that simultaneous analysis of
   CNVs and SNVs/indels can improve the diagnostic yield of prenatal
   diagnosis with shortened reporting time, namely, 2-3 weeks. Due to the
   relatively long TAT for sequential procedure for prenatal genetic
   diagnosis, as well as recent sequencing technology advancements, it is
   clinically necessary to consider the simultaneous evaluation of CNVs and
   SNVs/indels to enhance the diagnostic yield and timely TAT, especially
   for cases in the late second trimester or third trimester.}},

Abstract = {{beta-carotene (BC) is beneficial for human health. However, the low
   oxidative stability and bioavailability of hydrophobic BC limit its
   utilization as supplements in functional foods and pharmaceutical
   products. Herein a conventional oil-in-water Pickering emulsion (OPEs-1)
   and an oleogel-in-water Pickering emulsion (OPE-2) were prepared and
   determined to improve the chemical stability and bioavailability of BC.
   Cellulose nanocrystals were used as the emulsifier. Oleogel was
   developed by structuring soybean oil with beeswax. The freezing-thawing
   (FT) stability and physical stability of the OPEs-2 was improved
   compared to the OPEs-1. The OPE-2 seemed to be stable against three FT
   cycles. The OPEs-2 presented higher droplets size than OPEs-1, but they
   were more stable over a wide range of pH (4.0-8.0) and salt level
   (0.05-0.60M). The chemical stability of BC encapsulated in OPEs-2 was
   higher than that in OPEs-1. For instance, the relative BC concentration
   decreased from 100\% to 71.16\%/90.12\% in OPE-1/OPE-2 after stored at
   25 degrees C for 15 days. The BC bioaccessibility in OPE-2 (68.17 +/-
   1.19\%) was significantly improved compared with OPE-1 (53.15 +/-
   1.36\%). The results obtained indicated that OPEs-2 was probably an
   effective delivery system for hydrophobic and indigestible bioactive
   compounds. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundBoth COVID-19 and influenza A contribute to increased
   mortality among the elderly and those with existing comorbidities.
   Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis.
   This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the
   immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the
   clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery
   duration.MethodsBy retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups
   (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe
   COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we
   performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of
   leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at
   different time points (weeks 1-4).ResultsWe reviewed the patients' data
   of 94 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe-COVID-19, 19 Severe-COVID-19
   and 37 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.81x10(9)/L vs
   1.74x10(9)/L, P= 0.001; 0.87x10(9)/L vs 1.74x10(9)/L, P< 0.0001,
   respectively) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell
   subsets) of severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A patients to be
   significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection
   stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at
   different time points (weeks 1-4).ConclusionsOur study suggests the
   plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in
   turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe
   COVID-19 and influenza A.}},

Title = {{Free-standing bimetallic CoNiTe2 nanosheets as efficient catalysts with

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},

Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) step for water splitting requires
   highly efficient, low-cost and stable catalysts. As efficient catalytic
   materials for OER, bimetallic telluride (CoNiTe2/NF) nanosheets are
   prepared by the combination of hydrothermal and calcination method in
   this work. The physicochemical characterizations confirm that the
   surface of CoNiTe2/NF is covered by bimetallic telluride compounds
   (CoNiTe2) with 3D morphology composed of thin and defective nanosheets
   that are well-distributed on nickel foam (NF). Notably, it shows very
   low overpotential at 10 (181 mV), 500 (230 mV) and 1000 (270 mV) mA
   cm(-2) and low Tafel slope (44 mV dec(-1)). Besides, it also exhibits
   excellent durability lasting 24 h at 100, 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2),
   respectively, without distinct deactivation. This outstanding
   performance could be due to the bimetallic telluride and the strong
   covalency around the CoNi center caused by Te that plays a crucial role
   for enhancing the activity of catalyst. The unique morphology could
   provide large electrochemical active area and exposure higher amounts of
   active sites. Meanwhile, the self-supported structure, without binders,
   could also enhance the performance for OER. This work thus provides a
   promising strategy to synthesize multi-metal telluride materials as
   highly efficient and stable catalyst for OER at large current density.

   Shearing Interferometry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In-situ stress measurement has a significant benefit in revealing the
   deformation and failure mechanism during the deposition process.
   However, it is difficult to detect an ultrathin deposit and measure
   deposits of different scales simultaneously. Here, lateral shearing
   interferometry was used for in situ stress measurement of Ni deposits.
   we demonstrated that this method showed great stability and sensitivity
   during in situ process. Additionally, the accuracy of measurement was
   also been improved in terms of the measurement error (2.96\%) and
   fluctuation (0.00035) of curvature radius. The system was capable of the
   measuring radius of curvature as large as 250 m. Theoretical calculation
   and experimental results coherently suggested that the thickness of
   measurable deposits can be diminished by decreasing the elastic modulus
   and thickness of the substrate. PMMA substrates can be used to measure
   the stress evolution of deposits with a thickness of more than 10 nm.
   Moreover, suitable substrate material and thickness for stress
   measurement of deposits with different scales can be selected by
   theoretical calculation before the experiment. This novel method
   provides valuable insights into the in situ stress towards the ultrathin
   deposit and paves the way to further understanding on the mechanism of
   deformation and failure of the deposition process in different states.}},

Abstract = {{A novel kind of near-infrared communication window of photonic crystal

Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear dynamics of empty multi-bubbles with the same distance and
   initial conditions are studied analytically through a modified
   Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The collapse time and analytical solution are
   derived under various initial conditions. In particular, when
   considering a positive initial vibration velocity, the exact analytical
   expression for the maximal radius is obtained by solving a cubic
   algebraic equation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
   that a parabolic function has been used to construct the parametric
   analytical solution for this case. This type of function is able to
   simulate the collapse motion whereby the bubble radius first grows to
   the maximal radius and then decays to zero. The limiting behavior of the
   resulting analytical results for multi-bubbles (including the collapse
   time, analytical solution, and maximal radius) is also investigated,
   enabling the corresponding analytical results for single bubbles to be
   deduced in the limit as the distance between the multi-bubbles
   approaches infinity. In addition, the dynamical characteristics and
   qualitative analysis of these bubbles and the effects of the relevant
   physical parameters are studied.}},

Abstract = {{Green synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) from biological sources
   have attracted much attention because of their low cost, excellent
   bio-compatibility and renewability. However, previously reported
   synthesis strategies of biomass-derived CDs were commonly involved in
   the sophisticated equipment, high energy consumption and complicated
   synthetic conditions, restricting their practical application in various
   fields. In this work, a green, facile and low energy consumption method
   was demonstrated to prepare highly fluorescent CDs through room
   temperature one-step solvent extraction from rice fried Codonopsis
   pilosula (CP) which could be easily obtained commercially. The obtained
   CP-CDs exhibited outstanding fluorescence property (quantum yield up to
   12.8 \%) and high photostability. Besides, CP-CDs showed high
   selectivity and sensitivity of fluorescence response to Cr (VI) over a
   broad range of 0.03 50 mu M and a satisfactory detection limit of 15 nM.
   The developed sensing system was applied to quantitative determination
   of Cr(VI) in environment water samples and industrial sewage
   successfully with good recovery and high precision. More interestingly,
   CP-CDs based fluorescent hydrogel sensor was further fabricated for
   on-site semi-quantitative visual Cr(VI) detection in industrial sewage,
   demonstrating their tremendous potential for the fast and low-cost
   monitoring of Cr(VI) in industrial discharges.}},

Abstract = {{Antiretrovirals belonging to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   protease inhibitor (HIV-PI) class exert inhibitory effects across
   several cancer types by targeting tumor cells and its microenvironment.
   Cervical carcinoma represents a leading cause of morbidity and
   mortality, particularly in women doubly infected with high-risk human
   papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) and HIV; of note, combined antiretroviral
   therapy has reduced cervical carcinoma onset and progression in
   HIV-infected women. We evaluated the effectiveness and mechanism(s) of
   action of HIV-PI against cervical carcinoma using a transgenic model of
   HR-HPV-induced estrogen-promoted cervical carcinoma (HPV16/E2) and found
   that treatment of mice with ritonavir-boosted HIV-PI, including
   indinavir, saquinavir, and lopinavir, blocked the growth and promoted
   the regression of murine cervical carcinoma. This was associated with
   inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, coupled to downregulation of matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, reduction of VEGF/VEGFR2 complex, and
   concomitant upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3
   (TIMP-3). HIV-PI also promoted deposition of collagen IV at the
   epithelial and vascular basement membrane and normalization of both
   vessel architecture and functionality. In agreement with this, HIV-PI
   reduced tumor hypoxia and enhanced the delivery and antitumor activity
   of conventional chemotherapy. Remarkably, TIMP-3 expression gradually
   decreased during progression of human dysplastic lesions into cervical
   carcinoma. This study identified the MMP-9/VEGF proangiogenic axis and
   its modulation by TIMP-3 as novel HIV-PI targets for the blockade of
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia/cervical carcinoma development and
   invasiveness and the normalization of tumor vessel functions. These
   findings may lead to new therapeutic indications of HIV-PI to treat
   cervical carcinoma and other tumors in either HIV-infected or uninfected
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Indonesian travel and tourism have grown to become one of the largest
   economic sectors in the world. Tourists are the main source of income
   for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a
   beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local
   tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country.
   Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse.
   Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business
   and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the
   midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal,
   Indonesia's tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell
   targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but
   not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to
   the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to
   visit. Seeing to this problem, this study aims to propose an integrated
   tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture
   (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized
   recommender system. Through this system integration model, a significant
   socio-economic benefit can be made for tourism sector in Indonesia. The
   results of the research will be exploited for the tourism industry and
   Indonesia's participation in the global tourism competition market.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the natural superhydrophobic surfaces with various colors
   such as the lotus leaves and the wings of butterflies, we report a
   one-step method to fabricate superhydrophobic coatings by the
   combination of kaolin, acrylic color and organosiloxanes. The coatings
   were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, and other analytical techniques. Different from the
   previously reported method, kaolin particles were introduced to generate
   rough hierarchical structures on the coating surface, followed by
   acrylic color decoration and organosiloxanes modification. The colorful
   superhydrophobic coatings can be constructed in various substrates, such
   as glass slide, filter paper, and fabric. Furthermore, the obtained
   coating maintained excellent mechanical durability, chemical stability,
   and the high-efficiency of oil-water separation. All of the colorful
   coatings showed superhydrophobicity in air, and they retained water
   repellency even after exposed to ultraviolet or under harsh conditions.
   The results also indicated that the as-prepared coatings possessed
   outstanding fungi-resistance. The colorful superhydrophobic fabric can
   be used to separate oil/water mixtures, and the separation efficiencies
   are as high as 95\%. We envision that the colorful superhydrophobic
   coatings with durability and chemical stability may be useful in various
   fields, such as house decoration, paint coating, antimicrobial material
   and oil/water separation.}},

   of soil microbial activity over conversion of cropland to forest}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studying soil microbial activity is important for evaluating soil
   microbial conditions and soil nutrient cycling. This study examined how
   the conversion of cropland to forest affects soil microbial activity and
   stratification ratios of the rhizosphere soil microbial index (RSMI), as
   well as to clarify the relationship between the stratification ratios of
   RSMI and soil microbial activity. Soils beneath two typical vegetation
   types of shrubland (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides) and
   forestland (Robinia pseudoacacia) in the Loess Hilly region of China
   that had recovered for up to 47 and 56 years, respectively, were
   evaluated at four soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-50 cm). Our
   findings showed that the conversion of cropland to forest mainly
   affected soil microbial activity in the surface layer (0-10 cm), in
   which microbial biomass, enzyme activity (saccharase, urease, and
   phosphatase), and RSMI increased over time, whereas the microbial
   metabolic quotient decreased. After the conversion from cropland,
   recovery time (years) caused an increase in the SRR1 (the RSMI ratio in
   0-10 cm versus 10-20 cm layer) of shrubland (by 40.56-108.14\%, compared
   to 0 year) and forestland (by 18.48-79.71\%, compared to 0 year).
   Overall, SRR1 was positively correlated with RSMI in both conversion
   types. In conclusion, the stratification ratios of the rhizosphere soil
   microbial index of SRR1 provided good indicators of soil microbial
   activity and were significantly enhanced by the process of the
   conversion from cropland to forest.}},

   effects of PM2.5, 68,000 to NO2 and 14,000 to O-3. Traffic is
   responsible for 60-70\% of human exposure to NO2 and 25-35\% to PM2.5 in
   urban environments, so it is obvious that to improve air quality and
   lessen the health impact the number of circulating urban vehicles needs
   to be reduced. The characterisation of mobility in cities is fundamental
   for this, allowing us to bring together information on demography,
   location of services, spatial economy, geography, aspects of physics,
   mathematics, engineering and, in general, data science. The COVID-19
   pandemic has revealed not only how healthier a city can be with less
   traffic contamination, but has also underlined the great value of data
   generated by personal electronic devices for the public management of an
   emergency and for future urban planning. Air quality improvement plans
   in cities not only seek to reduce annual premature deaths, but also to
   improve the quality of life with healthier and more pleasant cities to
   live in. It is important to achieve greater collaboration between
   cities, administrations and citizens, as well as to integrate the needs
   and challenges of air quality with those of mitigation and adaptation to
   climate change. Integrated approaches will constitute the roadmap that
   will lead to a better quality of life in cities.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, and more specifically after the transition to the
   service economy, social classes and urban characters in cities have been
   transformed according to the new postmodern way of life from their
   residential trajectories and spatial practices. In this article we aim
   to take a look at this new class division encouraged by globalization
   and reinforced by contemporary urban processes such as gentrification,
   and also try to identify the urban actors who star in the current scene.
   The study focuses in the case of Bogota Centre, a place that has
   recently been involved in a socio-cultural and demographic restructuring
   that reflects the new residential consumption habits and the recent
   labor market trends. Through the analysis of the Multipurpose Survey
   2017, we establish the methodological basis for determining the
   localization patterns of these new social classes in the central urban

Abstract = {{Flow reactors are expected to play an increasingly important role in the
   production of chemicals. A simple carbon-based scaffold to easily
   develop flow systems is here detailed. Using a chemical vapour
   deposition technique, the controlled in situ growth of vertically
   aligned (VA) multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into quartz columns
   with 2 mm inner diameter is achieved. Several of the described MWCNT
   columns (CNCs) can be produced at a time. The influence of synthesis
   parameters on the formation of these VA-MWCNT scaffolds is reported and
   discussed (e.g. injection time of the precursor, carrier gas flow rate,
   inner diameter and length of the quartz column, position in the furnace
   during synthesis). Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy are used to assess the coverage of the
   inner channel of the quartz column with VA-MWCNTs and their overall
   quality. The length of the CNCs together with the carrier gas flow rate
   are found to be key parameters to control the MWCNT length profile
   within the CNCs. Fluoresceinamine molecules and platinum nanoparticles
   are successfully immobilised within these MWCNT scaffolds. The benefits
   of the CNCs for flow system design are summarised as the controlled
   filling with MWCNTs makes the detailed CNCs versatile scaffolds for flow
   catalysis and filtration.}},

Title = {{Estimated prevalence of the Duffy null phenotype Fy (a-b-) among black
   blood-donors in Southwestern Colombia}},
Journal = {{TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Hemolytic reactions are adverse complications associated
   with red blood cell transfusion. These reactions are associated with
   clinically important erythrocyte antigens, such as those of Duffy blood
   Meny (2010). Individuals with the Duffy null phenotype Fy (a-b-) are
   more likely to develop an alloimmunization reaction, resulting in an
   incompatibility with all available red blood cell units, thus increasing
   the risk of complications from their underlying disease Hoher et al.
   (2018). Hence, it is important to determine the prevalence of the Fy
   (a-b-) phenotype in blood donors in our population and to create a
   database to ensure safe transfusion in patients with this phenotype.
   Moreover, we intend to establish whether there is any relationship
   between individuals with this phenotype and the sickle cell trait. We
   conducted this study to measure the prevalence of the Fy (a-b-)
   phenotype in our blood donors.
   Materials and methods: This prospective, descriptive study included
   black blood donors visiting the blood bank of a tertiary care university
   hospital between January 2019 and July 2019. We used Fitzpatrick
   classification phototype VI and self-identification to select donors in
   the study. The presence of the Duffy antigens Fya and Fyb was determined
   by the Coombs test using monoclonal antibodies. To establish the
   presence of hemoglobin S (HbS) and sickle cell traits, a hemoglobin
   electrophoresis test was performed.
   Results: We included 166 patients in the study. Seventy-nine donors were
   identified as having Fy (a-b-). The prevalence of the Fy (a-b-)
   phenotype was 48 \%. Sickle cell trait hemoglobinopathy was found in 6
   blood donors (8\%).
   Conclusion: This information is relevant for the implementation of a
   database of blood donors to guarantee the safety of transfusion in
   patients with a Fitzpatrick skin type 6at our institution. Moreover, it
   may provide information of interest to other blood banks in case donors
   with this phenotype are needed. No significant association was found
   between the donor Fy (a-b-) phenotype and the sickle cell trait.}},

Title = {{Ferroelectret Ultrasonic Transducers for Pulse-Echo Water Immersion}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Featured Application
   Ultrasonic transducers with a short impulse response and a wide
   frequency band response are desirable for ultrasonic imaging and
   quantitative echography where the spectral analysis of reflected pulses
   can reveal the inner structure of scatterers and different organs in
   medical imaging. Therefore, the featured application for the transducers
   here presented is for the resonant spectral echography technique that
   our group is introducing in applications for materials characterization
   and medical imaging for quantitative echography, with special focus on
   layered tissues, where this technique can reveal the presence of
   different layers and extract their properties; examples are the cornea,
   the artery wall, the skin, the pleura, etc.
   Ferroelectrets are thin and porous polymeric films with a cellular
   microstructure, high porosity, permanent polarization and piezoelectric
   response. They have been used for different applications, where one of
   the most interesting ones is for the fabrication of air-coupled
   ultrasonic transducers. More recently they have been tested as water
   immersion transducers, showing a promising wide bandwidth but limited
   sensitivity along with other technical problems. This paper investigates
   ultrasonic transducers for water immersion and pulse-echo operation
   based on ferroelectret films. Two different ferroelectret foams with
   different resonant frequencies, acoustic impedances and cellular
   structures were tried. Flat and spherically focused prototypes (radius
   of curvature of 22 and 35 mm) were produced and tested. Finally,
   different materials and methods were tried to provide a protective
   surface coating. Acoustic field measurements for the focused transducers
   confirm the possibility to efficiently focus the ultrasonic beam by the
   proposed fabrication method, with focal spot size of 1.86 mm at -6 dB.
   Results show that in spite of the reduced sensitivity (about -115 dB),
   some of the tried ferroelectret films provide a very wide band response
   (-6 dB band from 0.29 to 2.7 MHz) and short pulse duration (2-3 us) that
   can be of interest for different applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The spontaneous, sporadic and sometimes unpredictable nature
   of children's physical activity causes fluctuations in blood glucose
   level and challenges for children with type 1 diabetes. Physical
   activity monitoring has potential utility. In this study, we explored
   the perceptions of physical activity monitoring among health-care
   professionals and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of using it
   in the management of pediatric type 1 diabetes.
   Methods: Seven health-care professionals from 1 pediatric diabetes
   centre in the United Kingdom were involved in a focus group. Data were
   analyzed thematically. Physical activity monitoring using a wristworn
   monitor was tested for feasibility with 13 children aged 7 to 11 years
   with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was feasibility (i.e.
   recruitment, adherence, data completion, adverse events and
   acceptability). Secondary measures were glycemic control, parental
   self-efficacy for diabetes management and parental fear of hypoglycemia.
   Results: Health-care professionals valued having an awareness of the
   level, type and intensity of children's physical activity. They
   identified unmet training and resource needs that would facilitate them
   in being able to give physical activity advice to children and families.
   Recruitment rate was 20\%, adherence to the activity monitoring was good
   and the study completion rate was 62\%. No adverse events were reported.
   Physical activity monitoring was considered acceptable by parents.
   Conclusions: Physical activity monitoring could be a feasible part of
   routine clinical practice, but further research is needed to understand
   whether health-care professionals are best placed to implement it and
   what impact it has on health outcomes. (c) 2020 Canadian Diabetes

Abstract = {{In this report, we show that hyperspectral high-resolution
   photoluminescence mapping is a powerful tool for the selection and
   optimization of the laser ablation processes used for the patterning
   interconnections of subcells on Cu(In-x,Ga1-x)Se-2 (CIGS) modules. In
   this way, we show that in-depth monitoring of material degradation in
   the vicinity of the ablation region and the identification of the
   underlying mechanisms can be accomplished. Specifically, by analyzing
   the standard P1 patterning line ablated before the CIGS deposition, we
   reveal an anomalous emission-quenching effect that follows the edge of
   the molybdenum groove underneath. We further rationalize the origins of
   this effect by comparing the topography of the P1 edge through a
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) cross-section, where a reduction of
   the photoemission cannot be explained by a thickness variation. We also
   investigate the laser-induced damage on P1 patterning lines performed
   after the deposition of CIGS. We then document, for the first time, the
   existence of a short-range damaged area, which is independent of the
   application of an optical aperture on the laser path. Our findings pave
   the way for a better understanding of P1-induced power losses and
   introduce new insights into the improvement of current strategies for
   industry-relevant module interconnection schemes. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {{Inflammation plays an important role in the development of several
   cancers. Inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), are associated with the induction of inflammation. Chronic
   inflammation contributes to the progression of cancer through several
   mechanisms, including increased cytokine production and activation of
   transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B).
   Zerumbone (ZER), a component of subtropical ginger (Zingiber zerumbet
   Smith), seems to have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant
   activities. In this study, we aimed to explore the protective function
   and mechanisms of ZER against TNF-alpha-induced cancer-promoting
   cytokines. We found that the viability of stimulated human fibroblast
   cell lines was reduced after treatment with ZER (IC50=18 mu mol/L),
   compared to un-stimulated fibroblasts (IC50=40 mu mol/L). Besides, ZER
   inhibited mRNA expression and protein secretion of transforming growth
   factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-33 (IL-33), monocyte chemoattractant
   protein-1 (MCP-1), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), which were
   produced by TNF-alpha-induced fibroblasts, as measured by quantitative
   real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and ELISA assays. The mRNA expression levels of
   TGF-beta, IL-33, SDF-1, and MCP-1 showed 8, 5, 2.5, and 4-fold
   reductions, respectively. Moreover, secretion of TGF-beta, IL-33, SDF-1,
   and MCP-1 was reduced to 3.65 +/- 0.34 ng/mL, 6.3 +/- 0.26, 1703.6 +/-
   295.2, and 5.02 +/- 0.18 pg/mL, respectively, compared to the untreated
   group. In addition, the conditioned media (CM) of TNF-alpha-stimulated
   fibroblasts increased the NF-kappa B expression in colorectal cancer
   cell lines (HCT-116 and Sw48), while in the vicinity of ZER, the
   expression of NF-kappa B was reversed. Considering the significant
   effects of ZER, this component can be used as an appropriate alternative
   herbal treatment for cancer-related chronic inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that surface-active oxygen functional groups
   (OFGs) effectively catalyze the vanadium redox reactions. Initial
   graphitic edge sites, OFGs and their electrochemical stability were
   examined using graphite felts, which were modified with multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes and activated with KOH. It is demonstrated that OFGs
   cannot exclusively be responsible for the electrocatalysis since they
   did not correlate to the electrochemical activity. The surface
   composition after electrochemical cycling in the positive half-cell was
   still different for all samples but did not reflect the performance
   either. However, a correlation was found between the activity and stable
   edge site defects. There was neither a correlation between the
   electrocatalytic activity and the amount of oxygen, nor for the kind of
   OFG in the negative half-cell. The oxygen concentration after
   electrochemistry was very similar, even more highlighting the importance
   of edge sites in the V-III/V-II redox reaction. The results of this work
   indicate that the major electrocatalytic effect for both half-cell redox
   reactions is related to stable graphitic edge sites in sufficient
   quantity.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of the surface and subsurface drainage systems and the
   efficient removal of excess water are highly dependent on both the
   manner in which the prepared surfaces are used, and their use class.
   This paper tackles the behaviour of the drainage network after 28 years
   of use on pastures. Our research has revealed more significant bank
   erosion and ditch clogging than in the ditches found on arable land.
   Sheep grazing caused double bank erosion and alluvial sediments layers,
   whereas cattle grazing was three to four times more detrimental to the
   ditches than works carried out on arable land. When grazing sheep, bank
   erosion and bottom clogging generally range between 0.60 and 1.00 in. On
   surfaces where cattle graze, bank erosion is as high as 1.20-2.00 m and
   alluvial sediment layer thickness is 1.20-1.40 m. The preservation of
   the design parameters of the ditches may be achieved by rational grazing
   and special crossing facilities for the animals crossing the ditches.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Perinatal depression (PD) has important implications for maternal and
   infant well-being but largely goes undetected. There is a need to
   develop low-intensity psychosocial interventions applicable to obstetric
   health care facilities.
   Objective:
   To assess the effectiveness of a brief psychological intervention for
   mild to moderate PD delivered by a nurse as compared to
   treatment-as-usual (TAU).
   Methods:
   This study is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicentric
   trial being conducted in four sites of India. A total of 816 pregnant
   women with mild to moderately severe depression (Patient Health
   Questionaire-9 score of 5-19) are being assessed for the effectiveness
   of the intervention. Participants are randomly allocated to two groups
   of trial intervention (psychological intervention given by nurse) and
   TAU. The primary outcome is to compare the proportion of women reporting
   improvement across both groups. Participants are serially followed-up in
   each trimester and at 6, 10, 14 weeks, and 6 months postpartum.
   Secondary outcomes include pregnancy outcomes, feeding practices,
   physical growth, and immunization status of the infants.
   Conclusion:
   It is a prospective pregnancy birth cohort with a robust design and
   long-term follow-up. This is one of the largest studies utilizing
   non-specialist health workers for the screening and management of PD.
   This study also holds promise to cast light on the course and outcome of
   depression during pregnancy in different parts of India. It is envisaged
   to help in developing a sound screening and referral-based protocol for
   obstetric settings.}},

Abstract = {{Lu-177-labeled PSMA-617 is a promising new therapeutic agent for
   radioligand therapy (RLT) of patients with metastatic
   castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Initiated by the German
   Society of Nuclear Medicine, a retrospective multicenter data analysis
   was started in 2015 to evaluate efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA-617
   in a large cohort of patients. Methods: One hundred forty-five patients
   (median age, 73 y; range, 43-88 y) with mCRPC were treated with
   Lu-177-PSMA-617 in 12 therapy centers between February 2014 and July
   2015 with 1-4 therapy cycles and an activity range of 2-8 GBq per cycle.
   Toxicity was categorized by the common toxicity criteria for adverse
   events (version 4.0) on the basis of serial blood tests and the
   attending physician's report. The primary endpoint for efficacy was
   biochemical response as defined by a prostate-specific antigen decline
   >= 50\% from baseline to at least 2 wk after the start of RLT. Results:
   A total of 248 therapy cycles were performed in 145 patients. Data for
   biochemical response in 99 patients as well as data for
   physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity in 145 and 121
   patients, respectively, were available. The median follow-up was 16 wk
   (range, 2-30 wk). Nineteen patients died during the observation period.
   Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity occurred in 18 patients: 10\%, 4\%, and 3\% of
   the patients experienced anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia,
   respectively. Xerostomia occurred in 8\%. The overall biochemical
   response rate was 45\% after all therapy cycles, whereas 40\% of
   patients already responded after a single cycle. Elevated alkaline
   phosphatase and the presence of visceral metastases were negative
   predictors and the total number of therapy cycles positive predictors of
   biochemical response. Conclusion: The present retrospective multicenter
   study of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT demonstrates favorable safety and high
   efficacy exceeding those of other third-line systemic therapies in mCRPC
   patients. Future phase II/III studies are warranted to elucidate the
   survival benefit of this new therapy in patients with mCRPC.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of fuel subsidy has affected many Malaysians due to the
   increase in the cost of living and hence causing insufficient income to
   cover monthly expenditures. This study investigates the total, direct
   and indirect effects of fuel price fluctuations on household income in
   Malaysia due to subsidy removal. The data from the Household Expenditure
   Survey (HES) conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia was used
   in this study. The households were differentiated into three income
   groups, namely Top 20\% (T20), Middle 40\% (M40), and Bottom 40\% (B40)
   which incuded the years 2009/2010, 2014, and 2016. Then, the partial
   equilibrium approach was used to investigate all effects. The effects
   were investigated for different incomes and ethnic groups. This study
   found that group B40 experienced the greatest indirect and total effect
   of fuel price fluctuations due to the subsidy removal. For the direct
   effect, there was not much difference seen among all income groups after
   the subsidy removal. Furthermore, the effects were found to be lower
   after the fuel subsidy removal for all ethnic groups. Thus, the findings
   could help the government in examining the policy of subsidy removal in
   order to successfully help the poor. Hence, this could improve the
   quality of life, especially for the income groups B40 and M40.}},

   (NH4OAc) and ethanol under reflux. The study was focused on optimizing
   reactions conditions: Standardization of catalyst, substrate of study
   and solvent study. In order to identify the best active catalysts, five
   different ratios of catalyst were synthesized and evaluated for the
   title reaction under similar conditions. To standardize the active
   catalysts, different temperature conditions (i.e. room temperature, 60
   degrees C and 80 degrees C) as well as catalysts amounts were evaluated.
   Under these established conditions, 2.5\% Fe/SiO2 was the best active
   catalysts that resulted. Benzaldehyde and p-anisaldehyde were used to
   study the effect of having various substrates on the conversion and
   reaction time, especially the substituted aldehydes. The best results
   were obtained by reacting p-anisaldehyde with EAA, NH4OAc, and ethanol
   at 60 degrees C with 0.3 grams of 2.5\% Fe/SiO2 heterogeneous catalysts.
   Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) monitoring of the reaction mixture
   showed no selectivity at high temperatures (80 degrees C) with 15\%
   Fe/SiO2. Standardization of solvent study was executed with two
   solvents, ethanol and acetonitrile. The product dihydropyridines were
   analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The melting
   points of the products were compared with authentic samples reported in
   the literature. Hence, the Fe/SiO2 catalysts is eco-friendly and
   economically developed for the title reaction. Copyright (C) 2020 BCREC

Abstract = {{Background: Dengue, a febrile illness, is caused by a Flavivirus
   transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Climate
   influences the ecology of the vectors. We aimed to identify the
   influence of climatic variability on the occurrence of clinical dengue
   requiring hospitalization in Zone-5, a high incidence area of Dhaka City
   Corporation (DCC), Bangladesh. Methods and Findings: We retrospectively
   identified clinical dengue cases hospitalized from Zone-5 of DCC between
   2005 and 2009. We extracted records of the four major catchment
   hospitals of the study area. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department
   (BMD) provided data on temperature, rainfall, and humidity of DCC for
   the study period. We used autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA) models for the number of monthly dengue hospitalizations. We
   also modeled all the climatic variables using Poisson regression. During
   our study period, dengue occurred throughout the year in Zone-5 of DCC.
   The median number of hospitalized dengue cases was 9 per month. Dengue
   incidence increased sharply from June, and reached its peak in August.
   One additional rainy day per month increased dengue cases in the
   succeeding month by 6\% (RR = 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.09). Conclusions:
   Dengue is transmitted throughout the year in Zone-5 of DCC, with
   seasonal variation in incidence. The number of rainy days per month is
   significantly associated with dengue incidence in the subsequent month.
   Our study suggests the initiation of campaigns in DCC for controlling
   dengue and other Aedes mosquito borne diseases, including Chikunguniya
   from the month of May each year. BMD rainfall data may be used to
   determine campaign timing.}},

Abstract = {{The design of bimetallic selenide configurations has been regarded as a
   feasible strategy to modulate the electronic structure of the
   electrocatalysts for sensors application. In this sense, unique
   hierarchical porous three-dimensional Ni-Co diselenide nanowires (3D
   Co0.6Ni0.4Se2 NWs) coated with N-doped carbon thin layer (3D
   N-C@Co0.6Ni0.4Se2 NWs) with hollow sea-urchin-like overall morphology
   were fabricated and used as an effectual bifunctional electrocatalyst
   for glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide reduction. Regarding the
   advantages of this porous and 3D structure, the N-C@Co0.6Ni0.4Se2 NWs
   offer abundant electrochemical-active sites, high availability to the
   electrolyte/analyte, and high conductivity due to the synergistic effect
   of bimetals, coated N-doped carbon and selenide. As an amperometric
   glucose sensor, it shows a high sensitivity of 1439 and 239 mu A mM(-1)
   cm(-2) and wide linear range from 0.5 mu M to 2.2 mM and 2.2 mM-12.2 mM
   with a low detection limit of 0.16 mu M. Moreover, amperometric H2O2
   sensing will be recognized with a sensitivity of 89 and 31.8 mu A mM(-1)
   cm(-2), a linear range from 0.5 mu M to 6 mM and 6 mM-15 mM, and a
   detection limit of 0.16 mu M (S/N = 3). Moreover, the developed sensor
   shows a great potential in determining glucose and H2O2 in biological

Abstract = {{The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the food chain and the
   consumer's demand for safe food without chemical preservatives have
   generated much interest in natural antimicrobials. Thus, our main goal
   was to study the mode of action of the crude extract, the enterocins,
   and the organic acid produced by a bacteriocinogenic Enterococcus
   faecium strain S6 previously isolated from raw camel milk. Then, we
   aimed to evaluate their potential application in a food system. These
   antimicrobials exhibited antimicrobial activity against Listeria
   monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli. The enterocins
   were synthesized as primary metabolites beginning at the lag phase, with
   optimal production at the exponential and stationary phases. The
   antimicrobials had a direct effect in extending the lag phase of L.
   monocytogenes, along with a significant inhibitory activity. The organic
   acid, in particular, inhibited both L. monocytogenes and S. enterica by
   inducing a total lysis and damage of the cell wall. The enterocins acted
   on disrupting the cell wall with pore formation, leading to cell death.
   Moreover, the crude extract revealed a combined inhibitory activity
   between enterocins and organic acid. Furthermore, the antimicrobials
   showed promising results through inhibiting L. monocytogenes cells in
   milk samples up to 1 wk at 4 degrees C. Key words: antimicrobial

Abstract = {{This article deals with historiographical controversies about the role
   played by the Kingdom of Serbia in the Sarajevo assassination and the
   outbreak of the First World War, which has been in focus for more than a
   century. A thesis was put forward in 2005 by the influential
   American-French duo of historians JayWinter and Antonie Pros that, after
   the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992,
   World War I increasingly began to look like a ``European civil war:' For
   this reason, all states, all nations, share to a different extent the
   responsibility for a catastrophe they were unable to predict and prevent
   .{''} Starting from this thesis, the author provides an extensive
   chronological overview of the findings from 65 historiographical, memoir
   political science titles published in the period from 1915 to 2015.
   The overview is divided into three, chronologically arranged, chapters.
   The first chapter, entitled ``Debates on the Culpability of Serbia
   (1915-1961){''}, provides an overview of the debates about the guilt,
   i.e. coresponsibility, of the Kingdom of Serbia in the period from the
   polemical writing of the American political scientist from Columbia
   University John William Burgess from 1915 to the so-called ``Fischer
   Controversies{''} from the 1960s.
   The second chapter ``New Knowledge in the Shadow of the Fischer
   Controversy (1961-2000){''} provides an overview of the insights from
   the influential 1961 book by the famous German historian Fritz Fischer,
   Griffnachder Weltmacht. The book sparked a debate on the liability of
   Germany for World War I outbreak, and it has lasted to the early 21st
   century when the focus shifted again to the Balkans.
   That is why the third chapter ``Return to the Balkans (2001-2015){''}
   gives an overview of the latest discussions, which are primarily focused
   on different views and arguments about Serbia's co-responsibility for
   the Sarajevo assassination and the First World War.
   In conclusion, the author summarises a whole range of, often quite
   contradictory, views that represent an indispensable introduction and
   impetus for further research into the controversy over the
   co-responsibility of the Kingdom of Serbia for the Sarajevo
   assassination and the First World War. And the author believes that the
   discussion of the complex backdrop cannot only come down to pointing the
   finger at official Belgrade or denying its joint responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{Photographs play a very crucial role in our lives, be it in the field of
   forensic investigation, military intelligence, scientific research, and
   publications. Nowadays, most of these photographs are in the digital
   format; which can be easily edited in any photo editing software without
   requiring any special knowledge of the field. It has become quite hard
   to identify whether an image is real or fake. This can be very crucial
   in the cases of forensic investigation or authorization of images. So,
   we need a solution, which not only identifies the attacks from different
   schemes like collage attack, crop attack, etc. but also recovers the
   edited or tampered portion. In proposed work, 4 reduced-size copy of the
   original image is hidden in the original image's 4-LSB using four
   pseudo-random codes. Later on, these copies are used for tamper
   detection. As image gets tampered, recovery images (which are stored in
   the 4-LSB's of the original image) also get tampered. So, before
   recovering the edited portion using the median image (or one out of the
   four recovery images) various filters like median filters, sharpening
   filters, and noise removal filters are used to enhance the quality. The
   proposed scheme recovers the host better than the many recently proposed
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion has become one of the most important problems of the
   big cities all around the world. Traffic jams lead to huge economic,
   temporal, psychological, environmental and other costs for drivers of
   cars and other vehicles, transport enterprises, urban and national
   economies, as well as for pedestrians and city residents. Based on the
   analysis of the ranking of cities in the world's leading countries with
   the most significant traffic jams, which was developed by the Dutch
   company TomTom, the author puts forward the concept of the genesis of
   traffic jams. Traffic congestion in 52 cities of different countries is
   being examined. According to the author's concept, traffic jams in major
   cities are caused by a combination of six causes (or part of them): 1)
   the number of vehicles, 2) the number of inhabitants of urban
   agglomerations, 3) population density of urban agglomerations, 4)
   country's typical work culture, 5) architectural and urban planning type
   of the city, 6) the terrain in which the city is located. Different
   causes make different contributions to the genesis of traffic
   congestion, which allows us to speak about their hierarchy. In every
   major city's case, traffic jams are caused by a peculiar combination of
   their causes. Contrary to popular belief, the increase in the number of
   vehicles is not the most important cause of traffic jams. Special
   attention is dedicated to the analysis of traffic jams in big Russian
   cities. The Russian cities' traffic jams are caused by low standards of
   work culture, which lead to low standards of vehicle management and
   traffic management, by special features of the architectural and urban
   planning type of the cities, and by increase in the number of vehicles.
   Research on the causes of traffic jams allows developing ways to deal
   with them. The impact of some causes of traffic jams can be mitigated,
   but, in some cases, some of the causes are fundamentally irremediable.}},

Title = {{Towards a comprehensive pipeline to identify and functionally annotate
   long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)}},

Abstract = {{Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in various genetic diseases
   and cancer, attributed to their critical role in gene regulation. They
   are a divergent group of RNAs and are easily differentiated from other
   types with unique characteristics, functions, and mechanisms of action.
   In this review, we provide a list of some of the prominent data
   repositories containing lncRNAs, their interactome, and predicted and
   validated disease associations. Next, we discuss various wet-lab
   experiments formulated to obtain the data for these repositories. We
   also provide a critical review of in silico methods available for the
   identification purpose and suggest techniques to further improve their
   performance. The bulk of the methods currently focus on distinguishing
   lncRNA transcripts from the coding ones. Functional annotation of these
   transcripts still remains a grey area and more efforts are needed in
   that space. Finally, we provide details of current progress, discuss
   impediments, and illustrate a roadmap for developing a generalized
   computational pipeline for comprehensive annotation of lncRNAs, which is
   essential to accelerate research in this area.}},

Title = {{Deep autoencoders as anomaly detectors: Method and case study in a
   distributed water treatment plant}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are found in critical infrastructure,
   such as, water treatment plants and oil refineries. ICS are often the
   target of cyber-attacks leading to undesirable consequences. It is
   essential to detect process anomalies resulting from such attacks before
   appropriate defensive actions are considered. In this work, a deep
   autoencoder-based anomaly detector (DAE) is proposed. DAE is trained
   using data collected during normal operation of a plant. The detection
   effectiveness of three variants of DAE was experimentally evaluated on
   an operational Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) plant. Further, the amount
   of plant design knowledge needed to design DAE was compared with that
   needed to create design-centric approaches for anomaly detection.
   Experimental results indicate that the proposed DAE, constructed with
   minimal design knowledge, is effective in detecting process anomalies re
   sulting due to single and multi-point coordinated attacks with high
   detection rate and few false alarms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Early assessment of Systemic Inflammatory Response
   Syndrome (SIRS) through various biomarkers like Procalcitonin (PCT),
   C-reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) etc., is crucial to
   manage the outcome of patients. Levels of PCT concerning its likelihood
   to distinguish patients with SIRS and non-SIRS and the possibility to
   predict mortality in patients with sepsis has been variable.
   Aim: To investigate the role of PCT in early diagnosis of sepsis in
   patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
   Materials and Methods: In this prospective observational study, 136
   patients hospitalised in ICU at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and
   Research Centre, Bangalore, Karnataka, India, between July 2019 to June
   2020 were evaluated and PCT was analysed using FinecareT PCT rapid test.
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multiple
   logistic regression was carried out to detect the association of
   predictive PCT value with its outcomes.
   Results: PCT showed the best predictive value in the diagnosis of SIRS
   at 1.68 ng/mL (Area Under Curve (AUC)-0.87; p<0.05) having Positive
   Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 90.43\%
   and 73.81\%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression model adjusted
   for age, weight, and duration of stay to predict the outcome of SIRS,
   positive blood culture and fatality case rate derived a significant
   association of PCT with Odds Ratio (OR) being 1.23 (1.11- 2.31), 1.06
   (1.01-1.98) and 1.76 (1.08-2.14), respectively.
   Conclusion: Early identification and treatment for sepsis significantly
   affects mortality. It appears that consecutive measurements of
   biomarkers could be valuable, but further prospective studies are
   important to characterise the role of PCT as a prognostic marker in
   sepsis and severe sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{Red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders are predominantly caused by
   mutations resulting in decreased RBC deformability and permeability. We
   present a family in which, the proband and his daughter presented with
   pseudohypokalaemia. Studies on the temperature dependence of
   pseudohypokalaemia suggested a maximum decrease in serum potassium when
   whole blood is stored at 37 degrees C. Routine haematology suggested
   mild haemolysis with a hereditary spherocytosis phenotype. These two
   cases present a novel variant in temperature-dependent changes in
   potassium transport. A new variant was identified in the SLC4A1 gene
   which codes for band 3 protein (anion exchanger 1) in RBC membrane which
   may contribute to the phenotype. This is the first report of familial
   pseudohypokalaemia associated with changes in RBC membrane morphology.
   The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to
   inappropriate investigation or treatment. However, many questions remain
   to be solved and other RBC membrane protein genes should be studied.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic multiobjective optimization requires the robust tracking of
   varying Pareto-optimal solutions (POS) in a changing environment. When a
   change is detected in the environment, prediction mechanisms estimate
   the POS by utilizing information from previous populations to accelerate
   search toward the true POS. To achieve a robust prediction of POS, a
   mixture-of-experts-based ensemble framework is proposed. Unlike existing
   approaches, the framework utilizes multiple prediction mechanisms to
   improve the overall prediction. A gating network is applied to manage
   switching among the various predictors based on performance of the
   predictors at different time intervals of the optimization process. The
   efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through experimental
   studies based on 13 dynamic multiobjective benchmark optimization
   problems. The simulation results show that the proposed framework
   improves the dynamic optimization performance significantly,
   particularly for: 1) problems with distinct dynamic POS in decision
   space over time and 2) problems with highly nonlinear decision variable
   linkages.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Large scale spatial patterns of livestock predation risk from multiple
   co-predators are fundamental to applied conservation planning. Here, we
   examined important ecological, social, and landscape attributes
   explaining spatial patterns of human-carnivore interactions. We used a
   systematic grid-based framework, across an area of 14,200 km(2) of
   sixteen Forest Divisions at the human-wildlife interface encompassing
   Protected Areas, Reserved Forest and Fringe Areas at the human-wildlife
   interface in the Eastern and Western Ghats, India. The data was
   collected on livestock depredation incidents from the tiger (Panthera
   tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus) for the
   past five years, through semi-structured interviews (n = 1460) of local
   communities. We examined socio-ecological (i.e. livestock abundance and
   forest dependency) and landscape attributes (i.e. forest cover, climates
   and topographic) influencing the depredation events from each carnivore
   species. We found that livestock predation risk by the tiger, leopard
   and dhole was driven by the size of livestock species, the dependency of
   local people on the forest, topography, proximity to water body and the
   forest boundary, precipitation, and forest cover. Risk of predation from
   leopard and dhole exhibited high spatial overlap, and predation by
   leopards was higher than dhole and tiger. Livestock predation by leopard
   and dhole was frequent in open areas of Reserved Forest and buffer
   zones, while that from tiger occurred in densely forested core regions
   of Protected Areas (PAs). Our predictive risk maps (ca. 22,525 km(2))
   showed species-specific predation patterns, reflected ecological
   differences among large carnivores with regards to their habitat and
   spatial partitioning for domestic prey. Our predictive predation risk
   map and factors associated with livestock predations provides powerful
   visual guidance and tools for PA managers in developing multi-species
   conflict mitigation strategies. We recommend diversifying local economic
   livelihoods and benefit-sharing options for local communities to
   minimize their forest dependency. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: Acute iliofemoral artery thrombosis (IFAT) can occur in
   critically ill neonates and infants who require indwelling arterial
   cannulas for monitoring or as a consequence of cardiac catheterization.
   Guidelines suggest treatment with anticoagulation, but evidence
   supporting the optimal duration of therapy and the role of surveillance
   ultrasound is limited. The objectives of this study were to characterize
   the kinetics of thrombus resolution and to define an appropriate
   duration of anticoagulation and interval for surveillance ultrasound.
   Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of
   pediatric patients with acute IFAT from 2011 to 2019. Medical records
   and vascular laboratory studies were reviewed. Patients with one or more
   surveillance ultrasound examinations were included. Thrombus resolution
   was defined as multiphasic flow throughout the index limb without
   evidence of echogenic intraluminal material by ultrasound. Time to
   resolution of thrombus was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
   Results: Fifty-four limbs in 50 patients were identified with acute
   IFAT. The median age was 9.9 weeks (interquartile range, 3.1-21.7
   weeks), with a median weight of 4.2 kg (interquartile range, 3.3-5.5
   kg). The majority of limbs (65\%) with acute IFAT presented with a
   diminished pedal Doppler signal, commonly after cardiac catheterization
   (55\%). Forty-eight (89\%) limbs had complete arterial occlusion on
   index ultrasound, and flow could not be detected below the ankle in
   48\%. The median number of ultrasound examinations per limb was three
   (range, two to seven), and 61\% of limbs had a surveillance ultrasound
   within 7 days of diagnosis. At 14 and 30 days, 33\% and 64\% of
   patients, respectively, treated with anticoagulation had an estimated
   complete resolution of thrombus. Nine (17\%) patients did not receive
   anticoagulation, and only two of these patients experienced IFAT
   resolution. At the time of diagnosis, one patient underwent open
   thrombectomy because of a contraindication to anticoagulation, and one
   patient was treated with thrombolysis. There were no instances of tissue
   loss or amputation
   Conclusions: Management of IFAT with anticoagulation resulted in
   successful short-term outcomes. Based on the observed rate of
   resolution, management should start with anticoagulation, followed by
   surveillance ultrasound at 2-week intervals. With treatment by
   anticoagulation, resolution can be expected to occur in one-third of
   patients every 2 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review The main purpose of this article is to review recent
   literature regarding multimodal analgesia medications, citing their
   recommended doses, efficacy, and side effects. The second part of this
   report will provide a description of drugs in different stages of
   development which have novel mechanisms with less side effects such as
   tolerance and addiction.
   Recent Findings Multimodal analgesia is a technique that facilitates
   perioperative pain management by employing two or more systemic
   analgesics along with regional anesthesia, when possible. Even though
   opioids and non-opioid analgesics remain the most common medication used
   for acute pain management after surgery, they have many undesirable side
   effects including the potential for misuse. Newer analgesics including
   peripheral acting opioids, nitric oxide inhibitors, calcitonin
   gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, interleukin-6 receptor
   antagonists, and gene therapy are under intensive investigation.
   Summary A patient's first exposure to opioids is often in the
   perioperative setting, a vulnerable time when multimodal therapy can
   play a large role in decreasing opioid exposure. Additionally, the
   current shift towards faster recovery times, fewer postoperative
   complications, and improved cost-effectiveness during the perioperative
   period has made multimodal analgesia a central pillar of Enhanced
   Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of Microphysical Schemes on the Simulation of Post-Monsoon
   Tropical Cyclones over the North Indian Ocean}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are the most disastrous natural weather
   phenomenon, that have a significant impact on the socioeconomic
   development of the country. In the past two decades, Numerical Weather
   Prediction (NWP) models (e.g., Advanced Research WRF (ARW)) have been
   used for the prediction of TCs. Extensive studies were carried out on
   the prediction of TCs using the ARW model. However, these studies are
   limited to a single cyclone with varying physics schemes, or single
   physics schemes to more than one cyclone. Hence, there is a need to
   compare different physics schemes on multiple TCs to understand their
   effectiveness. In the present study, a total of 56 sensitivity
   experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of seven
   microphysical parameterization schemes on eight post-monsoon TCs formed
   over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) using the ARW model. The performance
   of the Ferrier, Lin, Morrison, Thompson, WSM3, WSM5, and WSM6 are
   evaluated using error metrics, namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
   Square Error (MSE), Skill Score (SS), and average track error. The
   results are compared with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
   observations. From the sensitivity experiments, it is observed that the
   WSM3 scheme simulated the cyclones Nilofar, Kyant, Daye, and Phethai
   well, whereas the cyclones Hudhud, Titli, and Ockhi are best simulated
   by WSM6. The present study suggests that the WSM3 scheme can be used as
   the first best scheme for the prediction of post-monsoon tropical
   cyclones over the NIO.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of desmopressin in preventing renal biopsy-related
   bleeding is not established and its effects on serum sodium levels are
   not well studied. The study aimed to compare the bleeding complication
   rates between the groups with and without desmopressin use prebiopsy and
   to observe the effect of desmopressin on postbiopsy serum sodium levels.
   Methods: In this single-center, prospective and retrospective
   interventional study, from June 2018 onwards, patients with serum
   creatinine >132.6 mu mol/L but not on dialysis and undergoing
   ultrasound-assisted needle-guided renal biopsy received 150 mu g of
   desmopressin (D-amino D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP)) (Group II). Data
   from patients from June 2017 to May 2018 were included in Group I in
   whom desmopressin was not used. Bleeding complications were monitored by
   clinical and ultrasound surveillance. Serum sodium levels were checked
   prior to and 24 h following desmopressin in Group II.
   Results: A total of 194 patients were included in the study: 105 in
   Group I and 89 in Group II. Group II had lower overall minor bleeding
   complications and perinephric hematomas than Group I (15.7\% versus
   31.4\%, 14\% versus 27\% and 7.8\% versus 19\% in Group II and Group I,
   respectively, with P < 0.05). Not using desmopressin and female sex were
   significant predictors for overall risk of bleeding on multivariate
   logistic regression. Serum sodium levels fell in 94\% of patients in
   Group II. Lower prebiopsy serum sodium, higher estimated glomerular
   function rate and higher spot urine sodium values were associated with a
   greater decrease in serum sodium after desmopressin.
   Conclusion: Intranasal desmopressin reduces bleeding complications
   during renal biopsies performed in patients with reduced renal function
   not requiring dialysis, albeit with a risk of developing hyponatremia.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium substituted in Ni-Zn ferrite nanoparticles at different ratio
   and prepared by sol-gel auto combustion method. Their structural,
   morphological, compositional, magnetic and electrical properties were
   studied using XRD, FE-SEM with EDS, FTIR, VSM and DC electrical
   resistivity. From XRD shows single-phase spinel cubic structure and
   lattice constant increased, due to its higher ionic radius of 0.97
   angstrom than that of Zn2+ (0.74 angstrom) which was replaced. FESEM
   attached with EDS gave the images and composition of the sample, which
   were smaller in size. Similarly, the FTIR spectra showed two leading
   absorption bands with the frequencies v(1) near 600 cm(-1) (Ni-O) and
   v(2) near 400 cm(-1) (Zn-O-Cd) indicating Cd2+ prefers to be in the
   tetrahedral site. The magnetic saturation has been reduced from 89.51 to
   71.32 emu/g upon substituting Cd ions and is attributed to strong B-B
   interaction instead of A-B interaction. The sample preparation is highly
   resistive according to the two probes DC electrical resistivity

Abstract = {{Strategic Alliances are one of the options corporates can undertake to
   expand. Organizations consider these means of inorganic growth to
   increase their competitive advantage by increasing their financial
   competencies, by entering into untapped geographical areas, and by
   achieving various updated technological competencies as beneficial. In
   the literary sense, a merger is an activity wherein organizations pool
   in their capabilities to form one unit and acquisition is a process when
   one organization acquires other organizations of its interest.
   Organizations may select these options for varied reasons like, to tap
   untapped locations, get the advantage of newer technologies, to be more
   visible in the market, to attain competitiveness with respect to mass
   production.
   The merger and acquisition activities are responses to the changes in
   the external environment, so it is apt that these activities are
   predominantly dominant in certain time frames than in other time frames.
   (Weston and Jawien, 1999). Gadiesh, Roavit and Critchlow (2001), in
   their perspective have identified the objectives of mergers. Among them,
   getting the control of the organization and ensuring the smooth
   operations of the same, attaining scale of economy, effectively
   operating interrelated operations, expanding the product range and
   improving the technological advantage and improving the attributes with
   respect to the financial parameters and hence to enable the organization
   to adjust to the movements in the external environment by reengineering
   the organizations are very important.
   Our study focuses on the case wise analysis of seven deals from the
   banking and the information technology sector and exploring the
   strategic objectives behind these alliances and analyzing these deals
   case wise to identify whether these strategic objectives were being
   achieved or not and identification of the factors behind these. These
   alliances are analyzed based on the analysis of the various statements
   available in the public domain with respect to the organizations.}},

Title = {{Publication of Positive Studies in the Urologic Literature}},
Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{90-94}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To assessed rates of positive publications within the urologic
   literature, comparing the years 2012 and 2017.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS All studies published in Journal of Urology,
   Neurourology and Urodynamics, Urologic Oncology, Journal of Endourology,
   and Urology in 2012 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary study outcome
   was proportion of positive studies. Additional article characteristics,
   including associated citations and subspecialty focus, were recorded and
   statistical analyses used to assess for differences in negative
   publication rates based on these variables.
   RESULTS A total of 1,796 articles meeting inclusion criteria were
   analyzed (2012, 959; 2017, 837). The overall proportion of positive
   studies decreased in comparison of 2012 and 2017. (90\%-86\%, P =.01). A
   statistically significant decrease was seen in 2 of 5 journals:
   Neurourology and Urodynamics (97\%-87\%, P = .01) and Journal of
   Endourology (93\%-83\%, P G.01). There were no significant differences
   in associated citations for positive vs negative studies in either year.
   Logistic regression focused on year and journal revealed that studies
   published in 2017 and Urology were more likely to be negative.
   CONCLUSION The vast majority of studies within the urologic literature
   are positive, with only a small increase in negative study publication
   comparing 2012 vs 2017. Continued efforts are needed to identify
   publication bias and promote dissemination of negative research
   findings. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{The influence of humic and fulvic acids on Cd bioavailability to wheat
   cultivars grown on sewage irrigated Cd-contaminated soils}},

Abstract = {{The soil cadmium (Cd) contamination is a ubiquitous environmental
   problem that has resulted from intense irrigation with wastewater. This
   pot trial was conducted with aim to produce safe food with Cd tolerant
   wheat cultivar in wastewater irrigated soils. For this purpose, two
   wheat cultivars NARC-2011 (Cd tolerant) and Shafaq-2006 (Cd sensitive)
   were screened out and selected, after conducting a pilot trial of twelve
   local wheat cultivars against Cd stress. Both cultivars were grown in
   naturally contaminated soils with Cd concentrations (4.18, 3.23, 2.29
   and 1.25 mg kg(-1)). After harvesting, NARC-2011 showed significant
   photosynthetic attributes, grain biochemical parameters and yield.
   Additionally, Cd concentrations in edible grains of NARC-2011 cultivars
   were found within standard limits (200 mg kg(-1)), in all contaminated
   soils. Furthermore, a marked decrease in Cd bioavailability was noted
   with cultivar NARC-2011, where contribution of mobile Cd fractions
   (exchangeable and reducible) percentage was decreased, while immobile Cd
   fractions percentage increased (oxidizable and residual). Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reflects the maturity and
   stability of humic and fulvic like acid fractions and revealed that
   humification of these compounds after prolonged sludge enriched
   wastewater irrigation lowered the Cd availability. The wheat cultivar
   NARC-2011 (Cd tolerant) could be opted to grow on soils irrigated with
   waste-water for a long time, as Cd bioavailability decreased with ageing
   due to stabilized humic substances and varietal tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with the problem of the right to die as the derivative
   of the right to life. The author uses problematic, systematic,
   interdisciplinary, and descriptive approaches when she is looking for
   answers to such questions: I) does any life have value? z) whose claims
   to live should modern society guarantee? 3) is it appropriate to speak
   not only of the right to life but also of the right to die? For this
   purpose, the utilitarian position of P. Singer, J. McMahan, and M.
   Tooley is mostly analyzed. Several representatives of the ``sanctity of
   life{''} conception become their opponents. The author concludes that I)
   they speak about the right to die when they question life as an absolute
   or ontic good; z) an alternative may be to distinguish between the
   levels of rights and to respect the persons, not their manifestations.
   Eventually, a different understanding of values is at the core of the

Abstract = {{The NineTeen Complex (NTC), also known as pre-mRNA-processing factor 19
   (Prp19) complex, regulates distinct spliceosome conformational changes
   necessary for splicing. During Drosophila midblastula transition,
   splicing is particularly sensitive to mutations in NTC-subunit Fandango,
   which suggests differential requirements of NTC during development. We
   show that NTC-subunit Salsa, the Drosophila ortholog of human RNA
   helicase Aquarius, is rate-limiting for splicing of a subset of small
   first introns during oogenesis, including the first intron of gurken.
   Germline depletion of Salsa and splice site mutations within gurken
   first intron impair both adult female fertility and oocyte
   dorsal-ventral patterning, due to an abnormal expression of Gurken.
   Supporting causality, the fertility and dorsal-ventral patterning
   defects observed after Salsa depletion could be suppressed by the
   expression of a gurken construct without its first intron. Altogether,
   our results suggest that one of the key rate-limiting functions of Salsa
   during oogenesis is to ensure the correct expression and efficient
   splicing of the first intron of gurken mRNA. Retention of gurken first
   intron compromises the function of this gene most likely because it
   undermines the correct structure and function of the transcript 5'UTR.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy is the cornerstone of our future energy needs. In
   particular, solar energy is being utilized at a faster pace than ever.
   Floating Solar Photovoltaics (FSPV) has recently gained traction as a
   suitable alternative of land-based large scale PV installation. It is a
   promising technology to utilize water surfaces for placing solar plants.
   Not only it utilizes the water as real estate but it has several other
   advantages as well. For example, FSPV can use the existing transmission
   and distribution infrastructure that is the part of hydroelectric power
   plants. In this paper, we evaluate an FSPV plant and its integration
   with the existing hydroelectric power station of a small reservoir in
   Pakistan. We have investigated the 500 kV, 132 kV and 11 kV voltage
   levels for the integration of FSPV plant. Moreover, we have devised a
   hydro-solar optimization model for the efficient utilization of energy.
   The combined system consisting of hydroelectric and 200 MWp FSPV
   produces more than 3.5\% additional power overall when compared with
   production of only hydroelectric power. More importantly the FSPV
   generation coincides with the daily mid-day peak load thus works as a
   peaker plant for the national grid. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Methodik Der Einschluss der aortokoronar bypassoperierten Patienten in
   die prospektive Beobachtungsstudie zum Kraftausdauertraining erfolgte
   von Mai 2017 bis November 2018 in der Paracelsus-Harz-Klinik Bad
   Suderode. Wahrend der Anschlussheilbehandlung absolvierten die Patienten
   3-mal pro Woche eine Bewegungstherapie mit Kraftubungen, welche Dehn-
   und Scherbewegungen am Sternum sowie eine Thoraxkompression vermieden.
   Drei Monate nach dem Aufenthalt wurden die Patienten zu
   Wundheilungsstorungen, anderen Komplikationen und erneuten
   Klinikaufenthalten befragt.
   Ergebnisse 92\% der Patienten waren mannlich, das Durchschnittsalter lag
   bei 61,712,3 Jahren und der mittlere BMI betrug 27,53,8 kg/m (2) . Die
   Patienten erreichten nach einem Median von 16 (13/19) Tagen postoperativ
   die Anschlussheilbehandlung. Wahrend der stationaren Rehabilitation
   traten bei 1,5\% der Patienten Wundheilungsstorungen auf, die
   konservativ behandelt wurden. Im Follow-up gaben 8\%
   Wundheilungsstorungen an, darunter 5 Patienten mit Narbeninfektionen und
   3 weitere Patienten mit verzogerten Heilprozessen. In 2 Fallen war das
   Sternum betroffen. Weitere 8\% gaben Schmerzen im Operationsgebiet an.
   Weiterhin waren bei 7,8\% der Patienten ein erneuter stationarer
   Aufenthalt in einer Akutklinik notig, bei einem Patienten im Rahmen
   einer Wundheilungsstorung (Erysipel im Bereich der Saphenektomie-Narbe).
   Schlussfolgerung Diese Beobachtungsstudie zeigt die kurz- und
   mittelfristige Sicherheit eines selektiven Kraftausdauertrainings in der
   stationaren Rehabilitation, welches fruh nach ACB-Operation durchgefuhrt
   wird.
   Abstract
   Introduction Physical activity is an important and mutable risk factor
   of coronary artery disease. In addition to aerobic exercise a moderate
   strength training should be offered to patient with coronary artery
   disease. However, it is unclear when to start exercise training to
   protect patients with coronary artery bypass graft against a
   post-surgery loss of strength.
   Methods This purely descriptive monitoring study focused on a
   correlation between early postoperative physical activity and an
   increased risk of sternal complications. During the cardiac
   rehabilitation the participants done exercises without elongation or
   compression of the sternum at 3 times a week. After three months the
   patients were asked to healing disorder, any other complications and
   rehospitalisation.
   Results The proportion of men were 92\%, patients were 61,7 +/- 12,3
   years old and the mean BMI was 27,5 +/- 3,8 kg/m (2) . The patients
   began the cardiac rehabilitation after 16 (13/19) days post-surgery.
   While inpatient stay the rate of wound healing disorders was 1.5\%.
   These complications could be handled conservatively. 1.5\% of the
   patients had to be transferred to an acute care clinic. During 3 months
   of follow up the rate of wound healing disorders was 8\%, among 5 cases
   of infections and three cases of delayed healing. In only 2 cases was
   the wound healing disorder located at the sternum. A further 8\%
   reported about postoperative pain. Furthermore, in 7,8\% was a new
   inpatient stay necessary, including one case of wound healing disorder
   (one patient suffered from an erysipelas in the area of saphenectomy).
   Conclusion This observational study shows the short- and medium-term
   safety of selective strength endurance training in inpatient
   rehabilitation, which is carried out early after coronary artery bypass
   surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for research;
   however, multicomponent outcome measures such as daily functioning
   cannot yet be readily extracted.
   Aim
   To evaluate whether an electronic frailty index based on routine primary
   care data can be used as a measure tor daily functioning in research
   with community-dwelling older persons {[}aged >=( )years].
   Design and setting
   Cohort study among participants of the Integrated Systemic Care lot
   Older People (ISCOPE) trial (11 476 eligible; 7285 in observational
   cohort; 3141 in trial; over-representation of trail people).
   Method
   At baseline (T0) and after 12 months (112), daily functioning was
   measured with the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS, range
   18-72). Electronic frailty index scores (range 0-1) at T0 and T12 were
   computed from the EHRs. The electronic frailty index (electronic Frailty
   Index - Utrecht) was tested for responsiveness and compared with the
   GARS as a gold standard for daily functioning.
   Results
   In total, 1390 participants with complete EHR and follow-up data were
   selected (31.4\% male; median age - 81 years. interguartile range =
   78-851. The electronic frailty index increased with age, was higher for
   females, and lower for participants living with a partner. It Was
   responsive after an acute major - medical event; however, the
   correlation between the electronic frailty index arid GARS at T0 arid
   over time was limited.
   Conclusion
   Because the electronic frailly index does riot reflect daily
   functioning, further research on new methods to measure daily
   functioning with routine care data (for example, other proxies) is
   needed before EHRs can be a useful data source for research with older
   persons.}},

Title = {{A powerful method for pleiotropic analysis under composite null
   hypothesis identifies novel shared loci between Type 2 Diabetes and
   Prostate Cancer}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   We propose a new approach PLACO that uses aggregate-level
   genotype-phenotype association statistics-commonly referred to as GWAS
   summary statistics-to identify genetic variants that influence risk of
   two traits or diseases. It allows correlation in summary statistics
   between studies that may arise due to sharing of controls between
   disease traits. We demonstrate that PLACO can achieve major power gain
   over alternative methods that are typically used. We applied PLACO to
   Type 2 Diabetes and Prostate Cancer summary data from two large
   case-control studies. Many previous studies have reported an inverse
   association of these two chronic diseases suggesting shared risk
   factors; however, shared genetic mechanisms underlying this association
   is poorly understood. PLACO identified a number of novel shared genetic
   regions that are not detected by individual trait analysis. Many of the
   loci implicated by PLACO increase risk for one disease while decreasing
   risk for the other. PLACO can similarly be used on other traits to shed
   light on shared genetic risk factors.
   There is increasing evidence that pleiotropy, the association of
   multiple traits with the same genetic variants/loci, is a very common
   phenomenon. Cross-phenotype association tests are often used to jointly
   analyze multiple traits from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The
   underlying methods, however, are often designed to test the global null
   hypothesis that there is no association of a genetic variant with any of
   the traits, the rejection of which does not implicate pleiotropy. In
   this article, we propose a new statistical approach, PLACO, for
   specifically detecting pleiotropic loci between two traits by
   considering an underlying composite null hypothesis that a variant is
   associated with none or only one of the traits. We propose testing the
   null hypothesis based on the product of the Z-statistics of the genetic
   variants across two studies and derive a null distribution of the test
   statistic in the form of a mixture distribution that allows for
   fractions of variants to be associated with none or only one of the
   traits. We borrow approaches from the statistical literature on
   mediation analysis that allow asymptotic approximation of the null
   distribution avoiding estimation of nuisance parameters related to
   mixture proportions and variance components. Simulation studies
   demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain type I error and can
   achieve major power gain over alternative simpler methods that are
   typically used for testing pleiotropy. PLACO allows correlation in
   summary statistics between studies that may arise due to sharing of
   controls between disease traits. Application of PLACO to publicly
   available summary data from two large case-control GWAS of Type 2
   Diabetes and of Prostate Cancer implicated a number of novel shared
   genetic regions: 3q23 (ZBTB38), 6q25.3 (RGS17), 9p22.1 (HAUS6), 9p13.3
   (UBAP2), 11p11.2 (RAPSN), 14q12 (AKAP6), 15q15 (KNL1) and 18q23

Abstract = {{Carbon-based nanomaterials have received substantial attention as a drug
   delivery platform for cancer treatment. In the current study, a simple
   and eco-friendly method was introduced for the preparation of highly
   fluorinated graphene oxide (FGO), which was subsequently evaluated by
   standard characterization methods. It was then employed as a carrier for
   Linoleic acid-curcumin conjugate as an anticancer drug (FGO-Lino-CUR).
   Finally, the release profile and selective toxicity of FGO-Lino-CUR were
   investigated and compared with FGO-CUR. It was observed that the
   pH-sensitive release fitted to Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The accumulated
   release of Lino-CUR at pH 5.5 was about 20\% more than that of pH 7.4.
   FGO-Lino-CUR exhibited relatively high toxicity (about 60\%) against
   MCF-7 cells which was 20\% more than that against MCF10A cells. In vitro
   MRI studies also revealed that the Lino-CUR loaded FGO with adequate
   relaxation rate (r(2) = 67.12 (s(-1)mM(-1))) and favorable ability to
   reduce signal intensity in the presence of MCF10A and MCF-7 cells, could
   be a potential candidate as a negative MRI contrast agent. In vivo
   anti-tumor studies were performed on 4T1 induced BALB/c breast cancer
   model. Accordingly, the higher tumor suppression capability of
   FGO-Lino-CUR was observed with no significant body weight changes during
   treatment compared with free Lino-CUR. Moreover, the MRI contrast
   enhancing ability of FGO-Lino-CUR for the in vivo MRI of tumor bearing
   BALB/c mice, indicated its noticeable ability to create negative
   contrast. Simple and versatile method for the preparation of the target
   system as well as acceptable anticancer activity and MRI contrast
   enhancement, make Lino-CUR loaded FGO as an encouraging candidate for
   the breast cancer theranostics.}},

Abstract = {{Careful estimation of global ductility will certainly lead to greater
   accuracy in the design of structural members. In this paper, a new and
   optimal intelligent model is proposed to predict the roof ductility
   (mu(R)) of EBF steel frames exposed to the near-fault pulse-like
   earthquakes, using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). To
   achieve this goal, a databank consisting of 12960 data is created. To
   establish different geometrical properties of models, 3-,6-, 9-, 12-,
   15, 20-stories, steel EBF frames are considered with 3 different types
   of link beam, column stiffness, and brace slenderness. All models are
   analysed to reach 4 different performance levels using nonlinear time
   history under 20 near-fault earthquakes. About 6769 data are applied as
   ANFIS training data. Subtractive clustering and Fuzzy C-Mean clustering
   (FCM) methods are applied to generate the purposed model. The results
   show that FCM provides more accurate outcomes. Moreover, to validate the
   model, 2257 data are applied (as test data) in order to calculate the
   correlation coefficient (R) and mean squared error (MSE) between the
   predicted values of (mu(R)) and the real values. The results of
   correlation analysis show the high accuracy of the proposed intelligent
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the sintering time/temperature has been long desired. A
   so-called ``non-firing sintering{''} was previously introduced by
   authors, without using thermal energy. This method involves the chemical
   activation of powder surface via ball milling, however, the mechanical
   strength of solidified bodies by non-firing sintering method is still
   low. In this study, an optimized non-firing process will be proposed in
   order to achieve high-strength materials comparable to the
   high-temperature sintered counterparts. Results showed that by
   optimizing the process, mechanical strength of 270 MPa and Vickers
   hardness of 2.1 GPa (214 Hv) were successfully achieved. It is also
   shown that the particle-particle bridge strength determines the bulk
   strength. (c) 2020 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with the advent of the age of Web 2.0, several social
   recommendation methods that use social network information have been
   proposed and achieved distinct developments. However, the most critical
   challenges for the existing majority of these methods are: (1) They tend
   to utilize only the available social relation between users and deal
   just with the cold-start user issue. (2) Besides, these methods are
   suffering from the lack of exploitation of content information such as
   social tagging, which can provide various sources to extract the item
   information to overcome the cold-start item and improve the
   recommendation quality. In this paper, we investigated the efficiency of
   data fusion by integrating multi-source of information. First, two
   essential factors, user-side information, and item-side information, are
   identified. Second, we developed a novel social recommendation model
   called Two-Sided Regularization (TSR), which is based on the
   probabilistic matrix factorization method. Finally, the effective
   quantum-based similarity method is adapted to measure the similarity
   between users and between items into the proposed model. Experimental
   results on the real dataset show that our proposed model TSR addresses
   both of cold-start user and item issues and outperforms state-of-the-art
   recommendation methods. These results indicate the importance of
   incorporating various sources of information in the recommendation
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the flexural response of functionally graded plates with
   porosities is investigated using a novel higher order shear deformation
   theory, which considers the influence of thickness stretching. This
   theory fulfills the nullity conditions at the top and bottom of the
   plate for the transverse shear stresses, thus avoids the need of a shear
   correction factor. The effective material properties are computed
   through the rule of mixtures. The principle of virtual displacements is
   employed to derive the equilibrium equations. The Navier's method is
   adopted to obtain the solutions in closed form for simply supported
   boundary conditions. The accuracy and consistency of the developed
   theory are established with numerical results of perfect and porous
   functionally graded plates available in the open literature. The
   dimensionless transverse displacements and stresses have been reported.
   The effect of even, uneven and logarithmically-uneven porosity
   distributions with different porosity volume fraction, gradation index,
   side-to thickness ratios and aspect ratios are studied. The numerical
   results show that, the increase of volume fraction of porosity increases
   the dimensionless transverse deflections and axial stresses, and
   decreases the transverse shear stresses. No variation of transverse
   shear stresses observed for a completely ceramic and metallic plate for
   all kinds of porosity models. The provided numerical results can be used
   to evaluate various plate theories and also to compare the results of
   other analytical methods and finite element methods.}},

Abstract = {{The modern engineering structures require the advanced engineering
   materials to resist the high temperatures and to provide high stiffness.
   In particular the functionally graded porous materials (FGPMs)
   introduced are expected to have these desired properties, consequently
   eliminating local stress concentration and de-lamination. In the present
   paper, a new shear strains shape function is chosen to research the
   bending analysis of functionally graded plates (FGPs) with uneven
   symmetrical, uneven asymmetrical and even distributions of porosity. The
   material properties of uneven porosity distributions along the thickness
   of the FGPs vary with cosine function. The present theory includes the
   influence of thickness stretching. This theory also fulfills the nullity
   of the shear stresses in the transverse direction on the top and bottom
   of the plate, thus avoids the use of a shear correction factor. The
   virtual displacement principle is employed to develop the equilibrium
   equations for porous FGPs. The Navier's method is used to obtain the
   solutions of porous FGPs for simply supported (SS) conditions. The
   accuracy of the developed theory is established with numerical results
   of perfect and porous FGPs available in the open source. The transverse
   displacements and stress results have been reported and studied for
   evenly, unevenly symmetrical and unevenly asymmetrical distributions
   with different porosity volume fraction (PVF), thickness ratios and
   aspect ratios. From the numerical results it is concluded that the type
   of porosity distribution needs to be considered as a key factor in the
   optimal design of the porous FGPs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To formulate and evaluate Olanzapine immediate-release tablets
   using direct compression. Immediate release of drug from the dosage form
   is required for rapid onset of action and produce an immediate
   therapeutic effect. Method: Tablets were formulated using two different
   natural super disintegrants like Fenugreek and Isabghul and in
   combination by using Response Surface Methodology. The selected
   independent variables (Y1) Fenugreek and (Y2) Isabghul showed a
   significant effect on dependent variables, i.e., disintegration time
   (X1) and percentage drug release (X2). Drug and excipients compatibility
   studies were done by FTIR studies. Results: No significant drug-polymer
   interactions were observed in FTIR studies. The prepared tablets were
   evaluated for weight variation, friability, hardness, disintegration,
   and dissolution. A formulation containing 2\% fenugreek and 5\% isabghul
   was offered the relatively rapid release of Olanzapine when compared
   with other concentrations employed in this investigation. The
   formulation with 4.2\% Fenugreek and 5\% Isabghul was optimized, and the
   tablets were evaluated. Conclusion: The optimized formulation AOF14
   showed the desired level of \% CDR 98.43 at the end of 30 minutes, and
   their similarity factor (f2) was calculated with innovator whose value

Abstract = {{Preparing work-ready chemical engineering graduates is achieved by
   integrating the technical skills and knowledge learned at university
   with employability skills required by industry. While this is most often
   made through industry placements, non-placement forms of work-integrated
   learning (WIL) can be highly effective in preparing graduates for the
   workplace without the issues of locating work placements and ensuring
   their quality. In this paper, the authors focus on a chemical
   engineering course that combines non-placement WIL with a
   problem-oriented/project-based learning methodology, and a
   problem-solving tool, the Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD)
   framework. The authors present qualitative data from students,
   lecturers, and industry partners to evaluate whether the employability
   skills of creativity and teamwork are developed in the course. Through a
   process of qualitative analysis, the authors developed five key themes
   that provide a focused understanding of how the parts of the course
   relate to one another and drive student learning. The findings of this
   study indicate that the model of non-placement WIL evaluated was
   effective in building the defined employability skills; however, there
   are opportunities for iterative enhancement. The key learnings from this
   study may guide others interested in building non-placement WIL into
   chemical engineering education. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical

   occipitomastoid, lambdoid, sphenosquamosal and petro-occipital sutures,
   and synchondroses were determined. Main Outcome Measures: The presence
   of temporal bone suture and synchondrosal diastasis following temporal
   bone trauma. Diastasis was defined as sutural separation of a distance
   greater than 1 mm in comparison to the contralateral side. Results:
   Using our diastasis diagnostic criteria, diastasis occurred in 41.5\% of
   temporal bone fractures. Transverse fracture types were significantly
   associated with diastasis (p <= 0.001). Lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
   and loss of consciousness (LOC) were associated with the presence of
   diastasis with displacement and diastasis (p = 0.034 and p = 0.042,
   respectively). Otic capsule violation was more common in fractures with
   diastasis but did not reach statistical significance. There were two
   cases of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea and three deaths in cases that
   featured diastasis. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that diastasis is
   a positive predictor for higher disruptive force injuries and more
   severe outcomes and complications. Posttraumatic temporal bone suture
   diastasis may represent a separate clinico-pathologic entity in addition
   to the usual temporal bone fracture classification types.}},

Abstract = {{In order to prepare poly-D,L-lactide/silica nanocomposites and to
   improve the interfacial adhesion between these two materials,
   silanization of silica was realized adopting two different
   organosilanes, i.e. 3-glycidyloxytrimethoxysilane or
   3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. Then, resulting modified silica with
   epoxy or amino terminal functions served as initiating sites for
   D,L-lactide in situ polymerization allowing the production of
   poly-D,Llactide/silica nanocomposites.
   Silica dispersion and mechanical properties of these hybrids were
   compared to composites prepared with hydrophilic or hydrophobic
   commercial silica by in situ polymerization. These latter composites
   disclosed heterogeneities with microscale agglomerates and a drop in
   mechanical properties for 5 wt\% of silica loading. In contrast,
   composites made from poly-D,L-lactide chains chemically grafted on
   silica carrying initiation sites disclosed nanoscale dispersion of
   nanofiller in the PDLLA matrix. In particular, with only 1 wt\% of these
   modified silicas, thanks to the nanoscale dispersion of the inorganic
   nanofiller, an improvement of 24 \% for Young modulus and 51 \% for
   ultimate tensile strength was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In the US, birth has become a carefully planned experience for those
   with the greatest access to resources. Pregnancy preparations, including
   prenatal care, childbirth education, and peer interactions, encourage
   women to act as informed consumers, to communicate their own values,
   beliefs, and preferences in labor and delivery, and to challenge
   healthcare systems and medical providers. Simultaneously, there has been
   a growth in the number of mothers who reject medical recommendations for
   infant vaccination and newborn interventions. These challenges are
   presented by women with higher levels of education and resources, a
   group that is also most likely to insist on control over birth. In this
   article, I draw on qualitative data from mothers who reject vaccination
   recommendations for their children to highlight the interconnected
   experiences of childbirth self-advocacy and vaccine refusal. I suggest
   prenatal education toward self-advocacy may serve as a pedagogical
   process that mirrors the rhetoric of vaccine refusal. I conclude by
   showing how this new pedagogy of patient empowerment is nurtured and
   respected by pediatricians who administer vaccines and provide wellness
   care, even as they struggle with mothers who reject this core public
   health intervention.}},

Title = {{Gender equality regimes and evaluation regimes in Europe and their
   implications for policy design and evaluation}},
Journal = {{EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{83}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This article starts from the assumption that it is important
   for the evaluation of gender equality in-terventions in RTDI (Research,
   Technology Development and Innovation) to consider its context regarding
   gender equality regime and evaluation culture because this context does
   influence effects and long term impacts of such activities. It aims to
   provide key characteristics for the differentiation of gender equality
   regimes and evaluation regimes to be considered when designing policy
   interventions or evaluating specific gender equality interventions in
   RTDI.
   Design/methodology/approach: After a literature review of relevant
   typologies for welfare state and gender equality regimes, it was
   analysed to which extent the seven EFFORTI countries correspond to
   certain typologies based on the data basis of the context research
   performed in the EFFORTI project. For this context research,
   international/national and qualitative/quantitative data regarding the
   relevant framework conditions were firstly collected for each of the
   EFFORTI countries and secondly compared in a cross-country analysis.
   Findings: The research showed that when it comes to gender equality
   policies, most EFFORTI countries can either be assigned to the
   Social-Democratic category or Conservative Equal Employment Regime
   category in the typology of von Wahl (2005), with the latter type
   tending to provide less favourable conditions for women in the general
   labour market as well as women in RTDI (e.g. overtime culture). In how
   far these different types of context can have an impact on the
   evaluation of interventions can be exemplarily illustrated using case
   studies carried out as part of EFFORTI.
   Connecting the typologies for gender equality policy with evaluation
   regimes has not proved fruitful, as the two discourses have only begun
   to converge in recent years. The evaluation regimes and cultures of the
   respective countries have therefore been described independently.
   However, it was shown that countries with more expertise in certain
   areas (e.g. gender, evaluations) developed more routinized and
   institutionalised procedures in the respective field.
   Originality/value: Considering the different framework conditions is
   relevant when it comes to evaluation as different national contexts
   might require different policy and designs of activities, but might also
   shape the interventions' effects. This article therefore aims to provide
   support in this regard for future evaluations of gender policies.}},

Journal = {{GENES}},

Abstract = {{Warmblood fragile foal syndrome (WFFS) is an autosomal recessive
   disorder caused by a single nucleotide variant in the
   procollagen-lysine-2-oxoglutarate-5-dioxygenase 1 gene (PLOD1:c.2032G>A,
   p.Gly678Arg). Homozygosity for the PLOD1 variant causes an
   Ehler-Danlos-like syndrome, which has to date only been reported in
   warmblood breeds but the WFFS allele has been also detected in the
   Thoroughbred. To investigate the breed distribution of the WFFS allele,
   4081 horses belonging to 38 different breeds were screened. In total,
   4.9\% of the horses representing 21 breeds carried the WFFS allele. The
   affected breeds were mainly warmbloods, with carrier frequency as high
   as 17\% in the Hanoverian and Danish Warmblood. The WFFS allele was not
   detected in most non-warmblood breeds. Exceptions include WFFS carriers
   in the Thoroughbred (17/716), Haflinger (2/48), American Sport Pony
   (1/12), and Knabstrupper (3/46). The origin of the WFFS allele remains
   unknown. The Arabian breed and specifically the stallion Bairactar Or.
   Ar. (1813), whose offspring were reported to have a similar phenotype in
   the 19th century, were hypothesized as the origin. DNA from a museum
   sample of Bairactar Or. Ar. showed that he did not carry the mutated
   allele. This result, together with the genotypes of 302 Arabians, all
   homozygous for the reference allele, does not support an Arabian origin
   of the WFFS allele. Our extensive survey shows the WFFS allele to be of
   moderate frequency and concern in warmbloods and also in breeds where it
   may not be expected.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze clinicopathological features, including treatment profile of
   34 cases of Ewing sarcomas with epithelial differentiation, including 6
   cases with adamantinoma-like features.
   EWSR1 gene rearrangement was tested by fluorescence in-situ
   hybridization.
   Thirty-four tumors occurred in 19 males and 15 females (M:F = 1.26:1),
   with age ranging from 7 to 61 years (average = 24.2); in extremities
   (17), pelvis (5), paraspinal region (6), head and neck region (3),
   abdomen (2) and lung (1).
   Prior to molecular testing, 20/34(58.8\%) cases were unequivocally
   diagnosed as Ewing sarcomas. Histopathologically, the most commonly
   observed pattern was nesting-type, comprising malignant round cells,
   including adamantinoma-like features, seen in 6 tumors.
   Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were diffusely positive (cytoplasmic
   membranous staining) for CD99/MIC2 (34/34), Fli1 (30/30); focally for
   synaptophysin (4/16) (25\%); variably positive for
   AE1/AE3(31/32)(96.8\%), including diffuse immunoexpression in 4 cases;
   EMA(6/8) and p40(3/8). All 34 (100\%) tumors, tested for EWSR1
   rearrangement, displayed positive results.
   According to the treatment details (available in 24/34 cases, 70.5\%),
   most patients (13/24)(54.1\%) were treated with surgical resection and a
   specific chemotherapy(CT) regimen (neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings),
   including 7 patients, who received adjuvant radiotherapy. During
   follow-up (16 cases, 47\%), 5 patients developed recurrences and 8
   developed metastasis, including a single, who developed recurrence.
   Finally, 10 patients were alive-with-disease (2-22 months); 6
   free-of-disease (5-36 months).
   This constitutes one of the largest documentation of these rare tumors
   from our subcontinent, which are diagnostically challenging; require
   molecular confirmation and associated with treatment implications.}},

   Land Cover Classification}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes a novel method for combining multiview features in
   polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) for land cover
   classification. It is well-known that feature extraction and classifier
   design are two significant steps in machine learning methods for PolSAR
   data interpretation. Each PolSAR pixel can be represented in different
   feature spaces, such as polarimetric data scattering, or the
   polarimetric target decomposition spaces. In this letter, a tensor-based
   multiview embedding algorithm is proposed to fuse those features from
   different spaces in order to obtain a distinctive set of features for
   the subsequent classification. Based on the pixel-based classification
   tasks, a modified tensor distance (MTD) is designed to accurately
   calculate the distance between tensors. It emphasizes the importance of
   the central pixel, and decreases the influence of the neighbors in the
   feature patch when calculating tensor distance. Furthermore, the

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes has attracted
   tremendous attention due to be economical and environmentally friendly.
   We present herein a tetracarboxyate photocatalyst (Mgtptc) based on MgO6
   octahedral. With increased particle size of Mgtptc, the PL intensity
   displayed a quenching effect as well as a lengthened emission lifetime,
   which might contribute to photoinduced electron-hole pairs separation.
   Mgtptc at the particle size of 0.45-0.3011m showed highly photocatalytic
   activity in degradation of cation and neutral dyes upon UV light
   exposure. Based on the reactive species capturing, the responsible
   photocatalytic mechanism was discussed in detail. Furthermore,
   degradation efficiency of MB was not of significant loss after five
   consecutive cycles, suggesting its excellent photostability.}},

Title = {{The White Dwarf Binary Pathways Survey. V. The Gaia White Dwarf Plus
   AFGK Binary Sample and the Identification of 23 Close Binaries}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Close white dwarf binaries consisting of a white dwarf and an A-, F-,
   G-, or K-type main-sequence star, henceforth close WD+AFGK binaries, are
   ideal systems to understand the nature of type Ia supernovae progenitors
   and to test binary evolution models. In this work we identify 775
   WD+AFGK candidates from TGAS (The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) and
   Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), a well-defined sample of stars with available
   parallaxes, and we measure radial velocities (RVs) for 275 of them with
   the aim of identifying close binaries. The RVs have been measured from
   high-resolution spectra obtained at the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope and
   the San Pedro Martir 2.12 m Telescope and/or from available LAMOST DR6
   (low-resolution) and RAVE DR5 (medium-resolution) spectra. We identify
   23 WD+AFGK systems displaying more than 3 sigma RV variation among 151
   systems for which the measured values are obtained from different
   nights. Our WD+AFGK binary sample contains both AFGK dwarfs and giants,
   with a giant fraction similar to 43\%. The close binary fractions we
   determine for the WD+AFGK dwarf and giant samples are 24\% and 15\%,
   respectively. We also determine the stellar parameters (i.e., effective
   temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and radius) of the AFGK
   companions with available high-resolution spectra. The stellar parameter
   distributions of the AFGK companions that are members of close and wide
   binary candidates do not show statistically significant differences.}},

   composed of two emission peaks at 490 nm (blue) and 580 nm (yellow). The
   ratios of yellow-to-blue increased as well as the CCT reduced from 6974
   K, 5876 K-4910 K with the Sr2+ ion increasing. When the temperature

Title = {{An improved variable neighborhood search for bi-objective mixed-energy
   fleet vehicle routing problem}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{With increasing emphasis on environmental protection, the green vehicle
   routing problem has been a research hotspot. This paper investigates a
   mixed-energy fleet green vehicle routing problem with time windows,
   where the mixed-energy fleet is presented for the situation in which
   transport companies introduce electric vehicles into their homogeneous
   fleet with only gasoline and diesel vehicles (GDVs) due to environmental
   consideration. Since multiple pollutants are emitted by GDVs into the
   environment, this paper minimizes five dominating types of pollutant
   emissions. The other objective is to minimize the total delay time,
   which is defined with a newly designed optimal service period to improve
   customer satisfaction. To solve this bi-objective NP-hard problem, an
   improved variable neighborhood search (VNS) with a selection mechanism
   is presented to find the Pareto frontier of the model. The computational
   results based on Solomon benchmark show that the proposed VNS with a
   selection mechanism has better capability and efficiency than the
   original VNS. Using numerical experiments, we found that delivery with
   only GDVs can better minimize the delay time in cluster-distributed
   customers with narrow time windows, while the mixed-energy fleet
   performs better in both optimization objectives in wider time windows.
   Our research conclusion can provide a more reasonable decision-making
   basis of delivery for transportation companies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant cancers worldwide.
   However, the mechanisms of initiation and development of CRC are still
   largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the biological
   function and prognosis of glutamate receptor ionotropic, kainate 1
   (GRIK1) in CRC. GRIK1 expression levels were analyzed in tissue
   microarrays containing 80 primary CRC samples using immunohistochemistry
   (IHC). The association between GRIK1 expression levels,
   clinicopathological factors and the prognosis was also investigated
   using Spearman's correlation analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis,
   respectively. After genetic knockdown or overexpression of GRIK1,
   invasion/migration assays, proliferation assay, soft agar/colony
   formation assays, western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative
   PCR and tumor xenograft models were used to investigate the function of
   GRIK1 both in vitro in two CRC cell lines, HCT116 and SW620, and in
   vivo. The results revealed that the expression levels of GRIK1 were
   significantly downregulated in CRC samples. Furthermore, IHC analysis
   indicated that the downregulated expression levels of GRIK1 were
   significantly associated with lymph node status and tumor size. In
   addition, patients with CRC with low GRIK1 expression levels
   demonstrated a consistently poor overall survival. The overexpression of
   GRIK1 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion
   and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCT116 cells in vitro. In
   contrast, the genetic knockdown of GRIK1 promoted the proliferative,
   colony forming, migratory and invasive abilities of SW620 cells in
   vitro. Moreover, the overexpression of GRIK1 inhibited tumor growth, and
   liver and lung metastasis of CRC in vivo. In conclusion, the findings of
   the present study suggested that GRIK1 may serve as a tumor suppressor
   in CRC, and upregulated expression levels of GRIK1 may predict an
   improved prognosis for patients with CRC.}},

Abstract = {{Within the past 20 years, the question of the quality of work has caught
   increased attention on both sides of the Rhine. While in 2013 a national
   inter-professional agreement recognized ``qualite de vie au travail{''}
   as a category of collective bargaining in France, the German Trade Union
   Confederation has been producing an index on ``good work{''} (Gute
   Arbeit) based on ad hoc employee surveys since 2007. But what do these
   categories refer to respectively? Beyond similarities that emerge at
   first glance, a closer look reveals significant differences. While
   quality of work is framed as a societal problem on the German side, it
   is treated as a public health problem on the French one. The article
   examines the differing process of categorization within the respective
   national discourses, laying a particular focus on how European
   objectives are translated into national contexts. European debates of
   the 2000s on the subjective aspects of quality of work provide the
   background to both categories but major differences can be traced back
   to the structures of labor-related conflict-resolution and the varying
   importance of labor psychology in the process of categorization.}},

Title = {{Reliability Assessment of a Fault-Tolerant PV Multistring Inverter}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In photovoltaic (PV) systems, the reliability of the system components,
   especially the power converters, is a major concern in obtaining cost
   effective solutions. In order to guarantee service continuity in the
   case of failure of elements of the PV converter, in particular,
   semiconductor switching devices, a solution is to design power converter
   with fault-tolerance capability. This can be realized by aggregating
   hardware redundancy on an existing converter, providing the possibility
   of replacement of faulty elements. This paper evaluates the reliability
   of a fault-tolerant power electronics converter for PV multistring
   application. The considered fault-tolerant design includes a single
   redundant switching leg, which is used in order to reconfigure the
   structure in case of a switch failure either on DC-AC or DC-DC stages.
   This paper details the reliability estimation of the considered PV
   multistring fault-tolerant converter. Furthermore, a comparison with a
   conventional structure without fault-tolerant capability is provided.
   The results show that the introduction of a single redundant leg allows
   for improving the converter mean time to failure by a factor of almost
   two and it reduces, by half, the power loss due to system-failure
   shutdowns in PV applications, while only increasing the converter cost
   by 2-3\%.}},

Title = {{Stress distribution with extra-short implants in an angled frictional
   system: A finite element analysis study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Statement of problem. Short and extra-short implants with Morse taper
   connections were developed to avoid grafting procedures. How the
   stresses around these implants differ with abutments of different
   angulations is unclear.
   Purpose. The purpose of this finite element study was to analyze the
   stress distribution in different structures (abutment, implant, and
   bone) of an extra-short implant with a Morse taper connection to the
   abutment (Arcsys-FGM-Brazil) (5.0x5.0 mm and 4.3x5.0 mm) when different
   abutment degrees were used.
   Material and methods. Eight 3D models were designed according to each
   group under analysis: group 5DS (5.0x5.0-mm implants with straight
   abutment), group 5DA (5.0x5.0-mm implants with 20-degree angled
   abutments), group 4DS (4.3x5.0-mm implants with straight abutments), and
   group 4DA (4.3x5.0-mm implants with 20-degree angled abutments). Axial
   and oblique loads of 150 N were applied on the mandibular molar crowns.
   Results. The oblique loads and angled abutments had higher stress values
   in the whole model (implant, abutment, and bone) than the axial loads
   and straight abutments. Implants with a different diameter had almost
   the same stress distribution on the implant, abutment, and bone. The
   yield limit was exceeded in the cortical bone with oblique loads and was
   also exceeded in implant models when an angled abutment with oblique
   loads was used.
   Conclusions. Extra-short implants with Morse taper connections to the
   abutment had higher stress concentrations with an angled abutment on
   oblique loads, and the peri-implant bone was the most damaged structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents `expert opinions' on what should be taught in a
   first-year linear algebra course at university; the aim is to gain a
   generic picture and general guiding principles for such a course.
   Drawing on a Delphi method, 14 university professors-called `experts' in
   this study-addressed the following questions: What should be on a
   first-year linear algebra undergraduate course for engineering and/or
   mathematics students? How could such courses be taught? What tools (if
   any) are essential to these two groups of students? The results of the
   investigation, these experts' opinions, mainly concern what should be in
   a linear algebra course (e.g. problem-solving and applications) and what
   students should be able to do. The experts also emphasized that certain
   theoretical aspects (e.g. proofs, abstract structures, definitions and
   relationships) were more important to mathematics students. There was no
   real consensus among the experts on teaching methods or the use of
   digital tools, but this lack of consensus is interesting in itself. The
   results are discussed in relation to extant research.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for Opuntia spp., cladodes has increased substantially due to
   their low caloric value, high fiber content, their nutritional and
   functional characteristics and beneficial effects and phytochemical
   composition. The aim of this work was to determine the content of
   biochemical components and the antioxidant capacity of the nopal
   developed under micro tunnel conditions, with VC as a source of
   fertilization. The plants were grown under micro tunnel conditions with
   the manual vermicompost application at 15, 30 and 45 t.ha(-1). Between
   February and May 2019, four samplings of three cladodes (12 to 15 cm)
   from each treatment were obtained. Samples were stored at -20 degrees C
   prior to obtaining ethanol extracts. Total phenolic content and total
   flavonoids were determined using a modification of Folin-Ciocalteu and
   Zhishen methods, respectively. The ABTS(+) test was performed with
   methodology proposed by Aubad-Lopez. A split plot design, with two
   replicates, was used. The big plot corresponded to doses of vermicompost
   and subplots to the three varieties of nopal. Data were statistically
   analyzed by a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Statistical
   significance was obtained at 95\% confidence level (alpha = 0.05) using
   SPSS Statistics. The values recorded for the contents of total phenols,
   total flavonoids and the antioxidant activity, in the Chicomostoc,
   Chapingo and Narro varieties suggest that cladodes may be a promising
   source of natural antioxidants.}},

   Concrete with Fine Recycled Concrete Aggregate}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The compressive strength of recycled concrete is acknowledged to be
   largely conditioned by the incorporation ratio of Recycled Concrete
   Aggregate (RCA), although that ratio needs to be carefully assessed to
   optimize the design of structural applications. In this study,
   Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) mixes containing 100\% coarse RCA and
   variable amounts, between 0\% and 100\%, of fine RCA were manufactured
   and their compressive strengths were tested in the laboratory for a
   statistical analysis of their strength variations, which exhibited
   robustness and normality according to the common statistical procedures.
   The results of the confidence intervals, the one-factor ANalysis Of
   VAriance (ANOVA), and the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that an increase in
   fine RCA content did not necessarily result in a significant decrease in
   strength, although the addition of fine RCA delayed the development of
   the final strength. The statistical models presented in this research
   can be used to define the optimum incorporation ratio that would produce
   the highest compressive strength. Furthermore, the multiple regression
   models offered accurate estimations of compressive strength, considering
   the interaction between the incorporation ratio of fine RCA and the
   curing age of concrete that the two-factor ANOVA revealed. Lastly, the
   probability distribution predictions, obtained through a log-likelihood
   analysis, fitted the results better than the predictions based on
   current standards, which clearly underestimated the compressive strength
   of SCC manufactured with fine RCA and require adjustment to take full
   advantage of these recycled materials. This analysis could be carried
   out on any type of waste and concrete, which would allow one to evaluate
   the same aspects as in this research and ensure that the use of recycled
   concrete maximizes both sustainability and strength.}},

Abstract = {{Recent cases have called the Federal Trade Commission's ({''}FTC{''})
   enforcement methods into question. After a circuit split developed in
   the wake of the Seventh Circuit's decision in Federal Trade Commission
   v. Credit Bureau Center, L.L.C., the Supreme Court responded by granting
   certiorari and consolidating the case with AMG Capital Management,
   L.L.C. v. Federal Trade Commission. The issue in these cases is whether
   Section 13(b) of the FTC Act authorizes the FTC to bypass the due
   process safeguards mandated by Congress in Sections 5 and 19 of the FTC
   Act and, in doing so, to conduct warrantless searches and seizures,
   unilaterally freeze assets, and impose punitive ``disgorgement{''}
   monetary damages. In light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in
   Securities \& Exchange Commission v. Liu, it seems likely that the Court
   will limit the FTC's abusive use of Section 13(b) and find in favor of
   the defendants in these cases.
   The FTC's mission is to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts
   or practices, and for many years, one of its main enforcement methods
   has been disgorgement under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Section 13(b)
   gives the FTC the authority to seek preliminary and permanent
   injunctions when it believes that the law is being violated or is about
   to be violated. It does not mention disgorgement or any other
   restitution methods, but the FTC has spent considerable time and energy
   building a foundation of favorable case law to support its ability to
   use disgorgement. Its strategy consisted of building a body of
   precedent, based on old and inapplicable cases, and it has aggressively
   pursued this strategy with the intention of expanding its enforcement
   abilities. The way it has used its self-created power has caused untold
   damage to business owners, employees, and consumers.
   This Article argues that the Supreme Court should rule against the FTC
   in Credit Bureau Center /AMG Capital Management. The FTC used shaky and
   extraneous case law to expand its power to include the ability to seek
   disgorgement, and it has caused irreparable harm to businesses and
   individuals across the country. Indeed, following the FTC's use of
   disgorgement as an improper remedy to seek damages, several business
   owners who were subjected to that improper treatment committed suicide,
   making the FTC a de facto judge, jury, and executioner. Part I details
   the methods that the FTC has used over the past few decades to expand
   its power to its current level. Part II argues that disgorgement is not
   authorized by Congress under Section 13(b). Indeed, nothing other than a
   preliminary or permanent injunction is authorized by Congress under
   Section 13(b). And Part III addresses the numerous constitutional issues
   that arise when a federal agency expands its power far beyond its
   statutory grant of power.}},

Abstract = {{Background Survival rates after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
   remain low. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) has been
   introduced as an attempt to increase survival in selected patients and
   observational studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless,
   inclusion criteria and timing of eCPR remain undefined. Objective The
   current study analyzed a load and go strategy with respect to the golden
   hour of eCPR as a cut-off time for survival and favorable neurological
   outcome. Material and methods This retrospective cohort study included
   32 patients who underwent eCPR treatment due to an OHCA between January
   2017 and September 2019. Routinely taken patient demographic data (age,
   BMI, sex) were analyzed. The main focus was set on processing times in
   the preclinical and clinical setting. Time intervals including OHCA
   until ambulance arrival, time on scene, transportation times and door to
   eCPR were extracted from emergency medical service (EMS) and
   resuscitation protocols. Low-flow times, survival and neurological
   outcome were analyzed. Results The use of eCPR in OHCA was associated
   with survival to hospital discharge in 28\% and a good neurological
   outcome in 19\% of the cases. Both groups (survivor and nonsurvivor) did
   not differ in patient demographics except for age. Survivors were
   significantly younger (47 (30-60) vs. 59 (50-68) years, p = 0.035).
   Processing times as well as low-flow times were not significantly
   different (OHCA-eCPR survivor 64 (50-87) vs. non-survivor 74 (51-85)
   min; p-value 0.64); however, median low-flow times were outside the
   golden hour of eCPR (69 (52-86)). Conclusion Despite low-flow times of
   more than 60 min, eCPR was associated with survival in 28\% after OHCA.
   Hence, exceeding the golden hour of eCPR cannot act as a definitive
   exclusion criterion for eCPR.}},

Title = {{Mineral chemistry and phase relations of Co-Ni arsenides and
   sulfarsenides from the Baycheh-Bagh deposit, Zanjan province, Iran}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{127}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The polymetallic hydrothermal veins of Baycheh-Bagh deposit in NW Iran
   occur in quartz-carbonate veins which are hosted by Oligocene to Miocene
   volcanic (mainly andesite) and volcaniclastic (agglomerate, tuff) rocks
   unconformably overlying metamorphic basement rocks. Three transitional
   paragentic stages of hypogene mineralization have been identified. Stage
   1 includes base metal (Cu, Zn, Pb) sulfides and gold and is succeeded by
   Co-Ni-Fe-As minerals and bismuth (Stage 2) and Cu-Bi sulfides/sulfosalts
   (Stage 3). Stage 2 Ni-Co-Fe mineralization is complex and is subdivided
   into three substages starting with sulfarsenides (arsenopyrite,
   alloclasite I, II), followed by native bismuth, triarsenides
   (skutterudite I, II, III) and diarsenides (rammelsbergite, safflorite)
   and terminated by sulfarsenides (gersdorffite-cobaltite solid solution,
   alloclacite III). Skutterudite and alloclasite are present in several
   generations and preserve delicate growth zoning reflecting a multi-stage
   episodic growth. The sulfarsenides and arsenides reveal significant
   substitution of Ni, Co, Fe as well as As and S reflecting compositional
   changes of the ore forming fluid (e.g., activities of metals, As/S) as
   well as changes in pH and oxidation state. The mineral assemblages and
   comparison with similar As-dominated vein-type Ni-Co mineralization
   elsewhere, collectively referred to as ``five element veins{''}, suggest
   that the complex arsenide/ sulfarsenide assemblages formed at
   temperatures below 300 degrees C. Baycheh-Bagh can be regarded as a
   member of this heterogeneous group of Bi-Co-Ni-As deposits. A
   peculiarity of hydrothermal vein-type mineralization at Baycheh-Bagh is
   that initial epithermal (?) Cu-(Au-Zn-Pb) mineralization evolved into
   (Bi)-Co-Ni-As mineralization with time.}},

   hydrolysates}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{B}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to obtain flavor molecules from goat
   by-product hydrolysates, emphasizing the thermal action during
   processing. A mixture of by-products submitted or not to the
   inactivation of endogenous enzymes was used, followed by hydrolysis with
   the proteolytic enzyme Alcalase (R) (Bacillus licheniformis), and
   autoclaving after hydrolysis. The production of hydrolysates provided
   both quantitative and qualitative data on the precursors involved in the
   aromatic formation of protein hydrolysates. The inactivation process of
   endogenous enzymes resulted in hydrolysates with a higher degree of
   hydrolysis and greater protein content. The autoclaving process produced
   a significant increase in the concentration of free amino acids and
   maltose and a reduction in the glucose content. Application of the two
   heat treatments resulted in the production of goat by-product protein
   hydrolysates with different volatile profiles. The goat by-product
   protein hydrolysate without heat treatment but with autoclaving (HCA),
   showing a higher concentration of flavor precursors and the formation of
   heterocyclic volatiles, is expected to impact the aroma quality of goat
   hydrolysates.}},

Title = {{Identifying recreational ecosystem service areas of concern in Grand
   Canyon National Park: A participatory mapping approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increased visitor use and overuse are well-documented in popular
   national parks in the Western United States. Previous research has
   documented how this high level of visitor use negatively impacts park
   resources and inhibits the provisioning of recreational ecosystem
   services to park visitors. This research informs the management of
   recreational ecosystem services in wildland protected areas by
   identifying important provisioning areas, degraded provisioning areas,
   and at-risk provisioning areas through a participatory mapping exercise
   conducted with park managers and other key residential stakeholders
   (e.g., tourism operators, NGOs, and local community leaders) in Grand
   Canyon National Park. Following a mixed methods design, responses were
   analyzed via overlap, hotspot, and qualitative metadata analyses.
   Findings indicate that unique bundles of recreational ecosystem services
   are provisioned in specific areas across the study area. However, many
   of these service provisioning areas were also found to be either
   degraded or at-risk of degradation due to visitor use trends. Based on
   perceived service provisioning and degradation, areas of concern for
   recreational ecosystem service management were subsequently classified.
   Finally, sources and impacts of degradation for areas of concern were
   identified through a paired qualitative analysis of the spatial
   participatory mapping data. As a result, this manuscript outlines a new
   method of prioritizing areas for recreational ecosystem service
   management through an areas of concern analysis that examines the
   overlap of service provisioning areas and ecological and experiential
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Natural behaviorally important stimuli are combinations of cues that are
   integrated by the nervous system to elicit behavior. Nonetheless, these
   cues dynamically change in time and space. In turn, the animal's
   internal state can cause changes in the encoding and representation of
   these stimuli. Despite abundant behavioral examples, links between the
   neural bases of sensory integration and the internal state-dependency of
   these responses remains an active study area. Recent studies in
   different insect models have provided new insights into how plasticity
   and the insect's internal state may influence odor representation. These
   studies show that complex stimuli are represented in unique percepts
   that are different from their sensory channels and that the
   representations may be modulated by physiological state.}},

Title = {{Mixed integer programming for dynamic tower crane and storage area
   optimization on construction sites}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Construction site layout planning, the arrangement of temporary
   facilities and equipment on site, is a fundamental part of construction
   preparation. In construction, the operation of tower cranes has a great
   impact on construction process execution and preparation costs.
   Therefore, tower cranes should be chosen and placed such that they
   enable smooth construction processes at minimal cost. Since the majority
   of loads on site are transported either from or to a storage area, the
   transport routes taken between tower cranes and storage areas have a
   high impact. This paper presents a mathematical model that computes
   cost-optimal positions for both tower cranes and storage areas. The
   model consists of two linked mixed integer programs, allowing for the
   detailed quality assessment of the obtained solutions. Time dependency
   is considered by subdividing the construction process into several
   construction phases. Conditions on site and construction elements can be
   retrieved from a building information model. Particular advantages of
   our approach include the close approximation of complex shapes via
   convex hulls. Available positions on site are represented by a fine grid
   and calculated during runtime, which allows for freer placement instead
   of restricting to a fixed number of possible locations given as input.
   Using mixed integer programming offers tremendous modeling possibilities
   and a rigorous quality guarantee for the obtained solutions. In contrast
   to existing heuristic approaches, the returned solutions are provably
   optimal up to the chosen optimality gap. A case study is provided to
   demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Pre- and postoperative cognitive deficits have repeatedly
   been demonstrated in patients with glioblastoma (GBM).
   OBJECTIVE: To identify presurgical risk factors that facilitate the
   identification of GBM patients at risk for postoperative cognitive
   impairment.
   METHODS: Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment using Central
   Nervous System Vital Signs 1 d before (TO) and 3 mo after surgery (T3).
   Patients' standardized scores on 7 cognitive domains were compared to a
   normative sample using one-sample z tests. Reliable change indices with
   correction for practice effects were calculated to assess cognitive
   changes in individual patients over time. Logistic regression models
   were performed to assess presurgical sociodemographic, clinical,
   psychological, and cognitive risk factors for postoperative cognitive
   impairments.
   RESULTS: At T0, 208 patients were assessed, and 136 patients were
   retested at T3. Patients showed significantly lower performance both
   prior to and 3 mo after surgery on all cognitive domains compared to
   healthy controls. Improvements and declines over time occurred
   respectively in 11\% to 32\% and 6\% to 26\% of the GBM patients over
   the domains. The regression models showed that low preoperative
   cognitive performance posits a significant risk factor for postoperative
   cognitive impairment on all domains, and female sex was a risk factor
   for postoperative impairments in Visual Memory.
   CONCLUSION: We demonstrated preoperative cognitive riskfactors that
   enable the identification of GBM patients who are at risk for cognitive
   impairment 3 mo after surgery. This information can help to inform
   patients and clinicians at an early stage, and emphasizes the importance
   of recognizing, assessing, and actively dealing with cognitive
   functioning in the clinical management of GBM patients.}},

Title = {{Legacy iron and steel wastes in the UK: Extent, resource potential, and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The iron and steel industry has a long tradition of bulk reuse of slags
   for a range of construction applications. Growing interest in recent
   years has seen slag resource recovery options extend to critical raw
   material recovery and atmospheric carbon capture. Full scale deployment
   of such technologies is currently limited in part by absent or partial
   inventories of slag deposit locations, data on composition, and volume
   estimates in many jurisdictions. This paper integrates a range of
   spatial information to compile a database of iron and steel slag
   deposits in mainland United Kingdom (UK) for the first time and evaluate
   the associated resource potential. Over 190 million tonnes of legacy
   iron and steel slag are present across current and former iron and steel
   working regions of the UK, with particular concentrations in the north
   west and north east of England, and central Scotland. While significant
   potential stockpiles of blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace slag
   could provide up to 0.9 million tonnes of vanadium and a cumulative
   carbon dioxide capture potential of 57-138 million tonnes, major
   management challenges for resource recovery are apparent. Over one third
   are located in close proximity to designated conservation areas which
   may limit resource recovery. Furthermore, land use analyses show that
   many of the sites have already been redeveloped for housing (nearly 30\%
   urban cover). Deposits from recent decades in current or recently closed
   steel-working areas may have the greatest potential for resource
   recovery where such ambitions could be coupled with site restoration and
   regeneration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning of magnetic
   resonance (MR)-conditional cardiac implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) can be performed safely following
   specific protocols. MRI safety with cardiac resynchronization
   therapy-defibrillators (CRT-Ds) incorporating quadripolar left
   ventricular (LV) leads is less clear.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and
   effectiveness of ICDs and CRT-D systems with quadripolar LV leads after
   an MRI scan.
   METHODS The ENABLE MRI Study included 230 subjects implanted with a
   Boston Scientific ImageReady ICD (n = 39) or CRT-D (n = 191)
   incorporating quadripolar LV leads undergoing nondiagnostic 1.5-T MRI
   scans (lumbar and thoracic spine imaging) a minimum of 6 weeks
   postimplant. Pacing capture thresholds (PCTs), sensing amplitudes (SAs),
   and impedances were measured before and 1 month post-MRI using the same
   programmed LV pacing vectors. The ability to sense/treat ventricular
   fibrillation (VF) was assessed in a subset of patients.
   RESULTS A total of 159 patients completed a protocol-required MRI scan
   (MRI Protection Mode turned on) with no scan-related complications. All
   right ventricular (RV) and left LV PCT and SA effectiveness endpoints
   were met: RV PCT 99\% (145/146 patients), LV PCT 100\% (120/120), RV SA
   99\% (145/146), and LV SA 98\% (116/118). In no instances did MRI result
   in a change in pacing vector or lead revision. All episodes of VF were
   appropriately sensed and treated.
   CONCLUSION This first evaluation of predominantly CRT-D systems with
   quadripolar LV leads undergoing 1.5-T MRI confirmed that scanning was
   safe with no significant changes in RV/LV PCT, SA, programmed vectors,
   and VF treatment, thus suggesting that MRI in patients having a device
   with quadripolar leads can be performed without negative impact on CRT
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Regional rock art studies have provided insight into the role of caves
   in Maya ideology and worldview. In addition to the content of the
   imagery itself, the placement or siting of rock art with respect to
   natural and cultural features within the cave environment can reveal
   much about the function and meaning of cave use practices. This
   comparative analysis of rock art emphasizes contextual considerations
   with a discussion on the spatial and symbolic relationships between
   images in individual caves. Rock art in the northern Maya lowlands is
   commonly associated with watery areas and pathways leading to pools in
   caves. Across the northern Yucatan Peninsula, watery caves witnessed the
   rites and rituals of religious practitioners who appealed to the rain
   gods. Rock art scenes throughout this region were often devised and
   positioned in ways that reveal or are consistent with this unique and
   pervasive emphasis on rain and agricultural fertility in religious
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{In case of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear emergency,
   there are recommended or required behaviours to be adopted by the
   public, e.g. go inside, stay inside, stay informed. The initial response
   can be crucial to outcomes, all the while recognising that changes may
   be needed as the emergency progresses. The recent coronavirus pandemic
   demonstrated how the course of action taken by authorities endorsing
   these protective behaviours early on can save thousands of lives.
   Factors that determine response success include public compliance with
   authorities' recommendations and cooperation between experts and
   rescuers. In particular, the way rescuers perceive the risks of ionising
   radiation hazards will influence their preparedness to respond in case
   of a radiological or nuclear emergency. Having found no previous studies
   on radiological hazard and risk perception amongst rescuers in Portugal,
   mental models were used as a descriptive approach. The target groups
   were firefighters and the military formally trained to deal with
   radiation hazard emergencies. Their representations of radiological
   hazards and risks were analysed in the light of an expert model built ad
   hoc. The results show several overlays between experts and rescuers on
   the understanding of radiation hazards and potential risks. We conclude
   that the main gap between radiation risk perceptions by rescuers and
   experts involves the concepts and mechanisms of radiation contamination
   and its spread among individuals, in particular, if persons exposed to
   radioactive sources may also become a radioactive source themselves.
   This gap can have practical implications for an emergency response.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a nonlinear model reduction approach for
   reducing two commonly used nonlinear dynamical models of power grids:
   the effective network (EN) model and the synchronous motor (SM) model.
   Such models are essential in real-time security assessments of power
   grids. However, as power grids are often large-scale, it is necessary to
   reduce the models in order to utilize them in real-time. We reformulate
   the nonlinear power grid models as quadratic systems and reduce them
   using balanced truncation based on approximations of the reachability
   and observability Gramians. Finally, we present examples involving
   numerical simulation of reduced EN and SM models of the IEEE 57 bus and
   IEEE 118 bus systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is limited evidence on the survivorship of patients
   who undergo cementless stem implantation, beyond 20 years of the hip
   arthroplasty. We report implant survival and results of the CLS Spotorno
   femoral stem until 30 years from implantation.
   Methods: Survival analysis of 147 CLS Spotorno stems in 119 patients for
   an average period of 24 years (20-30) from the date of implantation was
   performed. During the course of the follow-up period, 33 patients (39
   hips) died. The information on the survival of their hip implant at the
   time of death was gathered from their relatives and general
   practitioners. Sixty-six patients (86 hips) undertook the complete
   survey along with radiographic examination, while 18 subjects (20 hips)
   were interviewed over the telephone. The factors influencing survival,
   functional outcomes, and level of satisfaction with surgery were
   evaluated.
   Results: The overall estimated survival of the stems was 89.9\% after 30
   years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 83.5-93.9). Survival with femoral
   revision for aseptic loosening as an end point was 93.1\% (95\% CI
   87.1-96.4). In the worst-case scenario, an overall implant survival of
   77.2\% (95 CI\% 80.3-82.7) was observed after 24 years. Patients who
   were older than 50 in age at the time of surgery had better survival
   rates (P = .026). The mean Harris Hip Score at follow-up was 83.1 (range
   43-100) and the level of satisfaction was 9/10. The main determinant of
   postsurgical satisfaction was Harris Hip Score, whereas radiographic
   alterations explained little with respect to the variation in the
   outcomes.
   Conclusion: The cementless CLS Spotorno stem displayed satisfactory
   results 24 years after implantation and high estimated survival until 30
   years from surgery. However, patients below the age of 50 at the time of
   surgery have an increased risk of undergoing revision of their femoral
   stem. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Geochemistry and geological control of Sonora obsidian: New insights
   into the provenance study of archaeological obsidians in Mexico}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Obsidian artifacts found in thirteen archaeological localities of Sonora
   show a petrological relationship with rhyolitic outcrops scattered in
   various geological localities (El Pinacate, Sierra Libre, Sierra El
   Aguaje, Hermosillo, Babidanchi and Sierra Los Mochos). X-Ray
   Fluorescence geochemical analysis of a group of 133 samples was done,
   including archaeological artifacts, as well as geological samples and
   anhydrous cores (raw material-lithic nodules) coming from both
   geological outcrops and archaeological sites. The geochemical data were
   compared with reference sample values from known primary obsidian
   knowing outcrops that also were analyzed by conventional techniques of
   ICP and XRF previously published. Geochemical results can be integrated
   into two large groups of obsidian from Sonora, and their spatial
   distribution holds a direct relation with the geological origin of
   perlitic outcrops. The first group corresponds to Oligocene rhyolites
   from the Sierra Madre Occidental. The second group correlates with
   Middle-Late Miocene rhyolites is associated to the Proto-Gulf of
   California development. Archaeologically, a distinct temporal sequence
   was identified as concerning its use according to the cultural areas in
   which they were found. The geological studies on obsidian sources help
   us to understand, on the one hand, the origin of perlitic landforms,
   their spatial situation and, on the other hand, to have a measurable
   comparative reference, that contributed to know the cultural extension
   of its indigenous use over time, as well as the reach of the social
   interaction networks, flaking techniques and use of specific artifact
   types. Finally, the integration of their geological control and
   geochemical characteristics allowed us to establish a reliable base to
   achieve provenance interpretations of obsidian lithic complexes in
   Sonora. All elements described here represent the obsidian phenomenon in
   Sonora and have an affinity with obsidian sources of NW Mexico, which
   provides a unique identity that needs to be located in the context of
   the interdisciplinary research of lithic in Mexico and SW United States.}},

Title = {{Dealignment: Class in Britain and Class in British Sociology Since 1945}},
Journal = {{SOCIETIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper sets changes in Britain's class structure since 1945
   alongside the parallel sociological controversies about class. Since the
   1970s, the class scheme developed by John Goldthorpe and colleagues for
   initial use in their study of social mobility in Britain has become
   sociology's standard template for thinking about and researching class.
   Versions have been adopted by the UK government and the European Union
   as their official socio-economic classifications. This paper does not
   dispute that the Goldthorpe scheme is still the best available for
   classifying by occupation, or that occupation remains our best single
   indicator of class, or that a constant class scheme must be used if the
   purpose is to measure trends over time in rates of relative
   inter-generational mobility. Despite these merits, it is argued that the
   sociological gaze has been weakened by failing to represent changes over
   time in the class structure itself and, therefore, how class is
   experienced in lay people's lives. There has been a relative neglect of
   absolute social mobility flows (which have changed over time), and a
   pre-occupation with the inter-generational and a relative neglect of
   intra-career mobilities and immobilities.}},

Abstract = {{Companies often engage in prosocial initiatives-such as employee
   volunteering programs-as a way to balance their economic goals with a
   set of social goals. In an attempt to expand the impact of such
   programs, some companies have begun soliciting help from their customers
   as well. Given the significant investment these programs represent, it
   is important that companies understand whether they offer the
   anticipated social and economic returns. Using multimethod data from a
   local microbrewery, we develop and test theory about the reputational
   implications of customers' involvement in a corporate community
   engagement initiative. Our results suggest that customers' engagement in
   such initiatives is related to positive views of the organization (i.e.,
   corporate reputation), as well as positive customer behaviors-brewery
   patronage and purchases-two years later. Moreover, it appears that
   customers spread this sentiment to others-creating the potential for an
   even broader audience to see the company as reputable and, in turn,
   provide support.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the darker side of care as depicted in Leila
   Slimani's Chanson douce (2016), an important aspect of the carer-caree
   relationship that has been much less documented than the positive nature
   of care-giving.The article traces the nanny's trajectory through
   different stages of care from early feelings of attachment and devotion
   to a point of crushing fear, unmanageable anxiety and overwhelming
   exhaustion, which then leads her onto a path of incremental abuse.
   Rather than focusing on the actual crime committed (infanticide), the
   article endeavours to understand the nanny's personal circumstances and
   the way in which they inflect her care-giving and ultimately steer it
   towards a deviant turn.The overall aim of the article is to demonstrate
   that the reality of care is much more complex than one might realize
   (especially when it is caught up in the gruelling ideals of perfect
   motherhood) and more often than not co-exists alongside various forms of
   abuse, which in the case of Chanson douce, culminate in tragedy.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmic rays may have contributed to the start of life on the Earth.
   Here, we investigate the evolution of the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum
   at the Earth from ages t = 0.6-6.0Gyr. We use a 1D cosmic ray transport
   model and a 1.5D stellar wind model to derive the evolving wind
   properties of a solar-type star. At t = 1 Gyr, approximately when life
   is thought to have begun on the Earth, we find that the intensity of
   similar to GeV Galactic cosmic rays would have been similar to 10 times
   smaller than the present-day value. At lower kinetic energies, Galactic
   cosmic ray modulation would have been even more severe. More generally,
   we find that the differential intensity of low-energy Galactic cosmic
   rays decreases at younger ages and is well described by a broken power
   law in solar rotation rate. We provide an analytic formula of our
   Galactic cosmic ray spectra at the Earth's orbit for different ages. Our
   model is also applicable to other solar-type stars with exoplanets
   orbiting at different radii. Specifically, we use our Galactic cosmic
   ray spectrum at 20 au for t = 600 Myr to estimate the penetration of
   cosmic rays in the atmosphere of HR2562b, a directly imaged exoplanet
   orbiting a young solar-type star. We find that the majority of particles
   <0.1 GeV are attenuated at pressures greater than or similar to 10(-5)
   bar and thus do not reach altitudes below similar to 100 km.
   Observationally constraining the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum in the
   atmosphere of a warm Jupiter would in turn help constrain the flux of
   cosmic rays reaching young Earth-like exoplanets.}},

   Forward Osmosis}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the last few years, forward osmosis (FO) has attracted increasing
   interest as a sustainable technique for water desalination and
   wastewater treatment. However, FO remains as an immature process
   principally due to the lack of efficient and easily recyclable draw
   solutes. In this work, we report that ionosilica hydrogels based on
   quaternary ammonium halide ionosilica are efficient draw solutes in FO.
   Fluidic ionosilica hydrogels were obtained via
   hydrolysis-polycondensation reactions of a trisilylated quaternary
   ammonium precursor in slightly acidic water/ethanol solvent mixtures.
   The liquid-to-gel transition of the precursor and the kinetics of the
   formation of hydrogels were monitored by liquid NMR measurements. The
   formed hydrogels were shown to generate osmotic pressure up to 10.0 atm,
   indicating the potential of these hydrogels as efficient draw solutes in
   FO. Our results suggest that iodide anions are the osmotically active
   species in the system. Regeneration of the hydrogels via ultrafiltration
   (UF) was successfully achieved, allowing the development of a closed
   FO-UF process. However, the osmotic performances of the ionosilica
   hydrogels irreversibly decreased along the successive FO-UF cycles,
   probably due to anion exchange processes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Author summary
   SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple animal species, including humans. Like many
   other viruses, the first step in its infection cycle is the interaction
   between a viral protein and a receptor protein on the host cell
   membrane. Characterizing the three-dimensional structure of such protein
   interactions, at the atomic level, is very important to understand the
   infection process, to help develop therapeutics against it, and to
   predict which other animal species are at risk. Experimentally, this
   characterization is usually difficult, expensive, and not applicable on
   a large scale. Here, we show that computational modeling can fill in
   some of the gaps, namely provide a structural framework to explain why
   humans are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while mice and chicken
   are not. Our models also map, with reasonable accuracy, key amino acids
   of the host receptor, which can help guide the development of antiviral
   therapeutics. Our work serves as a blueprint for studying viral-host
   protein interactions using computational modeling, providing a quick and
   inexpensive complement to experiments, and benefits both our basic
   understanding of viral infections and drug development.
   Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
   responsible for the ongoing global pandemic that has infected more than
   31 million people in more than 180 countries worldwide. Like other
   coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans
   from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical
   distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of
   cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this
   transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features
   distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we
   investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound
   to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be
   susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in
   several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged
   contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to
   predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2
   variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a
   blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights
   several important considerations when designing these computational
   studies and analyzing their results.}},

   and replacement of the removable partial (B) and total (D) prostheses.
   Yeasts were genotyped using DNA microsatellite markers. Microbiological
   methods were used to screen for azole antifungal resistance and
   exoenzyme production. In the initial sampling, oral colonization by
   Candida was observed in 31 (53.4\%) subjects in groups A (33.3\%), B
   (68.2\%), and D (65\%); 20 (47.6\%) subjects displayed colonization of
   prostheses: groups B (50\%) and D (45\%). The second sampling (+/- 30
   days) revealed Candida in 2 (3.4\%: oral cavity) and 4 (6.9\%:
   prosthetic) subjects from group B. C. albicans and C. dubliniensis
   displayed both polyclonal and monoclonal patterns of infection.
   Azole-resistant C. albicans and SAPs(+) strains were prevalent. Related
   strains were found in one or several oral sites (mucosa and prosthesis),
   as well as intra- and inter-subject, -gender, -group, and -time of
   sampling. However, the patterns of clonality can be altered under dental

Abstract = {{In this study, insecticide resistance and the mechanisms responsible
   were characterized in Ae. aegypti of Boyeros municipality from Havana,
   Cuba. Boyeros represents a high epidemiological risk because it is
   located near the Havana International Airport, it is highly urbanized,
   and it has a large influx of people from endemic countries so that it
   qualifies as a sentinel site for surveillance. The larvae collected from
   five areas of this municipality showed resistance to temephos associated
   with metabolic enzymes. The adult mosquitoes displayed a deltamethrin
   resistance and less distinctly to other pyrethroids associated with a
   high frequency of sodium channel gene mutations (F1534C and V1016I),
   detected for the first time in a field population from Cuba. The
   presence in the field populations of two insecticide resistance
   mechanisms represents a limiting factor in the success of the control
   operations of this vector, so other strategies should be considered to
   preserve the effectiveness of the insecticides available in public
   health for vector control in Cuba.}},

   30\%, respectively) and interception (11 and 9\%, respectively). Runoff
   was five times higher in the cropland compared to the dry forest (10 vs.
   2\%; p < 0.01). Deep drainage was a negligible water flux in dry forests
   but it represented 4\% of annual rainfall in croplands (p < 0.01),
   reaching values of zero and 130 mm year(-1) for dry and wet years,
   respectively. Our results highlight the key role of vegetation cover
   controlling ecosystem water fluxes in the Dry Chaco. More generally, we
   suggest that the expansion of dryland cultivation can modify the
   regional water balance and threaten the primary production of ecosystems
   in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, creatine kinase and transaminases are
   released into the circulation, indicating muscle injury. Their
   usefulness in monitoring muscle injury or disease progression has not
   yet been fully evaluated. Thus, this study examined serum creatine
   kinase and transaminase concentrations at different ages in patients
   with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and evaluated their association with
   muscle injury. Design
   This is a prospective cohort study that included 110 patients with
   Duchenne muscular dystrophy categorized by age groups. Creatine kinase
   and transaminases were quantified in the serum; the Vignos scale
   evaluated the muscle function. Results
   Creatine kinase and transaminase levels were higher in ambulatory than
   that in nonambulatory patients, which significantly decreased as age
   increased. Serum creatine kinase and transaminase concentrations were
   elevated in all ages, and those aged 3-4 yrs had the highest
   concentrations. Age and Vignos Scale were significantly correlated with
   creatine kinase and transaminase concentrations. Age, creatine kinase,
   and transaminases explained the 42.5\% of loss of muscle function.
   Conclusions
   This study added the knowledge on the natural history of Duchenne
   muscular dystrophy at different ages and confirmed that creatine kinase
   and transaminases decrease with age and loss of muscle function, making
   them generally inappropriate for monitoring response to therapy,
   although they are useful for the clinical diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of the use of two autochthonous starter
   cultures (Lactobacillus sakei LS131 + Staphylococcus equorum SA25 (EQU),
   or L. sakei LS131 + Staphylococcus saprophyticus SB12 (SAP)) on the
   physicochemical, microbiological, proteolytic and lipolytic changes
   taking place during the manufacture of Galician chorizo, a traditional
   Spanish sausage, was studied. Three different batches (control (CNT),
   EQU and SAP) were manufactured in triplicate and analysed during the
   manufacturing process (samples were taken and analysed at 0, 2, 5, 9,
   14, 21 and 30 days of ripening) for proximate composition, pH, a(w),
   colour parameters, nitrogen fractions, free amino acids, biogenic
   amines, fat parameters and free fatty acids. The use of either of these
   two starter cultures slightly but significantly reduced the pH values
   during the fermentation and increased the percentage of transformation
   to nitrosyl-heme pigments as well as the a{*} and b{*} values in the
   final products. The two starters significantly decreased the
   Enterobacteriaceae counts in the final product, but without this
   microbial group completely disappearing. Both starter cultures
   significantly increased the alpha-amino acidic nitrogen and the total
   basic volatile nitrogen fractions during manufacturing, also increasing
   the free amino acid content and reducing the total biogenic amine
   content by approximately 20\%. The SAP starter enhanced the lipolytic
   processes, increasing the free fatty acid content. Due to their
   performances, these two starter cultures seem to be suitable for
   increasing the quality and safety of the Galician chorizo sausage.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Complications of cirrhosis are the main cause of
   hospital admissions in liver units. In areas where HCV is prevalent,
   most of these admissions are attributable to HCV-related cirrhosis
   (HCV-cirrhosis). This study assessed the impact of direct-acting
   antivirals (DAA) in the profile of patients with liver disease admitted
   to a referral liver unit from a university hospital.
   Methods: We registered hospital admissions resulting from cirrhosis to
   the Liver Unit of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, from 2011 to 2014
   (pre-DAA period) and from 2015 to 2019 (post-DAA period).
   Results: From a total of 14,865 hospital admissions, 10,053 resulted
   from cirrhosis (corresponding to 6,272 patients). The number and
   proportion of hospital admissions because of HCV-cirrhosis remained
   stable during the period 2011-2014 (525 per year, 48.8\% of the total),
   but decreased progressively after 2015 (p <0.001), reaching <300
   (27.1\%) admissions in 2019. Similarly, HCV-cirrhosis accounted for
   3,885 inpatient days per year (44.9\%) during the pre-DAA period and
   decreased steadily after 2015 (p >0.001), reaching only 1,909 inpatient
   days (22\%) in 2019. The figures for intensive care unit admissions
   followed a similar pattern. By means of a slope analysis (binomial
   regression model), we predicted that HCV-cirrhosis hospital admissions
   will be residual by 2025 (2.3\%, 95\% CI 0-10.9\%). By contrast, we
   observed a significant increase in hospital admissions because of
   metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (5-fold) and autoimmune
   hepatitis (4-fold) during the study period.
   Conclusions: In summary, our data showed a profound reduction in
   HCV-cirrhosis hospitalisation burden since 2015, coincident with the
   wide use of DAAs in Spain. Our predictions suggest that, by 2025,
   HCV-cirrhosis will be a marginal cause of hospital admissions for
   patients with liver disease.
   Lay summary: Over the past few years, the wide use of antiviral drugs
   that cure HCV has had a significant effect on patients being admitted to
   hospital. Most patients with HCV and cirrhosis are treated (and often
   cured) in the community and, thus, the number of hospital admissions
   because of severe forms of HCV has decreased drastically. HCV is no
   longer the first cause of admission into liver units and, in only a few
   years from now, it is likely to be only a residual cause of
   hospitalisation. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Abstract = {{The human genome encodes five RecQ helicases (RECQL1, BLM, WRN, RECQL4,
   and RECQL5) that participate in various processes underpinning genomic
   stability. Of these enzymes, the disease-associated RECQL4 is
   comparatively understudied due to a variety of technical challenges.
   However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a functional homolog of RECQL4
   called , which is more amenable to experimentation and has recently been
   shown to be involved in DNA inter-strand crosslink (ICL) repair and
   telomere maintenance. To expand our understanding of and the RecQ4
   subfamily of helicases in general, we took a multi-omics approach to
   define the interactome in yeast. Using synthetic genetic array analysis,
   we found that mutations of genes involved in processes such as DNA
   repair, chromosome segregation, and transcription synthetically interact
   with deletion of and the catalytically inactive -K318A allele. Pull-down
   of tagged and mass spectrometry identification of interacting partners
   similarly underscored links to these processes and others. Focusing on
   transcription, we found that mutant cells are sensitive to caffeine and
   that mutation of alters the expression levels of hundreds of genes. In
   the case of -K318A, several of the most highly upregulated genes encode
   proteins of unknown function whose expression levels are also increased
   by DNA ICL damage. Together, our results suggest a heretofore
   unrecognized role for in transcription, as well as novel members of the
   ICL repair pathway. These data expand our understanding of RecQ4
   subfamily helicase biology and help to explain why mutations in human
   RECQL4 cause diseases of genomic instability.}},

   attitude (66.4\%), and only a minority of them (38.2\%) had a poor
   practice of prophetic food consumption. Based on Independent t-test and
   One-Way ANOVA statistical test, there was a significant difference in
   the mean attitude scores between male and female students, mean attitude
   and practice scores between the three age groups, mean knowledge scores
   between the three fields of study groups, and mean knowledge, attitude,
   and practice scores between the four religions. A positive correlation
   was observed for the three domains, namely between knowledge and
   attitude (r = 0.71), knowledge and practice (rho = 0.37), and attitude
   and practice (rho = 0.43), based on Spearman or Pearson correlation
   test. In conclusion, the importance of prophetic food must be
   highlighted and shared among multi-religious university students for
   them to be more familiar with the relevant health and sustainability
   issues. The students may employ effective attitude and behaviour towards
   the practical implementation of prophetic food if they are provided with
   more integrated knowledge in the learning environment of the university.

Abstract = {{Onchocerca lupi is a parasitic filarioid and the causative agent of
   canine ocular onchocercosis, a zoonotic disease of domestic dogs with
   sporadic reports in humans. A 13-year-old dog with no travel history
   outside of Israel was presented to an ophthalmology veterinary clinic in
   Israel with severe right ocular and periocular disease. After surgical
   exploration, thin helminths were removed from the dorsal sclera of the
   eye and identified as Onchocerca lupi by polymerase chain reaction
   according to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1), reduced
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) and 12S
   rRNA genes. Phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks of the cox1 and
   nad5 genes confirmed the circulation of two genotypes: genotype 1 with
   worms from dogs, cats and humans from both the Old and New Worlds, and
   genotype 2 with specimens from Portugal and Spain. The Israeli sequences
   clustered in genotype 1 and were identical to O. lupi from the USA.
   Evidence of two genotypes separated geographically sheds light on the
   phylogeography and evolution of this zoonotic pathogen, and suggests a
   diverse pathology observed in different regions of the world.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Different graphene surfaces have been proposed for modifying drug
   delivery of mesalazine as drug model. The adsorption of the drug on
   pristine graphene and functionalized graphene with amino group and
   amino-carboxyl groups were analyzed at the level of the functional
   density theory (DFT). Conclusive results were observed regarding the
   advantage of using the functionalized graphene surface with
   amino-carboxyl groups due to its greater stability in the adsorption
   energy compared to the lower energies obtained for pristine and amine
   functionalized graphene. The major changes in adsorption can be
   attributed to the changes in HOMO-LUMO orbitals of mesalazine specie at
   basic pH, and the decreased gap between valence-conduction bands on the
   bifunctionalized graphene DOS spectrum that facilitate the interactions
   between the drug and graphene surface.}},

Abstract = {{Amsterdam is a culturally rich city attracting millions of tourists.
   Popular activities in Amsterdam consist of museum visits and boat tours.
   By strategically combining them, this paper presents an innovative
   approach using waterborne autonomous vehicles (WAVs) to improve the
   museum visitation in Amsterdam. Multi-source urban data including I
   Amsterdam card data and Instagram hashtags are used to reveal museum
   characteristics such as offline and online popularity of museums and
   visitation patterns. A multi-objective model is proposed to optimize WAV
   routes by considering museum characteristics and travel experiences. An
   experiment in the Amsterdam Central area was conducted to evaluate the
   viability of employing WAVs. By comparing WAVs with land transportation,
   the results demonstrate that WAVs can enhance travel experience to
   cultural destinations. The presented innovative WAVs can be extended to
   a larger variety of points of interest in cities. These findings provide
   useful insights on embracing artificial intelligence in urban tourism.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, with the increasing global need for sustainable
   development, ecotourism has emerged as one of the most efficient
   activities that can be used to reconcile economic development with
   environmental conservation. A growing interest in the ecotourism and
   ecosystem services provided by landscapes makes such services
   increasingly necessary within municipal planning processes. This study
   aims to construct a geoenvironmental model based on geographic
   information systems (GISs) to spatially identify areas with greater
   capacity to promote ecotourism, with a practical case study of the city
   of Brotas, Brazil. The model can produce an integrated analysis of
   landscape components using geoenvironmental, topographic, and urban
   data. As a result, four zones were classified according to their
   ecotourism potential, with 81\% of the overall local territory showing
   great potential, which not only reinforces the territory's resilience
   regarding sustainable development, but also demonstrates that ecotourism
   should be included in discussions related to environmental planning in
   Brotas, as well as in other municipalities that have ecotourism
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic and preventive and compulsory social isolation
   (PCSI) have generated changes in the organization and use of the health
   system around the world. We analyze the impact of the health situation
   on the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations and access to
   revascularization therapy for cerebrovascular disease. The period from
   March 1 to July 31, 2020 was analyzed. It was compared with the same
   period in 2019. Total outpatient and hospital visits were evaluated,
   NIHSS scale (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) upon admission,
   type of cerebrovascular disease and use of revascularization therapies;
   197 patients with acute cerebrovascular events were admitted in 2019 and
   150 patients in 2020. There was a significant decrease in the number of
   hospitalizations for total ischemic events and transient ischemic
   attacks in the comparison of 5 months. An increase in cerebral venous
   thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhages was also seen. Access to intravenous
   fibrinolysis and mechanical thrombectomy remained stable, but with
   prolonged door-to-needle time. Outpatient visits fell 67\%, the decrease
   being greater in April and more marked in follow-up visits. The number
   of hospitalizations and outpatient visits during the PCSI dropped
   substantially. This seems to be due to strict compliance with quarantine
   and not to pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID-19. The
   population should be educated about the need to control chronic diseases
   and acute events and safety measures should be guaranteed in health

   Resulting in Low N2O Soil Emissions and Limited Effectiveness of
   Nitrification Inhibitors}},
Journal = {{SOIL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and drained
   tropical/subtropical wetland soils that are high in carbon (C) make a
   substantial contribution to global anthropogenic N2O emissions. However,
   we previously reported negligible N2O emissions from an acidic, C-rich
   Gleysol under aerobic rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in the
   subtropics despite ample moisture and fertiliser nitrogen (N). In a
   field experiment, seasonal cumulative N2O emissions in the field
   following the application of 90 kg ha(-1) N as urea were low (0.15 kg
   N2O-N ha(-1)center dot season(-1)). An incubation study examining the
   effects of temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and
   water-filled pore space (WFPS; 40\% vs. 60\%) on N transformations
   showed that incubation temperature had a larger influence on
   nitrification than WFPS (40\% vs. 60\%). There was limited nitrification
   at 20 degrees C at either WFPS over 30 days, but low concentrations of
   NO3- (<100 mg kg(-1)) began to accumulate between 16-23 days at 30
   degrees C and between 23-30 days at 25 degrees C. Liming soil resulted
   in nitrification after 10 days, while only minor nitrification was
   evident in the unlimed soil. The presence of the nitrification inhibitor
   3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) with urea delayed nitrification
   for up to 4 days in the limed soil, suggesting such inhibitors may not
   provide substantial benefits in high C soils. Our results suggest that a
   low soil pH contributes to impaired nitrification in the C-rich Gleysol
   examined, which is associated with low fluxes of N2O in the field. We
   suggest that soil pH could potentially be manipulated to sustain low
   rates of nitrification and lower N losses, without compromising crop
   growth.}},

Title = {{Prenatal alcohol exposure reduces posterior dorsomedial striatum
   excitability and motivation in a sex- and age-dependent fashion}},
Journal = {{NEUROPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-induced clinical symptoms have been
   widely reported but effective treatments are not yet available due to
   our limited knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms underlying behavioral
   outputs. Operant behaviors, including both goal-directed and habitual
   actions, are essential for everyday life. The dor-somedial striatum
   (DMS) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) have been identified as
   mediating each type of instrumental behavior, respectively. The current
   studies were designed to evaluate the effects of PAE (i.e., 3 g/kg,
   twice a day on gestational days 17-20) on goal-directed vs. habitual
   behaviors in both females and males during their adolescent and adult
   stages. We found that PAE-treated adult, but not adolescent, males
   display similar habitual oral sucrose self-administration but reduced
   goal-directed sucrose self-administration, compared to those treated by
   prenatal control (water) exposure (PCE). There were no differences in
   either habitual or goal directed sucrose taking between PCEvs.
   PAE-treated adolescent and adult females. These results indicate sex and
   age-specific effects of PAE on operant behaviors. Further, whole-cell
   patch clamp recordings showed that the excitability of medium-sized
   spiny neurons (MSNs) in the posterior DMS (pDMS), but not the anterior
   DMS (aDMS), was significantly decreased in PAE-treated adult male rats.
   Notably, chemogenetic enhancement of MSN excitability in the pDMS by the
   DREADD agonist, compound 21, rescued the motivation of PAE-treated male
   adult rats. These data suggest that the pDMS may be a key neuronal
   substrate mediating the PAE-induced low motivation in male adults.}},

Title = {{Deagrarianisation of the Economic Structure and the Evolution of Rural
   Settlement Patterns in Poland}},
Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Since the Second World War, Poland has been undergoing an intensive
   process of transformation of the economic structure of rural areas,
   manifested, among other things, in the change in the occupational
   make-up of its inhabitants. The development of non-agricultural methods
   of management in rural areas has led to the emergence of multifunctional
   rural areas, where the role of agriculture as a source of income for the
   inhabitants is decreasing. There is a process of deagrarianisation of
   the economic structure, which has been indicated by many researchers as
   an unavoidable process, connected with the changes taking place in rural
   areas. One of the effects of this process are changes in rural
   settlement patterns. The aim of this article is to present the spatial
   effects of the deagrarianisation process in the Polish countryside,
   expressed in the changes in the rural settlement network. The authors
   used the statistical database of the Central Statistical Office (over 41
   thousand records) to draw up the classification of rural areas by the
   nature of changes in population numbers in the period 1950-2011, which
   was compared with the research carried out as part of the Monitoring of
   Rural Development in Poland. The study confirmed that the factor behind
   the evolution of the rural settlement network is the process of
   decreasing agricultural demand for labour. As a consequence, there is a
   polarisation of localities into multifunctional rural localities, mainly
   headquarter villages and local government offices, and those with a
   predominantly agricultural function. On a supra-local scale, a process
   of polarisation of rural areas between a growing suburban population and
   a reducing peripheral location around large and medium-sized towns has
   been observed.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the deadliest cancers, owing in
   part to complex inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the presence of
   a population of stem-like cells called brain tumour stem cells
   (BTSCs/BTICs). These cancer stem cells survive treatment and confer
   resistance to the current therapies - namely, radiation and the
   chemotherapeutic, temozolomide (TMZ). TMZ induces cell death by
   alkylating DNA, and BTSCs resist this mechanism via a robust DNA damage
   response. Hence, recent studies aimed to sensitize BTSCs to TMZ using
   combination therapy, such as inhibition of DNA repair machinery. We have
   previously demonstrated in established GBM cell lines that eukaryotic
   initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) promotes the translation of pro-survival
   and anti-apoptotic proteins. Consequently, silencing eIF5B sensitizes
   these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, established cell lines
   do not always recapitulate the features of human glioma Therefore, we
   investigated this mechanism in patient-derived BTSCs. We show that
   silencing eIF5B leads to increased TMZ sensitivity in two BTSC lines:
   BT25 and BT48. Depletion of eIF5B decreases the levels of anti-apoptotic
   proteins in BT48 and sensitizes these cells to TMZ-induced activation of
   caspase-3, cleavage of PARP, and apoptosis. We suggest that eIF5B
   represents a rational target to sensitize GBM tumors to the current
   standard-of-care.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{63}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effectiveness of social and economic recovery of a society damaged
   by major disasters is significantly interrelated with pace of
   reconstruction of transportation infrastructures. If not managed
   delicately, post-disaster reconstruction of transportation
   infrastructures often encounters barriers that result in unexpected
   delays. An understanding of the impacts of barriers and adoption of
   mitigating strategies are required to successfully mitigate the adverse
   consequences of these barriers. In this study, (1) barriers to timely
   reconstruction of transportation infrastructures after natural disasters
   were identified; (2) strategies for alleviating the adverse impacts of
   each barrier were developed, and (3) preventive and corrective
   strategies were developed. A thorough literature review was performed,
   and semi-structured interviews were conducted with subject matter
   experts (SMEs) to identify the barriers. A total of 14 potential
   barriers were identified and validated, and 26 mitigating strategies
   were developed and classified into categories of governance and
   planning, resource allocation and management, coordination and
   cooperation, and awareness enhancement. The strategies were then
   classified into preventive and corrective groups, based on their time of
   implementation. The results of the interviews showed that the SMEs
   considered resource allocation and management as the most important
   category. In addition, they indicated that resource management plays a
   key role in achieving effective reconstruction of transportation
   infrastructures. This research offers a foundation for further advancing
   studies on post-disaster reconstruction of transportation
   infrastructures. In addition, timely implementation of identified
   strategies will enhance effectiveness of reconstruction of
   disaster-affected areas.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, the results of the conductometric work of the
   complexation reaction of Kryptofix5 (Scheme 1) with Al3+, Cu2+, Ca2+,
   and Fe3+ cations are studied in acetonitrile-ethanol (AN-EtOH) binary
   non-aqueous solvents. In all cases, the achieved results reveal that the
   stoichiometry of the complexes formed between the ligand and Al3+, Cu2+,
   Ca2+, and Fe3+ metal cations is 1 : 1 {[}ML] complex. GENPLOT (the
   computer program) calculates the stability constants of complexes of
   (Kryptofix5 center dot M)(n+). The selectivity order of Kryptofix5
   ligand for the studied metal cations in pure AN and AN-EtOH (AN = 50 mol
   \% ) binary mixed solvent at 15 degrees C is found to be Ca2+ > Fe3+ >
   Cu2+ > Al3+ and Cu2+ > Fe3+ > Ca2+ > Al3+, respectively. As a result,
   the selectivity order of the ligand for the metal cations shows
   independence from the nature and composition of the mixed binary
   solvent. By using the Van't Hoff plots, the thermodynamic parameters
   (Delta-H-c degrees, Delta S-c degrees) value for 1 : 1 complexes are
   calculated from the temperature due to the stability constants of the
   complexes. The achieved findings reveal that the thermodynamics of the
   complexation reaction is affected by the nature and composition of the
   mixed solvents, and the complexation processes entropy and enthalpy are
   stabilized in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the design of a new building it is essential that all
   involved stakeholders understand, communicate, participate, and
   collaborate with each other to acquire a high-quality result. To support
   these shared and creative design processes, this paper presents the
   design and evaluation of virtual collaborative design environment
   (ViCoDE)-a new collaborative design system. ViCoDE features seamless
   integration of several immersive VR systems and a multitouch table that
   facilitates collaborative and interactive design work with immediate
   feedback. The evaluation of the system has been done during two
   real-life collaborative design workshops in a context of designing new
   healthcare environments. The results show that the VR system and
   multitouch table complement each other very well by facilitating both
   collaborative, and individual design spaces-and that it fosters better
   understanding, participation, communication, knowledge sharing, and
   collaboration among the different stakeholders. The contribution is
   two-fold: presentation of a new collaborative design system and the
   evaluation of its use in a real-life design context, which demonstrate
   how these new technology-based workshops may facilitate design
   management. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Why psychiatry is different-challenges and difficulties in managing a

Abstract = {{Objective Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was officially declared a
   pandemic in March 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 are nosocomial, but to
   the best of our knowledge, no nosocomial outbreaks on psychiatric
   departments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Europe. The different nature of
   psychiatry makes outbreak management more difficult. This study
   determines which psychiatry specific factors contributed to a nosocomial
   outbreak taking place in a psychiatric department. This will provide
   possible interventions in future outbreak management. Method A case
   series describing a nosocomial outbreak in a psychiatric department of
   an acute care hospital in the Netherlands between March 13, 2020 and
   April, 14 2020. The outbreak was analyzed by combining data from
   standardized interviews, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and whole
   genome sequencing (WGS). Results The nosocomial outbreak in which 43\%
   of staff of the psychiatric department and 19\% of admitted patients
   were involved, was caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW
   transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission. We
   identified four aspects associated with the mental health care system
   which might have made our department more susceptible to an outbreak.
   Conclusions Infection control measures designed for hospitals are not
   directly applicable to psychiatric departments. Psychiatric patients
   should be considered a high-risk group for infectious diseases and
   customized measures should be designed and implemented. Extra attention
   for psychiatric departments is necessary during a pandemic as
   psychiatric HCWs are less familiar with outbreak management. Clear
   communication and governance is crucial in correctly implementing these
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Non-cancer and cancer health risks to humans associated with respirable
   particulate matter <= 10 mu m (PM10) in an indoor microenvironment such
   as a subway cabin are currently a public concern. In this study,
   detailed investigations of human health risks due to PM10-bound metals
   in a subway cabin were conducted for the first time. Cancer risks (CRs)
   were estimated for inhalation exposure (CRinh) using a Monte Carlo
   probability density function and were compared with incremental lifetime
   CRs (ILCRs). Moreover, the percentage contributions of each metal to the
   risk levels were calculated to identify the elements potentially
   responsible for human health risks. The significant (>1) for non-CRs
   levels as HI (hazard index) was estimated for children and adults for
   all types of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal). Pb, Cr, and
   Ni were recognized as the foremost contributors to the HQ (hazard
   quotient) levels for all types of exposure. For subway commuters, the
   CRinh and ILCR levels for adults were marginally higher than the
   satisfactory maximum point of confinement of the lifetime carcinogenic
   risk level (1 x 10(-5)) where as CRinh for children was within the
   acceptable limit (1 x 10(-6)-1 x 10(-5)). Cr was identified as the
   predominant carcinogenic element, with 91\% contribution to the total CR
   level in the subway cabin on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A major barrier to achieving wide-spread progress on planning for
   impacts from climate change is the lack of trained scientists skilled at
   conducting societally-relevant research. Overcoming this barrier
   requires us to transform the way we train scientists so they are
   equipped to work with a range of different societal partners and
   institutions to produce the science needed to address climate change and
   society's other pressing environmental challenges. As researchers at
   climate research organizations that work directly with decision-makers
   and stakeholders to produce decision-relevant science, we are entrenched
   in advancing actionable climate science. Based on our experience
   preparing scientists for similar careers, we offer a perspective on a
   path for the academy to better develop, train and support scientists to
   conduct societally relevant research. We emphasize the need for science
   training that builds collaborative science skills at different career
   stages to develop a strong community of practice around actionable
   climate science. We offer insights from our training and
   capacity-building programs to demonstrate this transformation, and point
   to strategies that can be adopted at other universities to grow the
   capacity of scientists to support society in achieving rapid progress on

Title = {{Fair accessibility - Operationalizing the distributional effects of
   policy interventions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A fair distribution of public transport benefits is a commonly stated
   goal of agencies and operators of public transport. However, it is less
   complicated and costly to provide accessibility in some parts of cities
   and their surroundings than in other parts. Densely populated areas, and
   areas situated closer to the city center therefore often have higher
   public transport accessibility than remote or sparsely populated areas.
   Neglecting these realities results with an unrealistic assessment of
   equity in service provision and hampers their consideration when setting
   policy goals. In this study, we propose a framework for investigating
   equity in the distribution of accessibility, where the suggested goal is
   to provide residents with equal accessibility for equally dense and
   central areas. For the Stockholm County, we show that accessibility may
   seem to be distributed horizontally inequitable and vertically
   regressive. However, once controlling for how dense and close to the
   city center residents live, while still being horizontally inequitable
   the distribution of accessibility in Stockholm County is found
   progressive, i.e., benefiting those with lower incomes. We demonstrate
   the proposed method for the case of skip-stop train operations and find
   that it shifts our constructed accessibility measure toward a more
   horizontally inequitable and vertically progressive state. We conclude
   that our proposed method can be a potent way for public transport
   agencies to measure and concretize equity goals and evaluate policy
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Self-concept Focus is a 15-item measure of the disposition to make
   autobiographical memories central to one's self-concept and thus to
   rehearse them more frequently. In studies with 400 MTurk workers and 299
   undergraduates, Self-concept Focus had high reliability (alpha similar
   to.83), good test-retest stability (r = .66) that did not decline
   between 7 and 54 days, good psychometric properties in a bifactor
   measurement model, and results that replicated across studies. A factor
   analysis of nine measures relevant to self-concept resulted in two
   factors. Self-concept Focus, Reflection, Reappraisal and Private
   Self-Consciousness all loaded on one factor, suggesting an underlying
   dimension of elaborative rehearsal of memories and emotion regulation.
   Self-concept Focus also correlated with PTSD symptoms for a single very
   negative event and thus with opportunities to modify such memory-based
   symptoms. Given its association with elaborative rehearsal and emotion
   regulation, Self-concept Focus has potential applied relevance in
   clinical, forensic and consumer contexts.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates possible separation of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and
   Rh(III) ions from chloride solutions by solvent extraction in rotating
   coiled columns (RCC). The most common reagents used for extraction of
   platinum metals were selected as extractants: trioctylamine (TOA),
   methyltrialkylammonium chloride (MTAA), tributyl phosphate (TBP), and
   relatively new reagent-N,N,N',N'-tetra-n-octyldiglycolamide (TODGA). The
   completeness of extraction of platinum metals from individual and mixed
   hydrochloric acid and chloride solutions has been analyzed as a function
   of the essence and concentration of extractant, acidity of the analyzed
   solutions, and other factors. Optimum conditions of quantitative
   extraction of the metals from model hydrochloric acid and chloride
   solutions into the extractant phase have been determined, including
   subsequent selective separation at the re-extraction stage. A flowchart
   has been proposed for multistage extraction of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and
   Rh(III) using 0.05 M MTAA solution in toluene as a stationary phase in
   RCC. The flowchart includes extraction of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) ions from
   the solution (0.1 M HCl + 30 g/L Cl-) into the organic phase upon
   simultaneous separation of Rh(III) remaining in the aqueous phase and
   consecutive re-extraction of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from the organic phase
   using 0.01 M solution of thiourea in 0.1 M HCl and 1 M solution of
   thiourea in 0.5 M HCl, respectively. The flowchart has been verified for
   separation of platinum metals in the production process of preset
   composition. The degree of metal extraction after processing by 0.05 M
   solution of MTAA in in toluene and consecutive re-extraction by
   solutions of thiourea is 99.5\% for rhodium(III), 99.9\% for
   palladium(II), and 97.4\% for platinum(IV). The extracted aqueous phases
   of rhodium and platinum after output from the column did not contain
   impurities of other platinum metals. In the aqueous fraction of
   palladium, the platinum content was 0.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Utilitarianism is often criticized because of its reliance on the
   interpersonal aggregation of harms and benefits. However, since the
   rejection of all forms of interpersonal aggregation strikes most people
   as implausible, some critics of utilitarianism have proposed theories of
   Limited Aggregation. These occupy the middle ground between fully
   aggregative and non-aggregative views. Recently, Limited Aggregation has
   been criticized for having counterintuitive implications that seem even
   worse than the counterintuitive implications of fully aggregative and
   non-aggregative views it tried to escape. I here propose a new view of
   Limited Aggregation that does better than existing accounts in this
   regard. It is more modest than existing accounts of Limited Aggregation,
   but it retains the view's core idea. This, I claim, is the thought that
   sometimes very strong individual claims stand in the way of realizing
   the best outcome.}},

Title = {{Reterritorialization practices and strategies of campesinos in the urban
   frontier of Bogota, Colombia}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Much of the research on urbanization has focused on how rural
   populations move to cities for work opportunities. This paper takes a
   different perspective on the relations between rural populations and
   urbanization. The livelihoods of rural dwellers on the outskirts of the
   city of Bogot'a in Colombia are increasingly affected by the expansion
   of urban activities and infrastructure. Therefore, urbanization takes
   place in the areas of residence of the rural populations; these people
   do not migrate to the city but, rather, the city migrates to them.
   Consequently, rural ways of life face growing competition from the
   production of commodities and services on the urban-rural fringe,
   including quarrying and landfills serving the needs of industries and
   urban populations. We explore how rural populations and their
   livelihoods have transformed as a response to these urban dynamics and
   the expansion of the city. We focus on the strategies that the rural
   populations employ to deal with the physical and socio-ecological
   impacts of this change. The defense of peri-urban livelihoods through
   these strategies is simultaneously social and spatial and has been
   partially successful. However, increasing social and environmental
   inequality, including worsening access to land, water and vital
   ecological functions, tends to lead to a general reduction in the
   quality of life in the urban frontier.}},

   the TRAPPIST-1 System}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{904}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Variations in the reflective properties of the bulk material that
   comprises the surface of land-dominated planets will affect the
   planetary energy balance by interacting differently with incident
   radiation from the host star. Furthermore, low-mass cool stars, such as
   nearby M8V dwarf TRAPPIST-1, emit a significant fraction of their flux
   in longer wavelengths relative to the Sun in regions where terrestrial
   materials may exhibit additional variability in albedo. Using the
   Community Earth System Model, we investigate the effect of the
   composition of the land surface and its albedo on planetary climate in
   the context of spatially homogeneous, entirely land-covered planets with
   dry atmospheres at the orbital separation of TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e,
   and TRAPPIST-1f. We use empirically derived spectra of four terrestrial
   compositional endmembers (granite, calcite, aridisol, and dune sand) and
   a composite spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 for these simulations and compare
   these model outputs to an aquaplanet and several Sol-spectrum control
   cases. We report a difference of approximately 50 K in global mean
   surface temperature, variations in atmospheric rotational features, and
   a reduction in cross-equatorial heat transport between scenarios in
   which materials with higher albedo in the infrared (calcite and dune
   sand) were used and those with more absorptive crustal material, such as
   granite or dry soils. An aquaplanet TRAPPIST-1d scenario results in an
   unstable runaway greenhouse regime. Therefore, we demonstrate that
   determining the composition and albedo of continental landmasses is
   crucial for making accurate determinations of the climate of terrestrial
   exoplanets.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a Quality Management System
   (QMS) for computer systems validation and to identify and demonstrate
   the validation process on a practical case of a pharmaceutical company.
   Based on the European and the US legal requirements, we define QMS for
   computer system validation elements. Validation process example based on
   the use of a general V-model provides a thorough understanding of the
   actual validation implementation in practice. Computer system validation
   in a concrete organization can be implemented, based on general and
   specific standard operating procedures which form the QMS. Planning,
   Specifying, Development/Building, Verification and Report validation
   activities are presented through process diagrams based on a practical
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) manufacturing
   computer-aided system validation example. Empirical part employed two
   research strategies: a single case study and action research. Presented
   computer system validation QMS and process can provide a guideline for
   all companies where computer systems are important. Although the
   presented QMS and process for the computer system validation are related
   to a specific pharmaceutical company case and its legal requirements,
   the experience from this highly regulated industry can be appropriately
   used in other less regulated industries. For verification of the
   proposed model, they need to be further tested within the pharmaceutical
   and other less regulated industries.}},

Title = {{Colorectal cancer screening completion: An examination of differences by

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Average-risk colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is broadly recommended,
   using one of several endorsed test options. However, CRC screening
   participation rates remain below national goals. To gain further
   insights regarding recent, population-based patterns in overall and
   test-specific CRC screening participation, we conducted a retrospective
   study of adults, ages 50-75 years, utilizing comprehensive data
   resources from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP).
   Among residents of Olmsted County, MN eligible and due for CRC
   screening, we identified 5818 residents across three annual cohorts who
   completed screening between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2018. We summarized CRC
   screening rates as incidence per 1000 population and used Poisson
   regression to test for overall and mode-specific CRC trends. We also
   analyzed rates of follow-up colonoscopy within 6-months after a positive
   stool-based screening result.
   While no significant differences over time were observed in overall CRC
   screening incidence rates among those due for screening, we observed a
   statistically significant increase in mt-sDNA test and statistically
   significant decreases in screening colonoscopy and FIT/FOBT test
   completion rates; differences in screening overall and by modality were
   observed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The diagnostic colonoscopy
   follow-up rate within six months after a positive stool-based test was
   significantly higher following mt-sDNA (84.9\%) compared to FIT/FOBT
   (42.6\%).
   In this retrospective, population-based study, overall CRC screening
   incidence rates remained stable from 2016 to 2018, while test-specific
   rates for mt-sDNA significantly increased and decreased for colonoscopy
   and FIT/FOBT. Adherence with follow-up colonoscopy after a positive
   stool-based test was significantly higher among patients who underwent
   mt-sDNA screening compared to FIT/FOBT.}},

Title = {{Issues in the establishment of a therapeutic cannabis market under
   Jamaica's Dangerous Drugs Amendment Act 2015}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: In 2015, Jamaica became the first Caribbean country to
   decriminalise personal cannabis possession, legalise home cultivation
   and establish a commercial therapeutic cannabis market via the passage
   of the Dangerous Drugs Amendment Act (DDAA).
   Aim: To critically analyse implementation of the legal therapeutic
   cannabis market under the DDAA.
   Methods: Synthesis of findings from semi-structured face-to-face
   interviews with 22 key informants (KIs) from the government, industry,
   academia and NGO sector, unstructured interviews with illegal growers,
   and field observations of licensed and illegal operators.
   Results: KIs identified a number of challenges in implementing
   therapeutic market provisions under DDAA, including a limited buy-in
   from key government agencies; delays in developing a framework for
   quality assurance; and lack of access to banking services. Public sector
   actors stressed the challenges imposed by the UN drug conventions and
   need to maintain favourable diplomatic relationship with the US federal
   government, with the consequence of prioritising enforcement to prevent
   diversion and inversion. Implementation of the Alternative Development
   Programme in two traditional cannabis-growing communities experienced
   challenges with land titles and frictions in local communities. High
   compliance costs and limited skills to meet the envisioned medical
   standards presented barriers for traditional farmers. Many KIs
   conceptualised the purchasing of cannabis from the regulated market as
   ``recreational{''} rather than medical, reflecting the marketing and
   limited information on medical applications at point of sale. Licensees'
   reliance on foreign investment puts local industry at risk of predatory
   shareholder agreements, but also provides needed investment and
   expertise.
   Conclusion: External international factors (e.g. UN treaties,
   correspondent banking with the US) and conflicting domestic government
   agency visions for the reform played a significant role in the DDAA
   implementation. As cannabis law reform spreads beyond Western
   jurisdictions, consideration of pre-existing social, cultural and
   economic conditions of developing countries will be important.}},

Abstract = {{Close packed carbon nanotube bundles are materials with highly
   defonnable elements, for which unusual deformation mechanisms are
   expected. Structural evolution of the zigzag carbon nanotube bundle
   subjected to biaxial lateral compression with the subsequent shear
   straining is studied under plane strain conditions using the chain model
   with a reduced number of degrees of freedom. Biaxial compression results
   in bending of carbon nanotubes walls and formation of the characteristic
   pattern, when nanotube cross-sections are inclined in the opposite
   directions alternatively in the parallel close-packed rows. Subsequent
   shearing up to a certain shear strain leads to an appearance of shear
   bands and vortex-like displacements. Stress components and potential
   energy as the functions of shear strain for different values of the
   biaxial volumetric strain are analyzed in detail. A new mechanism of
   carbon nanotube bundle shear deformation through cooperative,
   vortex-like displacements of nanotube cross sections is reported.}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous measurement of thermal diffusivity and thermal
   effusivity based on the temperature wave analysis (TWA) is proposed by
   introducing the dual lock-in temperature sensor with a photo-thermal ac
   heat source. The thermal effect from each component in the multilayered
   experimental system is simulated by the quadrupole modeling adopted to
   the pure periodic heating of the temperature wave. The frequency
   dependency of the thermal effect from the thermal contact resistance and
   capacitance in the sensor were analyzed and minimized by taking the
   optimal frequency range of the temperature wave. The proposed method is
   applied to examine the nematic-isotropic phase transition of the liquid
   crystal 4'-(pentyloxy)-4-biphenyl carbonitrile (5OCB). The results were
   compared with the previous results measured with a single sensor and the
   advantage of the dual lock-in temperature sensor was demonstrated. (C)

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Fatigue is one of the most common and
   disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). It can be defined as a
   subjective lack of physical and mental energy. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the frequency and severity of fatigue in patients with MS
   and its relationship with overall physical activity and disease-related
   disability. Materials and Methods: The study included 100 patients with
   a clinical relapsing-remitting form of MS. Patients with severe
   depression were excluded. Neurological impairment was rated using the
   Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Fatigue was assessed using the
   Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale
   (FSS), with FSS scores greater than 36 indicating patients with fatigue.
   Physical activity was evaluated with the International Physical Activity
   Questionnaire (IPAQ) and categorized on three levels: low, moderate, and
   high, using standard metabolic equivalents (MET). Results: The average
   FSS and MFIS scores were (mean +/- SD) 31.3 +/- 15.2 and 30.1 +/- 17.0,
   respectively. The mean EDSS score was 2.5 +/- 1.5. 42\%. Patients were
   classified as fatigued based on FSS. Fatigued patients had higher mean
   EDSS scores than non-fatigued (3.0 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.4,
   respectively, p = 0.002). Low, moderate, and high levels of physical
   activity were reported in 35\%, 20\%, and 45\% of patients,
   respectively. Higher scores of fatigue in FSS and MFIS were inversely
   correlated with the intensity of physical activity (r = -0.38, p < 0.001
   and r = -0.33, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with
   MS, fatigue is a common symptom. Patients with lower physical activity
   and greater MS-related disability have a higher severity of fatigue,
   which negatively affects cognitive, psychosocial, and physical
   functioning.}},

Abstract = {{The report shows the strong impact of fullerene C-60 nanoparticles on
   phase transitions and complex dynamics of rod-like liquid crystal
   dodecylcyanobiphenyl (12CB), within the limit of small concentrations.
   Studies were carried out using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS)
   via the analysis of temperature dependences of the dielectric constant,
   the maximum of the primary loss curve, and relaxation times. They
   revealed a strong impact of nanoparticles, leading to a similar to 20\%
   change of dielectric constant even at x = 0.05\% of C-60 fullerene. The
   application of the derivative-based and distortion-sensitive analysis
   showed that pretransitional effects dominate in the isotropic liquid
   phase up to 65 K above the clearing temperature and in the whole Smectic
   A mesophase. The impact of nanoparticles on the pretransitional anomaly
   appearance is notable for the smectic-solid phase transition. The
   fragility-based analysis of relaxation times revealed the universal
   pattern of its temperature changes, associated with scaling via the
   ``mixed{''} ({''}activated{''} and ``critical{''}) relation. Phase
   behavior and dynamics of tested systems are discussed within the
   extended Landau-de Gennes-Ginzburg mesoscopic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives: Key sex differences have been explored in
   multiple cardiac conditions. However, sex impact in hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy outcome is unclear. We aimed to characterize sex impact
   in overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in a nationwide
   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registry.
   Methods: We analyzed 1042 adult patients, 429 (41\%) women, from a
   national registry of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with mean age at
   diagnosis 53 +/- 16 years and a mean follow-up of 65 +/- 75 months. At
   baseline, women were older (56 +/- 16 vs 51 +/- 15 years; P < .001),
   more symptomatic (56.4\%, vs 51.7\%; P < .001) and had more heart
   failure (42.0\% vs 24.2\%. P < .001), diastolic dysfunction (75.2\% vs
   64.1\% P = .001), moderate/severe mitral regurgitation (33.4\% vs
   21.7\%; P = .003), and higher B-type natriuretic peptide levels (920
   {[}366-2412] mg/dL vs 487 {[}170-1087] mg/dL; P <.001). Women underwent
   fewer stress tests and cardiac magnetic resonance.
   Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed higher overall (8.4\% vs
   5.0\%; P = .026) and CV mortality (5.5\% vs 2.2\%; P = .004) in women.
   Cox proportional hazard regression showed that female sex was an
   independent predictor of overall (HR, 2.05; 95\%CI,1.11-3.78; P= .021)
   and CV mortality (HR, 3.16; 95\%CI, 1.25-7.99; P = .015). Women had more
   heart failure-related death (2.6\% vs 0.8\%, P = .024). Despite similar
   sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, women received fewer implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillators (10.9\% vs 15.6\%; P = .032) and, in
   patients without cardioverter-defibrillators, SCD occurred more commonly
   in women (1.8\% vs 0.4\%; P = .031).
   Conclusions: In this nationwide registry, female sex was an independent
   predictor of overall and CV-related death, with more heart
   failure-related death. Despite similar SCD risk, women were undertreated
   with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. These data highlight the
   need for an improved clinical approach in women with HCM. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Algerian dwellings are known for their use of ceramics as decorative
   materials. The latter are mainly composed of clay that contains
   naturally occurring radionuclides, mainly Uranium and Thorium families

   classified as a source of hazardous contamination and broad
   investigations of natural radioactivity levels must be established with
   the aim of estimating the harmful effects of ionizing radiations emitted
   by these materials. In this study, thirteen samples collected from
   ceramic dealers and construction sites were analyzed using a
   high-resolution HPGe semiconductor detector. Activity concentrations of
   Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were found with mean specific activities of
   22.28 +/- 0.61, 29.39 +/- 1.34 and 558.31 +/- 11.58 Bq.kg(-1),

   Ra-226 and Th-232. However, they were above them for 40K. Radiological

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fault location scheme is introduced for multi-terminal
   double-circuit untransposed lines with multiple tap-nodes and multiple
   branches emanating from the same tap-node. The proposed scheme consists
   of two steps. In the first step, a new threshold free searching scheme
   is proposed for faulted branch identification utilizing only the
   synchronized terminal measurements. The proposed searching scheme is
   very simple and it does not require examination of all branches to
   determine the faulted branch. As the faulted branch is determined, the
   fault location problem of multi-terminal network becomes two-terminal
   fault location problem and the second step is applied to obtain the
   exact fault location utilizing one of the proposed fault location
   schemes in open literature. Different fault locations and resistances
   and all types of faults are tested to evaluate the scheme performance.
   In addition, the system is evaluated under influence of changing ground
   resistivity and synchronization errors. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The main protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key antiviral drug target.
   While most M-pro inhibitors have a gamma-lactam glutamine surrogate at
   the P1 position, we recently found that several M-pro inhibitors have
   hydrophobic moieties at the P1 site, including calpain inhibitors II and
   XII, which are also active against human cathepsin L, a host protease
   that is important for viral entry. In this study, we solved x-ray
   crystal structures of M-pro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and
   XII and three analogs of GC-376. The structure of M-pro with calpain
   inhibitor II confirmed that the S1 pocket can accommodate a hydrophobic
   methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue
   is necessary at this position. The structure of calpain inhibitor XII
   revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose. Together, the
   biochemical, computational, structural, and cellular data presented
   herein provide new directions for the development of dual inhibitors as
   SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable membranes with different compositions of polycaprolactone
   (PCL) and polybutylene succinate (PBS) are prepared via immersion
   precipitation. The morphology, hydrophilicity, chemical structure,
   crystalline structure, mechanical properties, and biodegradability of
   the membranes are studied to assess the effect of PBS concentration in
   the polymer blend on membrane properties. Furthermore, the performance
   of the obtained membranes is assessed through the treatment of
   wastewater sampled from the chips and snacks factory. Also, membranes'
   antifouling properties are assessed by filtration of a model foulant.
   The investigations revealed that the addition of PBS to PCL increases
   the membrane hydrophilicity and biodegradability. Regarding the results,
   the PCL membrane blended with 30 wt\% PBS has 106\%, 26\%, and 37\%
   higher pure water flux, flux recovery ratio, and permeate flux, in
   addition to the higher rejection of pollution indices, in comparison

Abstract = {{Vertical stiffness and shear strength of ballasts are significantly
   degraded when contaminated with sands. There is a lack of
   solutions/studies related to strengthening ballast against sand
   contamination. Addressing this limitation, a comprehensive laboratory
   investigation was made on effectiveness of geogrid reinforcement for
   improvement of mechanical properties of sand-contaminated ballast. To
   this end, large-scale direct shear tests as well as plate load tests
   were conducted on geogrid-reinforced ballast samples prepared with
   different levels of sand contamination. The obtained results indicate
   that geogrid reinforcement considerably improves shear strength and
   vertical stiffness of contaminated ballast. A bandwidth was obtained for
   contamination levels in which ballast reinforcement is effective.
   Through examining geogrid with different aperture sizes and locations in
   the ballast layer, the best performance conditions of geogrid
   reinforcement were derived. The results were used to propose an
   effective method of ballast reinforcement and an efficient ballast
   maintenance approach in sandy areas.}},

Abstract = {{CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer cells are the
   main cytotoxic killer cells of the human body to eliminate
   pathogen-infected or tumorigenic cells (also known as target cells). To
   find their targets, they have to navigate and migrate through complex
   biological microenvironments, a key component of which is the
   extracellular matrix (ECM). The mechanisms underlying killer cell's
   navigation are not well understood. To mimic an ECM, we use a matrix
   formed by different collagen concentrations and analyze migration
   trajectories of primary human CTLs. Different migration patterns are
   observed and can be grouped into three motility types: slow, fast, and
   mixed. The dynamics are well described by a two-state persistent random
   walk model, which allows cells to switch between slow motion with low
   persistence and fast motion with high persistence. We hypothesize that
   the slow motility mode describes CTLs creating channels through the
   collagen matrix by deforming and tearing apart collagen fibers and that
   the fast motility mode describes CTLs moving within these channels.
   Experimental evidence supporting this scenario is presented by
   visualizing migrating T cells following each other on exactly the same
   track and showing cells moving quickly in channel-like cavities within
   the surrounding collagen matrix. Consequently, the efficiency of the
   stochastic search process of CTLs in the ECM should strongly be
   influenced by a dynamically changing channel network produced by the
   killer cells themselves.}},

Title = {{Rare and de novo duplications containing SHOX in clubfoot}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{851-857}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Congenital clubfoot is a common birth defect that affects
   at least 0.1\% of all births. Nearly 25\% cases are familial and the
   remaining are sporadic in inheritance. Copy number variants (CNVs)
   involving transcriptional regulators of limb development, including
   PITX1 and TBX4, have previously been shown to cause familial clubfoot,
   but much of the heritability remains unexplained.
   Methods Exome sequence data from 816 unrelated clubfoot cases and 2645
   in-house controls were analysed using coverage data to identify rare
   CNVs. The precise size and location of duplications were then determined
   using high-density Affymetrix Cytoscan chromosomal microarray (CMA).
   Segregation in families and de novo status were determined using
   qantitative PCR.
   Results Chromosome Xp22.33 duplications involving SHOX were identified
   in 1.1\% of cases (9/816) compared with 0.07\% of in-house controls
   (2/2645) (p=7.98x10(-5), OR=14.57) and 0.27\% (38/13592) of
   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities/the Wellcome Trust Case Control
   Consortium 2 controls (p=0.001, OR=3.97). CMA validation confirmed an
   overlapping 180.28 kb duplicated region that included SHOX exons as well
   as downstream non-coding regions. In four of six sporadic cases where
   DNA was available for unaffected parents, the duplication was de novo.
   The probability of four de novo mutations in SHOX by chance in a cohort
   of 450 sporadic clubfoot cases is 5.4x10(-10).
   Conclusions Microduplications of the pseudoautosomal chromosome Xp22.33
   region (PAR1) containing SHOX and downstream enhancer elements occur in
   similar to 1\% of patients with clubfoot. SHOX and regulatory regions
   have previously been implicated in skeletal dysplasia as well as
   idiopathic short stature, but have not yet been reported in clubfoot.
   SHOX duplications likely contribute to clubfoot pathogenesis by altering
   early limb development.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between a tree's crown cover area (CCA) and diameter at
   breast height (d.b.h) has a variety of uses including forest competition
   studies, tree crown densities, spacing and stocking relationships,
   wildlife habitat suitability models, and tree volume estimations.
   Estimating (d.b.h) from crown cover area (CCA) is of interest to natural
   resource managers because CCA can be estimated from high resolution
   digital imagery using remote sensing techniques. (d.b.h) is a common
   tree dimensional characteristic that is used to quantify tree and stand
   structure. This research presents CCA \& d.b.h, (d.b.h) \& CCA, CCA \&
   H, H \& CCA and CCA \& (d.b.h, H) relationships, for Melia azedarach
   trees. The linear model, D = a + b x CCA provided the best model fit
   with R-2 values of 92.76 and S.E. (2.22) and for determining H, the
   values of R-2 and S. E. was 89.32 and 0.37 respectively. Crown cover
   area can be determined from digital imagery and then used to predict
   (d.b.h) and H. Reliable measures of canopy cover are important in the
   management of public and private forests. However, direct sampling of
   canopy cover is both labor and time intensive. More efficient methods
   for estimating percent canopy cover could be empirically derived
   relationships between more readily measured stand attributes and canopy
   cover.}},

Abstract = {{High/very-high-resolution (HR/VHR) multitemporal images are important in
   remote sensing to monitor the dynamics of the Earth's surface.
   Unsupervised object-based image analysis provides an effective solution
   to analyze such images. Image semantic segmentation assigns pixel labels
   from meaningful object groups and has been extensively studied in the
   context of single-image analysis, however not explored for multitemporal
   one. In this article, we propose to extend supervised semantic
   segmentation to the unsupervised joint semantic segmentation of
   multitemporal images. We propose a novel method that processes
   multitemporal images by separately feeding to a deep network comprising
   of trainable convolutional layers. The training process does not involve
   any external label, and segmentation labels are obtained from the argmax
   classification of the final layer. A novel loss function is used to
   detect object segments from individual images as well as establish a
   correspondence between distinct multitemporal segments. Multitemporal
   semantic labels and weights of the trainable layers are jointly
   optimized in iterations. We tested the method on three different HR/VHR
   data sets from Munich, Paris, and Trento, which shows the method to be
   effective. We further extended the proposed joint segmentation method
   for change detection (CD) and tested on a VHR multisensor data set from
   Trento.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Clematis chinensis (family: Ranunculaceae) is a deciduous climbing plant
   having multipurpose use in traditional Chinese medicine, but the use of
   molecular markers in Clematis chinensis is yet to gain momentum.
   Recently ESTSSRs are the free by-product of the currently growing EST
   databases. SSRs (microsatellites) have been extensively used as
   molecular marker in several genetic studies. The present study reports
   the frequency of SSRs and appropriate primers for the C. chinensis EST
   sequences. The EST sequences of C. chinensis were obtained from NCBI
   database and screened for the presence of SSRs. MISA tool was used to
   predict the microsatellites and Primer3 plus software was used for
   designing the primers. By using the MISA tool a total of 155 SSRs were
   identified in contigs and 275 SSRs were identified in singletones.
   Occurrence of trinucleotide repeats were most abundant both in contigs
   (52.3\%) and singletones (41.5\%) followed by dinucleotides. Maximum
   trinucleotide motifs code for Leucine (CTT) followed by glutamic acid
   (GAA) and Serine (TCT) i.e., whereas in singleton sequences glutamic
   acid (GAA) is dominated followed by glutamine (CAA) and asparagine
   (AAC). AG/CT was the most recurrent repeat of dinucleotide. We also
   designed 60 primers flanking the SSR repeats. The identified SSRs and
   their related markers can be used in future studies of linkage mapping,
   comparative genomics study, genetic diversity analysis and different
   breeding programs in Clematis chinensis.}},

Abstract = {{Educational environment has a significant impact on students' learning
   and academic achievement.The aim of this article was to explore the
   perception of veterinary school students' regarding their educational
   environment at the University of the West Indies. In this
   cross-sectional study, the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure
   (DREEM) was administered to veterinary undergraduate students from year
   2 to year 5.The DREEM questionnaire consists of 50 items with five
   subscales: students' perceptions of learning, students' perceptions of
   teachers, students' academic self-perceptions, students' perceptions of
   atmosphere, and students' social self-perceptions. Each item was scored
   on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (0) to strongly
   agree (4).The Cronbach's alpha for the overall DREEM score was 0.92, and
   for the five subscales, it ranged from 0.66 to 0.83.A total of 99
   students responded (response rate: 86\%). The students' overall DREEM
   mean score was 106.59 out of the global mean score of 200, indicating
   that students' perception of the educational environment was generally
   more positive than negative. I n the five DREEM subscales, students were
   found to have a more positive perception of learning (55.15\%);
   students' perception of teachers was generally positive (61.41\%); and
   their perception of academic atmosphere was also positive (57.75\%).
   Conversely, students' academic self-perception (51.41\%) and social
   self-perception (42.61\%) trended negatively.The findings suggest that
   improvement is needed in significant areas in the veterinary school,
   including curriculum review, faculty development, provision of sports
   and cultural facilities, stress management, and academic support
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Chlortetracycline CTC is an organochlorine compound released from
   industrial pharmaceutical waste. This pollutant had dangerous effects in
   aquatic organisms and human health, since it is responsible for
   inhibition of microbial activity and growth. In this study, the
   elimination of CTC from water is targeted. Biodegradability, based on
   the BOD5/COD ratio was studied, showing the non-feasibility of a direct
   biological treatment. Cyclic voltammetry analysis on a nickel electrode
   revealed a significant electrochemical activity of CTC. An
   electrochemical pre-treatment was therefore carried out ina percolation
   cell using a nickel foam as a working electrode at the potential of 0.5
   V/SCE. The operating parameters were optimized. A degradation yield of
   99\% was achieved for an initial concentration of pollutant of 50 mg L-1
   and a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1) in alkaline conditions. After
   electrolysis, a total dechlorination of CTC was observed. The
   biodegradability ratio was improved, from 0.13 to 0.33 after
   electrolysis; while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis revealed
   that the level of mineralization remained low 27\%. A 21 days biological
   treatment with activated sludge was then carried out, leading to an

Abstract = {{We completely characterize smoothness of bounded linear operators
   between infinite dimensional real normed linear spaces, probably for the
   very first time, by applying the concepts of Birkhoff-James
   orthogonality and semi-inner-products in normed linear spaces. In this
   context, the key aspect of our study is to consider norming sequences
   for a bounded linear operator, instead of norm attaining elements. We
   also obtain a complete characterization of smoothness of bounded linear
   operators between real normed linear spaces, when the corresponding norm
   attainment set non-empty. This illustrates the importance of the norm
   attainment set in the study of smoothness of bounded linear operators.
   Finally, we prove that Gateaux differentiability and Frechet
   differentiability are equivalent for compact operators in the space of
   bounded linear operators between a reflexive Kadets-Klee Banach space
   and a Frechet differentiable normed linear space, endowed with the usual

   particularly large in tropical systems, and even more so in the African
   tropics. This study provides baseline data on species composition and
   vegetation structure, and evaluate variation along elevational gradient
   transecting of four elevation-forest types: lowland, mid-elevation,
   sub-montane and montane forest in the Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve of
   Cameroon. We collected data on tree species diversity, above-ground
   biomass and carbon in 25 1-ha plots sampled in 500 m long x 20 m width
   transect. Results revealed high species diversity, particularly in
   lowland forest. Overall, the study enumerated 12,037 individuals (trees
   >= 10 cm dbh) of 441 species. The mean species per plot decreased with
   increasing elevation, 112 in lowland, 81 in mid-elevation, 60 in
   submontane and 38 in montane forest. Above-ground carbon averaged 162.88
   +/- 50 t ha(-1). We found the greatest carbon storage and tree and liana
   species diversity at low elevations. Our results indicate that high
   species diversity and occurrence of larger tree species are more
   important in carbon storage in lowland forest than at higher elevations.
   These findings are useful for management and land use planning of the
   forests in the Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Gunshot wounds are the second leading cause of spinal cord
   injuries. Surgical intervention for gunshot injury to the spine carries
   a high rate of complications. There is a scarcity of data on civilian
   gunshot injuries to the spine in Pakistan. Approximately 60 cases over
   the last 10 years have been recoded, with unusual presentation and
   neurological recovery. Thus it is imperative to fill this gap in data,
   by reviewing cases of civilian gunshot injuries to spine presenting at a
   tertiary care hospital (Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi).
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients of all ages who
   presented to the emergency department of Aga Khan University Hospital,
   with gunshot injuries to spine between January 2005 and December 2016
   were included in the study. Data were collected on neurological status
   (American Spinal Injury Association score was used for the initial and
   follow-up neurological assessment), extent of cord transection, motor
   and sensory deficits. The patients were further grouped into those with
   cord transection, and those with fractures of the bony spine but an
   intact spinal cord. These patients were then followed and the outcomes
   were recorded.
   Results: A total of 40 patients were identified. The mean SD of patients
   age was (30.9 +/- 9.5) years. Of the 40 patients with gunshot wounds, 31
   had the medical imaging performed at the facility, and hence they were
   included in this categorization. The remaining 9 patients were excluded
   from this additional grouping. Thirteen patients were managed surgically
   and 27 patients underwent the conservative management. The mean +/- SD
   of follow-up was (8.7 +/- 7.2) months. In our study, the thoracic spine
   was the most commonly injured region in gunshot injuries. Of the 31
   patients with medical imaging performed at our institute, 17 (54.8\%)
   had cord transection, of whom 8 (47\%) ultimately developed paraplegia.
   Conclusion: The prognosis of gunshot injuries to the spine can be varied
   depending on whether the spinal cord is intact or transected. This will
   help healthcare providers to plan the further management of the patient
   and counsel them accordingly. (C) 2020 Chinese Medical Association.

Number = {{49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{While a genetic component of preterm birth (PTB) has long been
   recognized and recently mapped by genome-wide association studies
   (GWASs), the molecular determinants underlying PTB remain elusive. This
   stems in part from an incomplete availability of functional genomic
   annotations in human cell types relevant to pregnancy and PTB. We
   generated transcriptome (RNA-seq), epigenome (ChlP-seq of H3K27ac,
   H3K4mel, and H3K4me3 histone modifications), open chromatin (ATAC-seq),
   and chromatin interaction (promoter capture Hi-C) annotations of
   cultured primary decidua-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and in
   vitro differentiated decidual stromal cells and developed a
   computational framework to integrate these functional annotations with
   results from a GWAS of gestational duration in 56,384 women. Using these
   resources, we uncovered additional loci associated with gestational
   duration and target genes of associated loci. Our strategy illustrates
   how functional annotations in pregnancy-relevant cell types aid in the
   experimental follow-up of GWAS for PTB and, likely, other
   pregnancy-related conditions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Progressive supranuelear palsy (PSP) is listed as a core
   clinical feature in the Movement Disorder Society 2017 criteria, along
   with ocular motor dysfunction, postural instability, akinesia, and
   cognitive dysfunction. Imaging evidence shows predominant midbrain
   atrophy and postsynaptic striatal dopaminergic degeneration as two
   supportive features. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
   diagnostic performance of I-123-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2
   beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (I-123-FP-CIT) SPECT
   by comparing it with evaluation of core clinical features and MRI in the
   diagnosis of PSP.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study included 53 patients with clinically
   suspected PSP who had undergone I-123-FP-CIT SPECT and MRI examinations.
   MR parkinsonism index (MRPI) was used as the MRI index. For the
   I-123-FP-CIT SPECT index, specific binding ratio (SBR) was calculated as
   the average of the right and left SBRs.
   RESULTS. In regard to core clinical features, ocular motor dysfunction
   was present in 15 of 20 (75.0\%) patients with the diagnosis of probable
   PSP (p < 0.0001). Calculation of the diagnostic performance of the
   imaging parameters showed that MRPI (cutoff > 11.6) had 85.0\%
   sensitivity, 100\% specificity, and 94.3\% accuracy. SBR (cutoff < 3.7)
   had 95.0\% sensitivity, 36.4\% specificity, and 58.5\% accuracy.
   CONCLUSION. Iodine-123-labeled FP-CIT SPECT has high sensitivity, and
   MRI has high specificity in the diagnosis of PSP. Because these tools
   have complementary roles, reaching a more confident clinical diagnosis
   of PSP may be possible when both are used.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Emergency Response Teams have been employed by
   hospitals to evaluate and manage patients whose condition is rapidly
   deteriorating. In this study, we aimed to assess the outcomes of
   triggering the Emergency Response Teams at a high-volume arthroplasty
   center, determine which factors trigger the Emergency Response Teams,
   and investigate the main reasons for an unplanned intensive care unit
   admission following Emergency Response Team intervention. Material and
   Methods: We gathered data by evaluating all Emergency Response Team
   forms filled out during a 4-year period (2014-2017), and by assessing
   the medical records. The collected data included age, gender, time of
   and reason for the Emergency Response Teams call, and interventions
   performed during the Emergency Response Teams intervention. The results
   are reported as percentages, mean +/- standard deviation, or median
   (interquartile range), where appropriate. All patients were monitored
   for 30 days to identify possible intensive care unit admissions,
   surgeries, and death. Results: The mean patient age was 72 (46-92) years
   and 40 patients (62\%) were female. The Emergency Response Teams was
   triggered a total of 65 times (61 patients). The most common Emergency
   Response Team call criteria were low oxygen saturation, loss or
   reduction of consciousness, and hypotension. Following the Emergency
   Response Team call, 36 patients (55\%) could be treated in the ward, and
   29 patients (45\%) were transferred to the intensive care unit. The
   emergency that triggered the Emergency Response Teams was most commonly
   caused by drug-related side effects (12\%), pneumonia (8\%), pulmonary
   embolism (8\%), and sepsis (6\%). Seven patients (11\%) died during the
   first 30 days after the Emergency Response Teams call. Conclusion:
   Although all 65 patients met the Emergency Response Teams call criteria,
   potentially having severe emergencies, half of the patients could be
   treated in the arthroplasty ward. Emergency Response Team intervention
   appears useful in addressing concerns that can potentially lead to
   unplanned intensive care unit admission, and the Emergency Response
   Teams trigger threshold seems appropriate as only 3\% of the Emergency
   Response Teams calls required no intervention.}},

   vertical flow is predominantly from the deep layer to the surface one.
   The phosphorus balance of the Seno Gallegos was negative for the upper
   layer and positive in the deep layer. Under a condition of increased
   rainfall, nutrient balance and flow would be intensified, along with
   increased nitrogen fixation and net metabolism. While under a condition
   of lower rainfall, these processes would be diminished. Due to the
   direct relationship between variations of the glacial ice volume and its
   adjacent proglacial marine area, the latter are highly sensitive to
   climate change. Therefore, further studies on these areas are of great
   importance to understand the forces that govern these cold estuarine
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Cover crop diversity improves multiple soil properties via altering root

Journal = {{RHIZOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cover crops may influence soil health and functioning. However, little
   is known about the role of belowground root architectural traits in
   linking cover crop diversity with rhizosphere soil ecosystem properties.
   We hypothesize that cover crop diversity may improve root traits, which
   in return, could influence its effects on essential indicators of soil
   physicochemical heterogeneity, such as the composition of soil
   aggregate-size classes and nutrients, and the soil organic matter (SOM)
   and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. We studied the impact of plant
   diversity on root traits and soil properties. The four soil
   aggregate-size classes, such as large macro ( 2000 mu m), small
   macro(<2000-500 mu m), meso(<500-250 mu m), and micro-aggregates (<250
   mu m) were separated by the dry sieving. Root traits such as surface
   area (cm(2)) and length (cm) were quantified by image analysis using
   Winrhizo. The soil nutrient, SOM, and SOC contents were determined by
   standard methods. We used Fox's (2005) method for partitioning the
   selection and complementarity effects on plant productivity. Plant
   diversity improved productivity, root architectural traits, root
   coverage, the composition of soil aggregate-size classes and nutrients,
   SOM and SOC contents across the soil depth. It increased and decreased
   the relative abundance of mesoand micro-aggregates, respectively. Both
   root architectural traits and SOC contents positively correlated with
   several soil edaphic properties essential for physicochemical
   heterogeneity, health, and functioning. Our results suggest that
   competition among plant roots in species-rich than poor communities may
   improve rhizosphere soil carbon storage, the composition of soil
   aggregate-size classes, and nutrients.}},

Title = {{Epidemic risk of arboviral diseases: Determining the habitats,
   spatial-temporal distribution, and abundance of immature Aedes aegypti
   in the Urban and Rural areas of Zanzibar, Tanzania}},

Abstract = {{Author summary
   Dengue is considered the most important mosquito-borne viral disease and
   a global public health threat. In recent decades, large scale epidemics
   of dengue have occurred across sub-Saharan Africa including mainland
   Tanzania. Aedes aegypti is identified as the principal vector for dengue
   transmission in most affected countries. In the absence of antiviral
   treatment and as a dengue vaccine is not readily available; dengue
   prevention depends largely on vector control. As mosquitoes develop
   resistance towards commonly applied chemical insecticides, environmental
   management targeting the destruction of larval habitats is recommended.
   In Zanzibar, little is known about Ae. aegypti in terms of type,
   magnitude, or distribution of its larval habitats. In this study, we
   identified the main larval habitats of Ae. aegypti, their seasonal
   variations and factors contributing to Ae. aegypti abundance across
   urban and rural settings of Unguja Island in Zanzibar. We found
   widespread presence and abundance of the vector with plastic and metal
   containers as well as car tires identified as the most important larval
   habitats. Season, location of water container, water storage, sun
   exposure, presence of vegetation and organic matter were among the
   factors associated with high Ae. aegypti abundance. This study is the
   first to document widespread occurrence and distribution of Ae. aegypti
   in Zanzibar and highlights the need for the establishment of a
   nation-wide Aedes surveillance program to guide the development and
   monitoring of targeted, context specific vector control interventions
   for prevention of dengue and other arboviral epidemics. Aedes
   surveillance involves periodic inspection of households and surrounding
   environments for presence of larvae/pupae in water-holding containers
   which are then targeted for larval source reduction, as well as
   monitoring of adult mosquito populations.
   Background
   In Zanzibar, little is known about the arboviral disease vector Aedes
   aegypti in terms of abundance, spatio-temporal distribution of its
   larval habitats or factors associated with its proliferation. Effective
   control of the vector requires knowledge on ecology and habitat
   characteristics and is currently the only available option for reducing
   the risk of arboviral epidemics in the island nation of Zanzibar.
   Methodology
   We conducted entomological surveys in households and surrounding
   compounds from February to May 2018 in the urban (Mwembemakumbi and
   Chumbuni) and rural (Chuini and Kama) Shehias (lowest government
   administrative unit) situated in the Urban-West region of Unguja island,
   Zanzibar. Larvae and pupae were collected, transported to the insectary,
   reared to adult, and identified to species level. Characteristics and
   types of water containers were also recorded on site. Generalized linear
   mixed models with binomial and negative binomial distributions were
   applied to determine factors associated with presence of Ae. aegypti
   immatures (i.e. both larvae and pupae) or pupae, alone and significant
   predictors of the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti or pupae,
   respectively.
   Results
   The survey provided evidence of widespread presence and abundance of Ae.
   aegypti mosquitoes in both urban and rural settings of Unguja Island.
   Interestingly, rural setting had higher numbers of infested containers,
   all immatures, and pupae than urban setting. Likewise, higher House and
   Breteau indices were recorded in rural compared to the urban setting.
   There was no statistically significant difference in Stegomyia indices
   between seasons across settings. Plastics, metal containers and car
   tires were identified as the most productive habitats which collectively
   produced over 90\% of all Ae. aegypti pupae. Water storage, sun
   exposure, vegetation, and organic matter were significant predictors of
   the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti.
   Conclusions
   Widespread presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti were found in rural and
   urban areas of Unguja, the main island of Zanzibar. Information on
   productive habitats and predictors of colonization of water containers
   are important for the development of a routine Aedes surveillance system
   and targeted control interventions in Zanzibar and similar settings.}},

Abstract = {{The two-receiver broadcast channel with primary and third party
   receivers is studied. The sender wishes to reliably communicate a common
   (or public) message to both receivers as well as individualized and
   confidential messages to the primary receiver only. The third party
   receiver must be kept completely ignorant of the confidential message
   but there are no secrecy requirements associated to the individualized
   message. A trade-off arises between the rates of the three messages:
   when one of the rates is high, the other rates may need to back off to
   guarantee the reliable transmission of all three messages. In addition,
   the confidentiality requirement implies availability of local randomness
   at the transmitter in order to implement a stochastic encoding. This
   article studies the trade-off between the rates of the common,
   individualized and confidential messages as well as that of the local
   randomness in the one-shot regime of a quantum broadcast channel. We
   provide an achievability region, by proving a conditional version of the
   convex-split lemma combined with the position-based decoding, as well as
   a (weak) converse region. We study the asymptotic behaviour of our
   bounds and recover several well-known asymptotic results in the
   literature, including simultaneous transmission of classical and quantum
   information.}},

Abstract = {{The cancerous bone may be treated using magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs)
   coupled with hyperthermia treatment technology. During the last three
   decades, calcium-silicate (CS) based bioceramics have been investigated
   as a proper choice due to their bioactivity, biocompatibility,
   magnetization property, and ability to form suitable apatite for hard
   tissue engineering approaches. For this purpose, three-dimensional
   bio-nanocomposite scaffolds utilizing bioactive wollastonite (WS) and
   bioglass (BG) as composed based materials with 0 wt\% (S1), 5 wt\% (S2),
   10 wt\% (S3), and 15 wt\% (S4) of Zr-Fe3O4 are considered in this study.
   These materials with two various space-agents such as sodium chloride
   (NaCl) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3 ) particles containing ball mill
   with high energy and pressing under 150 MPa, and sintered at 850 degrees
   C are analyzed. Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), and mechanical
   tests include of toughness and compressive strength are investigated.
   The powder's and scaffold's crystals size are measured between 30 and 50
   nm, and the pores and porosity size are measured from 70 to 180 mu m and
   25\%-40\%. The VSM curves illustrate that the zirconium-ferrite has a
   soft magnetic property, which is easily magnetized by applying a small
   amount of magnetic field, and it rapidly loses its magnetic moment by
   cutting off the field. The low coercive force, as well as high magnetic
   saturation with low residue, are represented for the S2 and S3. The
   obtained outcomes indicate that the best amounts of mechanical
   properties amongst the specimens are related to the specimen with 15
   wt\%, 7.9 +/- 1 MPa of compressive strength, and 203.3 +/- 10 MPa of
   elastic modulus. Likewise, the biological assessment shows that the
   sample containing 10 wt\% MNPs provides a better apatite creation on
   porous scaffolds after 28 days. The gained outcomes represent that those
   specimens containing 10 and 15 wt\% MNPs provide proper biological and
   mechanical replies.}},

   Economic Union (EAEU) integrating processes; export support of
   innovative goods and evolution of a single service market through the
   enhanced cooperation are possible. A generalised model for the export
   development of innovative goods and services of the EAEU member states

Abstract = {{This article presents the multiband asymmetric radio frequency (RF) to
   direct current (DC) converter circuit for the wireless power transfer
   (WPT) applications. The proposed circuit is composed of a power divider,
   novel asymmetric multiband matching circuit and RF Schottky diode
   quadrupler voltage rectifier circuit. Unlike the conventional narrow
   band quadrupler using two Greinacher cells with opposite polarities, the
   proposed circuit aims to cover the multifrequency bands, which are the
   cell phone 1.8-2.1 GHz, the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
   bands 2.4-2.5 GHz and 5.725-5.875 GHz. The interested RF input power
   range of -10 to 20 dBm for the WPT application is focused. The measured
   RF-to-DC conversion efficiency (eta) of 50-65\% at 1.8-2.1 GHz, 65\% at
   2.45 GHz and 16\% at 5.8 GHz are obtained at 10 dBm optimal input power.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two-dimensional time-resolved particle image velocimetry
   (2D-TR-PIV) was used to investigate the effect of the external domain on
   oscillating jets from double-feedback fluidic oscillators. Two different
   cases with different Re numbers (2680-10,730), as free external domain
   and fully confined were studied. Time-averaged results showed although a
   self-oscillating jet was attained for the free external domain, it could
   not be achieved for a fully confined geometry. For a fully confined
   geometry at Re = 2680, two symmetric vortices did not allow the jet to
   oscillate and at Re = 6440, the flow pattern in the external region
   became non-symmetric due to the Coanda vortex, subsequently, the
   self-oscillating jet was not observed. At Re = 10,730, the strength of
   the jet was inclined to cope with such vortices and tended to oscillate.
   However, strong vortices were created near the exit region of the
   fluidic oscillator, which led to an almost non-symmetric pattern. In
   addition, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method and
   phase-averaged analysis were applied to obtain the unsteady behavior of
   flow and the most energetic dynamic structure. Interestingly, at Re =
   6440, the third mode was still energetic for fully confined, but for
   other cases, the first two modes were the most energetic modes, which
   showed vigorous coherent structures.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{123}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The main objective is to develop and test a novel SPC method to ensure
   the stability of final customer characteristics by controlling the
   upstream characteristics of manufacturing processes, considering their
   importance/contribution. The originality of the proposed method lies in
   the use of predictive models (multivariate regression), whose
   coefficients are used to weigh the contribution of each upstream
   characteristic to predict the final characteristics. In the context of
   continuous improvement environments, the application of different SPC
   approaches to manufacturing processes were compared. The results showed
   that the multivariate SPC method based on partial least squares
   regression was superior to traditional univariate and multivariate SPC
   methods in terms of the predictive precision to detect downstream faults
   in customer characteristics. However, the use of multiple linear
   regression may also be an option, since the identification of what
   upstream characteristic is causing the out-of-control signal is simpler
   than that of partial least squares regression, and predictive precision
   in the case of each of the two methods is comparable in practical terms.

Title = {{Common-envelope evolution with an asymptotic giant branch star}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{644}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Common-envelope phases are decisive for the evolution of many binary
   systems. Cases with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary stars are of
   particular interest because they are thought to be progenitors of
   various astrophysical transients. In three-dimensional hydrodynamic
   simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO, we study the
   common-envelope evolution of a 1.0 M-circle dot early-AGB star with
   companions of different masses. Although the stellar envelope of an AGB
   star is less tightly bound than that of a red giant, we find that the
   release of orbital energy of the core binary is insufficient to eject
   more than about twenty percent of the envelope mass. Ionization energy
   that is released in the expanding envelope, however, can lead to
   complete envelope ejection. Because recombination proceeds largely at
   high optical depths in our simulations, it is likely that this effect
   indeed plays a significant role in the considered systems. The
   efficiency of mass loss and the final orbital separation of the core
   binary system depend on the mass ratio between the companion and the
   primary star. Our results suggest a linear relation between the ratio of
   final to initial orbital separation and this parameter.}},

Title = {{Disabling MNK protein kinases promotes oxidative metabolism and protects
   against diet-induced obesity}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR METABOLISM}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Diet-driven obesity is increasingly widespread. Its
   consequences pose major challenges to human health and health care
   systems. There are MAP kinase-interacting kinases (MNKs) in mice, MNK1
   and MNK2. Studies have demonstrated that mice lacking either MNK1 or
   MNK2 were partially protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced weight
   gain and insulin resistance. The aims of this study were to evaluate the
   phenotype of mice lacking both MNKs when given an HFD, to assess whether
   pharmacological inhibition of MNK function also protects against
   diet-induced obesity (DIO) and its consequences and to probe the
   mechanisms underlying such protection.
   Methods: Male wild-type (WT) C57B16 mice or mice lacking both MNK1 and
   MNK2 (double knockout, DKO) were fed an HFD or control diet (CD) for up
   to 16 weeks.
   Results: MNK-DKO mice were almost completely protected from HFD-induced
   obesity. Higher energy expenditure (EE) in MNK-DKO mice was observed,
   which probably reflects the changes in a number of genes or proteins
   linked to lipolysis, mitochondria! function/biogenesis, oxidative
   metabolism, and/or ATP consumption. The MNK inhibitor ETC-206 also
   prevented HFD-induced weight gain, confirming that the activity of the
   MNKs facilitates weight gain due to excessive caloric consumption.
   Conclusions: Disabling MNKs in mice, either genetically or
   pharmacologically, strongly prevents weight gain on a calorie-rich diet.
   This finding likely results from increased energy utilisation, involving
   greater ATP consumption, mitochondria! oxidative metabolism, and other
   processes. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The acceleration of economic development and rising standards of living
   have made energy security a top priority for policy makers worldwide.
   The issue of securing energy is particularly challenging for Jordan,
   which suffers from scarcity of natural resources, combined with the
   regional instability and conflicts. Based on desk research and on
   experts' interviews, this study discusses the status quo of the energy
   sector in Jordan, its main challenges, and future aspirations. It thus
   contributes to the debate on how Jordan can ensure environmental,
   economic, social, and political sustainability of its energy sector.
   Jordan's energy security has been historically linked to its relations
   with the neighboring countries and thus vulnerable to external shocks
   and outside political events. Notwithstanding reform efforts to reduce
   dependency from imports and some progress in diversifying the energy
   mix, energy security remains critical: the country imports around 94\%
   of its energy, which represents approximately 10\% of GDP. The growing
   domestic demand, which increases at a yearly rate of 3\%, further adds
   to the pressure to envision strategies towards a more sustainable energy
   sector. These strategies will need to include investment in renewable
   energy, the reduction of energy consumption via increasing energy
   efficiency, and also synergic agreements with other countries. The
   interviewed experts highlighted the importance of governance for the
   successful implementation of these strategies. The creation of an
   enabling environment should go hand in hand with the involvement of all
   key stakeholders from energy and related sectors, into the development
   of a future vision of a sustainable energy sector.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is one of the essential commodities to increase food
   production and economic growth in the world. Food demand is rising day
   by day as a result of population growth. Existing farming techniques are
   not suited for increasing food production. To overcome this issue, we
   use Internet of Things (IoT), which is one of the emerging technologies
   in the agriculture field. Generally, the IoT devices consist of low
   power, low processing and low memory capacity. So, energy plays a
   significant role in extending the lifespan of the network in the
   Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT). To increase the lifetime of the
   network, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Gridbased Data Aggregation
   Scheme in Routing (EGDAS-RPL) protocol for AIoT. It has three processes,
   namely grid formation, grid head (GH) selection and grid head parent
   selection. First, EGDAS-RPL forms the equal-sized grid on the square
   network. Second, it probabilistically selects the GH node within the
   grid. Finally, it considers the metric expected transmission count (ETX)
   to select the optimal GH parent for data transfer. The simulation is
   conducted using the COOJA simulator. The performance of the proposed
   EGDAS-RPL protocol is compared to RPL and E2HRC-RPL, which reduces the
   packet loss ratio and end-to-end delay. Thus, EGDAS-RPL protocol
   increases the lifespan of the network.}},

   nanocomposite for carbendazim determination}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{220}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{For the first time, a nanocomposite based on biochar and reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) was employed to construct a modified carbon paste
   electrode and applied for the determination of carbendazim (CBZ).
   Biochar was obtained by through pyrolysis of Eichhornia crassipes
   biomass, also known how ``Aguapc{''} at 400 degrees C. The modified
   electrode with our nanocomposite proposal shows to be able to
   preconcentrate CBZ and presented the highest analytical response in
   comparison to the unmodified electrode and by the electrodes prepared
   with the proposed materials separately. Using differential pulse
   voltammetry (DPV) under optimized conditions, the sensor showed a linear
   dynamic response (LDR) from 30 to 900 nmol L-1, a limit of detection
   (LOD) of 2.3 nmol L-1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 7.7 nmol L-1.
   No significant influence of inorganic ions or organic compounds on
   sensor response was verified, considering the recovery evaluation data.
   The proposed sensor was successfully applied for the determination of
   CBZ in spiked whole orange juice, lettuce leaves, drinking water, and
   wastewater samples. Good recovery values were found using the ex-situ
   methodology, showing excellent analytical performance of the
   electrochemical sensor based on biochar and rGO nanocomposite.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and photosynthesis performance of cassava during early vegetative
   growth are important determinants of final biomass. The objective of
   this work was to investigate canopy structure and photosynthesis
   performance of four cassava genotypes (Rayong 9, Rayong 11, Kasetsart
   50, and CMR38-125-77) growing under irrigation at 3 and 6 months after
   planting (3MAP and 6MAP). Data for the 3MAP plants were collected from
   cassava planted on 30 June (Rainy PD), 10 November (Cool PD1), and 15
   December (Cool PD2) 2015; and for the 6MAP from those planted on 20
   April 2015 (Hot PD), Rainy PD, and Cool PD1. The plants growing in the
   rainy season had significantly higher leaf area index (LAI) than those
   growing in the cool and hot seasons. Consequently, they had lower
   percentage light penetration at the bottom of canopy, and therefore more
   light interception through the canopy, and hence a higher mean net
   photosynthesis rate (Pn) across the six canopy levels. At the 3MAP,
   which is the stage of maximum rate of leaf and stem growth, the Rainy PD
   and Cool PD2 plants of CMR38-125-77 showed the highest LAI and highest
   mean Pn. Similarly, the Cool PD1 plants of Kasetsart 50 showed the
   highest LAI and highest mean Pn. In contrast, at 6MAP during the stage
   of active starch accumulation in storage roots, the genotypes with the
   highest mean Pn were the ones having an intermediate (CMR38-125-77 for
   the Hot PD) or low LAI (Rayong 9 for the Rainy PD, and CMR38-125-77 for
   the Cool PD1). Data on variations in canopy structure and photosynthesis
   potentials of different cassava genotypes in response to seasonal
   variations may be useful for crop growth modeling and may be employed as
   a criterion for the selection of suitable genotypes for each growing
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: To investigate the association between different
   indicators of body adiposity and TyG in community-dwelling older adults.
   Methods: One hundred and fifty-seven older adults voluntaries in the
   present study. Height, total body mass, waist and hip circumference were
   used to obtain the body mass index (BMI) and 6 other indexes related to
   body fat, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR),
   conicity index, and more recent anthropometric indicators such as the
   body roundness index (BRI) and the body shape index (ABSI). The linear
   regression technique adjusted for sex and age was used. The regression
   model adequacy was verified through the analysis of normality of the
   residues (Kolmogorov-Smir nov test with significance level of p <0.05),
   in addition to the visual inspection to identify extreme observations in
   the histograms of the residues.
   Results: The linear regression analysis indicated that all adiposity
   indicators were significantly associated with TyG. The residue analysis
   indicated a good fit of the regression models obtained for the TyG,
   which could be confirmed by the low standard error values of estimative.
   Waist Circumference, WHR, and WHtR were the predictors with the best
   regression parameters.
   Conclusion: Body adiposity indicators are significantly associated to
   TyG in community-dwelling older adults. Waist Circumference, WHR, and
   WHtR are simple and low-cost anthropometric indicators that seem to be
   promising predictors of TyG, which could be candidate for future studies
   as screening tool for older adults prone to develop insulin resistance.

Abstract = {{A 2(4) full factorial design with four center points was used to

   cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase), and transglutaminase (TGase)
   on dough Mixolab (R) parameters and fresh and stored gluten-free bread
   (GFB) physical properties. Results show that CF and PSY have the
   greatest effects on the investigated variables. CF increases the
   loaf-specific volume and crumb firmness values of fresh GFB, effects of
   increased starch stability (C4) and tendency to starch retrogradation
   (C5). Both PSY and PSY- CF interactions reduce the loaf-specific volume
   and increase the crumb firmness of GFB during storage, effects of an
   increased initial consistency (C1). CF - CGTase interaction reduced
   crumb firmness during storage, and TGase had no effect. High CF-levels
   (75 and 100 g/100 g flour weight basis, fwb) combined with low
   PSY-levels (4.5 and 5.5 g/100 g fwb) resulted in favorable dough
   consistency for increasing loaf volume and crumb softness. Results also
   show that the combination of 75 CF and 5.5 PSY (g/100 g fwb) produces a
   GFB with good physical properties and appearance, reaching values
   comparable to commercially available fresh and stored GFB.}},

Title = {{Nasal function and cardio-respiratory capacity of adolescent with
   external nasal dilator}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: the external nasal dilator (END) has been employed for the
   purpose of aiding sporting performance. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate nasal function and cardio-respiratory capacity in healthy
   adolescent athletes using the END.
   Methods: double-blind, crossover clinical trial in which adolescents
   were evaluated while using the experimental and placebo END during
   physical exercise. Values for peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), nasal
   resistance (NR) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max) were obtained in
   randomized order. Additionally, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE)
   after the cardio-respiratory test was assessed.
   Results: for the 71 adolescents evaluated, the use of the experimental
   END, compared to the placebo, produced a significant improvement in
   values of PNIF (177.4 +/- 20.9 L/min and 172.8 +/- 20.2 L/min) (p =
   0.020), NR (0.24 +/- 0.16 and 0.27 +/- 0.16) (p = 0.007), VO(2)max.
   (39.5 +/- 5.2 mL/kg.min(-1) and 37.5 +/- 5.2 mL/kg.min(-1)) (p < 0.001)
   and RPE (6.0 +/- 2.2 and 5.5 +/- 2.4) (p < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusion: the END reduced NR, increased PNIF and improved VO(2)max. In
   addition, it improved RPE after the maximal cardio-respiratory test. The
   use of the END can significantly improve nasal function, increase
   cardiorespiratory capacity and reduce rating of perceived exertion
   during a maximal test involving adolescent athletes.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration are
   ecosystem services (ESs) provided by urban landscapes that are dominated
   by continuous grass cover, such as residential lawns. Organic matter and
   C sequestration are expected to increase over time, but few studies have
   determined potential soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation from
   residential lawns in semiarid climates. The objectives were to evaluate
   physiochemical attributes of urban soils established under turfgrass
   landscapes of different ages and determine soil factors that
   differentiate urban soils in semiarid climate of Lubbock, TX. Soil
   samples (0-10 cm) were obtained from 10 residential lawns of homes
   built: pre-1970 (oldest), 1971-1990 (middle), 1991-2010 (newer), and
   after 2011 (newest). Soil texture, bulk density, extractable nutrients
   {[}phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and iron
   (Fe)], pH, SOM, SOC, and total nitrogen (TN) were determined. Bulk
   density and pH were highest in newest homes and lowest in oldest homes.
   Increasing years of lawn establishment increased SOM, SOC, and TN
   content. Linear regression determined 0.036 \% annual increase in SOM
   for residential lawns, but SOC accumulated at 0.021 kg C m(2) yr(-1) for
   53.6 yr. In principal component (PC) analysis, SOM, SOC, and TN
   contributed most to PC1 (36.2 \%) reflecting components separating
   residential lawns by years of establishment, and primarily soil texture
   components for PC2 (22.5 \%). The results of this study show that home
   age is a strong determinant of soil carbon content in semiarid urban
   turfgrass systems, with the greatest accumulation threshold in oldest
   homes over 50 years of age.}},

   barrier in sandstorms using simulation and a wind tunnel test}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{.The movement of sand particles and their accumulation on railway tracks
   are among the major problems observed in desert areas, which may impose
   huge maintenance and repair costs. One solution is to create a
   protective barrier in the vicinity of railway tracks to reduce sand
   deposition on these tracks. The present study introduced a triangular
   embankment due to its construction simplicity and low cost and compared
   it with a rigid wall-type barrier. At first, both models were compared
   in terms of the streamline and the sand mass flux with a two-phase flow
   of sandstorm numerical calculations. Then, the sand mass flux was
   measured for the rigid wall-type barrier using an experimental wind
   tunnel test. Moreover, the effects of wind speed, wall height, the
   zero-porosity barrier on the mass flux profile, and the deposition
   reduction of sand particles were examined after the barrier placement.
   Finally, the triangular embankment behavior was studied in a wind
   tunnel. The results revealed that the triangular embankment could
   increase the safe area after the barrier placement by up to 25\%.
   Further, the triangular embankment was proven to be a permanent and
   cost-effective solution for protecting railway tracks in windblown
   sand-prone areas.Graphical abstract}},

Abstract = {{Water level regulates the dynamics of different populations residing in
   water bodies. The increase/decrease in the level of water leads to an
   increase/decrease in the volume of water, which influences the
   interactions of fishes and catching capability. We examine how seasonal
   variations in water level and harvesting affect the outcome of
   prey-predator interactions in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation
   of the water level is introduced in the predation rate. We derive
   conditions for the persistence and extinction of the populations. Using
   the continuation theorem, we determine the conditions for which the
   system has a positive periodic solution. The existence of a unique
   globally stable periodic solution is also presented. Moreover, we obtain
   conditions for the existence, uniqueness and stability of a positive
   almost periodic solution. We find that if the autonomous system has a
   stable focus, the corresponding nonautonomous system exhibits a unique
   stable positive periodic solution. But, whenever the autonomous system
   shows limit cycle oscillations, the corresponding nonautonomous system
   exhibits chaotic dynamics. The chaotic behavior of system is confirmed
   by the positivity of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. For higher values of
   the assimilation fraction of prey population, the persistent
   oscillations of the autonomous system are eliminated and this system
   becomes stable. On the other hand, chaotic nature of the nonautonomous
   system is converted into periodicity if the assimilation fraction of
   prey is large. Moreover, populations behave almost periodically if the
   seasonally varied rate parameters are almost periodic functions of time.
   Our findings show that water level plays an important role in the
   persistence of prey-predator system.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Spiral magnetic resonance imaging acquisition may enable improved image
   quality and higher scan speeds than Cartesian trajectories. We tested
   the performance of four 3D T1-weighted (T1w) TFE sequences
   (magnetization-prepared gradient echo magnetic resonance sequence) with
   isotropic spatial resolution for brain imaging at 1.5 T in a clinical
   patient cohort based on qualitative and quantitative image quality
   metrics. Two prototypical spiral TFE sequences (spiral 1.0 and spiral
   0.85) and a Cartesian compressed sensing technology accelerated TFE
   sequence (CS 2.5; acceleration factor of 2.5) were compared with a
   conventional (reference standard) Cartesian parallel imaging accelerated
   TFE sequence (SENSE; acceleration factor of 1.8). Materials and Methods
   The SENSE (5:52 minutes), CS 2.5 (3:17 minutes), and spiral 1.0 (2:16
   minutes) sequences all had identical spatial resolutions (1.0 mm(3)).
   The spiral 0.85 (3:47 minutes) had a higher spatial resolution (0.85
   mm(3)). The 4 TFE sequences were acquired in 41 patients (20 with and 21
   without contrast media). Three readers rated qualitative image quality
   (12 categories) and selected their preferred sequence for each patient.
   Two readers performed quantitative analysis whereby 6 metrics were
   derived: contrast-to-noise ratio for white and gray matter (CNRWM/GM),
   contrast ratio for gray matter-CSF (CRGM/CSF), and white matter-CSF
   (CRWM/CSF); and coefficient of variations for gray matter (CVGM), white
   matter (CVWM), and CSF (CVCSF). Friedman tests with post hoc Nemenyi
   tests, exact binomial tests, analysis of variance with post hoc Dunnett
   tests, and Krippendorff alphas were computed. Results
   Concerning qualitative analysis, the CS 2.5 sequence significantly
   outperformed the SENSE in 4/1 (with/without contrast) categories,
   whereas the spiral 1.0 and spiral 0.85 showed significantly improved
   scores in 10/9and 7/7 categories, respectively (P's < 0.001-0.039). The
   spiral 1.0 was most frequently selected as the preferred sequence
   (reader 1, 10/15 times; reader 2, 9/12 times; reader 3, 11/13times
   {[}with/without contrast]). Interreader agreement ranged from
   substantial to almost perfect (alpha = 0.615-0.997). Concerning
   quantitative analysis, compared with the SENSE, the CS 2.5 had
   significantly better scores in 2 categories (CVWM, CVCSF) and worse
   scores in 2 categories (CRGM/CSF, CRWM/CSF), the spiral 1.0 had
   significantly improved scores in 4 categories (CNRWM/GM, CRGM/CSF,
   CRWM/CSF, CVWM), and the spiral 0.85 had significantly better scores in
   2 categories (CRGM/CSF, CRWM/CSF). Conclusions
   Spiral T1w TFE sequences may deliver high-quality clinical brain
   imaging, thus matching the performance of conventional parallel imaging
   accelerated T1w TFEs. Imaging can be performed at scan times as short as
   2:16 minutes per sequence (61.4\% scan time reduction compared with
   SENSE). Optionally, spiral imaging enables increased spatial resolution
   while maintaining the scan time of a Cartesian-based acquisition schema.}},

   adaptive control with parallel feedforward compensator and its
   application to rotation control}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{In the design of simple adaptive control (SAC) using almost strictly
   positive real (ASPR), the feedback control system is stabilized by the
   output feedback with a high gain. Although ASPR is not, however,
   generally satisfied, it is achieved by introducing a parallel
   feedforward compensator (PFC). When SAC is designed for the augmented
   system which consists of an actual plant and PFC, not the actual plant
   output but the augmented system output converges to the reference input
   because of the influence of PFC. To resolve the problem, an extension
   method of the conventional SAC is proposed. In the proposed method,
   based on the null-space of an augmented plant, an exogenous input, which
   is independent of the augmented system output, is newly introduced.
   Because the exogenous input is designed so that PFC output is to be 0,
   the actual plant output is the same as the augmented system output in
   the steady state, and as a result, the actual plant output converges to
   the reference input. From a practical application point of view, the
   proposed method can easily improve the control performance of the
   conventional SAC with a PFC. In the proposed method, an exogenous input
   generated as the feedback signal of PFC output is only added to the
   conventional SAC control input. Therefore, the proposed method can be
   applied to various field in which the SAC method has been implemented,
   e.g., process control, mechanical systems, power systems, robotics, and
   others. In the present study, the effectiveness of the proposed method
   is also demonstrated through experiments for a motor control.}},

   we need to pay more attention to the question of how students and
   practitioners could bring physical awareness into their various life

   somatic knowledge into different life contexts, our lives can become
   more embodied and we can tap into the knowledge that emanates from the

Abstract = {{The article suggests discussing the education system of the Rusins in
   Lemkivshchyna during WWII through the prism of scientific discourse. The
   authors show the specificity of socio-political and cultural development
   of the education system in the late 19th - the first half of the 20th
   centuries and describe the essence of the Nazi regime that established
   in Lemkivshchyna from September 1939 to 1944, within which Lemkivshchyna
   was part of the General Government - an administrative-territorial
   entity in Poland and Western Ukraine occupied by Nazi Germany. The focus
   is the local administrative structures - the Ukrainian Central Committee
   and others - functioning on this territory as well as the goals of the
   Nazi education policy. The authors determine the main types, forms, and
   specificity of the education system, which include preschool
   institutions (seasonal and permanent kindergartens, teachers' training,
   etc.), primary education (its universality and compulsoriness; creation
   of a network of public schools, ensuring their functioning), secondary
   schools (gymnasiums, teacher seminaries); vocational training (with
   agriculture, craft, fishing, and trade being the main areas); higher
   school (enrolling the Rusins of Lemkivshchyna in the universities of
   Lviv and Europe and their financial support), and students' social
   security.}},

Title = {{A Closer Look at Exoplanet Occurrence Rates: Considering the
   Multiplicity of Stars without Detected Planets}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{160}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One core goal of the Kepler mission was to determine the frequency of
   Earth-like planets that orbit Sun-like stars. Accurately estimating this
   planet occurrence rate requires both a well-vetted list of planets and a
   clear understanding of the stars searched for planets. Previous
   ground-based follow-up observations have, through a variety of methods,
   sought to improve our knowledge of stars that are known to host planets.
   Kepler targets without detected planets, however, have not been
   subjected to the same intensity of follow-up observations. In this
   paper, we constrain better the stellar multiplicity for stars around
   which Kepler could have theoretically detected a transiting Earth-sized
   planet in the habitable zone. We subsequently aim to improve estimates
   of the exoplanet search completeness-the fraction of exoplanets that
   were detected by Kepler-with our analysis. By obtaining adaptive optics
   observations of 71 Kepler target stars from the Shane 3 m telescope at
   Lick Observatory, we detected 14 candidate stellar companions within 4
   `' of 13 target stars. Of these 14 candidate stellar companions, we
   determine through multiple independent methods that 3 are likely to be
   bound to their corresponding target star. We then assess the impact of
   our observations on exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, finding an
   increase in occurrence of 6\% (0.9 sigma) for various estimates of the
   frequency of Earth-like planets and an increase of 26\% (4.5 sigma) for
   super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These occurrence increases are not
   entirely commensurate with theoretical predictions, though this
   discrepancy may be due to differences in the treatment of stellar
   binarity.}},

   adaptation, validity and reliability of Turkish version}},
Journal = {{MUSCULOSKELETAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of self-assessment questionnaires in addition to
   clinical evaluations is gradually increasing. Liverpool Elbow Scale
   (LES) is an elbow-specific outcome score that provides a comprehensive
   assessment of by both the clinicians and patients. However, it has not
   been adapted and validated to Turkish language.
   Objective: To conduct the translation, cross-cultural adaptation and
   validation of Liverpool Elbow Score-patient answered outcome (LES-PAQ)
   into Turkish for patients with elbow fracture.
   Design: Study of diagnostic accuracy/assessment scale.
   Methods: This study was carried out in three consecutive phases:
   translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation. In the third
   phase, we used the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand
   (Quick-DASH), Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and 12-Item Short Form
   Survey (SF-12) physical health score.
   Results: Sixty-one patients were included for the analysis. Neither a
   ceiling nor a floor effect was observed. Cronbach's alpha coefficient
   was 0.89. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (95\% CI 0.89 to
   0.96; p < 0.001). SEM was 0.28 and MDC95 was 0.79. The LES-PAQ showed a
   high negative correlation with the Quick-DASH (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) and
   high positive correlation with MEPS (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), and with
   SF-12 physical health subscale (r = 0.73, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The Turkish version of the LES-PAQ is a reliable and valid
   tool for the assessment of the patients with elbow fracture.}},

Abstract = {{An 80-year-old male patient presented with sepsis secondary to infected
   central line which was placed for native aortic valve endocarditis. He
   also had melena and abdominal pain prior to his presentation. Abdominal
   computed tomography (CT) was done, which showed cholelithiasis.
   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was also done with no source of bleeding
   identified. Later, he developed hemodynamic instability requiring
   aggressive fluid resuscitation and multiple packed blood cell
   transfusions. In view of his hemodynamic instability, a repeat abdominal
   CT scan showed air droplets within the gallbladder pneumobilia, ascites,
   diverticulosis, and a bleeding infrahepatic hematoma measuring 6 x 10
   cm, which was not on his prior scan 2 days prior. A mesenteric
   arteriogram was performed that identified an aneurysm of the right
   hepatic artery with no active bleeding; therefore, it was coiled. Due to
   his continued clinical decompensation, he underwent an urgent open
   cholecystectomy, in which serosanguineous fluid, cholecystocolic
   fistula, and old clot related to his previous bleed were encountered.
   However, control of bleeding was difficult, and the patient expired. We
   report this case of right hepatic artery aneurysm that we believe its
   etiology was related to eroding cholecystitis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The precise relationship between frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
   and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is incompletely understood. The
   association has been described as a continuum, yet data suggest that
   this may be an oversimplification. Direct comparisons between patients
   who have behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) with and without ALS are rare.
   This prospective comparative study aimed to determine whether there are
   phenotypic differences in cognition and behaviour between patients with
   FTD-ALS and bvFTD alone.
   Methods Patients with bvFTD or FTD-ALS and healthy controls underwent
   neuropsychological testing, focusing on language, executive functions
   and social cognition. Behavioural change was measured through caregiver
   interview. Blood samples were screened for known FTD genes.
   Results 23 bvFTD, 20 FTD-ALS and 30 controls participated. On cognitive
   tests, highly significant differences were elicited between patients and
   controls, confirming the tests' sensitivities to FTD. bvFTD and FTD-ALS
   groups performed similarly, although with slightly greater difficulty in
   patients with ALS-FTD on category fluency and a sentence-ordering task
   that assesses grammar production. Patients with bvFTD demonstrated more
   widespread behavioural change, with more frequent disinhibition,
   impulsivity, loss of empathy and repetitive behaviours. Behaviour in
   FTD-ALS was dominated by apathy. The C9ORF72 repeat expansion was
   associated with poorer performance on language-related tasks.
   Conclusions Differences were elicited in cognition and behaviour between
   bvFTD and FTD-ALS, and patients carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion.
   The findings, which raise the possibility of phenotypic variation
   between bvFTD and FTD-ALS, have clinical implications for early
   detection of FTD-ALS and theoretical implications for the nature of the
   relationship between FTD and ALS.}},

Abstract = {{Optically transparent flexible tag antennas are highly desired for some
   applications, where unobtrusiveness and capability of mounting on curved
   surfaces are required. On the other hand, circular polarization
   minimizes signal degradation due to polarization mismatch between the
   reader and tag antennas, thus ensuring good communication quality and
   accuracy. In this letter, we present an optically transparent and
   flexible radio frequency identification passive tag antenna operating in
   the ultrahigh frequency band and exhibits circular polarization. It is
   thin, lightweight, and completely encapsulated inside transparent
   polymer, which protects it against dust, water, heat, and mechanical
   stress. The tag antenna is made by utilizing highly flexible and
   transparent conductive-mesh-polymer composite through a simple and
   low-cost manufacturing process. The antenna design is based on a planar
   square ring. It achieves a measured maximum read range of about 8.3 m
   and approximately 47 MHz (885-932 MHz) 3 dB axial-ratio bandwidth
   (ARBW).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Takotsubo syndrome mimics acute myocardial infarction (MI)
   at presentation.
   Objectives: To explore differences in ECG time-course that could further
   help distinguish the two conditions.
   Methods: Serial ECG's (day 0-4) of 27 acute takotsubo and 37 MI
   patients, all presenting with anterior ST-elevation, were analysed for
   detailed morphology and timing of de/re-polarisation. All underwent
   cardiac magnetic resonance.
   Results: The presenting ECG (day 0) showed significantly fewer total
   abnormal leads (p = .001), comparable number of ST-elevation leads but
   lesser total magnitude of ST-elevation (p = .003), smaller sum of
   positive T wave amplitude (p = .006) and lesser number of pathological Q
   waves (p = .005) in takotsubo vs the MI group. After day 0, takotsubo
   patients developed more widespread T wave inversion (p = .001, day 3)
   and/or deeper T waves compared to MI, (sum of the T-wave amplitude slope
   of change between days 0-3: -43.1 +/- 9.6 vs - 16.6 +/- 5.4 mm, p =
   .02). Although there was no difference in mean QTc between the groups on
   any day, between days 0-3 there was a progressive increase in QTc in
   takotsubo vs a decrease in MI (34.1 +/- 12.2 vs-29.5 +/- 9.3 ms, slope
   of change p <.001). There was significantly more myocardial oedema
   (native T1 mapping) in takotsubo vs MI (p = .02), which resulted in
   increased left ventricular mass index in takostubo (p = .04).
   Conclusions: The differences in presenting (day 0) ECG between takotsubo
   and MI are significant but subtle, reinforcing the importance of acute
   cardiac catheterisation for accurate diagnosis. During the next 3 days
   there is progressive increase in the depth and spread of T-waves and QTc
   duration in takotsubo vs MI - these may aid the diagnostic confidence in
   patients with bystander non-obstructive coronary disease. (C) 2020

   measure. It was found that oxygen saturation and deoxy-hemoglobin are
   slightly better descriptors of sustained fatigue, than oxy-hemoglobin,

Title = {{MiRNA-200c, MiRNA-139 and ln RNA H19; new predictors of treatment
   response in H-pylori- induced gastric ulcer or progression to gastric
   cancer}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer and
   progression to gastric cancer could be attributed to altered
   inflammatory/immunological response and associated differential
   non-coding RNAs expression signatures. However, co-expression profiling
   of lncRNA-miRNAs in GU/GC patients are scarcely focused on. Therefore,
   in the present study the expression of H19 and related miRNAs including
   miR-139, and miR-200 were assayed in the plasma samples of treatment
   responsive GU vs nonresponsive GC patients. This study is a case-control
   study carried out on 130 subjects recruited from the Gastrointestinal
   Endoscopy Unit in AlKasr Al-Aini Hospital, in Egypt. All recruited
   patients were diagnosed with H-pylori infection, 50 of them were gastric
   cancer patients (GC), with previous H-pylori induced gastric ulcer but
   were treatment non-respondent. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate
   the expression level of serum non-coding RNA; miRNA-200c, miR139, Ln RNA
   H19 in patients with peptic ulcer treatment non-respondent, who
   progressed to GC vs non progressed gastric ulcer patients (GU) (n = 50),
   and compared to early diagnosed H-pylori-gastric ulcer patients (n =
   30). The association between these miRNAs and the FGF-18/FGF-R signaling
   indicators of H-pylori GC pathogenesis were then investigated.
   Results: showed that the H19 level was significantly elevated while
   miR-139 and miR-200c expression were significantly down-regulated in GC
   patients, compared to GU participants (P < 0.01). The herein
   investigated ncRNAs are correlated to the disease duration with Ln H19
   being significantly correlated with all inflammatory markers; TNF-alpha,
   INF-gamma, TAC, MMP-9, and FGF18/FGFR2. A significant correlation was
   also observed between miRNA 200c and each of miRNA 139 and FGFR2.
   Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that miRNA 200c showed the highest AUC
   (0.906) and 81.2\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Moreover, the
   combined analysis of miRNA 200c/miRNA 139 revealed superior AUC (0.96)
   and 93\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity, than each separately. As for
   discriminative accuracy between stages III to IV of gastric cancer,
   LncRNA H19 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy (95.5\%), specificity
   (100\%), and sensitivity (90.9\%). The current study demonstrated that
   the combination of serum miRNA 200c/miRNA 139 expression levels
   (down-regulation) could provide a new potential prognostic panel for GU
   predictive response and potential sequelae. In conclusion, LncRNA H19
   and related miRNAs, miRNA 200c/miRNA 139, could serve as a potential
   diagnostic biomarker for early gastric cancer diagnosis.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new definition for burnout and investigates the
   psychometric properties of the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT). In a prior
   qualitative study, 49 practitioners were interviewed about their
   conceptualization of burnout (part 1). Using a dialectical approach,
   four core dimensions-exhaustion, mental distance, and impaired emotional
   and cognitive impairment-and three secondary dimensions-depressed mood,
   psychological distress, and psychosomatic complaints-emerged, which
   constitute the basis of the BAT. In the second study, the psychometric
   characteristics of the BAT were investigated in a representative sample
   of 1500 Flemish employees, focusing on factorial validity, reliability,
   and construct validity, respectively. Results demonstrate the assumed
   four-factor structure for the core dimensions, which is best represented
   by one general burnout factor. Contrary to expectations, instead of a
   three-factor structure, a two-factor structure was found for the
   secondary dimensions. Furthermore, the BAT and its subscales show
   adequate reliability. Convergent validity and discriminant validity with
   other burnout measures-including the MBI and OLBI-was demonstrated, as
   well as discriminant validity with other well-being constructs, such as
   work engagement and workaholism.}},

   the cubic Klein-Gordon equation partial derivative U-2(t)-Delta
   U+m(2)U=Gamma(x)U-3 on R x R-3, which are weakly localized in space.
   Various families of such `breather' solutions are shown to bifurcate
   from any given nontrivial stationary solution. The construction of
   weakly localized breathers in three space dimensions is, to the author's
   knowledge, a new concept and based on the reformulation of the cubic
   Klein-Gordon equation as a system of coupled nonlinear Helmholtz
   equations involving suitable conditions on the far field behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Shared sanitation facilities (SSFs) have contributed considerably to
   sanitation access in many low-income settlements. While many SSFs are of
   unacceptable quality, others have been found to be a hygienically safe
   and a socially and economically viable sanitation option. Within its
   framework, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), evaluating
   progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, considers shared
   sanitation as `limited sanitation'. Overall, there is uncertainty about
   the criteria to distinguish between unacceptable and acceptable quality
   of SSF. In our study, we used a user-centred qualitative approach in
   low-income urban settlements in Kumasi (Ghana), Kisumu (Kenya) and Dhaka
   (Bangladesh) and conducted 17 focus group discussions to evaluate how
   SSF users define the quality of an SSF and which aspects they consider
   as essential priorities for good-quality SSF. In descending order, the
   user priorities identified are: immediate water access, cleanliness,
   gender-separated toilets, flush toilets, lighting for use at night,
   lockable/functional doors, tiling, handwashing stations and privacy.
   This list can serve as input to the sanitation guidelines, local
   building codes and the establishment of minimum national sanitation
   standards. SSFs that meet these minimal criteria can then be promoted as
   an incremental step when individual household facilities are not
   feasible.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of remote patient monitoring platforms to support the
   postoperative care of solid organ transplant recipients is evolving. In
   an observational pilot study, 28 lung transplant recipients were
   enrolled in a novel postdischarge home monitoring program and compared
   to 28 matched controls during a 2-year period. Primary endpoints
   included hospital readmissions and total days readmitted. Secondary
   endpoints were survival and inflation-adjusted hospital readmission
   charges. In univariate analyses, monitoring was associated with reduced
   readmissions (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]: 0.56; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.41-0.76; P < .001), days readmitted (IRR: 0.46; 95\%
   CI: 0.42-0.51; P < .001), and hospital charges (IRR: 0.52; 95\% CI:
   0.51-0.54; P < .001). Multivariate analyses also showed that remote
   monitoring was associated with lower incidence of readmission (IRR:
   0.38; 95\% CI: 0.23-0.63; P < .001), days readmitted (IRR: 0.14; 95\%
   CI: 0.05-0.37; P < .001), and readmission charges (IRR: 0.11; 95\% CI:
   0.03-0.46; P = .002). There were 2 deaths among monitored patients
   compared to 6 for controls; however, this difference was not
   significant. This pilot study in lung transplant recipients suggests
   that supplementing postdischarge care with remote monitoring may be
   useful in preventing readmissions, reducing subsequent inpatient days,
   and controlling hospital charges. A multicenter, randomized control
   trial should be conducted to validate these findings.}},

Title = {{Patient-specific computed tomography-based finite element analysis: a
   new tool to assess fracture risk in benign bone lesions of the femur}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most benign active and latent lesions of proximal femur do
   not predispose a patient to a pathologic fracture. Nonetheless, there is
   a tendency to perform internal fixation due to the lack of accurate
   clinical tools that may reliably confirm low risk of pathologic
   fracture. As many as 30\% of these surgeries may be unnecessary. A
   patient-specific CT-based finite element analysis may quantify bone
   strength and risk of fracture under normal weight-bearing conditions.
   Methods: The clinical relevance of such finite element analysis was
   investigated in a retrospective study on a cohort of 17 patients. Finite
   element analysis results (high risk = indication for surgery, low or
   moderate risk = follow-up) were compared to actual clinical decisions
   (surgery vs follow-up). All patients predicted by the finite element
   analysis as high risk underwent internal fixation and had good outcomes
   (n = 6).
   Findings: Four of the 11 low- and moderate-risk finite element analysis
   patients (36\%) were operated immediately, and seven (64\%) were either
   operated after a delay of at least 6 months or were never operated. None
   sustained a pathologic fracture. Patients who were predicted as low
   fracture risk by finite element analysis remained fracture-free for a
   minimal period of 6 months. Prediction of high risk of pathologic
   fracture by finite element analysis was in complete agreement with the
   conventional clinical evaluation.
   Interpretation: We consider finite element analysis a promising decision
   support system for the management of patients with benign tumors of
   femur, and that it may reliably endorse the decision to withhold surgery
   for patients at low fracture-risk.}},

   Properties}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{We present X-SHOOTER near-IR spectroscopy of a large sample of 38
   luminous (M-1450 = -29.0 to -24.4) quasars at 5.78 z < 7.54, which have
   complementary {[}C ii](158 mu m) observations from ALMA. This
   X-SHOOTER/ALMA sample provides us with the most comprehensive view of
   reionization-era quasars to date, allowing us to connect the quasar
   properties with those of its host galaxy. In this work we introduce the
   sample, discuss data reduction and spectral fitting, and present an
   analysis of the broad emission line properties. The measured Fe ii/Mg ii
   flux ratio suggests that the broad-line regions of all quasars in the
   sample are already enriched in iron. We also find the Mg ii line to be
   on average blueshifted with respect to the {[}C ii] redshift with a
   median of -391 km s(-1). A significant correlation between the Mg
   ii-{[}C ii](158 mu m) and C iv-{[}C ii](158 mu m) velocity shifts
   indicates a common physical origin. Furthermore, we fRequently detect
   large C iv-Mg ii emission line velocity blueshifts in our sample with a
   median value of -1848 km s(-1). While we find all other broad emission
   line properties not to be evolving with redshift, the median C iv-Mg ii
   blueshift is much larger than found in low-redshift, luminosity-matched
   quasars (-800 km s(-1)). Dividing our sample into two redshift bins, we
   confirm an increase of the average C iv-Mg ii blueshift with increasing
   redshift. Future observations of the rest-frame optical spectrum with
   the James Webb Space Telescope will be instrumental in further
   constraining the possible evolution of quasar properties in the epoch of
   reionization.}},

   training protocol included initial explant porcine models followed by
   live human cases, proctored by a single endoscopist experienced in POEM
   who prospectively graded trainees for each step ({''}skill{''}) of the
   procedure on a 5-point scale. Procedural skills were divided into
   cognitive and technical skills. Acceptable passing level was considered
   a score >= 4 for each skill. Results Three trainees completed a total of
   18 cases (8 cases on animal explant models and 10 human cases). Overall,
   cognitive skills were acquired early in training with scores of >= 4
   achieved by <= 3 cases. Technical skills required more cases and
   direction with scores >= 4 in technical skills achieved by three porcine
   and eight human cases. Entry of the endoscope into the submucosal space
   and submucosal tunneling were the most challenging steps followed by
   myotomy. Conclusion This pilot study introduces a POEM training and
   skills evaluation tool for training to competency. Submucosal entry,
   tunneling, and myotomy were the most challenging to learn while
   cognitive skills were learned early in training. Evaluation of more
   trainees at multiple sites will be necessary to further validate the
   utility of this tool.}},

Abstract = {{Companies can create value by differentiating their products and
   services along quantitative attributes. Existing research suggests that
   consumers' tendency to rely on relatively effortless and affect-based
   processes reduces their sensitivity to the scope of quantitative
   attributes and that this explains why increments along quantitative
   attributes often have diminishing marginal value. The current article
   sheds new light on how ``system 1{''} processes moderate the effect of
   quantitative product attributes on subjective value. Seven studies
   provide evidence that system 1 processes can produce diminishing
   marginal value, but also increasing marginal value, or any combination
   of the two, depending on the composition of the choice set. This is
   because system 1 processes facilitate ordinal comparisons (e.g., 256 GB
   is more than 128 GB, which is more than 64 GB) while system 2 processes,
   which are relatively more effortful and calculation based, facilitate
   cardinal comparisons (e.g., the difference between 256 and 128 GB is
   twice as large as between 128 and 64 GB).}},

Title = {{Umami potential of Nordic squid (Loligo forbesii)}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GASTRONOMY AND FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nordic squid (Loligo forbesii) cuts of mantle, arms, fins, and liver
   were investigated for their umami taste potential. The cuts were
   analysed raw, and additional samples of cooked mantle (sous vide, 30 min
   at 55 degrees C) and a corresponding cooking liquid were included in the
   study. The samples were prepared in analytical as well as biological
   triplicate, analysed for content of free amino acids (n = 17) and free
   5'-mononucleotides (n = 5), wherefrom the equivalent umami concentration
   (EUC) was calculated. It was found that the squid liver contains the
   highest amount of umami-specific compounds (Glu = 462 mg/100 g, XMP = 22
   mg/100 g; EUC = 2.3 x 10(4) mg/100 g) followed by cooked mantle (EUC =
   3.5 x 10(3) mg/100 g) > raw mantle (EUC = 3.3 x 10(3) mg/100 g) > fins
   (EUC = 2.3 x 10(3) mg/100 g) > arms (EUC = 1.7 x 10(3) mg/100 g) >
   cooking liquid (EUC = 82 mg/100 g), with all values referring to wet
   weight. In addition, high contents of sweet-tasting free amino acids
   Pro, Ala, and Gly were found but in significantly lower amounts after
   cooking. Thus, from the perspective of taste, a variety of cuts from
   squid may advantageously be used for cooking, the liver constituting a
   particularly great potential in terms of umami taste. However, special
   attention should be given to the method of preparation of the cuts of
   squid (mantle, arms, and fins) due to the high content of collagen.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of research on terrorism and countering violent extremism
   (CVE) has increasingly questioned the lack of attention to-and myths
   around-women involved in extremist and political violence, while other
   research has drawn attention to racial and religious stereotypes that
   affect national security policies and practices worldwide. While Canada
   is often heralded as a global leader in multiculturalism and gender
   equality, the nation's national security sector still faces significant
   challenges around implicit biases related to race and gender. This study
   asks whether gender and racial stereotypes impeding counterterrorism and
   CVE in other countries are also affecting policies and practices in
   Canada. Using twenty-six in-depth interviews with practitioners, police
   officers, academics, and government officials from seven major cities
   across Canada, this paper argues that persistent gender and racial
   stereotypes are indeed a key challenge impeding Canada's efforts to
   adequately address radicalization into and disengagement from extremist
   violence.}},

Journal = {{NUTRIENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Single and/or combined food intolerance/malabsorption may cause
   nonspecific, functional gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. In
   lactose-intolerant patients we evaluated the influence of additional
   food intolerance/malabsorption with hydrogen (H-2) breath tests. In a
   retrospective analysis of charts from 279 lactose-intolerant patients,
   we found 128 patients with only lactose intolerance (LIT). Then, we
   identified 106 LIT patients with additional histamine intolerance (HIT).
   Additionally, 45 LIT and HIT patients also had fructose malabsorption
   (FM). A hydrogen (H-2) breath test was performed to evaluate LIT and FM.
   A serum diamine oxidase value of <10 U/mL and a response to a
   histamine-reduced diet was used to identify HIT. Using pairwise
   comparison with the Kruskal-Wallis test to associate the area under the
   curve (AUC) of LIT patients and, LIT with HIT, to LIT with HIT and FM it
   was found, that the exhaled hydrogen values were significantly higher in
   patients with two-fold and triple combined food
   intolerance/malabsorption (p < 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively).
   Within the pool of 170 LIT patients with >20 ppm increase of expiratory
   H-2 from baseline, there were 74 LIT-only patients, 60 LIT with HIT
   patients, and 36 LIT patients with additional HIT and FM. With the
   Kruskal-Wallis test AUCs demonstrated a significant difference between
   all three groups (p = 0.024). In patients with LIT, the presence of
   additional food intolerance/malabsorption, significantly increases
   expiratory H-2 values. We demonstrate evidence, which may suggest HIT to
   embody an own GI disorder as food intolerance/malabsorption.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS-X}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Supersaturation profiles of amorphous indomethacin in aqueous solution
   containing 0.4 wt\% and 4 wt\% of isopropanol were predicted by
   combining separately-determined kinetics for dissolution, solution
   crystallization, and solid-state transformation. The kinetics of
   solid-state transformation were measured and compared to various data
   from the literature. The proposed kinetic model accounts for
   dissolution, solution crystallization and amorphous-to-crystalline
   solid-state transformation. It was validated for different initial
   amounts of amorphous and crystalline material and systems with different
   isopropanol contents. Furthermore, the influence of polyethylene glycol
   on the supersaturation behavior was investigated. The results clearly
   show the robustness of the model and give insight into the interplay of
   dissolution, solution crystallization, and solid-state transformation
   of. In particular, the influence of solid-state transformation on the
   overall supersaturation profile was elucidated in a quantitative manner.
   An amorphicity function phi(t) is proposed to account for the kinetics
   of the solid-state transformation. Its general form could be derived
   consistently from different sets of experimental data and seems to be
   independent of the particle size of the amorphous material and
   hydrodynamic conditions. This work is among the first of its kind to
   successfully integrate dissolution, crystallization from solution and
   solid-state transformation in a model that shows good predictability.}},

Abstract = {{Confounding by unmeasured spatial variables has received some attention
   in the spatial statistics and causal inference literatures, but concepts
   and approaches have remained largely separated. In this paper we aim to
   bridge these distinct strands of statistics by considering unmeasured
   spatial confounding within a causal inference framework and estimating
   effects using outcome regression tools popular within the spatial
   literature. First, we show how using spatially correlated random effects
   in the outcome model, an approach common among spatial statisticians,
   does not necessarily mitigate bias due to spatial confounding, a
   previously published but not universally known result. Motivated by the
   bias term of commonly-used estimators, we propose an affine estimator
   which addresses this deficiency. We discuss how unbiased estimation of
   causal parameters in the presence of unmeasured spatial confounding can
   only be achieved under an untestable set of assumptions which will often
   be application specific. We provide a set of assumptions which describe
   how the exposure and outcome of interest relate to the unmeasured
   variables, and we show that this set of assumptions is sufficient for
   identification of the causal effect based on the observed data when
   spatial dependencies can be represented by a ring graph. We implement
   our method using a fully Bayesian approach applicable to any type of
   outcome variable. This work is motivated by and used to estimate the
   effect of county-level limited access to supermarkets on the rate of
   cardiovascular disease deaths in the elderly across the whole
   continental United States. Even though standard approaches return null
   or protective effects, our approach uncovers evidence of unobserved
   spatial confounding and indicates that limited supermarket access has a
   harmful effect on cardiovascular mortality.}},

Title = {{How is satisfaction with food-related life conceptualized? A comparison
   between parents and their adolescent children in dual-headed households}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},

Abstract = {{Satisfaction with food-related life (SWFRL) is one component of
   satisfaction with life. Although researchers have identified
   associations between satisfaction with food-related life and specific
   food behaviours, it is still not clear how consumers conceptualize this
   complex construct. The aims of the present study were to explore
   consumers' conceptualization of SWFRL, to compare how parents and
   adolescents in dual-headed households perceive SWFRL, and to identify
   aspects that would increase their SWFRL. One-hundred and sixty-four dual
   families composed of mother, father, and at least one adolescent child
   between 10 and 17 years of age participated in the study. They completed
   a word association task with ``Being satisfied with my food-related
   life{''} and completed the sentence ``I would be more satisfied with my
   food-related life if ... ``. Participants' responses were aligned with
   the formal definition of SWFRL. References to specific foods and food
   characteristics were also mentioned in the word association task. No
   significant differences were found between parents and adolescents in
   the frequency of mention of responses related to the identified
   categories and supra-categories, suggesting lack of differences in their
   conceptualization of SWFRL. Changes in eating behaviours and
   individuals' resources for purchasing and preparing foods were regarded
   as the main factors that could increase SWFRL. Differences between
   family members were found in some of the aspects associated with an
   increase in SWFRL. Results from this study can aid in the development of
   strategies for promoting changes in eating habits and increasing SWFRL,
   targeted at different family members.}},

Title = {{Quantification of nematic cell polarity in three-dimensional tissues}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   Cell polarity enables cells to carry out specific functions. Cell
   polarity is characterized by the formation of different plasma membrane
   domains, each with specific composition of proteins, phospholipids and
   cytoskeletal components. In simple epithelial sheets, or tube-like
   tissues such as kidney, epithelial cells are known to display a single
   apical domain, facing a lumenal cavity, and a single basal domain on the
   opposite side of the cell, facing a basal layer of extracellular matrix.
   This apico-basal polarity defines a vector of cell polarity, which
   provides a direction of fluid transport, e.g., from the basal side of
   the sheet to the lumen-facing side. In more complex, three-dimensional
   epithelial tissues, such as liver tissue with its complex network of
   blood-transporting sinusoids, the membrane domains of hepatocyte cells
   display more intricate patterns, including rings and antipodal pairs of
   apical membrane. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to precisely
   characterize and quantify complex polarity patterns. Thereby, we reveal
   ordered patterns of cell polarity that span across a liver lobule. Our
   new method builds on physical concepts originally developed for ordered
   phases of liquid crystals. It provides a versatile tool to characterize
   the spatial organization of a complex three-dimensional tissue.
   How epithelial cells coordinate their polarity to form functional
   tissues is an open question in cell biology. Here, we characterize a
   unique type of polarity found in liver tissue, nematic cell polarity,
   which is different from vectorial cell polarity in simple, sheet-like
   epithelia. We propose a conceptual and algorithmic framework to
   characterize complex patterns of polarity proteins on the surface of a
   cell in terms of a multipole expansion. To rigorously quantify
   previously observed tissue-level patterns of nematic cell polarity
   (Morales-Navarette et al., eLife 2019), we introduce the concept of
   co-orientational order parameters, which generalize the known biaxial
   order parameters of the theory of liquid crystals. Applying these
   concepts to three-dimensional reconstructions of single cells from
   high-resolution imaging data of mouse liver tissue, we show that the
   axes of nematic cell polarity of hepatocytes exhibit local coordination
   and are aligned with the biaxially anisotropic sinusoidal network for
   blood transport. Our study characterizes liver tissue as a biological
   example of a biaxial liquid crystal. The general methodology developed
   here could be applied to other tissues and in-vitro organoids.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Fixation of scaphoid nonunion with a volar locking plate and cancellous
   bone grafting has been shown to be a successful technique in small
   series. Few mid- or long-term follow-up studies have been reported. The
   aim of this study was to report the mid-term radiological and functional
   outcome of plate fixation for scaphoid nonunion.
   Methods
   Patients with a scaphoid nonunion were prospectively enrolled and
   treated with open reduction using a volar approach, debridement of the
   nonunion, and fixation using a locking plate and cancellous bone
   grafting, from the ipsilateral iliac crest. Follow-up included
   examination, functional assessment using the patient-rated wrist/hand
   evaluation (PRWHE), and multiplanar reformation CT scans at three-month
   intervals until union was confirmed.
   Results
   A total of 49 patients with a mean age of 31 years (16 to 74) and a mean
   duration of non-union of 3.6 years (0.4 to 16) were included.
   Postoperatively, the nonunion healed in 47 patients (96\%) as shown on
   CT scans. The mean time to union was 4.2 months (3 to 12). Due to
   impingement of the plate on the volar rim of the radius and functional
   limitation, the hardware was removed in 18 patients. At a median
   follow-up of 38 months in 34 patients, the mean active range of motion
   (ROM) improved significantly from 89 degrees to 124 degrees (SD 44
   degrees; p = 0.003). The mean grip strength improved significantly from
   52\% to 79\% (SD 28\%; p < 0.001) of the contralateral side. The mean
   PRWHE score improved significantly from 66 to 17 points (SD 25; p <
   0.001).
   Conclusion
   Locking plate fixation supplemented with autologous cancellous bone
   grafting is a successful form of treatment for scaphoid nonunion.
   Functional outcomes improve with the passage of time, and mid-term
   results are excellent with a significant improvement in ROM, grip
   strength, and functional outcome as measured by the PRWHE.}},

   titanate oxide cells in battery management systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries play a major role for the reliability and safety
   of the energy supply in vehicle power networks. Battery management
   systems (BMS) are needed to monitor the battery's inner states, such as
   state of charge or state of available power. State-of-the-art algorithms
   running on a BMS cannot fulfill all today's requirements completely such
   as qualification for an automotive safety integrity level,
   implementation on low-cost hardware, adaption to different kinds of
   aging effects and minimized excitation in a vehicle's power network. In
   this paper a new approach for online parameter estimation of a battery
   model for a lithium-ion battery with titanate oxide anode is presented.
   The approach combines simple mathematical equations and low memory
   consumption while still adapting dynamically to different aging effects.
   In order to handle different types of excitation in the power network,
   three methods are suggested for analyzing the battery behavior in the
   time and frequency domain. The algorithms are validated utilizing real
   driving profiles applied to aged batteries. Therefore, calendric and
   cyclic battery aging tests were carried out for about two years and up
   to 100,000 equivalent full cycles. The frequency-based methods are
   advantageous in terms of impedance parameter tracking while the methods
   using time-domain parameterization data benefit in terms of time
   predictions. All proposed methods show promising results regarding
   voltage predictions independent of the battery's state of health.}},

   study demonstrates that additional species, currently placed in the
   genus Ischnochiton Gray, 1847, are better placed in Subterenochiton.
   Ischnochiton luteoroseus Suter, 1907, 1. albinus Thiele, 1911, and 1.
   granulifer Thiele, 1909 are newly reclassified as belonging to
   Subterenochiton due to their overwhelming similarities with the type
   species, Ischnochiton gabrieli Hull, 1912. These 4 small, elongate-oval
   species share characters that allow us to emend the definition of the
   genus. These characters include a more or less well-pronounced tegmentum
   granulation; a weakly defined articulamentum with small insertion plates
   in all valves (slit formula: many/I/many); a weakly developed, unslitted
   jugal plate; a short radula with a slender, keeled central tooth; a
   unicuspidate head of the second lateral tooth; and a slender, distally
   more or less pointed major uncinal tooth ventrally bearing a strong
   lamella on its shaft. In addition, species of Subterenochiton all have
   calcified spherules on the dorsal girdle scales, even though their
   distribution on the individual scales differs among the taxa.
   Furthermore, we conclude that Ischnochiton bednalli Torr. 1912, which in
   the past was erroneously interpreted as a species of Subterenochiton,
   should better classified under the leptochitonid genus Terenochiton
   Iredale, 1914.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The aim of the present retrospective
   single-center study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of
   contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for assessing Bosniak III complex
   renal cystic lesions with histopathological validation. Materials and
   Methods: 49 patients with CEUS-categorized Bosniak III renal cystic
   lesions were included in this retrospective study. All patients
   underwent native B-mode, Color Doppler, contrast-enhanced ultrasound
   (CEUS) between 2010-2020. Eight and five patients underwent computed
   tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively.
   Twenty-nine underwent (partial) nephrectomy allowing for
   histopathological analysis. The applied contrast agent for CEUS was a
   second-generation blood pool agent. Ultrasonography examinations were
   performed and interpreted by a single experienced radiologist with more
   than 15 years of experience (EFSUMB Level 3). Results: CEUS examinations
   were successfully performed in all included patients without registering
   any adverse effects. The malignancy rate of CEUS-categorized Bosniak III
   renal lesions accounted for 66\%. Initially, cystic complexity was
   visualized in native B-mode. In none of the renal lesions
   hypervascularization was detected in Color Doppler. CEUS allowed for
   detection of contrast enhancement patterns in all included Bosniak III
   renal lesions. Delayed wash-out could be detected in 6/29 renal lesions.
   In two cases of histopathologically confirmed clear-cell RCC,
   appropriate up-grading from Bosniak IIF to III was achieved by CEUS.
   Conclusions: CEUS depicts a promising imaging modality for the precise
   diagnostic workup and stratification of renal cystic lesions according
   to the Bosniak classification system, thereby helping guidance of
   adequate clinical management in the future.}},

Title = {{Infection as a Cardiovascular Trigger: Associations Between Different

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1437-1443}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Infection may be an acute precipitant of cardiovascular
   events. However, the relationships between different types of infection
   and cardiovascular events are less known. Our objective was to determine
   if exposure to infections of different organ systems in different time
   periods increases risk of myocardial infarction or venous
   thromboembolism.
   METHOD: We used case-crossover analysis with conditional logistic
   regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) for the association for each
   infection type during 3 case periods (30, 60, and 90 days prior to index
   event) compared with control periods (exactly 1 year before).
   RESULTS: This study had a total number of index admissions of 338,021
   individuals, of which 82,986 were female; the mean age for individuals
   with myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolism was 68.48 years
   and 62.33 years, respectively. With every infection type, there was an
   increased likelihood of venous thromboembolism. The greatest association
   was for skin infections, with an OR of 5.39 (95\% confidence interval,
   4.08-7.12) within the 7-day window. The association between myocardial
   infarction and skin infections was of lesser magnitude, with an OR of
   2.89 (confidence interval, 1.97-4.24) in the 7-day exposure period.
   CONCLUSION: We found a gradient of decreasing magnitudes of association
   with longer time periods, across the majority of infection types and
   cardiovascular events. This warrants potential interventions to prevent
   infection or cardiovascular disease prophylaxis in individuals with
   infection. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Distribution}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the four-parameter kappa
   distribution (K4D) is known to be occasionally unstable for small sample
   sizes and to be very sensitive to outliers. To overcome this problem,
   this study proposes Bayesian analysis of the K4D. Bayesian estimators
   are obtained by virtue of a posterior distribution using the random walk
   Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Five different priors are considered. The
   properties of the Bayesian estimators are verified in a simulation
   study. The empirical Bayesian method turns out to work well. Our
   approach is then compared to the MLE and the method of the L-moments
   estimator by calculating the 20-year return level, the confidence
   interval, and various goodness-of-fit measures. It is also compared to
   modeling using the generalized extreme value distribution. We illustrate
   the usefulness of our approach in an application to the annual maximum
   wind speeds in Udon Thani, Thailand, and to the annual maximum
   sea-levels in Fremantle, Australia. In the latter example,
   non-stationarity is modeled through a trend in time on the location
   parameter. We conclude that Bayesian inference for K4D may be
   substantially useful for modeling extreme events.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FUNGI}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Trichophyton rubrum is causing an increasing number of invasive
   infections, especially in immunocompromised and diabetic patients. The
   fungal invasive infectious process is complex and has not yet been fully
   elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the cellular and
   molecular mechanisms during the interaction of macrophages and T.
   rubrum. For this purpose, we used a co-culture of previously germinated
   and heat-inactivated T. rubrum conidia placed in contact with human
   macrophages cell line THP-1 for 24 h. This interaction led to a higher
   level of release of interleukins IL-6, IL-2, nuclear factor kappa beta
   (NF-kappa B) and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, demonstrating the cellular defense by macrophages against
   dead fungal elements. Cell viability assays showed that 70\% of
   macrophages remained viable during co-culture. Human microRNA expression
   is involved in fungal infection and may modulate the immune response.
   Thus, the macrophage expression profile of microRNAs during co-culture
   revealed the modulation of 83 microRNAs, with repression of 33 microRNAs
   and induction of 50 microRNAs. These data were analyzed using
   bioinformatics analysis programs and the modulation of the expression of
   some microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. In silico analysis showed that
   the target genes of these microRNAs are related to the inflammatory
   response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, drug resistance, and cell
   proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with stochastic scheduling of production and
   maintenance activities in a permutation flow shop setting. We present a
   two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program (SMIP) that adapts the
   conventional permutation flow shop scheduling problem for incorporating
   multiple preventive maintenance activities with various meter-based
   intervals. The model handles uncertainties in both processing times and
   the duration of maintenance activities. The concept of combining
   maintenance activities in scheduling problems is introduced and
   formulated, along with other practical considerations. The objective is
   to minimize the total expected cost associated with lateness penalties
   and maintenance resources. We use simulation-optimization (SO) for
   solving large-scale instances of the problem, and for validating the
   SMIP model. Through extensive computational experiments, we show that
   the SO method is superior in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and
   evaluate its sensitivity to the input data. Finally, a case study in
   earth-moving operations is presented, followed by managerial
   implications.}},

Abstract = {{Replicated research has not identified the impact of augering feed on
   the pellet quality, feed segregation, and resulting bird performance;
   therefore, 2 experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was conducted to
   determine the effects of pellet-to-fine ratios (P:F; 55:45 or 75:25) and
   liquid application method (LAM; mixer liquid application method {[}MLAM]
   or postpellet liquid application method {[}PPLAM] addition of fat and
   phytase) on feed segregation, after augering, throughout a commercial
   feed line. Samples for each augered diet were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 32,
   44, and 58 m on the feed line. After augering, each diet was retained by
   a feed pan location (FPL) from 0 to 30 and 32 to 58 m for experiment 2,
   to determine the effects of P:F, segregation, and FPL on day 28 to 56
   performance and day 57 processing. Augering PPLAM diets increased
   percent pellets vs. MLAM diets. An FPL X P:F interaction found decreased
   percent pellets when augering from 0 to 15 and 44 to 58 m; 55:45 P:F
   diets had no change from 15 to 44 m; 75:25 P:F diets fluctuated. An LAM
   X P:F X FPL interaction showed decreased day 28 to 42 BW gain (BWG) for
   the MLAM and 75:25 P:F diets across FPL vs. PPLAM and 75:25 P:F diets.
   In addition, an LAM X P:F X FPL interaction demonstrated that the PPLAM
   affected day 56 BW uniformity by the FPL. The 75:25 P:F diet improved
   the BWG, as well as carcass and total breast weight. These data verify
   physical and nutrient (phytase) segregation occurs during augering and
   subsequently affects performance; future research should examine the
   specific nutrient segregation due to augering and the resulting impact
   on bird performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend screening all
   systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients for pulmonary arterial hypertension
   (PAH) with yearly echocardiograms. There is a paucity of evidence to
   support these guidelines.
   Research question: Can a prediction model identify SSc patients with a
   very low probability of PAH and therefore not requiring annual screening
   echocardiogram?
   Study design and methods: We performed a case-control study of 925
   unselected SSc subjects nested in a multi-centered, longitudinal cohort.
   The probability of PAH for each subject was calculated using the results
   of multivariate logistic regression models. A cut-off was identified for
   the estimated probability of PAH below which no subject developed PAH
   (100\% sensitivity).
   Results: Study subjects were predominantly female (87.5\%), with mean
   (SD) age 58.6 (11.7) years and disease duration of 18.2 (12.2) years.
   Thirty-seven subjects developed PAH during 5407.97 person-years of
   observation (incidence rate 0.68 per 100 person-years). Shortness of
   breath (SOB), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and
   NT-proBNP were independent predictors of PAH. All SSc-PAH cases had a
   probability of PAH of >1.1\%. Subjects below this cut-off, none of whom
   had PAH, accounted for 46.2\% of the study population.
   Interpretation: A simple prediction model identified subjects at very
   low probability of PAH who could potentially forego annual screening
   echocardiogram. This represents almost half of SSc subjects in a general
   SSc population. This study, which is the first evidence-based study for
   the rational use of follow-up echocardiograms in an unselected SSc
   cohort, requires validation. The scoring system is freely available

Abstract = {{Humidity and temperature monitors have wide industrial applications in
   many areas such as automobile industry, food processing and evaluation
   of plastic encapsulations in IC packaging. However, most of these
   monitors had limited functionality. Hence, this paper was proposed new
   features that can detect, notify, record and control the humidity and
   temperature instantaneously in order to have stable, controllable
   atmospheric conditions. This research was used of temperature humidity
   sensor DHT-11 to detect level of humidity and temperature changes inside
   the room. The data and information from DHT-11 sensor will be analysed
   graphically on Blynk platform using NodeMCU. Humidifier will be attached
   at this monitor to stabilize back the atmospheric conditions when a
   specific humidity level must be maintained to prevent static electricity
   build up, preserve material properties, and ensure a comfortable and
   healthy environment for workers or residents in industries. In this
   paper, the value of temperature and humidity changes can be seen through
   graph and gauge in Blynk software application. The relative humidity
   level will be decrease as the temperature increase. Humidifier triggered
   when the reading of temperature and humidity is less than 20\% and more
   than 80\%. Through the mobile application, it can review and read the
   previous readings and histories from the temperature and humidity

   Cr3C2 Co cermets. The cermets were subjected to the annealing process at
   three different temperatures of 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C, and 1000
   degrees C for a constant soaking time of 4 h to study their thermal
   stability. All the cermets' compositions showed good thermal stability
   up to 800 degrees C and 55\% TiCN - 15\% SiC - 5\% TiN - 5\% Cr3C2-10\%
   Co - 10\% B4C cermets showed better thermal stability up to 1000 degrees
   C. There was a change in microstructure and formation of the oxide
   phases in the cermets during the high temperature (1000 degrees C)
   annealing process and overall lead to a decrease in hardness. The
   sintered cermets were also subjected to sliding wear in the pin on disk
   apparatus. EN31 steel disk was used as a counter disk. The wear testing
   was done at different loads (20 N, 25 N, 30 N, 35 N) and at different
   sliding velocity (0.55 m/s, 1 m/s, 1.5 m/s, 2 m/s) with a constant track
   distance of 1000 m. Wear rate was at its highest value of 9.74 x 10(-7)
   mm(3)/Nm for the cermet 65\% TiCN - 15\% SiC - 5\% TiN 5\% Cr3C2-10\% Co
   and the lowest wear rate noted was 1.18 x 10(-7) mm(3)/Nm for cermet
   55\% TiCN - 15\% SiC 5\% TiN - 5\% Cr3C2-10\% Co - 10\% B4C and the B4C
   addition has improved the wear resistance of the cermets.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of missing persons in Colombia has been analyzed from
   different perspectives throughout the years. The most recent official
   numbers given by the National Center for Historical Memory (Centro
   Nacional de Memoria Historica {[}CNMH]) provides an approximate number
   of 60,630 missing persons from 1970 to 2015. During this time,
   participants in the armed conflict performed different types of violence
   to one another, including torturing, disapperances, and multiple
   incidents of combat between militant groups and the Colombian National
   Army. Formerly, the agencies tasked with investigating these crimes were
   focused primarily on the cause and manner of death; identification was
   not the main purpose, leaving hundreds of unidentified victims buried in
   different cemeteries around the Colombian territory. The aim of this
   article is to provide a broad perspective of the dimension of the
   missing persons in Colombia, highlighting the achievements that have
   been made so far, presenting an example from the unidentified victims
   buried and recovered from ``La Resurreccion{''} cemetery in Granada
   (Colombia) and analyzed by a specialized forensic team of the National

Abstract = {{Background: Ascites in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) is
   uncommon. We studied the etiology and natural history of ascites and
   risk factors of post-bleeding ascites in children with EHPVO.
   Methods: All admitted EHPVO patients with clinically detectable ascites
   and/or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in previous 6 weeks were analysed.
   Subjects with ascites were classified as post-bleeding ascites and
   de-novo ascites (no GI bleeding) Post-bleeding ascites group was
   compared with controls (GI bleeding without ascites) for risk factors of
   developing ascites.
   Results: Of the total 307 analysed EHPVO patients, 26\% (n = 79) had
   ascites. Majority (n = 66, 83\%) were post-bleeding ascites and 17\% (n
   = 13) had de-novo ascites due to secondary causes. Risk factors of
   ascites in post-bleeding ascites (n = 56) versus controls (n = 188) were
   younger age of disease onset, lower height z-scores and greater
   reduction in serum protein, albumin and hemoglobin from baseline
   non-bled state. 32\%, 39\%, and 29\% of patients with post-bleeding
   ascites had ascites resolution with salt restriction, additional
   diuretics and large volume paracentesis respectively.
   Conclusions: Majority of ascites in EHPVO children is after GI bleeding
   where early age of disease onset, large volume of blood loss and poor
   nutritional status are risk factors. Overall outcome of EHPVO with
   ascites is favourable. (C) 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana

Abstract = {{In this study, new water-soluble carbon dots (CDs) were fabricated by
   hydrothermal treatment methods using Seville orange (Citrus aurantium)
   and ion sensor potential of its was investigated. The as-prepared CDs
   were characterized morphologically, structurally and optically with

   average 4.8 nm with TEM images. FTIR, XRD and XPS measurements confirmed
   the presence of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen atoms and groups such as
   hydroxyl and carboxyl in the structure of CDs. It was determined that
   CDs were selective towards Fe3+ ions among different metal ions with
   fluorescence measurements and limit of detection of Fe3+ ion was found
   as 0.53 mu M. It were revealed by interference studies that no metal ion
   and anion used affect the Fe3+ ion selectivity of CDs. Real sample tests
   were performed with tap and ground water samples showed that CDs can be
   used efficiently for practical applications. All results reflected that
   these newly synthesized CDs act selectivity and sensitivity in detecting

Title = {{Assessing the Interplay of Shape and Physical Parameters by Unsupervised
   Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{313-327}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article presents an exploratory study on the application to ship
   hydrodynamics of unsupervised nonlinear design-space dimensionality
   reduction methods, assessing the interaction of shape and physical
   parameters. Nonlinear extensions of the principal component analysis
   (PCA) are applied, namely local PCA (LPCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). An
   artificial neural network approach, specifically a deep autoencoder
   (DAE) method, is also applied and compared with PCA-based approaches.
   The data set under investigation is formed by the results of 9000
   potential flow simulations coming from an extensive exploration of a
   27-dimensional design space, associated with a shape optimization
   problem of the DTMB 5415 model in calm water at 18 kn (Froude number, Fr
   = .25). Data include three heterogeneous distributed and suitably
   discretized parameters (shape modification vector, pressure distribution
   on the hull, and wave elevation pattern) and one lumped parameter (wave
   resistance coefficient), for a total of 9000 x 5101 elements. The
   reduced-dimensionality representation of shape and physical parameters
   is set to provide a normalized mean squared error smaller than 5\%. The
   standard PCA meets the requirement using 19 principal
   components/parameters. LPCA and KPCA provide the most promising
   compression capability with 14 parameters required by the
   reduced-dimensionality parametrizations, indicating significant
   nonlinear interactions in the data structure of shape and physical
   parameters. The DAE achieves the same error with 17 components. Although
   the focus of the current work is on design-space dimensionality
   reduction, the formulation goes beyond shape optimization and can be
   applied to large sets of heterogeneous physical data from simulations,
   experiments, and real operation measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)-based hydrogels, with shear stress
   response and drug releasing properties, can be formulated simply by TEOS
   hydrolysis followed by volume corrections with aqueous solvents and pH

   colloidal aggregation of nanoparticulate silica. Herein, we investigated
   the effects of the nanoparticulate building blocks on the drug release
   properties of these materials. Our data indicate that the age of the
   hydrolyzed TEOS used for the formulation impacts the nanoparticulate
   structure and stiffness of thixogels. Moreover, the mechanism of
   formation or the disturbance of the nanoparticulate network
   significantly affects the release profiles of the incorporated drug.
   Collectively, our results underline the versatility of these basic,

   characteristics of stressed and non-stressed FeSe monolayers.
   Transmission spectra, current-voltage characteristic (CVC) and
   differential conductivity spectra of two-dimensional FeSe nanostructure
   have been calculated within the framework of the density functional
   theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions (DFT + NEGF). It has been
   shown that the electrophysical properties depend on the geometry of the
   sample, the substrate, and the lattice constant. On CVC of non-stressed
   sample in the range from -1.2 V to -1 and from 1.2 V to 1.4 V. a region
   of negative differential resistance (NDR) has been observed. NDR is at
   both signs of the applied voltage due to the syirunetty of the
   nanostructure. d(2)I/dV(2) is used to detennine the nature of the
   electron-phonon interaction and the features of quasiparticle tunnelling
   in stressed and non-stressed samples. The results obtained can be useful

Abstract = {{This study is focused on the relationships between the kappa-Cygnid
   meteor shower and different groups of asteroids crossing the Earth's
   orbit (the so-called near-Earth objects (NEOs)). The analysis is based
   on the visible structure of the meteor shower and a comprehensive
   strategy for estimating the proximity of orbits of two bodies. The
   kappa-Cygnid meteor shower (abbreviated as KCG) is observed from August
   3 to August 25 every year; it is classified as a minor shower, and the
   size of its mean orbit is around 3.2 AU, while the geocentric velocity
   is 20.9 km/s. No parent body (PB) of the shower has been found among
   comets so far. Relationships between the shower and asteroids, as
   potential PBs of the shower, are under active examination; some
   hypotheses on this subject can be found on the website of the Meteor
   Data Center (MDC) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to provide a review concept regarding the relationship
   between corporate governance and corporate sustainability in Indonesia.
   This paper examines the mechanisms and guidelines for implementing good
   corporate governance. This research used the literature review method
   and explores some effective corporate governance principles such as
   transparency, accountability, responsibility, independence, fairness,
   and equality to achieve business sustainability in Indonesia's setting.
   The results show that good corporate governance regulation in Indonesia
   has been improved, but the enforcement is still needed to be optimized
   because good corporate governance will positively impact corporate
   sustainability. Thus, sustainability requires more corporate innovation
   because sustainability is about how a company can create profits and
   value-added to society through corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   programs and how the company can contribute to the preservation of
   nature and the environment. In Indonesia, the board of directors, the
   board of commissioners, and the audit committees are positively related
   to CSR disclosure. Thus, leadership and management efforts are crucial.
   However, to comprehensively support the synergy of implementing good
   corporate governance, we need the role of the state, the business
   community, and society. This study provides important insights into the
   implementation of good corporate governance in achieving corporate
   sustainability in Indonesia.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{372}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel computational framework for the solution of
   geometrically parametrised flow problems governed by the Stokes
   equation. The proposed method uses a high-order hybridisable
   discontinuous Galerkin formulation and the proper generalised
   decomposition rationale to construct an off-line solution for a given
   set of geometric parameters. The generalised solution contains the
   information for all the geometric parameters in a user-defined range and
   it can be used to compute sensitivities. The proposed approach
   circumvents many of the weaknesses of other approaches based on the
   proper generalised decomposition for computing generalised solutions of
   geometrically parametrised problems. Four numerical examples show the
   optimal mesh convergence properties of the proposed method and
   demonstrate its applicability in two and three dimensions, with
   particular emphasis on parametrised flows in microfluidics. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {{Chitosan supported nano zero valent iron (nZVI/CS) was used as a
   catalyst to improve biohydrogen production. Dark fermentation was
   carried out by Enterobacter aerogenes using glucose as a carbon source
   under mesophilic condition at 37 degrees C. TEM analysis confirmed the
   morphological arrangement of nano sized zero valent iron embedded on
   chitosan. The highest biohydrogen yield was 243 mLH(2)/g(glucose) which
   was 30\% higher than the control. The corresponding initial pH was 6.8
   and optimum nZVI/CS concentration was identified as 150 mg/L. Volatile
   fatty acids (VFA) distribution indicated the acetic pathway was
   undertaken to produce biohydrogen resulting in a positive correlation
   between hydrogen yield and acetic acid concentration. The presence of
   propionic acid and ethanol has negatively affected the hydrogen yield.

Abstract = {{Dispersion is a serious issue related to the integrity of data
   transmission in high-speed optical fiber communication systems. Fiber
   Bragg gratings (FBGs) are among the most important components used to
   reduce dispersion in these systems. FBGs are simple, and have low-cost
   filter for wavelength selection, low insertion loss and customized
   reflection spectrum, and wide bandwidth. This study investigates the
   optical transmission system performance of a symmetric FBG for
   dispersion compensation. Transmission scheme simulation is analyzed with
   different parameters based on an OptiSystem simulator. Symmetric FBG and
   avalanche photodetector are used to enhance the evaluation of an optical
   transmission system. Optical fiber length, attenuation coefficient,
   input power, bit rate, and FBG grating length parameters are also
   investigated in detail to determine system optimization. The developed
   simulation design demonstrated high gain, low noise figure, substantial
   output power, and high Q-Factor for long transmission distance of up to
   60 km with 0.2 dB/km attenuation coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{Truck and shovel are the most common raw material transportation system
   used in the cement quarry operations. One of the major challenges
   associated with the cement quarry operations is the efficient allocation
   of truck and shovel to the mining faces. In order to minimize the truck
   and shovel operating cost, subject to quantity and quality constraints,
   the mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model for truck and shovel
   allocation to mining faces for cement quarry is presented. This model is
   implemented using the optimization IDE tool GUSEK (GLPK under SciTE
   Extended Kit) and the GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) standalone
   solver. The MILP model is applied to an existing cement quarry
   operation, the Kohat cement quarry located at Kohat (Pakistan) as a case
   study. The analysis of the results of the relating case study reveals
   that significant gains are achievable through employing the MILP model.
   The results obtained not only show a significant cost reduction but also
   help in achieving a better coordination among the quarry and quality
   department.}},

Title = {{Does Point-of-Care Ultrasound Affect Outcomes in Pediatric Patients with

Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is increasing evidence for the use of point-of-care
   ultrasound (POCUS) in pediatric patients with skin and soft tissue
   infections (SSTI), but there is a lack of sufficient data on its impact
   on SSTI outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine whether
   POCUS use is associated with fewer complications after discharge from
   the pediatric emergency department.
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study in patients presenting to
   the emergency department with SSTI between the ages of 2 months and 19
   years old. Adverse outcomes included hospitalization after discharge,
   change in antibiotics, subsequent procedures, or reevaluation by a
   medical professional. Outcome information was obtained 1 week later.
   Descriptive statistics and chi(2) tests were used.
   Results: Of 456 patients screened, 250 were enrolled. POCUS was
   performed on 113 (45\%) patients. The median age was 5 years, with more
   females in the non-POCUS group compared with the POCUS group (58\% vs.
   52\%). Cellulitis without abscess was more commonly diagnosed in the
   POCUS group than in the non-POCUS group (26\% vs 14\%, P = 0.02.) The
   patients in the non-POCUS group were more likely to undergo incision and
   drainage than those in the POCUS group (62\% vs 45\%, P = 0.008).
   Overall, a greater number of patients in the POCUS group did not undergo
   any procedure (45\% vs 27\%, P = 0.003). The outcomes at 1 week did not
   differ significantly between the two groups.
   Conclusions: POCUS use may lead to fewer procedures, but it does not
   lead to significantly better outcomes. Large randomized controlled
   trials are needed to confirm or refute our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) based index
   modulation (IM), referred here as SC-IM, allows users to implicitly

   transmission over the activated subcarriers. This sparse use of
   subcarriers provides better energy efficiency and error rate. Using
   these benefits, this letter exploits SC-IM with uplink power domain
   non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where all users with the same
   allocated subcarrier set can simultaneously transmit their SC-IM data
   with different power levels, which are exploited by the receiver to
   perform multi-user detection. Performance of the proposed technique is

Abstract = {{In the present article, transfer efficiency of graphyne's family members
   as Idarubicin drug delivery systems is evaluated by a combined density
   functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation approaches in the
   liquid water. The density functional theory computations such as
   Non-Covalent Interaction methodology allow the classification of the
   interatomic interaction of drug molecule with nanosheet as a weak
   interaction with the adsorption strength value of -81.305 kJ/mol. The
   density functional theory calculations approve the physical nature of
   Idarubicin anti-cancer drug interaction with graphydine nanosheet. It is
   found that graphydine as a good drug delivery vector can carry and
   deliver Idarubicin drug into the cells without significant changes in
   the structural and electronic properties of drug molecule in the
   delivery process. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of Idarubicin
   loading on the graphyne-3 nanosheet is investigated utilizing molecular
   dynamics simulation. It is observed that drug molecules move toward the
   nanocarrier at the initial time of simulation and adsorb with the
   parallel orientation relative to the nanosheet surface. Furthermore,
   molecular dynamics simulation is applied to explore the effects of
   electric field (magnitude and direction) on the adsorption of Idarubicin
   drugs on the nanosheet surface. It is found that when the electric field
   is introduced into the simulation system in z- and xy-directions, the
   van der Waals interaction energy value shows the increasing trend. In
   other words, the interaction between the adsorbed drug and nanosheet can
   be strengthened by applying the electric fields in z- and xy-directions.

Journal = {{THERIOGENOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{84-96}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Heat stress (HS) occurs when temperatures exceed a physiological range,
   overwhelming compensatory mechanisms. Most mammalian testes are similar
   to 4-5 degrees C cooler than core body temperature. Systemic HS or
   localized warming of the testes affects all types of testicular cells,
   although germ cells are more sensitive than either Sertoli or Leydig
   cells. Increased testicular temperature has deleterious effects on sperm
   motility, morphology and fertility, with effects related to extent and
   duration of the increase. The major consequence of HS on testis is
   destruction of germ cells by apoptosis, with pachytene spermatocytes,
   spermatids and epididymal sperm being the most susceptible. In addition
   to the involvement of various transcription factors, HS triggers
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause apoptosis of
   germ cells and DNA damage. Effects of HS on testes can be placed in
   three categories: testicular cells, sperm quality, and ability of sperm
   to fertilize oocytes and support development. Various substances have
   been given to animals, or added to semen, in attempts to ameliorate heat
   stress-induced damage to testes and sperm. They have been divided into
   various groups according to their composition or activity, as follows:
   amino acids, antibiotics, antioxidant cocktails, enzyme inhibitors,
   hormones, minerals, naturally produced substances, phenolic compounds,
   traditional herbal medicines, and vitamins. Herein, we summarized those
   substances according to their actions to mitigate HS' three main
   mechanisms: oxidative stress, germ cell apoptosis, and sperm quality
   deterioration and testicular damage. The most promising approaches are
   to use substances that overcome these mechanisms, namely reducing
   testicular oxidative stress, reducing or preventing apoptosis and
   promoting recovery of testicular tissue and restoring sperm quality.
   Although some of these products have considerable promise, further
   studies are needed to clarify their ability to preserve or restore
   fertility following HS; these may include more advanced sperm analysis
   techniques, e.g. sperm epigenome or proteome, or direct assessment of
   fertilization and development, including in vitro fertilization or
   breeding data (either natural service or artificial insemination). (C)

Abstract = {{The good rate capability and longer cyclic performance are the two key
   features electrochemical capacitors that are highly dependent on the
   electrochemical stability, structure, electrical conductivity,
   composition, and nature of the charge storing-mechanism involved by its
   electrodes. Herein, we fabricated layered Co(OH)(2) and their
   nanocomposite with carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 5\%) via a two-step approach
   for electrochemical applications. The as-prepared nanocomposite based
   electrode displays good specific capacitance (Cs), negligible capacity
   fade, and promising rate capability on electrochemical tests via a
   three-electrode configuration. More precisely, the nanocomposite based
   electrode showed Cs of 802 Fg(-1) at 0.5 Ag-1 and loss just 3.8\% of its
   initial capacitance (at 1st cycle) after 5000 cyclic tests. Furthermore,
   the nanocomposite electrode lost around 14\% of its initial capacitance
   on increasing the current density from 0.5 to 5 Ag-1 that reveals its
   novel rate capability. The observed superior electrochemical aptitude of
   the fabricated nanocomposite is credited to the layered nanoarchitecture
   of the Co(OH)(2) and CNTs matrix. The CNTs-matrix, because of their
   lower properties, performs multiple roles to improve the supercapacitive
   performance of the whole composite. Firstly, they accelerate the charge
   transfer within the nanocomposite matrix due to its higher electrical
   conductivity. Secondly, they facilitate mass transport due to its hollow
   structure. Thirdly, they sandwich between the layers of Co(OH)(2) and
   suppress the stacking process. Fourthly, the added CNTs itself act as a
   capacitive supplement and further improve the specific capacitance of
   the nanocomposite. Finally, CNTs buffers the whole nanocomposite against
   the volume expansion during the continuous cyclic tests. The
   electrochemical and structural stability of Co(OH)(2)/CNTs sample was
   also evaluated by EIS and PXRD characterizations after electrochemical
   tests. The acquired result showed that fabricated nanocomposite has
   great potential for advanced energy storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider the problem of signal detection in
   generalized spatial modulation (GSM) using deep neural networks (DNN).
   We propose a novel modularized DNN architecture that uses small sub-DNNs
   to detect the active antennas and complex modulation symbols, instead of
   using a single large DNN to jointly detect the active antennas and
   modulation symbols. The main idea is that using small sub-DNNs instead
   of a single large DNN reduces the required size of the NN and hence
   requires learning lesser number of parameters. Under the assumption of
   i.i.d Gaussian noise, the proposed DNN detector achieves a performance
   very close to that of the maximum likelihood detector. We also analyze
   the performance of the proposed detector under two practical conditions:
   i) correlated noise across receive antennas and ii) noise distribution
   deviating from the standard Gaussian model. The proposed DNN-based
   detector learns the deviations from the standard model and achieves
   superior performance compared to that of the conventional maximum
   likelihood detector.}},

Abstract = {{The article examines export techniques, strategies, and promoting
   Ukrainian goods to the market of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th -
   early 20th centuries. That historical period was chosen not by chance,
   but because there was a rapid economic recovery in Ukraine then.
   Although there was no a state but Ukrainian was part of the Russian
   Empire, a corporate community of Ukrainian entrepreneurs (representative
   organizations) was formed, and Ukrainian lands became the leading
   production region of the empire, it linked all those involved in trade
   relations with grains, sugar, coal, and mineral resources. The excess of
   production over the volume of the domestic consumer market encouraged
   entrepreneurs to export these goods, primarily to the nearest foreign
   markets. The market of the Ottoman Empire was determined as a priority
   in that respect. The study of the export direction of commercial
   activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs became possible as a result of
   attracting a wide range of sources including ``Government and business
   statistical directories, office documents of representative
   organizations, articles from periodicals of that time, archival
   materials{''}. Export techniques of Ukrainian businessmen were analyzed
   in the article as one of the components of business culture, and
   consists in introducing organizational and logistical techniques for
   export tasks, studying global experience, and using the most successful
   and effective mechanisms to influence the process of invading foreign
   markets. The paper shows that Ukrainian entrepreneurs had resorted to a
   variety of tools to promote their products including renting space in
   Turkey and participating in the ``Floating Exhibition{''}. The article
   concludes that, despite all efforts, Ukrainian entrepreneurs lost in
   competition with more developed countries and they had to pay attention
   to the increased domestic demand. The idea of Ukrainian trade and
   industry to organize a permanent trade mission in Istanbul in the form
   of a chamber of commerce, which originated in the early 20th century, it
   is implemented at the present stage of mutually beneficial partnership
   between Ukraine and Turkey.}},

Title = {{Scale quickly or fail fast: An inductive study of acceleration}},
Journal = {{TECHNOVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accelerators are a fast-growing form of entrepreneurship support.
   Literature about them remains descriptive and disjointed. While some
   consider them new, others believe them to be a next-generation incubator
   model. Based on a qualitative inductive study in India, with inputs from
   both accelerator executives and founders of accelerated ventures, we
   shift the analysis from the form (accelerator) to its underlying
   mechanism (acceleration). We identify at least three characteristics
   that make acceleration unique: a focus on product-market fit ventures; a
   focus on time-compressed scaling; and a focus on aggressive scalability
   testing. Our findings call for a shift in entrepreneurship support
   research (including accelerators) from ``form{''} to ``mechanism.{''}
   Entrepreneurs will find our three characteristics useful in assessing
   which programs truly accelerate, and therefore increase their chances of
   achieving scale. Accelerator executives can now distinguish their
   offerings from other support forms (e.g. incubators) by searching for
   ventures with product-market fit, offering time-compressed scaling
   services and testing the ventures' ability to scale rapidly. University
   administrators and policymakers can use the findings to add acceleration
   (to support scaling) as a component of their entrepreneurial ecosystems.
   Implications and future research directions are discussed.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{It is known that the nucleation of liquid crystal polymers with
   orientation interactions can reduce the energy barrier during the
   polymer crystallization. In this work, we combine the SCFT and string
   method to explore the nucleation and liquid crystal behavior of rod-coil
   block copolymers. By examining nucleation transitions from cylinders
   with different directions to lamellae, we obtain the information of
   critical nuclei for the first time, including the volume, shape and
   energy barrier. We further investigate the impacts of orientation
   interactions along different transition paths. The results show that if
   the cylinder and lamellae have inconsistent directions, the nucleation
   will occur with relatively longer transition path and multiple
   reorientations, and thus leading to higher energy barrier. Nucleation
   under different Flory-Huggins interactions and nucleation via precursory
   metastable structures are investigated, and compared with the classical
   nucleation theory. This work develops the nucleation studies for complex
   block copolymers with segment orientations, which is helpful for
   understanding the nucleation of liquid crystal polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Developing sulfur cathodes with high catalytic activity on accelerating
   the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and
   unveiling their mechanisms are pivotal for advanced lithium-sulfur
   (Li-S) batteries. Herein, MoS2 is verified to reduce the Gibbs free
   energy for rate-limiting step of sulfur reduction and the dissociation
   energy of lithium sulfide (Li2S) for the first time employing
   theoretical calculations. The MoS2 nanosheets coated on mesoporous
   hollow carbon spheres (MHCS) are then reasonably designed as a sulfur
   host for high-capacity and long-life Li-S battery, in which MHCS can
   guarantee the high sulfur loading and fast electron/ion transfer. It is
   revealed that the shuttle effect is efficiently inhibited because of the
   boosted conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the coin cell based on the
   MHCS@MoS2-S cathode exhibits stable cycling performance maintaining
   735.7 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. More importantly, the pouch
   cell employing the MHCS@MoS2-S cathodes achieves high specific capacity
   of 1353.2 mAh g(-1) and prominent cycle stability that remaining 960.0
   mAh g(-1) with extraordinary capacity retention of 79.8\% at 0.1 C after
   170 cycles. Therefore, this work paves a new avenue for developing
   practical high specific energy and long-life pouch-type Li-S batteries.

Abstract = {{Taking into account the dephasing process in the realistic atomic
   ensemble, we theoretically study the generation of atomic spin squeezing
   via atomic coherence induced by the coupling and probe fields. Using the
   Heisenberg-Langevin approach, we find that the perfect spin squeezing in
   the X component can be obtained while the coupling and probe fields
   produce the maximum coherence between the ground state sublevels 1 and
   2. Moreover, the degree of atomic spin squeezing in the X component can
   be strengthened with the increasing atomic density and/or Rabi frequency
   of the mixing field. The theoretical results provide a
   proof-of-principle demonstration of generating the atomic spin squeezing
   via quantum coherence in the realistic atomic ensemble which may find
   potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the shaping and mechanical performance of Ti6Al4V alloys

   Consequently, the carbon and oxygen contents decreased from 4064 ppm to
   2341 ppm and from 3507 ppm to 2879 ppm, respectively. The improvement of
   relative density from 94\% to 97\% was also achieved with PW/SA coating.
   Relatively dense microstructure was observed. Besides, the as-sintered
   sample also exhibited comprehensive mechanical properties, about 1029
   MPa in tensile strength, 967 MPa in yield strength, and 6.4\% in
   elongation. The present method showed good potential for fabricating

Abstract = {{This paper aims to examine the death penalty in Zoroastrianism, the
   Quran, and the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran. By studying antient
   Zoroastrian texts, we face a variety of crimes and punishments such as
   murder, robbery, adultery, magic, rape, and assault that were always
   considered to be the worst offenses. Zoroastrian religious scholars
   wrote books on crimes and their punishment in this world and the
   hereafter. Islam, like all other divine religions, regards the death
   penalty as a permissible and sometimes obligatory punishment for the
   perpetrators of capital offenses, while in other cases it prohibits the
   death penalty and considers it a grave sin. The Islamic penal system
   strives to confront offenses and injustice and eliminate corruption.
   This paper discusses the differences and similarities between the crimes
   that lead to the death penalty in pre-Islamic Iran, the Quran, and the

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) porous laser-guided graphene (LGG) electrodes on
   elastomeric substrates are of great significance for developing flexible
   functional electronics. However, the high sheet resistance and poor
   mechanical properties of LGG sheets obstruct their full exploitation as
   electrode materials. Herein, we applied 2D MXene nanosheets to
   functionalize 3D LGG sheets via a C-O-Ti covalent crosslink to obtain an
   LGG-MXene hybrid scaffold exhibited high conductivity and improved
   electrochemistry with fast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate
   due to the synergistic effect between LGG and MXene. Then we transferred
   the obtained hybrid scaffold onto PDMS to engineer a smart, flexible,
   and stretchable multifunctional sensors-integrated wound bandage capable
   of assessing uric acid (UA), pH, and temperature at the wound site. The
   integrated UA sensor exhibited a rapid response toward UA in an extended
   wide range of 50-1200 mu M with a high sensitivity of 422.5 mu A mM(-1)
   cm(-2) and an ultralow detection limit of 50 mu M. Additionally, the pH
   sensor demonstrated a linear Nernstian response (R-2 = 0.998) with a
   high sensitivity of -57.03 mV pH(-1) in the wound relevant pH range of
   4-9. The temperature sensor exhibited a fast and stable linear resistive
   response to the temperature variations in the physiological range of
   25-50 degrees C with an excellent sensitivity and correlation
   coefficient of 0.09\% degrees C-1 and 0.999, respectively. We anticipate
   that this stretchable and flexible smart bandage could revolutionize
   wound care management and have profound impacts on the therapeutic
   outcomes.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives It is not clearly known whether some benign (simple) ovarian
   cysts can convert into cancerous cysts. Size of cyst and wall
   abnormalities do predict the potentiality of malignancy. Not many
   studies have been done to explore the malignant potential of large-sized
   (> 5 cm) unilocular ovarian cysts without wall abnormalities. This study
   evaluated the correlation between ultrasonographic size of benign
   ovarian cysts and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) levels.
   Methodology Sixty (60) premenopausal women were recruited for the study
   preoperatively, based on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) findings present
   in the case record sheet received along with the CA-125 sample in the
   biochemistry laboratories. Those cases with elevated CA-125 levels were
   selected, where patients had unilocular ovarian cysts without wall
   abnormalities. CA-125 was done using ECLIA methodology (Cobas e411,
   Germany). Statistical correlation was calculated between the ovarian
   cyst size and CA-125 levels using Spearman's Rho coefficient.
   Results Mean age group of subjects were 29.7 7.3 years and mean value of
   CA-125 (normal < 35 IU/mL) was found to be increased: 118.0 +/- 147.1
   IU/mL so was the mean diameter of cysts (cut off <= 5 cm): 48.6 +/- 59.8
   cm. No correlation was found between CA-125 levels and volume of ovarian
   cyst ( r = 0.005, p = 0.680) for all subjects.
   Conclusions The lack of correlation between size of ovarian cysts and
   CA-125 levels provides a hint that the ovarian cyst epithelium does not
   directly express CA-125 and it may come from sites like the fallopian
   tube. Thus, raised level of CA-125 in benign ovarian cyst should be
   followed-up more closely, demanding assessment of fallopian tubes for
   early diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Also, algorithms can be explored to
   include size of ovarian cyst and CA 125 levels to predict ovarian
   cancer.}},

   status and patient outcome.
   Subjects and methods: A retrospective review identified 76 consecutive
   patients who underwent partial cystectomy for bladder carcinoma with (n
   = 66; 87\%) or without (n = 10; 13\%) FSA for SMs at our institution
   from 2004 to 2018. FSA was correlated with the diagnosis of the frozen
   section control, the status of final SM, and the prognosis.
   Results: Final SM was positive in 9 (12\%) cystectomies, including 6
   (9\%) FSA vs. 3 (30\%) non-FSA cases (P = 0.091). There were no
   significant differences in tumor size, histology, or tumor grade/stage
   between the 2 cohorts. FSAs were reported as positive (n = 7; 11\%),
   atypical (n = 10; 15\%), and negative (n = 49; 74\%). All of the
   positive and negative FSA diagnoses were confirmed accurate on the
   frozen section controls, whereas atypical diagnoses were revised to
   benign (n = 4), atypical (n = 4), and carcinoma (n = 2) on the controls.
   Ten (77\%) of 13 initial FSA-positive (6 of 7)/atypical (4 of 6;
   excluding benign diagnoses on the controls) cases achieved negative
   conversion by excision of additional tissue. Thus, final SM was positive
   in 1 (14\%) FSA-positive case, 3 (30\%) FSA-atypical cases (including
   one at the SM where FSA was not sampled), and 2 (4\%) FSA-negative cases
   (at the SM where FSA was not sampled). Kaplan-Meier analysis and
   log-rank test revealed an association of performing FSA with the risk of
   disease progression (P = 0.021), but not intravesical recurrence (P =
   0.434) or cancer-specific mortality (P = 0.560). Initial
   positive/atypical FSA, as an independent prognosticator, was associated
   with reduced progression-free (P = 0.002) and cancer-specific (P =
   0.004) survival rates, compared with initial negative FSA. Positive SM
   was also associated with a larger tumor size (P < 0.05) and a higher
   risk of intravesical recurrence (P = 0.070) or disease progression (P =
   0.096).
   Conclusions: Performing FSA during partial cystectomy may contribute to
   preventing positive SM and disease progression. Additionally, as seen in
   most of initial FSA-positive/atypical cases that achieved negative
   conversion, select patients may benefit from the routine FSA. Meanwhile,
   positive or atypical FSA was associated with significantly poorer
   prognosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decline in insulin sensitivity due to dysfunction of adipose tissue (AT)
   is one of the earliest pathogenic events in type 2 diabetes. We
   hypothesize that differential DNA methylation (DNAm) controls insulin
   sensitivity and obesity by modulating transcript expression in AT.
   Integrating AT DNAm profiles with transcript profile data measured in a
   cohort of 230 African Americans (AAs) from the African American Genetics
   of Metabolism and Expression cohort, we performed cis-expression
   quantitative trait methylation (cis-eQTM) analysis to identify
   epigenetic regulatory loci for glucometabolic trait-associated
   transcripts. We identified significantly associated cytosine-guanine
   dinucleotide regions for 82 transcripts (false discovery rate {[}FDR]-P
   < 0.05). The strongest eQTM locus was observed for the
   proopiomelanocortin (POMC; rho = -0.632, P = 4.70 x 10(-27)) gene.
   Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) further identified 155, 46,
   and 168 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide regions associated (FDR-P < 0.05)
   with the Matsuda index, S-I, and BMI, respectively. Intersection of
   EWAS, transcript level to trait association, and eQTM results, followed
   by causal inference test identified significant eQTM loci for 23 genes
   that were also associated with Matsuda index, S-I, and/or BMI in EWAS.
   These associated genes include FERMT3, ITGAM, ITGAX, and POMC. In
   summary, applying an integrative multiomics approach, our study provides
   evidence for DNAm-mediated regulation of gene expression at both
   previously identified and novel loci for many key AT transcripts
   influencing insulin resistance and obesity.}},

Title = {{Axial super-resolution in ultrasound imaging with application to
   non-destructive evaluation}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental challenge in non-destructive evaluation using ultrasound
   is to accurately estimate the thicknesses of different layers or cracks
   present in the object under examination, which implicitly corresponds to
   accurately localizing the point-sources of the reflections from the
   measured signal. Conventional signal processing techniques cannot
   overcome the axial-resolution limit of the ultrasound imaging system
   determined by the wavelength of the transmitted pulse. In this paper,
   starting from the solution to the 1-D wave equation, we show that the
   ultrasound reflections could be effectively modeled as
   finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals. The FRI modeling approach is a
   new paradigm in signal processing. Apart from allowing for the signals
   to be sampled below the Nyquist rate, the FRI framework also transforms
   the reconstruction problem into one of parametric estimation. We employ
   high-resolution parametric estimation techniques to solve the problem.
   We demonstrate axial super-resolution capability (resolution below the
   theoretical limit) of the proposed technique both on simulated as well
   as experimental data. A comparison of the FRI technique with time-domain
   and Fourier domain sparse recovery techniques shows that the FRI
   technique is more robust. We also assess the resolvability of the
   proposed technique under different noise conditions on data simulated
   using the Field-II software and show that the reconstruction technique
   is robust to noise. For experimental validation, we consider Teflon
   sheets and Agarose phantoms of varying thicknesses. The experimental
   results show that the FRI technique is capable of super-resolving by a
   factor of three below the theoretical limit.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) are at high risk for
   adverse health outcomes. Safer schools decrease this risk. The US
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified 6 practices
   that can make schools safer for SGMY, yet few US schools implement them
   all. We apply a structural competency framework to elucidate factors
   contributing to this implementation gap.
   METHODS We conducted 75 interviews and 32 focus groups with school
   professionals in 18 New Mexico high schools to assess factors impacting
   implementation of the practices over 2 years. We analyzed data using
   iterative coding, thematic identification techniques, and the
   sensitizing concept of structural competency.
   RESULTS Themes included: rendering an invisible population visible;
   critical thinking about LGBTQ inequalities; building school personnel
   capacity; intersecting cultural, religious, and political conflicts; and
   tackling community-based sources of stigma and discrimination.
   Conclusions Underlying cultural and structural forces render SGMY
   invisible and constrain what schools can accomplish. Professional
   development encouraging critical thinking about structural inequities is
   foundational, but efforts to close the implementation gap must attend to
   structural forces producing disparities for SGMY. Structural competency
   can strengthen the ability of the Whole School, Whole Community, and
   Whole Child model's cross-sector coordination of policy and process to
   meet the needs of every student.}},

Title = {{Modification of systemic anti-cancer therapies and weight loss, a
   population-level real-world evidence study}},
Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Involuntary weight loss may occur during systemic anti-cancer therapy
   (SACT), causing treatment disruption and poorer prognoses. There remain
   gaps in clinical awareness as to which patients may benefit from
   nutritional interventions that aim to prevent unintended weight loss
   during SACT.
   We utilised England's population-level cancer registry data, conducting
   a pan-cancer assessment of patient weight loss during SACT. We aimed to
   identify cancers with weight loss-associated treatment modifications,
   potential beneficiaries of nutritional intervention.
   Methods:
   This cross-sectional study used England's Cancer Analysis System
   database, including SACT-treated adults with one tumour and > 2 weight
   recordings between 2014 and 2018. Binary weight loss (threshold: 2.5\%)
   was derived from patients' most negative weight change from first SACT
   weight recording. The Martin et al. body mass index-adjusted weight loss
   grading system (BMI-WLG) was assigned. We describe binary weight loss,
   BMI-WLG and treatment modification status by cancer. Multivariate
   logistic regression models of weight loss (binary and BMI-WLG) and a
   composite outcome of patient treatment-modification status by cancer
   were produced.
   Results:
   Our study population contained 200,536 patients across 18 cancers; 28\%
   experienced binary weight loss during SACT. Weight loss patients were
   more likely to have multiple types of treatment modifications recorded
   across all cancers. Regression analyses included 86,991 patients. Binary
   weight loss was associated (p < 0.05) with higher likelihood of
   treatment modification in; colon {[}Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.72, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 2.07]; gynaecologic (excl. ovarian) (OR
   = 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.08, 2.01); stomach (OR = 1.6, 95\% CI: 1.04, 2.06);
   lung (OR = 1.38, 95\% CI: 1.21, 1.58); leukaemia (OR = 1.30, 95\% CI:
   1.09, 1.55); head and neck (OR = 1.30, 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.65) and
   oesophageal (OR = 1.29, 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.64) cancers. In lung, colon,
   and grouped gastro-intestinal cancers, association between BMI-WLG and
   treatment modification increased by WLG.
   Discussion:
   Our study is a wide assessment of weight loss during SACT using
   England's cancer registry data. Across different cancers we found
   patients have weight loss-associated treatment modifications during
   SACT, a precursor to poorer prognoses. Our findings highlight cancers
   that may benefit from improved nutritional intervention during SACT.}},

Abstract = {{The common shrew Sorex araneus is one of the least social mammals with
   chiefly aggressive interactions. Although this species is usually
   considered territorial, the behavioral mechanisms of the social system
   are not entirely clear. Sociability is the motivation to engage in
   social contact, the conflict in the case of the common shrew, in the
   presence of both situational and individual differences, can be an
   important factor in the use of space in this species. This aspect of
   behavior of shrews was not studied. We propose a simplified preference
   test which could be used in field studies. In contrast to the classic
   Crawley three chamber test we performed trials in one-chamber arena. The
   test implies assay of preference of an area adjoined to wire-net
   container with a stimulus animal versus an area-adjoined empty
   container. The distance, the velocity, and the duration were considered
   the principal variables. Indexes permitting assay the mobility in a zone
   and preference of an area is suggested. This publication is devoted to
   the description of the test and discussing of the preliminary results.}},

   isolates were collected from different intensive care units (ICUs) of
   Ain-Shams university hospital from April-December 2018. Methicillin
   resistance was detected by Cefoxitin disc, and antimicrobial
   susceptibility testing was done for all isolates and its results were
   interpreted according to Clinical \& Laboratory Standards Institute
   (CLSI) guidelines 2018. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration of Oxacillin
   was detected using Oxacillin E-test and the results were interpreted
   according to the manufacturer's instructions, then Polymerase Chain
   Reaction was done to detect mecA and mecC genes among MRSA isolates.
   Fifty isolates were identified as MRSA by Cefoxitin disc out of 163
   samples. Twelve isolates were sensitive to Oxacillin while 38 isolates
   were resistant to Oxacillin. All isolates were positive to mecA gene
   while only 3 isolates were positive to both mecA and mecC genes. MecC is
   a new emerging gene responsible for methicillin resistance in
   staphylococci and was detected in 6 \% of the isolates in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage,
   as determined by the Area Deprivation Index, increases 30-day hospital
   re-observation risk.
   Participants and Methods: This retrospective study of 20\% Medicare
   fee-for-service beneficiary observation stays from January 1, 2014, to
   November 30, 2014, included 319,980 stays among 273,308 beneficiaries.
   We evaluated risk for a 30-day re-observation following an index
   observation stay for those living in the 15\% most disadvantaged
   compared with the 85\% least disadvantaged neighborhoods.
   Results: Overall, 4.5\% (270,600 of 6,080,664) of beneficiaries had
   index observation stays, which varied by disadvantage (4.3\% {[}232,568
   of 5,398,311] in the least disadvantaged 85\% compared with 5.6\%
   {[}38,032 of 682,353] in the most disadvantaged 15\%). Patients in the
   most disadvantaged neighborhoods had a higher 30-day re-observation rate
   (2857 of 41,975; 6.8\%) compared with least disadvantaged neighborhoods
   (13,543 of 278,005; 4.9\%); a 43\% increased risk (unadjusted odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.31 to 1.55). After adjustment, this risk
   remained (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.04 to 1.22). Discharge to a
   skilled nursing facility reduced 30-day re-observation risk (OR, 0.63;
   95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.69), whereas index observation length of stay of 4 or
   more days (3 midnights) conferred increased risk (OR, 1.29; 95\% CI,
   1.09 to 1.52); those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods were less
   likely to discharge to skilled nursing facilities and more likely to
   have long index stays. Beneficiaries with more than one 30-day
   re-observation (chronic re-observation) had progressively greater
   disadvantage by number of stays (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.08;
   95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.14). Observation prevalence varied nationally.
   Conclusion: Thirty-day re-observation, especially chronic
   re-observation, is highly associated with socioeconomic neighborhood
   disadvantage, even after accounting for factors such as race,
   disability, and Medicaid eligibility. Beneficiaries least able to pay
   are potentially most vulnerable to costs from serial re-observations and
   challenges of Medicare observation policy, which may discourage patients
   from seeking necessary care. (C) 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical

Abstract = {{The present study was aimed to investigate the application of co-oxidant
   (H2O2) in order to enhancement the Butylparaben (BuP) and Benzylparaben
   (BzP) photo-catalytic degradability. To this purpose, UVC/ZnO (UZ) as a
   photocatalytic process was employed in the presence of H2O2 as
   co-oxidant. The experiments were done by UZ process in the presence and
   the absence of H2O2. The maximum degradation of BuP and BzP by UZ in the
   absence of H2O2 (under selected condition) was achieved 81\% and
   67.37\%, respectively; whereas enhancement in the degradation
   performance was observed, when H2O2 was added in the reaction
   environment. The kinetic studies proved this phenomenon, as values robs
   for UZH in the degradation of BuP and BzP were 6.04 and 27.31 times than
   that of the UZ, respectively. The values of energy consumption (EEO) and
   total cost for UZH and UZ in the removal of BuP were calculated (25 kW h
   m(-3), 2.72 \$ m(-3)) and (150 kW h m(-3), 6.35 \$ m(-3)), respectively.
   Also the values of EEO and total cost for UZH and UZ in the removal of
   BzP were (25 kW h m(-3), 2.72\$ m(-3)) and (206.72 kW h m(-3), 7.97 \$
   m(-3)), respectively. The mineralization rates of BzP and BuP by UZ and
   UZH processes were (3\% and 33\%) and (20\% and 37\%), respectively.}},

Journal = {{LITHOS}},

Abstract = {{Here we test for peridotite versus pyroxenite input in Mongolian
   Mesozoic and Cenozoic magmatism. A combination of new Ar-40/Ar-39
   radiometric dating results, whole-rock major- and trace-element, Sr-Nd
   isotope, and mineral phenocryst geochemical data is used to decipher the
   petrogenesis of Cretaceous lavas (Tsagaan Nuur and Khukh Tolgoi) and
   dykes (Samaan Damba) from the Argalant Range, Gobi-Altai (Mongolia).
   This magmatism is compared to Cretaceous asthenospheric mantle-derived
   basalts from Tsost Magmatic Field and Cenozoic volcanism from the
   Gobi-Altai, Khangai Range Watershed, Tariat and Togo to assess changing
   source conditions. We also compare this magmatism to Cenozoic magmatism
   from the North China Craton. The Argalant Range magmatism has
   geochemical signatures consistent with the involvement of both
   peridotite and pyroxenite-like components, and we suggest that this
   pyroxenite-like component was obtained through the melting of
   metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Mineral-liquid
   thermobarometer results for samples from Khukh Tolgoi and Samaan Damba
   indicate that upwelling magma stalled at similar to 30 km depth, before
   finally traversing further to surface. A model to explain Mesozoic
   magmatic genesis is presented here, whereby piecemeal delamination and
   convective erosion of a metasomatized SCLM drives magmatism. The
   Cenozoic volcanism also has geochemical signatures consistent with the
   melting of non-peridotite components, and the presence of samples with
   >9 wt\% MgO from Khangai Range Watershed, Tariat and Togo enabled
   assessments on the relative contribution of non-peridotite melt input.
   We suggest that magmatism from Togo contains the greatest amount of
   non-peridotite melt input, followed by Tariat and Khangai Range
   Watershed localities. We hypothesize that intermittent Cenozoic
   magmatism is the result of a slab graveyard under East Asia foundering
   into the upper mantle. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{ADMM-based market clearing and optimal flexibility bidding of
   distribution-level flexibility market for day-ahead congestion
   management of distribution networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{123}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, the massive deployment of distributed energy resources in
   distribution networks poses more operational challenges such as network
   congestion to distribution system operators. To cope with these
   challenges in an economically efficient way, the distribution system
   operator can utilize demand-side flexibility traded in the local
   flexibility market to manage the distribution network. In the existing
   distribution-level flexibility market frameworks, the market operator is
   assumed to have access to network parameters in order to ensure the
   market clearing solution being technically feasible from the operational
   point of view. To protect the privacy of network parameters, this paper
   proposes an alternating direction method of multipliers -based market
   clearing strategy, in which the market operator communicates with the
   distribution system operator to clear the market such that the market
   clearing solution respects network operation constraints without
   revealing network parameters to the market operator. In addition, in the
   existing flexibility bid formulations, the energy payback condition is
   determined without considering operation constraints of flexibility
   resources and the flexibility cost has not been considered. To fill this
   gap, this paper formulates an optimal flexibility bidding model for
   aggregators, which carefully models the energy payback condition and
   enables the aggregator to receive the maximum revenue with flexibility
   costs considered. The case studies were conducted on the Roy Billinton
   Test System with electrical vehicles and heat pumps as flexibility
   resources. The results demonstrate that the proposed distribution-level
   flexibility market framework is effective to perform day-ahead
   congestion management of distribution networks and is profitable to
   aggregators and end-users.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the differences in
   several serum adipokines in perinatal dairy cows with type I and II
   ketosis, and the correlations between these adipokines and the two types
   of ketosis.
   Methods: Serum adiponectin (ADP), leptin (LEP), resistin, tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and energy
   balance indicators related to ketosis were measured. Type I and II
   ketosis were distinguished by serum glucose (Glu) and Y values and the
   correlations between adipokines in the two types of ketosis were
   analyzed.
   Results: beta-Hydroxybutyric acid of type I ketosis cows was
   significantly negatively correlated with insulin (INS) and LEP and had a
   significant positive correlation with serum ADP. In type II ketosis
   cows, ADP and LEP were significantly negatively correlated, and INS and
   resistin were significantly positively correlated. Revised quantitative
   INS sensitivity check index (RQUICKI) values had a significantly
   positive correlation with ADP and had a very significant and significant
   negative correlation with resistin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. ADP was
   significantly negatively correlated with resistin and TNF-alpha, LEP had
   a significantly positive correlation with TNF-alpha, and a significantly
   positive correlation was shown among resistin, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.
   There was also a significant positive correlation between IL-6 and
   TNF-alpha.
   Conclusion: INS, ADP, and LEP might exert biological influences to help
   the body recover from negative energy balance, whereas resistin,
   TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in type II ketosis cows exacerbated INS resistance
   and inhibited the production and secretion of ADP, weakened INS
   sensitivity, and liver protection function, and aggravated ketosis.}},

Abstract = {{2-Furfurylthiol was an important contributor to the flavor of
   traditional fermented foods including Baijiu. It is essential to
   increase 2-furfurylthiol concentration to improve the quality of Baijiu.
   This study aimed to enrich the content of 2-furfurylthiol in Chinese
   sesame-flavored Baijiu via two strains we isolated from Baijiu
   fermentation, Bacillus subtilis LBM 10019 and Bacillus vallismortis LBM
   10020, which could respectively produce 56.31 mg/L and 42.81 mg/L
   L-cysteine, the precursor of 2-furfurylthiol, in sorghum extract. After
   inoculation of these two strains, the maximal relative abundance of
   Bacillus increased from 7.48\% to 40.38\%, the final content of
   L-cysteine increased by 101.44\% in Baijiu fermentation. Moreover, the
   concentration of 2-furfurylthiol increased by 89.15\% in the production.
   This work provides a novel strategy to improve the quality of Chinese
   sesame-flavored Baijiu.}},

Abstract = {{A system of two identical superconducting quantum interference devices
   (SQUIDs) symmetrically coupled through their mutual inductance and
   driven by a sinusoidal field is investigated numerically with respect to
   dynamical properties such as its multibranched resonance curve, its
   bifurcation structure and transition to chaos as well as its
   synchronization behavior. The SQUID dimer is found to exhibit a
   hysteretic resonance curve with a bubble connected to it through
   Neimark-Sacker (torus) bifurcations, along with coexisting chaotic
   branches in their vicinity. Interestingly, the transition of the SQUID
   dimer to chaos occurs through a torus-doubling cascade of a
   two-dimensional torus (quasiperiodicity-to-chaos transition). Periodic,
   quasiperiodic, and chaotic states are identified through the calculated
   Lyapunov spectrum and illustrated using Lyapunov charts on the parameter
   plane of the coupling strength and the frequency of the driving field.
   The basins of attraction for chaotic and non-chaotic states are
   determined. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed on the parameter plane
   of the coupling strength and the frequency of the driving field, and
   they are superposed to maps of the three largest Lyapunov exponents on
   the same plane. Furthermore, the route of the system to chaos through
   torus-doubling bifurcations and the emergence of Henon-like chaotic
   attractors are demonstrated in stroboscopic diagrams obtained with
   varying driving frequency. Moreover, asymmetric states that resemble
   localized synchronization have been detected using the correlation
   function between the fluxes threading the loop of the SQUIDs.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental challenges are increasingly becoming central to
   businesses. The startups are also being increasingly influenced by
   environmental concerns. The present article attempts to understand the
   environmental concerns in the values guiding the management of the
   startups at two levels, i.e., start up's internal as well as external
   operations. At the same time, it tries to correlate the same with the
   network size and networking frequency of the startups. A model has been
   proposed to show the relationship between start up's environmental
   concerns and their networking efforts. To identify and understand these
   relations, a survey was conducted on the emerging startups from
   different fields. The incubation centres at different institutions of
   Rajasthan (India) were covered under the survey. The findings
   highlighted a significant relationship between the start up's external
   environmental concern and networking, thereby suggesting the
   significance of these concerns for environmental issues in business
   operations. The startups having high environmental concern were found to
   be among the businesses which will get more attention and find
   themselves more scalable. Moreover, findings also revealed that the
   environmental orientation is a very crucial aspect of networking of
   startups, although the influence of external and internal environment
   orientation has a contrasting impact on the networking of startups. So,
   researchers and academicians working in the field of environmentally
   oriented startups can use this differentiation for further researches.
   There have been studies on correlating the environmental concern with
   networking in established firms in developed country such as Dickel et
   al. (2018). Moreover, emerging economies like India, there have not been
   an attempt to study this kind of relationship in the context of
   startups. The current study tries to validate the results of the study
   conducted by Dickel et al. (2018) for the startups in Rajasthan (India).}},

Title = {{Illegal wildlife trade, seizures and prosecutions: A 7.5-year analysis
   of trade in pig-nosed turtles Carettochelys insculpta in and from
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},

Abstract = {{The illegal wildlife trade is increasingly recognised as a major threat
   to biodiversity conservation, and one way of curbing it is to properly
   enforce existing legislation and where appropriate to prosecute to the
   full extent of the law. One of the taxa that suffers greatly from
   unregulated trade are the tortoises and freshwater turtles, with
   collection for trade currently being the most significant threat for
   most Asian species. Illegal trade in pig nosed turtles from Indonesia to
   supply international demand for pets, and to a lesser degree for meat
   and use in traditional medicines, continues on a large scale. We
   examined 26 reported seizures over the period 2013 to 2020, of which 20
   took place in Indonesia and the remaining five in other parts of Asia
   with the turtles being trafficked from Indonesia. In total, this
   amounted to the seizure of 52,374 pig-nosed turtles. Pig-nosed turtles
   are totally protected in Indonesia, and nine of the 26 cases we examined
   were successfully prosecuted though never to the full extent of the law.
   Trade in and trafficking of pig-nosed turtles is in violation of
   Indonesia's Fisheries and Customs Acts, yet these legal instruments were
   not used for prosecutions. In addition to the illegal trade, the
   Indonesia CITES Management Authority reported the export of 5415
   pig-nosed turtles, 95\% of which were declared as wild-caught, in direct
   contravention of Indonesia's own protected species legislation. We
   strongly recommend a strategy be developed and implemented to more
   effectively tackle this trade from point of collection through to point
   of sale, with improved use of all relevant pieces of national
   legislation to serve as a strong deterrent, and ultimately to protect
   this species from over-exploitation. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{21-27}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation
   requires comprehensive knowledge and specific skills to secure the
   airway. We hypothesized that airway assessment using ultrasound is
   superior in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and aimed to compare
   airway ultrasound with clinical assessment to predict it.
   Methodology: Cross sectional study on 100 adults (65 females) undergoing
   elective surgeries with tracheal intubation in a tertiary centre were
   subjected to 2 staged airway assessment, both clinical and ultrasound.
   Airway ultrasound parameters recorded were anteroposterior thickness of
   geniohyoid muscle, distance from skin to hyoid bone, thyrohyoid membrane
   and true vocal cords. The Cormack and Lehane (CL) grade at laryngoscopy
   and Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) scores were noted. Results were
   analysed using Kappa statistics.
   Results: Neck circumference and distance from skin to epiglottis at the
   level of thyrohyoid membrane (DSETM) were significant predictors of
   difficult laryngoscopy with a cut-off value of >= 35.8 cm (33\% were
   predicted to be difficult however only 4\% cases posed difficulty in
   laryngoscopy) and 1.9 +/- 0.3 cm respectively.
   Conclusion: Airway ultrasound is an objective and cost-effective
   modality in the anaesthesiologists' armamentarium. DSETM >= 1.90 cm
   differentiated between easy and difficult laryngoscopy. Ultrasonography
   assessment adds an incremental diagnostic value to clinical screening
   tests. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An unstable rock mass is a common geological hazard in water conservancy
   and hydropower engineering in southwest China. The mechanical properties
   of a rock mass joint and the internal and external physical environment
   are closely related. In this study, the factors to evaluate the
   stability of a dangerous rock mass and the geological conditions of a
   highway slope in Yunnan Province will be evaluated. The block
   discrete-element method (DEM) will be used to calculate the highway
   slope of a dangerous rock mass. Moreover, three-dimensional numerical
   analysis will be performed for the strength reduction of the safety
   factor. The stabilities of the dangerous rock mass under natural,
   rainfall conditions, roadbed excavation, and exerted active defending
   net on dangerous rock mass Nos. 1 and 2 will be determined. The safety
   coefficients under natural, rainfall, and roadbed excavation conditions
   are 1.36, 1.27, and 1.36, respectively. When an active protective net
   was applied onto the surface of dangerous rock mass No. 1, the safety
   coefficients were 1.39 and 1.31 under natural and rainfall conditions,
   respectively. When the active protective net was applied onto the
   surface of dangerous rock mass No. 2, the safety coefficients were 1.43
   and 1.35 under natural and rainfall conditions, respectively. The
   potential instability area of dangerous rock mass No. 1 is the rock mass
   on the bedding joint face. The potential instability area of dangerous
   rock mass No. 2 is the local block A. The two dangerous rock masses must
   be monitored during project operation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to validate a viscoplastic constitutive model and
   investigate the local and the full-field strain of notched specimen. A
   high temperature digital image correlation (DIC)-based test system was
   constructed to measure the full-field surface deformation. Surface
   strain fields of notched DZ125 specimens were measured under monotonic
   tensile loadings at 20 degrees C, 650 degrees C, 760 degrees C, and 850
   degrees C. Taking the effect of anisotropy, applied stress, and
   temperature into account, numerical simulations were conducted using a
   developed viscoplastic constitutive model. DIC-based measurements agreed
   well with the simulated strains, with the minimum correlation
   coefficient of 95.47\%. Both the numerical and experimental results show
   that the area of notch plasticity increases with temperature and applied
   stress, and the high strain zone nearly remains constant under various
   tensile loadings. For a given notch geometry, the strain mutation in
   high strain zone nearly remains constant no matter how the temperature
   and the applied stress change.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalysis is a promising method for environment remediation, such
   as organic pollutant degradation, disinfection and heavy metal ion
   reduction, while the light adsorption limitation, photo-induced charge
   carrier recombination and insufficient surface catalytic reaction has
   restricted its practical application. Here in this work, a highly
   hydrophilic wood derived cellulose nanofibril (CNF) was firstly
   introduced into alpha-FeOOH/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel system
   through a simple self-assembly method. In this composite system, the rGO
   acting as an electron transfer and the CNF acting as a hole sink, this
   dual charge transfer channel can maximize the charge carrier separation
   efficiency, meanwhile, the as obtained alpha-FeOOH/CNF/rGO aerogel has
   shown great enhanced water affinity-superhydrophilicity, which can
   sufficiently enhance the mass transportation during photocatalysis
   activity, the simultaneously enhancement of interfacial charge/mass
   transportation has endowed this photocatalytic system with both
   excellent photocatalytic oxidation and reduction performance. Under
   visible light irradiation, alpha-FeOOH/CNF/rGO can realize efficient
   degradation of various organics including dyes, aromatic compounds and
   antibiotics, killing bacterial as well as reduction of heavy metal ion.
   The simple, low-cost and environmentally friendly fabrication method
   along with excellent performance of this catalyst indicate its great
   application prospect for environmental protection.}},

Abstract = {{Salinity in estuaries has an important influence on sediment deposition,
   delta formation, and fishery economy. The change of runoff in Yellow
   River (YR), which is the largest river along the Bohai Sea, has an
   important effect on the salinity of the sea, particularly in Laizhou
   Bay. In this study, measured runoff data in Lijin hydrological station
   from 1950 to 2018 are adopted to examine the change of YR runoff into
   the sea. The study concludes that the runoff of YR is distributed
   unevenly throughout the year and the amount of runoff mainly
   concentrates during the flood season. Results show a decreasing trend at
   a significant level of alpha=0.95, with a range of -6.17 x 10(9) m(3)
   yr(-1). Three groups of runoff are set by using the Finite-Volume
   Coastal Ocean Model numerical model to analyze the change of salinity in
   Laizhou Bay. These modeled effects were compared with water level
   observations made by Bayuquan, Tanggu, and Penglai gauge stations and
   salinity surveys conducted by Longkou gauge station. Model results and
   observations of salinity distributions and coastal water level showed
   good agreement. We can conclude that the distribution of salinity in
   Laizhou Bay is high in the east and low in the west. Furthermore, it
   responded quickly to the change of the runoff from YR. Under conditions
   of high river discharge, the low-salinity zone increased in horizontal
   direction and reached the bottom in vertical direction.}},

Abstract = {{The interactive development of economic globalization, informatization,
   marketization, and urbanization has reshaped the urban commercial
   landscape and society, and poses new requirements for the business
   environment. New commerce forms that are based on information technology
   and electronic payment and integrate online and offline forms are
   growing rapidly in China. However, the relationship between new commerce
   forms and the business environment has not received sufficient academic
   attention. Using 29 major cities in China, this paper constructs a new
   business index system consisting of the following six sub-indexes: the
   characteristic hotels index, the Starbucks index, the Freshhema index,
   the concept bookstores index, the smart convenience stores index, and
   the healthcare and medical examination index. The entropy coupled with
   the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution
   (TOPSIS) method was used for quantitative evaluation of urban new
   business vitality. We found that the Freshhema index and smart
   convenient store index are the two most important evaluation factors.
   The relationship between the new business index and the business
   environment was examined through multiple linear regression (MLR) and
   Gaussian process regression (GPR) analysis. We found that the MLR is not
   a valid model, and instead, the nonlinear GPR model has good explanatory
   power for this relationship. The results show that human capital has a
   more important effect than the economic development level on business
   vitality. The rise and development of new commercial forms depend on the
   innovation and optimization of the business environment.}},

   of polyethylene obtained by these six catalysts were in 2.2-2.5, and the
   melting point was about 135 degrees C The reaction mechanism of ethylene
   polymerization was explored by HSAB. The results showed that when the
   substituent on the catalyst aniline was an electron withdrawing group,
   both the polymerization activity and the molecular weight of the
   obtained polymer were higher. Density Functional Theory (DFT) results
   indicated that ethylene was more inclined to react with one of the M-C
   bonds of the catalyst. The energy barrier for the ethylene insertion
   reaction by Cat.5 was the lowest, compared to other catalysts except
   Cat.1, which made ethylene insertion reaction easier. These ligands
   containing electron withdrawing groups on aniline ring made the
   catalytic active species more stable. Much higher molecular weight of
   polyethylene was produced by utilizing these catalysts with the ligands
   containing electron withdrawing groups on aniline ring. These
   experimental results were consistent with those of HSAB and DFT.}},

Title = {{An Advanced Sensor Placement Strategy for Small Leaks Quantification
   Using Lean Graphs}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Small leaks in water distribution networks have been a major problem
   both economically and environmentally, as they go undetected for years.
   We model the signature of small leaks as a unique Directed Acyclic
   Graph, called the Lean Graph, to find the best places for k sensors for
   detecting and locating small leaks. We use the sensors to develop
   dictionaries that map each leak signature to its location. We quantify
   leaks by matching out-of-normal flows detected by sensors against
   records in the selected dictionaries. The most similar records of the
   dictionaries are used to quantify the leaks. Finally, we investigate how
   much our approach can tolerate corrupted data due to sensor failures by
   introducing a subspace voting based quantification method. We tested our
   method on water distribution networks of literature and simulate small
   leaks ranging from {[}0.1, 1.0] liter per second. Our experimental
   results prove that our sensor placement strategy can effectively place k
   sensors to quantify single and multiple small leaks and can tolerate
   corrupted data up to some range while maintaining the performance of
   leak quantification. These outcomes indicate that our approach could be
   applied in real water distribution networks to minimize the loss caused
   by small leaks.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effects of deep-ocean water concentrate (DOWC) on sake
   quality, Taichung No. 10 indica rice (Oryza sativa subsp. indica) and
   Tainan No. 11 japonica rice (O. sativa subsp. japonica) were used as raw
   materials, and basic physicochemical property parameters in shochu were
   analyzed differentially. Sake fermentation mash analysis results
   revealed that DOWC addition did not significantly affect the basic
   physicochemical properties during sake brewing, but it significantly
   reduced citric acid and malic acid contents in Taichung No. 10 indica
   rice sake sample by 52-66\% and 73-93\%, respectively. DOWC addition
   significantly increased citric acid content in Tainan No. 11 japonica
   rice sake sample by 32-202\%. Rice shochu analysis results revealed that
   DOWC addition significantly increased isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate,
   and ethyl octanoate contents in shochu made from japonica rice and
   indica rice, respectively. The results indicate that rice variety
   directly affects the types of volatile compounds in rice shochu.
   Principal component analysis and sensory evaluation results revealed
   that DOWC addition affected the composition of volatile compounds in the
   two types of rice shochu and resulted in differences in flavor
   evaluation. DOWC addition affects yeast metabolites and directly changes
   the volatile compound composition and flavor of rice shochu.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of permanent animal communities on land was a defining
   event in the history of evolution, and one for which the ichnofauna and
   facies of the Tumblagooda Sandstone of Western Australia have been
   considered an archetypal case study. However, terrestrialization can
   only be understood from the rock record with conclusive sedimentological
   evidence for non-marine deposition, and original fieldwork on the
   formation shows that a marine influence was pervasive throughout all
   trace fossil-bearing strata. Four distinct facies associations are
   described, deposited in fluvial, tidal and estuarine settings. Here we
   explain the controversies surrounding the age and depositional
   environment of the Tumblagooda Sandstone, many of which have arisen due
   to the challenges in distinguishing marine from non-marine depositional
   settings in lower Palaeozoic successions. We clarify the terminological
   inconsistency that has hindered such determination, and demonstrate how
   palaeoenvironmental explanations can be expanded out from unambiguously
   indicative sedimentary structures. The Tumblagooda Sandstone provides a
   unique insight into an early Palaeozoic ichnofauna that was strongly
   partitioned by patchy resource distribution in a littoral setting. The
   influence of outcrop style and quality is accounted for to contextualize
   this ichnofauna, revealing six distinct low-disparity groups of trace
   fossil associations, each related to a different sub-environment within
   the high-ichnodisparity broad depositional setting. The formation is
   compared with contemporaneous ichnofaunas to examine its continued
   significance to understanding the terrestrialization process. Despite
   not recording permanent non-marine communities, the Tumblagooda
   Sandstone provides a detailed picture of the realm left behind by the
   first invertebrate pioneers of terrestrialization.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Patients who sustain a rotator cuff retear after arthroscopic rotator
   cuff repair are generally considered to have worse clinical outcomes
   compared with patients with an intact rotator cuff. However, some
   patients have good clinical outcomes, even with a retorn rotator cuff.
   Purpose:
   To report the clinical outcomes of nonoperative treatment for rotator
   cuff retears and analyze the factors affecting clinical outcomes after a
   retear.
   Study Design:
   Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   Patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between 2011 and
   2017 were reviewed, and those with a full-thickness retear on
   postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this
   study. According to their pre- and postoperative scores on the pain
   visual analog scale (pVAS) and functional visual analog scale (fVAS),
   the patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) mild group (pVAS <= 1 and
   fVAS >= 8), (2) moderate group (pVAS <= 1 and fVAS <= 7 or pVAS 2-3 and
   fVAS >= 8), and (3) severe group (pVAS >= 3 and fVAS <= 7). Preoperative
   data (dominant hand involvement, heavy labor) and tear size on 6-month
   postoperative MRI were analyzed as factors affecting clinical outcomes.
   Results:
   A total of 712 patients were reviewed, and a retear was observed in 62
   patients (8.7\%). Of the patients with retears, 52 were included in this
   study: 25 men and 27 women with a mean age of 62.6 years (range, 49-80
   years) and mean follow-up period of 40 months (range, 24-88 months).
   According to the pVAS and fVAS scores, 25 patients (48.1\%) were
   classified into the mild group, 9 (17.3\%) into the moderate group, and
   18 (34.6\%) into the severe group. There were no significant differences
   in preoperative data among the 3 groups. The tear size in the coronal
   and sagittal planes decreased by 5.1 and 6.6 mm, respectively, in the
   mild group but increased by 2.8 and 1.4 mm, respectively, in the severe
   group.
   Conclusion:
   In patients with retears, 48.1\% had only mild symptoms at a mean of 40
   months postoperatively. Patients with severe symptoms tended to have an
   increased tear size on postoperative MRI.}},

Abstract = {{On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case in Korea was confirmed. The
   Korean government handled the situation by early identification and
   quarantine along with transparent disclosure of information, while
   announcing a National Guideline to practice aggressive prevention
   policies. Consequently, the government changed its social distancing
   policy into a casual-distancing-in-daily-lives policy. However, on the
   very day when the new policy started, a new male patient who had visited
   a club in Itaewon, Seoul, was confirmed to be the start of a club
   infection. This incident gave rise to three possible problems for Korea.
   Firstly, asymptomatic infection, which means a patient can spread the
   virus having only slight or no symptoms at all, can increase. Secondly,
   the fourth infection occurred due to local transmission by confirmed
   cases related to the club infection. Thirdly, the change in awareness
   among the 20s and 30s age groups is required to minimize the COVID-19
   situation. As there is no established cure for COVID-19, both the
   government and the public should exert care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Transfer of infants who no longer need intensive or
   specialized care from tertiary to community hospitals or clinics
   contributes to efficient bed utilization in neonatal intensive care
   units (NICUs).
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of all 1,503 infants
   admitted to our NICU during the 6-year period from April 2013 through
   March 2019 to evaluate the impact of interfacility neonatal transport
   for convalescent care.
   Results: During the study period, our NICU accepted 33 infants from
   other tertiary NICUs and transferred 103 infants to other hospitals or
   clinics before their home discharge for convalescent care. Our NICU
   covered 39\% of the total hospital days of infants accepted from other
   NICUs. Among infants transferred to other facilities, 81\% born at our
   hospital were born to mothers transported to our obstetrics department
   as imminent high-risk deliveries; 94\% of infants born at other
   hospitals were moved back to the referring facility.
   Conclusions: Interfacility neonatal transport for accepting and
   transferring infants for convalescent care is now an integral part of
   NICU practice, to bridge gaps between higher-level care facilities and
   homes. Establishment of well-defined transfer criteria and appropriate
   allocation of medical and staff resources among relevant facilities are
   desirable.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of albumin agglomeration and dissolution induced by a helium
   plasma jet using the Schlieren visualization technique were
   demonstrated. The Schlieren technique enabled us to visualize the
   plasma-induced agglomeration of albumin on the albumin solution and
   dissolution from the agglomerate. Through the dissolution, a
   high-density albumin region moved downward, forming downward flows.
   During the plasma treatment, the downward flows were observed with a
   flow velocity of around 0.2 mm/s, while the flow velocity was 0.7
   mm/s-0.9 mm/s without the plasma treatment. It was found that the plasma
   treatment decelerates the downward flows.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To predict the fire risk of spatter generated during shielded metal arc
   welding, the thermal characteristics of welding spatter were analyzed
   according to different welding times and electrical powers supplied to
   the electrode. An experimental apparatus for controlling the contact
   angle between the electrode and base metal as well as the feed rate was
   prepared. Moreover, the correlations among the volume, maximum diameter,
   scattering velocity, maximum number, and maximum temperature of the
   welding spatter were derived using welding power from 984-2067 W and
   welding times of 30 s, 50 s, and 70 s. It was found that the volume,
   maximum diameter, and maximum number of welding spatters increased
   proportionally as the welding time and electrical power increased, but
   the scattering velocity decreased as the particle diameter increased
   regardless of the welding time and electrical power. When the measured
   maximum temperature of the welding spatter was compared with an
   empirical formula, the accuracy of the results was confirmed to be
   within +/- 7\% of the experimental constant C=112.414xP(e)(-0.5045).
   Results of this study indicate quantitatively predicting the thermal
   characteristics of welding spatter is possible for minimizing the risk
   of fire spread when the electrode type and welding power is known.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Pancreatic cancer and diabetes status have complex bilateral
   interactions; therefore, understanding their clinical features is
   essential for the clinical management of pancreatic cancer patients. We
   aimed to evaluate the diabetes status before diagnosis, after resection
   and until the time of recurrence in patients with resectable pancreatic
   cancer and to clarify the correlations among the clinical course of
   pancreatic cancer, operative procedure and diabetes status.
   Methods: Between 2011 and 2016, we retrospectively identified 189
   pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or distal
   pancreatectomy at our institution. The entire clinical course of each
   patientwas retrieved from the medical records, and the diabetes status
   in the longest possible duration was assessed.
   Results: Among 115 pancreatic cancer patients who had normal glucose
   tolerance at the time of resection, 22 (19.1\%) developed type 2
   diabetes after resection. In a multivariate analysis, distal
   pancreatectomy was strongly associated with the development of
   postoperative diabetes. On the other hand, 74 pancreatic cancer patients
   had already been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the time of
   resection. During the follow-up period, 15 patients were noted to have
   diabetes resolution after resection; interestingly, the majority of
   these patients had newly diagnosed diabetes, which was defined as the
   diagnosis of diabetes within 3 months before resection. Moreover, newly
   diagnosed diabetes was an independent factor for diabetes resolution
   after resection.
   Conclusions: In pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreatectomy,
   distal pancreatectomy was correlated with postoperative diabetes, and
   newly diagnosed diabetes had a high probability of resolution after
   resection.}},

Abstract = {{Document production, and with it e-discovery, presents unique
   opportunities but also challenges for parties and tribunals seeking
   fair, efficient and effective investor-state arbitration proceedings.
   Despite the prevalence of electronically stored information and the
   potential utility of technology-assisted review techniques, e-discovery
   procedures in investor-state arbitration are relatively underdeveloped.
   Applicable procedural rules and guidelines are largely silent as to the
   mechanics of e-discovery. Analysis of investor-state arbitration
   decisions indicates a further reticence on the part of parties and
   investor-state tribunals to squarely address issues of e-discovery
   proactively. This means that the use, selection and scope of e-discovery
   are left almost entirely to parties and tribunals to navigate on a
   case-by-case and largely ad hoc basis. Given the likely increasing
   relevance of e-discovery in international investor-state arbitration,
   this article considers how parties and tribunals might be supported to
   become better equipped to accommodate e-discovery appropriately in

Abstract = {{In this article, the meshless local radial point interpolation (MLRPI)

   domains of regular shapes such as square or circle. The radial point
   interpolation method is proposed to construct shape functions for MLRPI.
   A weak formulation with a Heaviside step function transforms the set of
   governing equations into local integral equations on local sub domains
   where Neumann's boundary condition is imposed naturally. A two-step time
   discretization method with the help of Crank-Nicolson technique is
   employed to approximate the time derivatives. Convergence studies in the

Abstract = {{Purpose To retrospectively investigate the effectiveness of a novel
   3-phase protocol for computed tomography (CT) before transcatheter
   aortic valve implantation/transcatheter aortic valve replacement
   (TAVI/TAVR) in terms of radiation dose and image quality.
   Materials and Methods A total of 107 nonrandomized patients (817.4
   years) scheduled for TAVI/TAVR underwent preprocedural CT on an 80-row
   CT scanner. 55 patients underwent a combined ECG-synchronized spiral
   scan of the chest and non-ECG-synchronized spiral scan of the
   abdomen/pelvis as recommended by the Society of Cardiovascular Computed
   Tomography (SCCT). 52 patients underwent an updated 3-phase variable
   helical pitch (vHP3) protocol combining a non-ECG-synchronized spiral
   scan of the upper thoracic aperture, followed by a prospective
   ECG-synchronized spiral scan of the heart, and a non-ECG-synchronized
   abdominal/pelvic spiral scan. The radiation dose was determined from an
   automatically generated protocol based on the CT dose index (CTDI).
   Objective image quality in terms of vessel attenuation and image noise
   was measured, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise
   ratio (CNR) were calculated. Subjective image quality was evaluated
   using a 4-point scale and compared for interrater agreement using
   Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient (kappa w). All data were compared and
   statistically analyzed.
   Results Use of the novel 3-phase vHP3 protocol reduced the dose-length
   product (DLP) from 1256.58619.05 mGy{*}cm to 790.90238.15 mGy{*}cm,
   reducing the effective dose (E) from 21.3610.52mSv to 13.444.05mSv and
   size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) from 20.857.29mGy to 13.84 2.94mGy
   (p<0.001). There were no significant differences in objective and
   subjective image quality between the two protocols and between the two
   readers.
   Conclusion The novel 3-phase vHP3 protocol significantly reduces the
   radiation dose of preprocedural TAVI/TAVR CT without a loss of image
   quality.
   Key Points:
   The use of a novel 3-phase protocol for preprocedural TAVI/TAVR CT
   reduces radiation dose by 37\% compared to a combined ECG-synchronized
   and non-ECG-synchronized spiral CT protocol.
   Objective image quality remains unaffected as image noise, SNR, and CNR
   did not differ significantly between the two protocols. The average
   attenuation of the aortic root and abdominal aorta exceeded 450 HU in
   both protocols.
   The average subjective image quality ratings were good to excellent for
   both protocols with almost perfect to substantial interrater agreement.

   Zusammenfassung
   Ziel Diese retrospektive Studie untersuchte die Wirksamkeit eines neuen
   3-Phasen-Protokolls fur die praprozedurale Computertomografie (CT) vor
   einer Transkatheter-Aortenklappenimplantation (TAVI; engl.: TAVR) in
   Bezug auf die Strahlenbelastung und diagnostische Bildqualitat.
   Material und Methoden 107 nichtrandomisierte Patienten
   (81<plus/minus>7,4 Jahre) erhielten vor der geplanten TAVI/TAVR eine
   prainterventionelle CT an einem 80-Zeilen-Gerat. Davon wurden 55
   Patienten mit einem kombinierten EKG-synchronisierten und nicht
   EKG-synchronisierten Spiral-CT-Protokoll entsprechend der Empfehlungen
   der Society of Cardiovascular Computing Tomography (SCCT) untersucht,
   wahrend 52 Patienten die CT-Bildgebung nach dem neuen, aktualisierten
   3-Phasen-Protokoll (vHP3; variabler Pitch-Faktor 3) erhielten. vHP3
   kombiniert eine nicht EKG-synchronisierte Spiral-CT des oberen Thorax
   mit einer anschlie ss enden EKG-synchronisierten Spiral-CT des Herzens
   und einer nicht EKG-synchronisierten Abdomen/Becken-Spiral-CT. Die
   Strahlendosis wurde anhand eines automatisch generierten Protokolls
   basierend auf dem CT-Dosisindex (CTDI) bestimmt. Die objektive
   Bildqualitat in Bezug auf Gefa ss kontrastierung und Bildrauschen wurde
   gemessen und SNR und CNR berechnet. Die subjektive Bildqualitat wurde
   unter Verwendung einer 4-Punkt-Skala bewertet und mittels
   Cohens-Kappa-Koeffizienten (kappa w) auf Interrater-Reliabilitat
   uberpruft. Alle Daten wurden verglichen und statistisch ausgewertet.
   Ergebnisse Die Verwendung des neuartigen 3-Phasen-vHP3-Protokolls
   reduzierte das Dosislangenprodukt (DLP) von 1256,58 +/- 619,05mGy{*}cm
   auf 790,90 +/- 238,15mGy{*}cm, die effektive Dosis (E) von 21,36 +/-
   10,52mSv auf 13,44 +/- 4,05mSv und die gro ss enspezifische
   Dosisabschatzung (SSDE) von 20,85 +/- 7,29mGy auf 13,84 +/- 2,94mGy
   (p<0,001). Hierunter zeigten sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede in
   der objektiven und subjektiven Bewertung der Bildqualitat zwischen
   beiden Gruppen.
   Schlussfolgerung Das neue 3-Phasen-vHP3-Protokoll ermoglicht die
   Durchfuhrung einer praprozeduralen CT vor TAVI/TAVR mit einer
   signifikanten Reduzierung der Strahlendosis ohne Minderung der
   Bildqualitat.
   Kernaussagen:

Abstract = {{Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder of the motile
   cilia. Early accurate diagnosis is important to help prevent lung damage
   in childhood and to preserve lung function. Confirmation of a diagnosis
   traditionally relied on assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, >50 known PCD genes
   have made the identification of biallelic mutations a viable alternative
   to confirm diagnosis. TEM and genotyping lack sensitivity, and research
   to improve accuracy of both is required. TEM can be challenging when a
   subtle or partial ciliary defect is present or affected cilia structures
   are difficult to identify due to poor contrast. Here, we demonstrate
   software to enhance TEM ciliary images and reduce background by
   averaging ciliary features. This includes an option to classify features
   into groups based on their appearance, to generate multiple averages
   when a nonhomogeneous abnormality is present. We validated this software
   on images taken from subjects with well-characterized PCD caused by
   variants in the outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH5. Examining
   more difficult to diagnose cases, we detected 1) regionally restricted
   absence of the ODAs away from the ciliary base, in a subject carrying
   mutations in DNAH9; 2) loss of the typically poorly contrasted inner
   dynein arms; and 3) sporadic absence of part of the central pair complex
   in subjects carrying mutations in HYDIN, including one case with an
   unverified genetic diagnosis. We show that this easy-to-use software can
   assist in detailing relationships between genotype and ultrastructural
   phenotype, improving diagnosis of PCD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{230-234}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high
   rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone positioning
   improves mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS. Strategies to increase
   prone positioning under crisis conditions are needed.
   Material and methods: We describe the development of a mobile prone team
   during the height of the crisis in New York City and describe
   characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who
   received prone positioning between April 2, 2020 and April 30, 2020.
   Results: Ninety patients underwent prone positioning for
   moderate-to-severe ARDS. Sixty-six patients (73.3\%) were men, with a
   median age of 64 years (IQR 53-71), and the median PaO2:FiO(2) ratio was
   107 (IQR 85-140) prior to prone positioning. Patients required an
   average of 3 2.2 prone sessions and the median time of each prone
   session was 19 h (IQR 17.5-20.75). By the end of the study period,
   proning was discontinued in sixtyseven (65.1\%) cases due to clinical
   improvement, twenty (19.4\%) cases due to lack of clinical improvement,
   six (5.8\%) cases for clinical worsening, and ten (9.7\%) cases due to a
   contraindication.
   Conclusion: The rapid development of a mobile prone team safely provided
   prone positioning to a large number of COVID-19 patients with
   moderate-to-severe ARDS. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A hybrid dynamic subgrid-scale model (HDSM) pertaining to Large-eddy
   simulation (LES) has been developed. The coefficient obtained by German
   dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) was integrated with a new dynamic
   coefficient, based on the dynamic subgrid characteristic length and
   controlled by the subgrid-scale (SGS) motions. In HDSM, the
   characteristic wave number determining the characteristic length of the
   dynamic subgrid is calculated from a new energy weighted mean method
   when the subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation wave
   number are known. The dissipation wave-number is derived from the SGS
   turbulent kinetic energy spectrum equation. The total dissipation rate
   spectrum equation is based on the Pao energy spectrum and local
   equilibrium assumption. The dynamic subgrid characteristic length could
   take into account the rapidly fluctuating small scale behaviours and the
   spatial variation of turbulent characteristics. HDSM was used to
   simulate the fully developed channel and turbulent flow past a circular
   cylinder, and to determine the impact of the dam-break flow on
   downstream structure. The HDSM is robust in respect to anisotropic mesh
   and is less sensitive to grid resolution, and would accurately describe
   the energy transfer from large-scale to SGS fluctuations and capture
   more fluctuations of turbulence with same meshes compared to the DSM.}},

   damage.
   Methods: Experimental study in 35 male Wistar rats determining the
   evolution over time of the tissue response to aseptic peritoneal damage.
   A standardized bowel and peritoneal lesions were created in the right
   lower quadrant by laparotomy. Then, tissular expression of growth
   factors was evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction at seven
   timepoints between 6 h and 30 days, postoperatively.
   Results: Tissular responses of granulocyte-stimulating factors (Csf2,
   Csf3), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), epidermal growth factors
   and receptor (Egf, Egfr), fibroblast growth factors (Fgf2, 7 and 10),
   heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (Hbegf), hepatocyte growth factor
   (Hgf), insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1), mitogenic transforming
   growth factors (Tgfa, Tgfb1, Tgfbr3), and vascular endothelial growth
   factor A (Vegfa) were biphasic with a first expression peak at day 3,
   followed by a more pronounced peak at day 14.
   Conclusions: We observed a long-lasting, widespread response of tissular
   growth factors for at least two weeks after peritoneal damage. To be
   clinically effective, the prophylaxis of postoperative adhesions might

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Ukrainian primary healthcare programme of preventive
   and screening recommendations has not been evidence-based. The
   traditional system of continuous medical education in Ukraine places
   participants in the role of passive listeners. This study explored the
   effects of an interactive training course on evidence-based prevention
   and screening of cardiovascular risks, on changes in Ukrainian family
   doctors' (FDs) and primary care nurses' (PCNs) knowledge and readiness
   to change practice over time.
   Methods: Three hundred and seven FDs and PCNs participated in the study.
   Changes in participants' knowledge were assessed with 20 multiple choice
   questions, and their readiness to change practice with a five-item
   questionnaire. These were administered before, immediately after, three
   and twelve months after training.
   Results: The mean pre-course knowledge score was 6.1 (SD 1.8) out of 20,
   increasing to 14.9 (SD 2.3) immediately afterwards (p<0.001). Three
   months later it was 10.2 (SD 3.2) and at one year it was 10.4 (SD 3.3),
   both of which were significantly higher than the pre-training level
   (p<0.005). The percentage of participants that were highly motivated to
   change their practice increased from 18.4\% before the training to
   62.3\% immediately afterwards (p<0.001). Three months later, this fell
   to 40.4\%. At 12 months it further reduced to 27.4\%, but was still
   significantly higher than the baseline level (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: The interactive training was effective in increasing both
   participants' knowledge and their readiness to change their clinical
   practice. The impact of the training diminished over time, but was still
   evident a year later.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerated degradation testing (ADT) has been widely applied as an
   efficient strategy to obtain the reliability (life) information of the
   assets in a shorter-than-normal period of time by exposing the assets to
   higher-than-normal stresses. Recently, with advances in the sensor
   technology, it has been revealed that the degradation of some assets
   demonstrates a long-term memory effect, which implies that the future
   degradation process not only depends on the current degradation state
   but also strongly correlates with the past degradation history across a
   long period of time, and the degradation increments are correlated for
   nonoverlapping time intervals. The existing ADT methods do not consider
   the long-term memories, which could lead to biased life testing results.
   In this article, we propose a novel ADT model by integrating the
   long-term degradation memory effect based on a utilization of the
   fractional Brownian motion. A maximum likelihood approach is developed
   to estimate the model parameters. A likelihood-ratio hypothesis test is
   designed to test the existence of long-term memories. Simulation studies
   are implemented to illustrate the developed methods. Physical
   experiments on accelerated testing of a photocatalyst are designed and
   conducted to demonstrate the proposed model and its advantage over
   benchmark approaches. The results show that the traditional ADT
   paradigm, which ignores the long-term memories, significantly
   underestimates asset lifetime uncertainties.}},

Title = {{Ozone weekend effect in cities: Deep insights for urban air pollution
   control}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studying weekend-weekday variation in ground-level ozone (O-3) allows
   one to better understand O-3 formation conditions, with a potential for
   developing effective strategies for O-3 control. Reducing
   inappropriately the O-3 precursors emissions can either produce no
   reduction or increase surface O-3 concentrations. This paper analyzes
   the weekend-weekday differences of O-3 at 300 rural and 808 urban
   background stations worldwide from 2005 to 2014, in order to investigate
   the O-3 weekend effect over time and assess the effectiveness of the
   precursors emissions control policies for reducing O-3 levels. Data were
   analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen
   estimator. Rural sites typically did not experience a weekend-weekday
   effect. In all urban stations, the mean O-3 concentration on the weekend
   was 12\% higher than on weekdays. Between 2005 and 2014, the annual mean
   of daily O-3 concentrations increased at 74\% of urban sites worldwide
   (+ 0.41 ppb year(-1)) and decreased in the United Kingdom (- 0.18 ppb
   year(-1)). Over this time period, emissions of O(3 )precursors declined
   significantly. However, a greater decline in nitrogen oxides (NOx)
   emissions caused an increase in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to NOx
   ratios leading to O(3 )formation. In France, South Korea and the United
   Kingdom, most urban stations showed a significant upward trend (+ 1.15\%
   per year) for O-3 weekend effect. Conversely, in Canada, Germany, Japan,
   Italy and the United States, the O-3 weekend effect showed a significant
   downward trend (- 0.26\% per year). Further or inappropriate control of
   anthropogenic emissions in Canada, Southern Europe, Japan, South Korea
   and the United States might result in increased daily O-3 levels in
   urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{I draw on the Tuba hunger strike of 2014, which took place in the shadow
   of the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the
   preceding year, to think through questions of collective action in
   relation to shifting figurations of labour in moments of crisis. I ask
   how state, capital and (I)NGO priorities shape or re-signify dominant
   narratives of labour insurgency under supply chain capitalism (Tsing,
   2009). I trace conditions that enable the invocation of (highly
   contextualized) non-work tropes as a strategy for controlling or
   reframing labour struggles; I am particularly interested in the
   emergence of the figure of the anti-nationalist or outside agitator and
   the work of sedition narratives in constructing borders between
   legitimate and illegal forms of labour mobilization. I show how the
   highly contingent global assemblages that emerge bear directly on the
   prospects for organizing (what remains of) the `formally' employed
   industrial workforce in the global garment sector, holding lessons for
   other spaces and places.}},

Abstract = {{Perigean spring tides in the atmosphere are discussed. In 2016-2017, the
   smoothed anomalies of air temperature over European Russia were found to
   repeat the evolution of the distance of the perigee (i.e., the distance
   between the Moon and the Earth at times when the former is at the
   perigee), which varies as a sine function with a period of about 206
   days. The origin of the 206-day lunar cycle is described. Atmospheric
   spring tides are studied. They are exhibited as atmospheric pressure
   oscillations similar to perigean spring oscillations of the sea level.
   The basic dependence of perigean spring tides in the form of beats of
   atmospheric pressure anomalies at new and full moons is found. The
   pressure anomalies at full and new moons can be approximated by
   sinusoids with beat envelope periods of about 412 days and with opposite
   phases. The range of oscillations at antinodes reaches 40 mb, which is
   comparable, in order of magnitude, with actual mesoscale fluctuations of
   atmospheric pressure. The violations in seasonal weather variation
   caused by the 206-day lunar cycle are described.}},

Journal = {{FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The effect of two commercial formulations (incorporating mepanipyrim and
   tetraconazole as active substances) on the metabolism of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae Lalvin T73 (TM), growing on a synthetic grape must, and their
   influence on the alcoholic fermentation course and the biosynthesis of
   volatiles derived from phenylalanine catabolism was studied. No relevant
   effects were observed for mepanipyrim except for glycerol production. On
   the contrary, in the presence of tetraconazole many genes and some
   proteins related to cell cycle progression and mitosis were repressed.
   This fact could explain the lower biomass concentration and the lower
   sugar consumption registered for tetraconazole at the end of the study.
   However, the biomass-to-ethanol yield was higher in connection with the
   overexpression of the ADH1 gene. The presence of tetraconazole residues
   seems to accelerate the Ehrlich pathway. These results agree with the
   overexpression of several genes (BAT1, PDC1, PDC5, ADH1, SFA1, ATF2,
   PFK1, PFK2 and ARO3) and a higher abundance of two proteins (Gap1p and
   Atf2p) involved in this metabolic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Tea infusion, as a valuable source of bioactive compounds, substantially
   contributes to daily polyphenols intake. Among green teas, matcha, which
   is grounded Tencha tea grown under shaded conditions, gains popularity
   not only as an infusion but also as an additive to food products. This
   paper compares the antioxidant activity of matcha, green leaf and white
   leaf tea and assesses the effect of water temperature on extraction of
   phenolic compounds. Moreover, based on the results, the contribution to
   daily polyphenol intake of infusions was calculated. The samples were
   brewed with water at 60 degrees C, 75 degrees C and 90 degrees C. The
   temperature of water significantly (p < 0.0001) impacted the properties
   of infusions. Regardless the brewing conditions, matcha infusions were
   found to contain significantly higher total phenolic content and
   exhibited stronger ferric reducing antioxidant power compared to green
   and white leaf tea infusions. Our experiment showed that 172 to 196 ml
   of matcha infusion depending on the water temperature can provide a
   sufficient amount of polyphenols to fulfill daily polyphenol intake from
   tea for the typical Polish consumer, which suggests that matcha is a
   suitable ingredient in a healthy diet.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to enhance human involvement in equipment maintenance
   and product disassembly, which are essential in product end-of-life
   (EOL) planning and achieving sustainable manufacturing. Maintenance
   operations can extend the production lifespan of machinery, whereas
   disassembly is an essential step in EOL processes, such as reusing,
   recycling and remanufacturing. Notably, most maintenance activities and
   disassembly operations are still conducted manually. Hence, an
   integrated framework that considers appropriate human factors and
   ergonomic conditions in these two phases is proposed. First, a review on
   current approaches in sustainable manufacturing, such as through-life
   engineering services and continuous maintenance is presented. Next, an
   integrated framework for maintenance and disassembly based on advanced
   human computer interaction and soft computing techniques is described.
   In the maintenance phase, a sensor network that tracks the steps
   performed by a user during maintenance operations is implemented. The
   proposed network can account for situations where the user is far away
   from the maintenance job area and when the user is carrying out the
   actual maintenance job. This tracking data and information will serve as
   a basis for comparison to obtain maintenance quality related information
   and provide real time ergonomics feedback. This information is utilized
   for disassembly optimisation with human factors consideration. In line
   with Industry 4.0 concept, this framework allows (i) improvement of
   maintenance quality with the inclusion of steps tracking during
   disassembly and maintenance operations and (ii) monitoring and
   consideration of the well-being of operators. Case studies are
   implemented to illustrate the proposed framework followed by discussion
   and conclusion with future work.}},

Abstract = {{Snow cover plays a significant role in the weather and climate system by
   affecting the energy and mass transfer between the surface and the
   atmosphere. It also has far-reaching effects on ecosystems of
   snow-covered areas. Therefore, global snow-cover observations in a
   timely manner are needed. Satellite-based instruments can be utilized to
   produce snow-cover information that is suitable for these needs. Highly
   variable surface and snow-cover features suggest that operational snow
   extent algorithms may benefit from at least a partly empirical approach
   that is based on carefully analyzed training data. Here, a new two-phase
   snow-cover algorithm utilizing data from the Advanced Very High
   Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the MetOp satellites of the
   European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
   (EUMETSAT) is introduced and evaluated. This algorithm is used to
   produce the MetOp/AVHRR H32 snow extent product for the Satellite
   Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water
   Management (H SAF). The algorithm aims at direct detection of
   snow-covered and snow-free pixels without preceding cloud masking.
   Pixels that cannot be classified reliably to snow or snow-free, because
   of clouds or other reasons, are set as unclassified. This reduces the
   coverage but increases the accuracy of the algorithm. More than four
   years of snow-depth and state-of-the-ground observations from weather
   stations were used to validate the product. Validation results show that
   the algorithm produces high-quality snow coverage data that may be
   suitable for numerical weather prediction, hydrological modeling, and
   other applications.}},

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A mixed-methods evaluation research study found that up to six years
   after engaging in a youth work internship, young adults (N = 54)
   continued to regard that training and experience (T\&E) as highly
   important for their current work. Over 60\% of respondents rated
   internship T\&E as important or extremely important for performance on
   36 of 40 competencies targeted. Competencies most valued are also
   critical to effectiveness in high intensity, high-demand settings,
   including composure under stress, adapting to change, sustaining a
   positive approach. Respondents also offered their retrospective views
   affirming the importance of T\&E for performance during internships.
   Recent (1-2 year alumni) and past (3-6 year alumni) interns' views of
   training effects were equally positive. Qualitative comments identified
   personal competencies (organization, confidence) as well as professional
   competencies (leadership, programming skills, communication) and career
   direction as significant benefits. Implications for practice, research,
   and policy are discussed.}},

Title = {{The effect of Staphylococcus aureus on the electrochemical behavior of
   porous Ti-6Al-4V alloy}},
Journal = {{BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been widely investigated for biomedical applications
   due to its low density, high specific strength, and favorable corrosion
   resistance. However, some reported failures have imposed a challenge to
   improve bone regeneration and fixation, as well as antibacterial
   properties. A further opportunity for solving this problem is the
   introduction of porosity. However, this can induce metallic release and
   corrosion product formation. In this work, a Ti-6Al-4V alloy was exposed
   to Hank's solution, sterilized and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus
   at 37 degrees C. Surface analysis was carried out by SEM-EDS and XPS.
   Electrochemical measurements were also performed using
   chronopotentiometry at open circuit potential, polarization curves, and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. After exposure, FE-SEM showed
   some colonies of S. aureus on the sample with 22\% porosity. However,
   XPS analysis revealed that the presence of bacterium influenced the
   composition of the oxide layer, even more drastically with the increase
   in added porosity. Moreover, the impedance analysis showed De Levie's
   behavior, revealing a reduction of pore resistance and modulus of the
   impedance in the low frequency range in inoculated medium, and
   polarization curves showed that the passivity potential range was
   decreased, whereas the passivity current increased in the presence of
   the S. aureus. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multiplexer design is a challenging task due to the high number of
   variables involved, raising the difficulty as the numbers of filters
   increase. Numerical computing tools provide a suitable environment to
   evaluate topologies and technologies before starting the long journey to
   the device. A direct scattering matrix solution for a star-junction
   multiplexer, based on the circuit theory, is presented in this work. The
   resulting star-junction matrix is introduced in a matrix system with the
   scattering matrix of each filter to evaluate the overall multiplexer
   response. This approach allows the acquisition of main multiplexer
   parameters like transmission, reflection, and cross-isolation response
   in a compact way, achieving a good starting point for the further
   full-wave optimization procedure. Furthermore, an approach for the
   design of a star-junction multiplexer is tackled based on the reflection
   coefficient phase. A triplexer under this interpretation is presented
   and evaluated using lumped elements.}},

Title = {{Risk factors and costs associated with 30-day readmissions following
   alcohol-related hospitalizations in the United States from 2010 to 2015}},
Journal = {{ALCOHOL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{19-25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Patients with alcohol-related diagnoses at initial hospitalization are
   at high risk of 30-day readmission. Understanding risk factors for
   30-day readmission among these patients may help to identify those who
   would benefit from efforts to reduce risk of readmission. The Nationwide
   Readmissions Database was used to estimate 30-day all-cause readmissions
   among United States patients with an alcohol-related index
   hospitalization and to evaluate risk factors and costs associated with
   these readmissions. Included patients were 18 years of age or older at
   initial hospitalization, had an alcohol-related primary diagnosis (based
   on ICD-9-CM codes), and were discharged between 2010 and 2015. They were
   followed for 30 days after initial hospitalization within the calendar
   year to identify all-cause readmissions. A logistic regression analysis
   assessed the association between risk factors and 30-day readmission.
   Average costs of initial admissions and readmissions were estimated.
   Among 113,931,723 adult index hospitalizations, 1,124,228 had
   alcohol-related diagnoses. Patients had a mean age of 49 years, 73\%
   were male, and 45\% had public insurance coverage. The annual rate of
   30-day readmissions among patients with index alcohol-related
   hospitalizations increased from 119 readmissions per 1000 admissions in
   2010 to 140 per 1000 in 2015, while the rate of readmissions among
   patients with all-cause hospitalizations declined from 103 to 98 per
   1000. The regression analysis suggested that age, male sex, comorbid
   conditions, discharge against medical advice, admission to large and
   teaching hospitals, and Medicaid vs. non-Medicaid payment were all risk
   factors for 30-day readmission. Mean costs of initial alcohol-related
   hospitalizations were greater among those with a 30-day readmission than
   without a 30-day readmission, and the mean cost of 30-day readmission
   was even greater. Mitigating the upward trend in rates of readmission
   following alcohol-related initial hospitalizations may be addressed
   through better identification of high-risk patients who are admitted
   with an alcohol-related diagnosis and greater use of existing
   evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacotherapy treatment methods. (C)

Abstract = {{Ayahuasca is a beverage consumed at shamanic ceremonies and currently
   has gained popularity on recreational scenarios. It contains
   beta-carboline alkaloids and N,N-dimethyltryptamine, which possesses
   hallucinogenic effects. Only a few studies have elicited the
   psychoactive effects and the dose of such compounds on neurological
   dopaminergic cells or animals. In this work, we aimed to study the
   cytotoxic effects of these compounds present in ayahuasca beverages and
   on five different teas (Banisteriopsis caapi, Psychotria viridis,
   Peganum harmala, Mimosa tenuiflora and Dc Ab (commercial name))
   preparations on dopaminergic immortalized cell lines. Moreover, a
   characterization of the derivative alkaloids was also performed. All the
   extracts were characterized by chromatographic systems and the effect of
   those compounds in cell viability and total protein levels were analyzed
   in N27 dopaminergic neurons cell line. This is the first article where
   cytotoxicity of ayahuasca tea is studied on neurological dopaminergic
   cells. Overall, results showed that both cell viability and protein
   contents decreased when cells were exposed to the individual compounds,
   as well as to the teas and to the two mixtures based on the traditional
   ayahuasca beverages.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke
   is often performed with the patient under conscious sedation. Emergent
   conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia is sometimes
   necessary. The aim of this study was to assess the functional outcome in
   converted patients compared with patients who remained in conscious
   sedation and to identify predictors associated with the risk of
   conversion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 368 patients, included in 3 trials
   randomizing between conscious sedation and general anesthesia before
   endovascular therapy (SIESTA, ANSTROKE, and GOLIATH) constituted the
   study cohort. Twenty-one (11\%) of 185 patients randomized to conscious
   sedation were emergently converted to general anesthesia.
   RESULTS: Absence of hyperlipidemia seemed to be the strongest predictor
   of conversion to general anesthesia, albeit a weak predictor (area under
   curve = 0.62). Sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, atrial
   fibrillation, blood pressure, size of the infarct, and level and side of
   the occlusion were not significantly associated with conversion to
   general anesthesia. Neither age (mean age, 71.3 +/- 13.8 years for
   conscious sedation versus 71.6 +/- 12.3 years for converters, P =.58)
   nor severity of stroke (mean NIHSS score, 17 +/- 4 versus 18 6 4,
   respectively, P = .27) were significantly different between converters
   and those who tolerated conscious sedation. The converters had
   significantly worse outcome with a common odds ratio of 2.67 (P =.015)
   for a shift toward a higher mRS score compared with the patients
   remaining in the conscious sedation group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing conversion had significantly worse
   outcome compared with patients remaining in conscious sedation. No
   factor was identified that predicted conversion from conscious sedation
   to general anesthesia.}},

   influenced by competing pressures from the overburdened network and

   identify leeway within, performing in ways that open tsuro up, producing

Abstract = {{Recent advances in our understanding of the dynamical history of the
   Solar system have altered the inferred bombardment history of the Earth
   during accretion of the Late Veneer, after the Moon-forming impact. We
   investigate how the bombardment by planetesimals left-over from the
   terrestrial planet region after terrestrial planet formation, as well as
   asteroids and comets, affects the evolution of Earth's early atmosphere.
   We develop a new statistical code of stochastic bombardment for
   atmosphere evolution, combining prescriptions for atmosphere loss and
   volatile delivery derived from hydrodynamic simulations and theory with
   results from dynamical modelling of realistic populations of impactors.
   We find that for an initially Earth-like atmosphere, impacts cause
   moderate atmospheric erosion with stochastic delivery of large
   asteroids, giving substantial growth (x 10) in a few per cent of cases.
   The exact change in atmosphere mass is inherently stochastic and
   dependent on the dynamics of the left-over planetesimals. We also
   consider the dependence on unknowns including the impactor volatile
   content, finding that the atmosphere is typically completely stripped by
   especially dry left-over planetesimals (< 0.02 per cent volatiles).
   Remarkably, for a wide range of initial atmosphere masses and
   compositions, the atmosphere converges towards similar final masses and
   compositions, i.e. initially low-mass atmospheres grow, whereas massive
   atmospheres deplete. While the final properties are sensitive to the
   assumed impactor properties, the resulting atmosphere mass is close to
   that of current Earth. The exception to this is that a large initial
   atmosphere cannot be eroded to the current mass unless the atmosphere
   was initially primordial in composition.}},

   the very human experiences upon which we reflect. We provide key

   relationship between corruption and leverage is positive and
   significant, except at the 10th quantile, with the effects being
   strongest at the higher quantiles. The results also hold in various

Title = {{Disparity in biomedical publication trends in the CARICOM countries: Is
   there a need for a more vibrant research culture in the region?}},
Journal = {{SAGE OPEN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biomedical research and publications provide evidence-based
   information about the extent and burden of health-related problems of a
   country and help to formulate strategic and operational plans to tackle
   the problems.
   Purpose: To determine the biomedical publication rates of CARICOM full
   member countries.
   Methods: Biomedical publications of full member CARICOM countries were
   retrieved using PubMed (1990-2015) and SCImago Journal \& Country Rank
   (1996-2015) databases. CARICOM countries having >50 publications in the
   PubMed (1990-2015) database were subject to further analysis, whereby
   publications of each country were adjusted by total population (million
   population), gross domestic product (billion-dollar), and Internet usage
   rate (hundred thousand population).
   Results: Total publications by all countries were 7281 and 8378 in
   PubMed and SCImago Journal \& Country Rank, respectively. Jamaica
   produced highest number of publications (PubMed: 3928 (53.9\%); SCImago
   Journal \& Country Rank: 2850 (34.0\%)). In both databases, Grenada had
   the highest research publications when adjusted with per million
   population (4721 and 10,633), per billion gross domestic product (803
   and 1651), and per hundred thousand Internet users (1487 and 3387).
   Trend analysis revealed Jamaica produced the highest number of
   additional PubMed listed publications each year, averaging 4.8/year,
   followed by Trinidad and Tobago (4.4). According to SCImago Journal \&
   Country Rank, Jamaica also had the highest number of citations (42,311)
   and h-index (76), followed by Trinidad and Tobago (29,152 and 71).
   Barbados had the highest number of citations per document (24.9),
   followed by Haiti (18.4). The publication rates determined by PubMed and
   SCImago Journal \& Country Rank databases were significantly correlated
   (p < 0.001). Most publications (68\% SCImago Journal \& Country Rank and
   85\% PubMed) can be attributed to authors affiliated with Barbados,
   Jamaica, and Trinidad.
   Conclusion: Publication and citation rates varied markedly between
   CARICOM countries and were in general low. Most publications could be
   attributed to researchers affiliated with The University of the West
   Indies. More universities valuing biomedical research are needed in the
   region, and more resources needed to improve publication rates.}},

Title = {{A study on the interaction of jet with constituent layers of
   multilayered structure in through kerfing with abrasive waterjets}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{117-133}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive waterjet technology is favored over solid cutting tools for
   cutting of multi-layered structures in view of its non-contact nature
   and its ability to cut a wide range of materials. However, the
   stochastic nature of abrasive water jet (AWJ) interacting with a
   multi-layered structure (MLS) produces a non-uniform kerf geometry. This
   non-uniformity depends on the characteristics of jet i.e. jet energy,
   the duration of interaction of jet with the material, and the nature of
   material exposed to the jet during cutting. This paper attempts to cover
   a study that systematically analyses the geometry of kerf generated in
   MLS and a stack of multiple materials with each material having
   different mechanical properties. It also covers a study to analyse the
   role of interfacial adhesive layer on kerf profile variation, and the
   preferential orientation of multi-layered structure and stacked
   materials, with its top layer, having an appropriate mechanical
   resistance (MR), in order to arrive at a strategy to present the
   structure or a stack of materials to AWJs for producing near uniform
   kerf profile. Hence, AWJ cutting experiments were carried out over a
   singleand doublelayered structures (SLSs, DLSs) with two different
   materials such as aluminum (Al), mild steel (MS), which showed a
   completely different kerf geometry when these materials are stacked in
   different ways. Stacking of these materials in different ways produced
   kerf of different geometry not only in the materials but also at their
   interface. This systematic study enabled to suggest the correct
   presentation of MLS and also a stack of multiple materials with a
   suitable material in top layer, to AWJ, for producing near uniform kerf
   in them. Further, this study also suggested several hypotheses like the
   importance of relative MR of adjoining layers, critical jet traverse
   rate, pseudo focusing nozzle, and the choice of layer placement in
   producing near uniform kerf on MLS and a stack of materials, so as to
   minimize the efforts in post machining of AWJ cut surfaces. Finally, the
   relevance of the proposed hypotheses was validated by analyzing the kerf
   formed over MS-rubber-MS and rubber-MS-rubber configured three-layered
   structure.}},

   humans by tick bites. The bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been
   known from decades to cause the disease, tick-borne fever (TBF) in
   domestic ruminants and cattles in various areas in northern Europe,
   China, Russian border and United Kingdom. In recent years, outbreak of
   A.phagocytophilum infection has enhanced multifold and is widely
   reported in I. persulcatus and engorged as D. silvarum ticks in north
   eastern regions of China. However, few genome sequences have been
   completed so far, thus observations on biological, ecological, and
   pathological differences between genotypes of this bacterium,are yet to
   be elucidated by molecular and experimental infection studies.
   In our current work, We have investigated 4 completely sequenced Genomic
   strains of A.phagocytophilum using various insilico tools SPINE and
   AGENT to characterize the percentage of Core Genome, Accessory genome
   and Pan Genome of these species. Further, we have tried to characterize
   the serotype and find the resistance genes observed in these four
   strains using MLST and ResFinder tools available at centre of Genetic
   epidemiology, Denmark Technical University server. By application of
   ClustAGE tool, we have made a comparative assessment of accessory genes
   across these strains. Heatmaps using expression map of these 4 genomes
   was constructed to infer the conserved genes and variable genes across
   these strains. Our study led to conclusion that core genome across these
   strains varies from 1.43 Mbps to 1.47 Mbps and accessory genomes varies
   from 0.0410 Mbps to 0.0734 Mbps. Comparison of the Gene clusters led to
   conclusion that gene clusters led to core genome value of 318 and Pan
   Genome value of 1035. Our analysis characterizes the dominance of
   accessory genes during evolution of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and lesser
   conservation of genes as there is a phylogenetic variation observed.}},

Title = {{Exploration for strategic placer mineral deposits in a fluctuating
   shoreline: Depositional environment and mineralogical characterization
   of the NE Odisha coast placers, India}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Systematic exploration for beach placer minerals has been undertaken in
   the Chandipur area of the Balasore district on the NE Odisha coast of
   India. Beach and dune sands are ubiquitous along the 1-1.5 km-wide NNE
   trending coast. Forty-three representative samples were collected from
   selected boreholes sampled by auger and dormer drilling at depths
   ranging from 6.0 m to 12.0 m. Detailed experimental studies show that
   the total heavy minerals (THM) grade of the study area varies from 0.4
   to 11.2\% with an average grade of 3.8\% for the individual samples; the
   upper 5.50 m sand column with a grade of 5.2\% is most significant. The
   heavy mineral assemblages, in decreasing volumetric percentages, are
   comprised of 55\% ilmenite, 25\% sillimanite, 11\% pyriboles/others
   (pymxene, amphibole, mica, coated grains etc.), 5.9\% rutile, 1.5\%
   leucoxene, 1.2\% garnet, 0.5\% zircon, and 0.4\% magnetite. Texturally,
   elevated heavy mineral concentrations are drawn from +200 ASTM (+75 qm)
   and 120 ASTM (+125 qm) mesh size fraction; the 40 ASTM (425 qm) size
   fraction contains lowest THM. The overall concentration of heavy
   minerals shows variable distribution patterns from shore to littoral
   (inland), and the maximum concentration of THM is observed within the
   1.5 m sandy surface horizon. The present study also addresses the
   down-core variation of heavy mineral assemblages and role of
   hydrodynamic conditions in the deposition of these wide-ranging placer
   minerals. The range of graphic mean sizes (Mz) varies from 2.19 to 2.60
   (Phi), which corroborates the deposition of sediments in low energy
   condition in a fluctuating shoreline along the Chandipur coast. Linear
   discriminant function analysis is predominantly indicative of diversity
   in the depositional features under aeolian conditions in a shallow
   marine environment. CM and Tractive current plots indicate that the
   sediments are mainly formed by graded suspension and without any rolling
   conditions in the beach subenvironment in a tractive current field. Both
   the perennial (Panchpara River) and the ephemeral drainage systems
   (Dubdubi River) played a dominant role in transporting and supplying
   sediment flux consisting of radioactive mineral (monazite) assemblages
   in the study area. The present detailed exploration study reveals a new
   find of placer deposits with radioactive and non-radioactive mineral
   assemblages formed from diverse sources.}},

Title = {{A Comparative In Vitro Sensitivity Study of
   ``Ceftriaxone-Sulbactam-EDTA{''} and Various Antibiotics against
   Gramnegative Bacterial Isolates from Intensive Care Unit}},
Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: A rapid increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains is
   being seen across the globe especially in the Southeast Asian region,
   including India. Carbapenems and colistin form the mainstay of treatment
   against Gram-negative pathogens, especially extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamase (ESBL)and metallo-beta-lactamse (MBL)-producing isolates.
   However, due to increased resistance to carbapenems and toxicity of
   colistin, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), carbapenem-sparing
   antibiotics like ceftriaxone-sulbactam-EDTA (CSE) combination needs to
   be evaluated.
   Materials and methods: Bacterial isolates cultured from various clinical
   samples from all ICUs for a period of 9 months were evaluated. Bacterial
   identification was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption
   ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and
   antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed by disc diffusion and E
   test method. Antibiogram of various antibiotics was noted.
   Extended-spectrum beta-lactamaseand MBL-producing bacteria were
   identified by phenotypic methods. Antibiotic sensitivity results of CSE
   were compared with the comparator drugs like colistin, carbapenems, and
   tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacterspp., and Pseudomonas
   spp. along with ESBL and MBL producers.
   Results:A total of 2,760 samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
   respiratory samples, tissue, and pus were collected from ICUs with
   maximum isolates from pus (37\%) followed by respiratory samples (31\%)
   and blood (27\%). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the
   predominant gram-negative pathogens accounting for 56\% of the isolates
   followed by Acinetobacter spp. (23\%) and Pseudomonas spp. (15\%).
   Extended spectrum beta-lactamase screening was positive for 57\%
   (1,069/1,877) isolates; whereas 43\% (732/1,877) were MBL producers.
   According to the antibiotic susceptibility results, CSE was the most
   effective antibiotic showing 94\% sensitivity for carbapenem-sensitive
   Enterobacteriaceae and 97\% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter and
   Pseudomonas spp. Among the other drugs, colistin was found to be the
   most effective showing almost 95\% sensitivity in both the
   Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae group (both ESBL +
   OXA/NDM). Ceftriaxone-sulbactam-EDTA was also found much more effective
   (95\%) as compared to Colistin (89\%) toward ESBLand MBL-producing
   strains of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae group. Among
   the carbapenems, imipenem was the most effective drug against
   Enterobacteriaceae showing 34\% sensitivity and ertapenem proved to be
   least effective.
   Conclusion: In our present study, CSE emerged as a potent antibacterial
   agent against MDR gram-negative infections; both for ESBL as well as MBL
   producers. Hence, in light of present study, we strongly recommend
   inclusion of CSE in routine sensitivity panel and may be used as a
   carbapenemand colistin-sparing drug and a promising option against ESBL
   and MBL producers especially in ICU.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) dynamics during changes in land use patterns in tropical
   forests may profoundly affect fine root dynamics and nutrient cycling
   processes. Variations in fine root biomass and soil N dynamics were
   assessed in developing stands of increasing ages following shifting
   agriculture in Mizoram, Northeast India, and comparisons were made with
   a natural forest stand. Concentrations of soil available N (NH4-N and
   NO3-N) and the proportion of NH4-N in total available N increased with
   stand age. The N-mineralization rate also increased with stand age
   whilst the proportion of nitrification relative to ammonification
   declined during succession. Fine root biomass and N-mineralization
   increased, and available N decreased during the monsoon season while
   this pattern was reversed during the winter season. A greater proportion
   of fine roots were <0.5 mm diameter in the younger sites, and turnover
   of fine roots was more rapid in the developing stands compared to the
   natural forest. Fine root biomass was correlated positively with
   N-mineralization rate and soil water content. Thus, it can be concluded
   that the fine root growth was aided by rapid N-mineralization, and both
   fine root growth and N-mineralization increase as stands redevelop
   following shifting cultivation disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Photoplethysmographic (PPG) measurements from ambulatory subjects may
   suffer from unreliability due to body movements and missing data
   segments due to loosening of sensor. This paper describes an on-device
   reliability assessment from PPG measurements using a stack denoising
   autoencoder (SDAE) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). The
   missing segments were predicted by a personalized convolutional neural
   network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) model using a short
   history of the same channel data. Forty sets of volunteers' data,
   consisting of equal share of healthy and cardiovascular subjects were
   used for validation and testing. The PPG reliability assessment model
   (PRAM) achieved over 95\% accuracy for correctly identifying acceptable
   PPG beats out of total 5000 using expert annotated data. Disagreement
   with experts' annotation was nearly 3.5\%. The missing segment
   prediction model (MSPM) achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of
   0.22, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.11 for 40 missing beats
   prediction using only four beat history from the same channel PPG. The
   two models were integrated in a standalone device based on quad-core ARM
   Cortex-A53, 1.2 GHz, with 1 GB RAM, with 130 MB memory requirement and
   latency similar to 0.35 s per beat prediction with a 30 s frame. The
   present method also provides improved performance with published works
   on PPG quality assessment and missing data prediction using two public
   datasets, CinC and MIMIC-II under PhysioNet.}},

Abstract = {{Producer strains have been created with an expression system based on
   the recipient strain Penicillium verruculosum 537 (Delta niaD) and the
   cellobiohydrolase-1 gene promoter. These strains made it possible to
   obtain new enzyme preparations (EPs) for feed production that were
   characterized by a high content of endodepolymerases
   (endo-beta-1,4-glucanases and endo-beta-1,4-xylanase), which degrade
   nonstarch polysaccharides (NSPs) of grain cereals used as a feed
   component. The proportion of endodepolymerases in the new EPs was
   44-68\% of the total protein content (as compared to 15\% in the
   recipient-based preparation), whereas the percentage of exodepolymerases
   (cellobiohydrolases) fell to 8-26\% as compared to 60\% in the recipient
   strain-based product. The new EPs have a high specific activity of
   endodepolymerases, which was 1.8-4.6 times greater than that in the EP
   obtained from the recipient strain, and the specific activity of
   exodepolymerases decreased by 2.0-3.7 times. The new EPs demonstrated
   endoglucanase and xylanase activities in a wide range of pH and
   temperature, including the physiological values of these parameters (pH
   3.0 and 7.0, and t 37-38 degrees C). They were characterized by high
   endodepolymerase stability under the action of digestive proteases
   (pepsin and trypsin). The EPs also retained their endoglucanase and
   xylanase activities during feed granulation (80 degrees C). The xylanase
   contained in the new EPs was not affected by proteinaceous inhibitors
   from cereals. Experimental batches of EPs were made by the Agroferment
   enzyme-producing plant and were tested in broiler and piglet feeding.
   The addition of the new commercial EPs to the animals' diets increased
   their live weight, reduced feed and protein intake, and decreased the
   metabolic energy per unit of body weight, improving digestibility and
   assimilability of feed nutrients, especially raw fiber and NSP.}},

Abstract = {{The present work aims to investigate the microstructure and mechanical
   behavior of the dissimilar welded joint (DWJ) of martensitic A 335-grade
   P91 steel and high alloy ferritic austenitic A 182 F69 steel produced by
   the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. The microstructural studies
   showed the variety of the microstructure across the DWJ, which formed
   mainly due to the solidification and solid-state phase transformation as
   a result of the weld thermal cycle. The microstructural studies were
   performed in as-welded as well as post-weld heat treatment (PWHT)
   conditions. PWHT has been conducted to improve the mechanical properties
   of the P91 heataffected zone (HAZ) at 760 degrees C (PW 1) and 810
   degrees C (PW 2) for 2 h. For the mechanical properties of the DWJ,
   tensile tests, and microhardness tests were conducted. The fractured
   tensile specimen has been characterized using the scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The
   centre region of the weld metal showed the equiaxed dendrites while the
   interface near the boat fusion line, on both the P91 and F69 sides,
   showed the cellular and columnar dendrites. PWHT has observed a
   negligible effect on the microstructure and hardness of WFZ and F69 HAZ,
   while a significant change was observed for P91 HAZ. The tensile
   strength of the DWJ was measured maximum (735 MPa) for as-welded
   condition and reduced after the PWHT and for PW 2, it was measured lower
   than that of P91 and F69 base metal. The failure of the tensile specimen
   was also noticed in the soft inter-critical HAZ (ICHAZ) region for PW 2
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
   The treatment of recurrent patellofemoral instability has undergone a
   paradigm change during the last 15 years. Instead of non-anatomical
   operations, the current concept favors the reconstruction of injured
   structures and the normalization of the biomechanical environment. Our
   aim was to briefly summarize the etiology, diagnostic regimen, and
   therapeutic decision making of this varied patient group and to review
   our own patients who underwent combined medial patellofemoral ligament
   reconstrucion and tibial tubercle transfer.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS
   Between 2015-2017 we performed combined ligament reconstruction and
   tubercle transfer for recurrent patellofemoral instability on 10
   patients. The patients were examined for the degree of trochlea
   dysplasia, height of the patella, tibial tubercle trochlear groove
   distance. Additional intraarticular abnormalities were noted. The
   patients were assessed preoperatively and at follow-up using the Tegner
   Activity Scale and the Kujala score. Return to sports was also examined.
   RESULTS
   The average age of our patients was 22 years (15-40). We had 6 female
   patients and 4 male patient. The average follow-up time was 29 months
   (12-44). 9 patients had a medializing of the tibial tubercle, whilst one
   patient had a pure distalization to go along with the medial
   patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using PEEK tenodesis screws. We
   had no redislocations up to the last follow-up and patients were able to
   return to their previous activity level and/or sporting activity. The
   Kujala score improved from an average preoperative value of 48.9 (32-58)
   to an average follow-up value of 88.6 (70-97).
   DISCUSSION
   The essential steps in the treatment of recurrent patellofemoral
   instability are a thorough physical examination, appropriate imaging and
   the individual correction of the uncovered anatomical abnormalities.
   Neither isolated lateral retinacular release, nor medial capsular
   reefing can preictably produce satisfactory results.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with tibial tubercle
   transfer (medializing and/or distalization) is a reliable surgical
   technique, that provides long term patellar stabilty in this selected
   group of young patients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the effect of a plant
   cultivating program carried out in a community mental health center
   (CMHC) on the functional remission levels of individuals with
   schizophrenia.
   Materials and methods: The study was carried out as experimental
   research in pretest-posttest with control group design. Eighty
   individuals being followed up and treated at two CMHCs were randomly
   assigned to an intervention and a control group. The plant cultivating
   program, containing a theoretical and a practical sequence, was
   conducted for six weeks in the intervention group. The effectiveness of
   the program was assessed with the Functional Remission of General
   Schizophrenia (FROGS) scale.
   Results: The individuals participating in the program registered a
   significant increase in their FROGS scale overall scores as compared to
   the control group following the program. After the program, the
   intervention group's social, health, daily skills and professional
   functioning posttest scores were significantly higher than those of the
   control group.
   Conclusion: The plant cultivating program applied to individuals with
   schizophrenia at the CMHCs positively resulted in an improvement in
   their functional remission. The nurse-led plant cultivating program
   conducted at the CMHCs was observed to be an effective and applicable
   program that would improve the social, health, daily skills and
   professional functioning of individuals with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Task shifting has been recommended as a strategy to reach out to persons
   with mental illness and bridge the treatment gap. There is a need to
   explore task-shifting using existing health staff like Accredited Social
   Health Activists (ASHAs).
   Aim and Context:
   ASHAs are involved in ongoing community-based rehabilitation (CBR)
   program run with a public-private partnership over the last 5 years at
   Jagaluru Taluk (an administrative block) in Davanagere district
   (Karnataka, India). This article aims to summarize a randomized
   controlled trial (RCT) to examine whether CBR delivered by ASHAs is more
   effective than treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing
   disability associated with severe mental illness (SMI).
   Method:
   A group of proactive ASHAs is already working with us for a follow-up of
   persons with SMI. For the study, we would allocate areas that are
   currently not being covered proactively by ASHAs randomly in a 1:1 ratio
   via computer-generated randomization list to receive either ASHAs
   delivered CBR arm or TAU control group. A sample size of about 100 in
   each arm is enough to identify an effect size of 0.5 in total IDEAS
   score between the intervention and control arms with a power of 90\% and
   an alpha of 0.05. We use the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items:
   Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement to describe the
   methods of the trial.
   Result:
   The study has been approved by the institute ethics committee and
   registered with CTRI (CTRI/2019/08/020585 dated 6th August 2019). The
   recruitment of subjects is ongoing. The patients will be followed up for
   1 year and assessed. The trial is funded by the Indian Council of
   Medical Research, Government of India.
   Discussion:
   The results of the study will be helpful from a public health
   perspective in delivering cost-effective and replicable CBR for persons
   with SMI through ASHAs. If the model turns successful, this could be
   expanded throughout the state/country. This would go a long way in
   bridging the huge treatment gap.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Aviation Rescue Firefighters (ARFF) require physical fitness
   specific to the aviation environment. This study aims to determine the
   physical fitness of ARFF and predictors of performance on ARFF-specific
   tasks from laboratory-based fitness measures.
   Design: Cross-sectional, observational study.
   Methods: Forty-two male ARFF (mean +/- SD; age 38.4 +/- 7.6 years, body
   mass index 26.2 +/- 2.2 kg m(-2)) completed a physical fitness testing
   battery, comprising maximal aerobic capacity ((V) over dotO(2max)),
   lactate threshold, anaerobic power, body composition (dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry), muscular strength (3 repetition maximum (3RM) bench and
   leg press) and muscular endurance (maximum curl ups and push ups) under
   controlled laboratory conditions. On a separate occasion, ARFF completed
   timed work-related tasks including a hose drag, dummy drag, Stihl saw
   hold, stair climb and simulated ARFF emergency protocol.
   Results: All participants finished the simulated ARFF emergency protocol
   under the criterion time (5 min 50 s); the average completion time was 4
   min and 31 s. Performance time on the simulated ARFF emergency protocol
   was inversely correlated to (V) over dotO(2max) (r= -0.514; p< 0.001),
   anaerobic step test performance (r = -0.549; p< 0.001), height (r =
   -0.325; p= 0.038) and lean mass (r= -0.429; p= 0.005). Higher fat mass
   (r = 0.318; p= 0.043) and \% body fat (r = 0.481; p= 0.001) were
   associated with slower performance time. Muscular strength, muscular
   endurance and flexibility were not related to performance on the
   simulated ARFF emergency protocol.
   Conclusions: Aerobic and anaerobic capacities, as well as body
   composition are the strongest predictors of simulated ARFF emergency
   protocol performance. This study highlights the importance of aerobic
   and anaerobic fitness, compared to muscular strength or muscular
   endurance, for ARFF job-specific performance, employment and training.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Fascia lata remains a popular and robust graft to repair
   osteodural defects in endoscopic neurosurgery. Classically, this graft
   is obtained via a large incision in the thigh that is prone to pain and
   muscle herniation after surgery.
   OBJECTIVE: To present a novel technique for harvesting fat and fascia
   lata graft and reapproximating the edges via an endoscopic approach
   through the thigh using an ``outside-in{''} technique to prevent muscle
   herniation.
   METHODS: Initially our technique was performed in cadavers and includes
   the following: small 2 cm incision in the lateral thigh to accommodate
   the endoscope, use of blunt dissection and endoscopic tools to obtain
   the graft, and reapproximation of the fascia via an outside-in technique
   using conventional sutures with endoscopic visualization to retrieve the
   sutures beneath the skin and tie them. We then applied the technique to
   a patient undergoing transsphenoidal tumor resection.
   RESULTS: This technique was trialed in 3 cadaver specimens (6 limbs) and
   was used successfully in a patient with excellent cosmetic results seen
   in follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: Endoscopic retrieval of fascia lata is feasible via a very
   small incision. Reapproximation of the cut fascia) edges to minimize
   muscle herniation can quickly and easily be performed with an outside-in
   technique detailed here. Additional case series may help to solidify the
   endoscopic retrieval as a preferred technique for fascia lata graft.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of ferritic transformation and the corresponding

   medium-Mn steel during isothermal annealing was investigated in
   dilatometric studies. The material was subjected to thermal and
   thermo-mechanical treatments aimed at obtaining, by the austenite ->
   ferrite transformation, a sufficient fraction of ferrite to stabilize
   the retained austenite by C and eventual Mn partitioning. The samples
   were isothermally held for 5 h in a temperature range from 600 to 750
   degrees C to simulate simplified temperature conditions of an industrial
   coiling process following hot rolling. Some of the samples were
   plastically deformed at a temperature of 900 degrees C before isothermal
   holding in order to study the effect of hot deformation on the kinetics
   of phase transformations. After the dilatometric investigations the
   material was subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy to
   reveal relationships between the holding temperature, deformation and
   microstructure evolution. Hardness tests were performed to assess the
   mechanical behavior. A significant effect of manganese in slowing down
   diffusional transformations during the cooling of steel was found. The
   influence of austenite deformation on the kinetics of austenite to
   ferrite transformation was noted. The plastically deformed samples
   showed an accelerated start of ferritic transformation and the extension
   of its range. During dilatometric tests, low-range dynamic ferritic
   transformation was recorded, which was also confirmed by the microscopic
   tests.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   We identified non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain
   metastases who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors at
   Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden and University Hospital of
   Heraklion, Greece from 2016 to 2019. We analyzed intracranial efficacies
   in the patients who had not received local treatment for their brain
   metastases less than three months prior to the initiation of immune
   checkpoint inhibitors and had adequate radiological evaluation. We
   demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are active in NSCLC
   patients with brain metastases regardless of the presence of
   neurological symptoms. This is a novel finding since, until now, this
   patient group has irrefutably been underrepresented in clinical studies
   and there is a clear scarcity of data. The results of our analyses
   suggest that symptomatic patients with active brain metastases (BM) may
   be considered for immunotherapy in routine clinical practice as well as
   clinical trials.
   There is lack of data addressing the intracranial (IC) efficacy of
   immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) on brain metastases (BM) in
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This patient category is
   underrepresented in randomized clinical trials. We retrospectively
   collected clinical data on patients with non-oncogenic driven NSCLC with
   BM who were treated with ICIs at two medical oncology institutes in
   Sweden and Greece from 2016 to 2019. IC efficacy was assessed in
   patients who had not received local treatment for BM less than three
   months prior to the initiation of ICIs and had adequate radiological
   evaluation. We screened 280 patients, of which 51 had BM. BM was an
   independent predictor for inferior PFS (HR = 2.27; 95\% CI, 1.53-3.36)
   but not OS (HR = 1.58; 95\% CI, 0.97-2.60) for the whole patient
   population. IC response assessment was done on 33 patients. IC objective
   response rate (ORR) was 24.2\%. The presence of neurological symptoms
   related to BM did not affect IC ORR (p = 0.48). High PD-L1 levels from
   extracranial biopsies were not a predictive factor for IC ORR (p =
   0.13). ICIs are active in NSCLC patients with BM regardless of the
   presence of neurological symptoms and can achieve durable IC disease
   stabilization in a subgroup of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the small multidrug resistance (SMR) efflux pump family known
   as SugE (recently renamed Gdx) are known for their narrow substrate
   selectivity to small guanidinium (Gdm(+)) compounds and disinfectant
   quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Gdx members have been identified
   on multidrug resistance plasmids in Gram-negative bacilli, but their
   functional role remains unclear, as few have been characterized. Here,
   we conducted a survey of sequenced proteobacterial plasmids that encoded
   one or more SugE/Gdx sequences in an effort to (i) identify the most
   frequently represented Gdx member(s) on these plasmids and their
   sequence diversity, (ii) verify if Gdx sequences possess a Gdm(+)
   riboswitch that regulates their translation similarly to chromosomally
   encoded Gdx members, and (iii) determine the antimicrobial
   susceptibility profile of the most predominate Gdx member to various
   QACs and antibiotics in Escherichia coli strains BW25113 and KAM32. The
   results of this study determined 14 unique SugE sequences, but only one
   Gdx sequence, annotated as ``SugE(p),{''} predominated among the >140
   plasmids we surveyed. Enterobacterales plasmids carrying sugE(p)
   possessed a guanidine II riboswitch similar to the upstream region of E.
   coli gdx. Cloning and expression of sugE(p), gdx, and emrE sequences
   into a low-copy-number expression vector (pMS119EH) revealed significant
   increases in QAC resistance to a limited range of detergent-like QACs
   only when gdx and sugE(p) transformants were grown as biofilms. These
   findings suggest that sugE(p) presence on proteobacterial plasmids may
   be driven by species that frequently encounter Gdm(+) and QAC exposure.
   IMPORTANCE This study characterized the function of
   antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes attributed to plasmid-encoded
   guanidinium-selective small multidrug resistance (Gdm/SugE) efflux
   pumps. These sequences are frequently monitored as biocide resistance
   markers in antimicrobial resistance surveillance studies. Our findings
   reveal that enterobacterial gdm sequences transmitted on plasmids
   possess a guanidine II riboswitch, which restricts transcript
   translation in the presence of guanidinium. Cloning and overexpression
   of this gdm sequence revealed that it confers higher resistance to
   quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) disinfectants (which possess
   guanidium moieties) when grown as biofilms. Since biofilms are commonly
   eradicated with QAC-containing compounds, the presence of this gene on
   plasmids and its biofilm-specific resistance are a growing concern for
   clinical and food safety prevention measures.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising strategy for relief of ischemic
   conditions, and gene delivery was used to stimulate blood vessels'
   formation and growth. We have previously shown that intramuscular
   injection of a mixture containing plasmids encoding vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF)165 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) leads to
   restoration of blood flow in mouse ischemic limb, and efficacy of
   combined delivery was superior to each plasmid administered alone. In
   this work, we evaluated different approaches for co-expression of HGF
   and VEGF165 genes in a panel of candidate plasmid DNAs (pDNAs) with
   internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), a bidirectional promoter or two
   independent promoters for each gene of interest. Studies in HEK293T
   culture showed that all plasmids provided synthesis of HGF and VEGF165
   proteins and stimulated capillary formation by human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVEC), indicating the biological potency of
   expressed factors. Tests in skeletal muscle explants showed a dramatic
   difference and most plasmids failed to express HGF and VEGF165 in a
   significant quantity. However, a bicistronic plasmid with two
   independent promoters (cytomegalovirus (CMV) for HGF and chicken b-actin
   (CAG) for VEGF165) provided expression of both grow factors in skeletal
   muscle at an equimolar ratio. Efficacy tests of bicistronic plasmid were
   performed in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia. Intramuscular
   administration of plasmid induced significant restoration of perfusion
   compared to an empty vector and saline. These findings were supported by
   increased CD31+ capillary density in animals that received pHGF/VEGF.
   Overall, our study reports a first-in-class candidate gene therapy drug
   to deliver two pivotal angiogenic growth factors (HGF and VEGF165) with
   properties that provide basis for future development of treatment for an
   unmet medical need-peripheral artery disease and associated limb
   ischemia.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Safe and stable fixation of metaphyseal and epiphyseal
   fractures by Kirschner (K-)wire osteosynthesis. Use of various K-wire
   configurations depending on the fracture morphology. Indications In
   accordance with the AO Pediatric Comprehensive Classification of
   Long-Bone Fractures (PCCF), all Salter-Harris (SH) and metaphyseal
   fractures as well as fractures of the foot and hand independent of the
   reduction technique, closed or open, provided that adaptation
   osteosynthesis allows sufficient stability. Fixation/immobilization in a
   plaster cast is mandatory after K-wire osteosynthesis. Contraindications
   All diaphyseal fractures, if a K-wire is not used as an intramedullary
   nail. Fractures that can not be correctly reduced or are nonreducible
   fractures. Surgical technique After closed or open, as anatomical
   reduction as possible, one, two, occasionally three K-wires per fragment
   are inserted under fluoroscopic control. Care must be taken that the
   K-wires optimally capture the fragment to be fixed as well as the main
   fragment (metaphysis). It must therefore be possible to make a strictly
   lateral and correct anteroposterior x-ray by image intensifier. It is
   important that the C-arm can be positioned at the appropriate level.
   Rotating the limb should be minimized, as prior to fixation the
   previously reduced fragments may shift again, resulting in poor K-wire
   fixation. Depending on the morphology of the fracture, size of the
   fragments and location of the fracture (humerus, forearm, femur or
   tibia, hand or foot), the K-wiring technique must be adapted, e.g.,
   mono-laterally crossed, mono-laterally divergent, in an ascending or
   descending direction, or the most commonly used ascending crossed
   technique. In most cases, the K-wires protrude through the sin and the
   exposed ends are bent. This allows removal without renewed anesthesia in
   the outpatient setting. K-wire osteosynthesis is neither a compression
   osteosynthesis (OS) nor a neutralization OS, but is always an adaptation
   and fixation of the fragments. Therefore, K-wire OS always needs
   additional immobilization using a plaster or prefabricated splint.
   Postoperative management Immobilization in plaster cast for 4-5 weeks,
   depending on the age; care must be taken to avoid interference between
   the cast and the skin/K-wires. Results With technically and optimally
   performed fixation and correct indication for K-wire OS, as well as
   adequate posttreatment, very good to good results are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We previously identified ZNF217 as an oncogenic driver of a subset of
   osteosarcomas using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system. Here, we
   followed up by investigating the genetic role of ZNF217 in osteosarcoma
   initiation and progression through the establishment of a novel
   genetically engineered mouse model, in vitro assays, orthotopic mouse
   studies, and paired these findings with preclinical studies using a
   small-molecule inhibitor. Through-out, we demonstrate that ZNF217 is
   coupled to numerous facets of osteosarcoma transformation, including
   proliferation, cell motility, and anchorage independent growth, and
   ultimately promoting osteosarcoma growth, progression, and metastasis in
   part through positive modulation of PI3K-AKT survival signaling.
   Pharma-cologic blockade of AKT signaling with nucleoside analogue
   triciribine in ZNF217(+) orthotopically injected osteosarcoma cell lines
   reduced tumor growth and metastasis. Our data demonstrate that
   triciribine treatment may be a relevant and efficacious therapeutic
   strategy for patients with osteosarcoma with ZNF217(+) and p-AKT rich
   tumors. With the recent revitalization of triciribine for clinical
   studies in other solid cancers, our study provides a rationale for
   further evaluation preclinically with the purpose of clinical evaluation

   Houston, 1997 to 2016}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization results in increasing impervious surfaces with the
   potential to threaten fragile environments and heighten flood risks. In
   the United States, research on the social processes driving urbanization
   has tended to focus on the twenty-first century, but less is known about
   how temporal trends arose from the spatial layout of the urban land upon
   which this growth was founded. To address this gap, we present a novel
   interdisciplinary synthesis using neighborhood-level census data in
   tandem with a satellite-derived annual land cover change time series to
   assess the role of race, affluence, and socioeconomic status in shaping
   spatio-temporal urbanization in the Houston metropolitan area from
   1997-2016. Results from cross-sectional and temporal regression models
   indicate that while social dynamics associated with historical versus
   recent urbanization are related, they are not identical. Thus, while
   temporal change in Houston's urbanization is driven primarily by
   socioeconomic status, the social dynamics associated with spatial
   disparities in urbanization relate primarily to race, regardless of
   socioeconomic status. These results are noteworthy as urbanization in
   Houston does not fully comport with existing theoretical perspectives or
   with empirical findings nationally. Instead, we suggest these findings
   reflect the city's politics and culture surrounding land use. Thus,
   beyond its important social and environmental implications, this study
   affirms the utility of fusing socio-demographic data with satellite
   remote sensing of urban growth, and highlights the value of the
   socioenvironmental succession framework for characterizing urbanization
   as a recursive process in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo survey individuals who tested positive for severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at 1 of 4 Trinity Health
   of New England drive-through testing centers to assess their demographic
   information, hospitalization rate, preexisting conditions, possible
   routes of exposures, duration of symptoms, and subsequent household
   infections of healthcare workers (HCWs) when compared to non-HCWs.
   MethodsData were collected via a telephone survey using a standardized
   script. Between March 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020, 28,903 people were
   tested at 4 Connecticut drive-through testing centers. Individuals who
   tested positive between March 16 and April 21, 2020 were randomly
   contacted. Of those individuals, 100 people agreed to complete the
   survey. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed.
   ResultsHCWs comprised 46\% of the 100 survey respondents during the
   study period. Similarly, HCWs comprised 42.1\% of all individuals who
   tested positive and listed an employer between March 1 and June 17,
   2020. HCWs reported a longer duration of symptoms (17.39 vs 13.44 days)
   and were more likely to report work as their route of exposure (80.4\%
   vs 27.8\%) than non-HCWs.
   ConclusionsHCWs may face a disproportionate risk of contracting COVID-19

Abstract = {{We conducted 22 GHz 1 `' Jansky Very Large Array imaging of 100
   radio-quiet X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the
   Swift-Burst Array Telescope (Swift-BAT) survey. We find AGN-driven
   kiloparsec-scale radio structures inconsistent with pure star formation
   in 11 AGN. The host galaxies of these AGN lie significantly below the
   star-forming main sequence, indicating suppressed star formation. While
   these radio structures tend to be physically small compared to the host
   galaxy, the global star formation rate of the host is affected. We
   evaluate the energetics of the radio structures interpreted first as
   immature radio jets, and then as consequences of an AGN-driven radiative
   outflow, and compare them to two criteria for successful feedback: the
   ability to remove the CO-derived molecular gas mass from the galaxy
   gravitational potential and the kinetic energy transfer to molecular
   clouds leading to v(cloud) > sigma({*}). In most cases, the jet
   interpretation is insufficient to provide the energy necessary to cause
   the star formation suppression. Conversely, the wind interpretation
   provides ample energy in all but one case. We conclude that it is more
   likely that the observed suppression of star formation in the global
   host galaxy is due to interstellar medium interactions of a radiative
   outflow, rather than a small-scale radio jet.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a series of bioactive ferrocene-modified N-heterocycles with
   alkyl linkers was prepared in good to quantitative yields starting from
   easy accessible ferrocene alcohols and heterocycles under acidic or
   neutral (for imidazole) conditions in racemic forms. The analytical
   resolution of a number of bioactive racemic ferrocene azoles 1-6 (where
   azole = imidazole, pyrazole, and benzotriazole derivatives) into
   enantiomers was first carried out by CE using sulfobuthylether-beta-CD
   (captisol) as a chiral selector. The analytical approaches to highly
   enantiomeric-enriched ferrocene derivatives are based on the formation
   of their inclusion complexes. The best chiral separation was achieved
   using zone CE in a quartz capillary. The ACE was used to evaluate the
   stability constants of captisol complexes with enantiomeric forms of two
   ferrocene derivatives 1, FcCHMe-imidazole, and 6, FcCHMe-benzotriazole.
   The optimal conditions for the resolution of the studied (R,
   S)-ferrocene compounds 1, 2, and 6 were predicted on the basis of the
   performed quantum chemical calculations and then implemented by the
   electrophoretic method. A high correlation between density functional
   theory calculation results and experimental electrophoresis data were
   obtained. Successful enantioseparation of racemic mixtures is of great
   importance for the characterization and further applications of drug
   candidates in enantiopure forms and in the development of clinical
   treatment. The advantages of the CE procedure make it possible to have
   important practical value and significance for determining the purity
   and enantiomeric excess of other ferrocene-containing compounds.}},

Title = {{Effect of infection control barriers on the light output from a
   multi-peak light curing unit}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{103}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Curing lights cannot be sterilized and should be covered
   with an infection control barrier. This study evaluated the effect of
   barriers when applied correctly and incorrectly on the radiant power
   (mW), irradiance (mW/cm(2)), emission spectrum (mW/nm), and beam profile
   from a multi-peak light-curing unit (LCU).
   Methods: Five plastic barriers (VALO Grand, Ultradent; TIDIShield, TIDI
   Products; Disposa-Shield, Dentsply Sirona; Cure Sleeve, Kerr; Stretch
   and Seal, Betty Crocker) and one latex-based barrier (Curelastic,
   Steri-Shield) were tested. The radiant power (mW) and emission spectrum
   (mW/nm) from one multi-peak LCU (VALO Grand, Ultradent) was measured
   using an integrating sphere. LCU tip internal diameter (mm) was
   measured, then the tip area and irradiance (mW/cm(2)) were calculated.
   The beam profiles were measured using a laser beam profiler.
   Results: When applied correctly, the plastic barriers reduced the
   radiant power output by 5-8\%, and the latexbased barrier by 16\%. When
   the plastic seam or barrier opaque face was positioned over the LCU tip,
   the power output was reduced by 8-11\%. When the plastic barriers were
   wrinkled, the power output was significantly reduced by 14-26\%. The
   wrinkled latex-based barrier reduced by 28\%, and further reduced the
   violet light. The beam profiles illustrated the importance of correctly
   barrier use without wrinkles over the tip.
   Conclusions: Plastic barriers applied correctly reduced the light output
   (mW) by 5-8\%. The barriers applied incorrectly significantly reduced
   the light output by 14-26\%. The latex-based barrier wrinkled also
   reduced the amount of violet light.
   Clinical relevance: Infection control curing light barriers should be
   used to prevent cross-infection between patients. However, they must be
   applied correctly to reduce their negative effects on the light output.}},

Abstract = {{The climate changes caused by the rise in the average temperature of the
   earth are unmistakable. These changes, subject several systems to risks,
   such as: greater frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events,
   rising sea levels, among other climate threats. For semi-arid regions,
   the projections indicate that the climate will become more arid,
   aggravating drought and increasing desertification processes. The
   purpose of this paper is to understand how opinion makers and decision
   makers in the state of Rio Grande do Norte perceive the risks of climate
   change in the semiarid region. The research presents a qualitative
   approach, with a case study and data from bibliographic, documentary
   surveys and structured interviews conducted with representatives of
   public agencies and researchers. The results points that these actors
   perceived the risks of climate change, as an aggravation to climate
   threats with a history of occurrence in the state. The perceived threats
   are in agreement with the climate trends projected by the literature,
   thus indicating a high probability of occurrence in the study area.}},

   was observed that the socio-spacial prejudice is immanent to the

   attribution is addressed to the peripheric neighborhoods. From them it's
   kept a distance and an expanding control, but when encounters with their

Title = {{The effect of mercapto-functionalization of thermo-acid activated
   diatomite for dye removal from aqueous solutions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{For the adsorption of malachite green (MG), `purified by thermo-acid
   (HCl) diatomite' (D-TA) and its derivative
   `3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane functionalised diatomite' (DTA-MTMS)
   were prepared as adsorbent and the effects of thermo-acid activation and
   surface functional groups on adsorption were investigated. Many acids
   dissolve certain substances in diatomite and change their chemical
   composition. Thermo-acid treatment and silane-modified diatomite
   fractions were characterised byBrunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning
   electron microscope (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal analysis (TG-DTA).
   The effects of contact time, solution pH, temperature and initial dye
   concentration on adsorption were investigated. Equilibrium isotherms are
   defined using nonlinear Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin - Radushkevich (D
   - R) and Sips adsorption isotherm equations. Isotherm data for both
   adsorbents are best fitted on the Freundlich and Sips model. The q(max)
   values determined from the Sips model are 18.8415 mgg(-1) and 21.4713
   mgg(-1) for D-TA and DTA-MTMS, respectively. It was determined that
   DTA-MTMS performed better than D-TA for MG adsorption. The results
   showed that MG adsorption was compatible with the pseudo-second-order
   (PSO) kinetic model. From the adsorption energy value (E < 8 kJ
   mol(-1)), it was confirmed that physical adsorption was dominant in the
   adsorption process. The nature of the sorption process is exothermic and
   spontaneous (due to negative values Delta H degrees and Delta G
   degrees). The results of the study showed that prepared D-TA and
   synthesised DTA-MTMS can be considered as an economical and promising
   adsorbent in removing organic dyes from wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Few studies have focused to determine the peculiarities of
   the course of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes after treatment in women
   with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia.
   Objective: To determine the peculiarities of the course of pregnancy and
   pregnancy outcomes in women treated for idiopathic hyperprolactinemia,
   with history of infertility and/or recurrent pregnancy loss.
   Materials and Methods: A non-randomized controlled study was conducted
   at the Center for Reproductive Medicine ``Universe{''} and Medical
   Clinic ``Medhealth{''} during 2016-2018, involving 96 women with
   idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, aged 20-44 yr with infertility and/or a
   history of recurrent pregnancy loss. Prolactin (PRL),
   follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol (E2), free
   testosterone, and progesterone were studied in blood serum using
   immunoassay analysis method. Before the occurrence of pregnancy,
   hyperprolactinemia was treated with bromocriptine. Dydrogesterone was
   used to support the luteal phase.
   Results: PRL levels decreased significantly and normalized within
   two-five months, regular menstrual cycle was restored in two-four
   months, ovulation was restored in three-seven months, and pregnancy was
   achieved in three-fourteen months. E2 and progesterone levels increased
   significantly (p < 0.001). Prior to the treatment, significant negative
   correlation between PRL and E2 (r = -0.386, p = 0.007), PRL and
   progesterone (r = -0.420, p = 0.003) was detected. Threatened early
   abortion prevailed among pregnancy complications. Pregnancy loss in the
   first trimester was recorded in 3.12\% of cases.
   Conclusion: Pregnancy outcomes in women with idiopathic
   hyperprolactinemia are improved by prolonged and continuous treatment
   with bromocriptine before pregnancy and administration of dydrogesterone
   in support of the luteal insufficiency.}},

Title = {{The large Bakyrchik orogenic gold deposit, eastern Kazakhstan: Geology,
   mineralization, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope characteristics}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{127}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The large (>13 Moz Au, averaging 5-6 g/t Au) Bakyrchik Au deposit in
   eastern Kazakhstan is part of a district-scale mineralized zone,
   situated in an accretionary terrane. The deposit is localized within a
   shear zone in carbonaceous sedimentary rocks, which crosscuts the
   stratigraphy and comprises subconcordant dikes of high-K calc-alkaline
   (to shoshonitic?) rocks (lamprophyre to monzogabbro to monzodiorite).
   The tectonized/cataclased carbonaceous rocks contain numerous banded
   (bedded?) pyrite clasts and bands and abundant disseminated auriferous
   sulfides (pyrite and acicular arsenopyrite); the latter overprint
   pyritic clasts and occur proximal to (although mostly outside of) the
   concordant quartz veins and associated quartz-cemented hydrothermal
   breccias. Late granodiorite-plagiogranite dikes postdate auriferous
   sulfides and associated quartz veins/hydrothermal breccia but are
   overprinted by the late quartz veins containing free native gold and
   some Cu-Zn-Pb sulfides. This mineralization, however, is minor at the
   deposit.
   The most abundant stylolitic quartz veins accompanied by auriferous
   sulfide mineralization were formed from a homogenous and then boiling
   aqueous-carbonic fluid at temperatures of >315-300 to 265-240 degrees C
   and pressures of 0.8 to 1.2 kbar. Boiling was a dominant process during
   the formation of hydrothermal breccias accompanied by most intense
   auriferous sulfide (pyrite, arsenopyrite) mineralization at the
   temperatures of 250-230 degrees C and pressures of similar to 1.1 kbar.
   The late quartz veins were also formed from a homogenous and then
   boiling aqueous-carbonic fluid at temperatures of >350-315 to 235-225
   degrees C and pressures of 1.1 to 1.3 kbar. The stable isotope data
   support a variable - from sedimentary to magma-derived - source of
   sulfur (delta S-34 = -20 to similar to 0 parts per thousand), with a
   dominantly sedimentary to metamorphic source of carbon (delta C-13 =
   -27.4 to -22.5 parts per thousand).
   The deposit is polygenetic and exhibits combined
   synsedimentary-exhalative, metamorphic to intrusionrelated,
   magmatic-hydrothermal signatures, with strong structural control and
   close association with various dikes. Most of auriferous sulfide
   mineralization occurred after or nearly coeval to the intrusion of mafic
   to intermediate dikes, with a strong positive correlation of Au with As,
   S-sulf, Ag, Sb, and Hg. Homogenized delta S-34 values of auriferous
   pyrite and arsenopyrite (from -2.4 to -0.5 parts per thousand), close to
   the meteorite standard, indicate dominantly magma-derived sulfur. Late
   quartz veins with free native gold and minor Cu-Zn-Pb sulfides are more
   distinctly related to granodiorite-plagiogranite intrusions.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Diverse pastures based on combinations of the forage herb species
   plantain and chicory with red clover and white clover, provide superior
   annual feeding value to finish lambs in temperate regions, compared to
   the traditionally used perennial ryegrass and white clover pastures. The
   success of herb-clover diverse pastures is dependent on maintaining the
   relative abundance of each species in the mix over time. The selective
   grazing by lambs on herb-clover mixes was compared with their selection
   on perennial ryegrass and white clover pasture, by using randomly tagged
   individual plants, to determine if selective grazing changed the
   relative abundance of any of the herb or clover species. Variations in
   the selection of the forage species over the seasons of the year were
   observed, but best practice grazing management was shown to maintain the
   relative abundance of species in herb-clover pastures required for
   superior lamb live weight gains.
   Plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) are now
   widely used in combination with clover species to provide greater annual
   lamb live weight gains than perennial ryegrass and white clover pasture.
   Reported selective grazing of the species in herb-clover mixes could
   potentially detrimentally change the relative abundance of species and
   decrease lamb production. Lambs were offered three herbage treatments:
   Pasture (perennial ryegrass and white clover) mix, plantain (plantain,
   red clover and white clover) mix and a chicory (chicory, plantain, red
   clover and white clover) mix in each of four seasons for two years. The
   experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replicates
   with 18-30 lambs per treatment replicate depending on the season. Lambs
   were rotationally grazed and fed ad libitum. Selection by the lambs of
   individually tagged plants within the pasture treatments was observed
   for three days on two occasions per season. Red clover was the most
   selected species on day 1, but by day 3 there was no difference in the
   selection of the species (p < 0.05). Plantain and chicory in the
   plantain and chicory mixes were selected less on day 1 in autumn
   relative to the other seasons (p < 0.05). It was concluded that three
   days of grazing before moving lambs maintained the relative abundance of
   species in the herb-clover mixes.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this article, an inverse analysis for simultaneous estimation of
   temperature dependent thermal conductivity (k(T)) and specific heat
   capacity (C-p(T)) of isotropic solids is presented. The unknown thermal
   properties are assumed a parametric variation with temperature and these
   parameters are then estimated from the solution of inverse problem.
   Pseudo-experimental temperature data are used to study the robustness of
   the present inverse parameter estimation solution strategy. Due to lack
   of sensitivity and existence of correlation among the unknown
   parameters, the solution to inverse problem is carried out with
   Levenberg-Marquardt, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and hybrid GA and it is
   found that hybrid GA is more suitable for this parameter estimation
   problem. The proposed inverse approach is also extended to real-time
   experiments involving heating of mild steel (MS) and stainless steel
   (SS304) samples with concentrated solar thermal energy source. The
   estimated constant k and C-p for MS are found to be 52.6 W/m-K and
   507.24 J/kg-K respectively which are within 10\% deviation from the
   literature data. Similarly, the estimated k and C-p of SS304 at 360 K
   are found to be 16.75 W/m-K and 512.7 J/kg-K with an absolute deviation
   of 6\% and 4\% respectively from literature data.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the cerebral cortex is directed by a series of
   methodically precise events, including progenitor cell proliferation,
   neural differentiation, and cell positioning. Over the past decade, many
   studies have demonstrated the critical contributions of Notch signaling
   in neurogenesis, including that in the developing telencephalon.
   However, in vivo evidence for the role of Notch signaling in cortical
   development still remains limited partly due to the redundant functions
   of four mammalian Notch paralogues and embryonic lethality of the
   knockout mice. Here, we utilized the conditional deletion and in vivo
   gene manipulation of Rbpj, a transcription factor that mediates
   signaling by all four Notch receptors, to overcome these challenges and
   examined the specific roles of Rbpj in cortical development. We report
   severe structural abnormalities in the embryonic and postnatal cerebral
   cortex in Rbpj conditional knockout mice, which provide strong in vivo
   corroboration of previously reported functions of Notch signaling in
   neural development. Our results also provide evidence for a novel dual
   role of Rbpj in cell type-specific regulation of two key developmental
   events in the cerebral cortex: the maintenance of the undifferentiated
   state of neural progenitor cells, and the radial and tangential
   allocation of neurons, possibly through stage-dependent differential
   regulation of Ngn1.}},

Abstract = {{A successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter
   (ADC) with input offset calibration is proposed to reduce input offset
   mismatches between multiple ADCs. The proposed input offset calibration
   is performed by controlling the capacitors used for scaling the input
   range of the SAR ADC in the capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC)
   without the addition and modification of analog circuits. To verify the
   proposed input offset calibration, a 10-bit 10-MS/s SAR ADC with
   asynchronous architecture is implemented by using a 180-nm CMOS process
   with a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The power consumption and active area of
   the implemented SAR ADC are 2.29 mW and 0.207 mm(2), respectively. The
   control logic circuits added for the proposed input offset calibration
   occupy an area of 0.032 mm(2). The proposed input offset calibration of
   the SAR ADC reduces the input offset of ten LSBs to less than that of
   three LSBs. The measured DNL and INL are +0.60/-0.94 LSBs and
   +0.89/-0.93 LSBs, respectively. The ENOB is measured to 9.29 bits for
   the analog input signal with Nyquist frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies regarding the combustion characteristics of a pintle
   injector, which is one of techniques for throttling liquid rocket
   engines, have been conducted; however, the primary focus was on the
   performance instead of on the flame. To study the fundamental flame
   characteristics and provide a useful design guide for a pintle injector,
   gaseous methane and oxygen flames under the laminar condition were
   visualized by CH{*} chemiluminescence and Schlieren imaging techniques.
   The pintle injector used in this study had a fully opened annular
   injection area, and the combustion chamber was designed as a square
   cylinder with two windows to visualize the flames. The mass flow rates
   of methane and oxygen were controlled to change the injection condition,
   and the pintle opening distance was changed as a geometrical variation.
   The flame shapes could be classified globally into two types: a shear
   layer flame, located between two injected propellants and a tip-attached
   flame located near the pintle tip. The flame angles were measured from
   deconvoluted flame images, and measured angles were compared with spray
   angles from previous studies. In conclusion, the flame-anchoring
   locations and flame shapes were found to be critical for the injection
   momentum flow rate. Additionally, a new non-dimensional number, the
   pintle number, K-p, for the normalized angle is proposed, and the pintle
   number has a strong relation with the flame and spray angles. It is
   expected that the pintle number can be used to design a pintle injector.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe variability in and consequences of opioid
   prescriptions following pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy. Summary
   Background Data: Postoperative opioid prescribing patterns may
   contribute to persistent opioid use in both adults and children.
   Methods: We included children <18 years enrolled as dependents in the
   Military Health System Data Repository who underwent uncomplicated
   laparoscopic appendectomy (2006-2014). For the primary outcome of days
   of opioids prescribed, we evaluated associations with discharging
   service, standardized to the distribution of baseline covariates.
   Secondary outcomes included refill, Emergency Department (ED) visit for
   constipation, and ED visit for pain. Results: Among 6732 children, 68\%
   were prescribed opioids (range = 1-65 d, median = 4 d, IQR = 3-5 d).
   Patients discharged by general surgery services were prescribed 1.23
   (95\% CI = 1.06-1.42) excess days of opioids, compared with those
   discharged by pediatric surgery services. Risk of ED visit for
   constipation (n = 61, 1\%) was increased with opioid prescription {[}1-3
   d, risk ratio (RR) = 2.46, 95\% CI = 1.31-5.78; 4-6 d, RR = 1.89, 95\%
   CI = 0.83-4.67; 7-14 d, RR = 3.75, 95\% CI = 1.38-9.44; >14 d, RR =
   6.27, 95\% CI = 1.23-19.68], compared with no opioid prescription. There
   was similar or increased risk of ED visit for pain (n = 319, 5\%) with
   opioid prescription {[}1-3 d, RR = 1.00, 95\% confidence interval (CI) =
   0.74-1.32; 4-6 d, RR = 1.31, 95\% CI = 0.99-1.73; 7-14 d, RR = 1.52,
   95\% CI = 1.00-2.18], compared with no opioid prescription. Likewise,
   need for refill (n = 157, 3\%) was not associated with initial days of
   opioid prescribed (reference 1-3 d; 4-6 d, RR = 0.96, 95\% CI =
   0.68-1.35; 7-14 d, RR = 0.91, 95\% CI = 0.49-1.46; and >14 d, RR = 1.22,
   95\% CI = 0.59-2.07). Conclusions: There was substantial variation in
   opioid prescribing patterns. Opioid prescription duration increased risk
   of ED visits for constipation, but not for pain or refill.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, N-doped hierarchical porous carbon-based supercapacitor
   electrode materials have been synthesized by means of pyrolysis methods
   using corncob, KOH and urea as biomass sources, activator and nitrogen
   source, respectively. The influence of carbonization temperature on the
   morphology and structure and N doping content on supercapacitor
   performance of corncob derived porous carbons has been investigated
   systematically. The specific capacitance of sample with carbonization
   temperature at 800 degrees C and urea: corncob mass ratio of 4:3 reaches
   382.6 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and still maintains as high as 232.7 F/g at high
   current density of 20 A/g. The symmetric supercapacitor achieves a high
   energy density of 18.84 Wh/kg at power density of 149.36 W/kg in 6 M KOH
   aqueous electrolyte. It also shows excellent cycling stability with a
   95.16\% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The results
   demonstrate that these as-prepared corncob-derived activated carbons
   have a great prospect in low-cost and high-performance supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of a radially polarized
   beam (RPB) with a maximum average output power of 20 W by our
   self-developed nanosecond pulsed ytterbium (Yb)-doped fiber MOPA system.
   The method of spatial phase conversion was adopted for the system, and a
   liquid crystal polymer (LCP) vortex half-waveplate (LCP-WPV) was
   utilized to realize efficient conversion of the linearly polarized LP01
   mode to the radially polarized TM01 mode. A narrowlinewidth, linearly
   polarized fundamental mode with an average power of 20.5 W was produced
   in the multistage all-fiber MOPA system consisting of a continuous-wave
   (CW) single frequency fiber laser seed, an electro-optical intensity
   modulator, two-stage core-pumped amplifiers and three-stage
   cladding-pumped amplifiers. Afterwards, an RPB output with a 20 W
   maximum average output power, a 7.5 ns pulse width and a 10 kHz
   repetition rate was finally obtained after the LCP-WPV was adopted as
   the spatial mode converter. Then, the mode purity of the RPB was
   measured to be approximately 88.5 \% with the PBS (polarization beam
   splitter) method. This work provides a reference for the generation of
   cylindrical vector beam sources with the advantages of high efficiency
   and high mode purity.}},

Abstract = {{Biological CO conversion has attracted considerable interest because of
   the demand for syngas valorization and the simultaneous treatment of
   toxic components in industrial flue gases. The oxidation of CO can
   produce additional reducing equivalents in the form of electrons and
   protons by the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) via carbon monoxide
   dehydrogenase (CODH). Such reducing energy decreases the thermodynamic
   and kinetic barriers of the bioconversion of gaseous carbon and
   increases the product yield. This study examined the effects of yeast
   extract, leading to increased CODH activity, on electrosynthesis with CO
   in an electrode-assisted bioelectrochemical system. The specific CODH
   activity was significantly higher (90.2 +/- 2.6 nmol mg(-1) min(-1))
   when the yeast extract was added compared to electrosynthesis without
   the yeast extract (11.8 +/- 1.1 nmol mg(-1) min(-1)). After 483 h, the
   levels of acetate and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were 3.5 and 0.8 g
   L-1, respectively, when the CODH activity was higher, but only 1.3 and
   0.2 g L-1, respectively, in cultures with lower CODH activity. The
   maximum coulombic efficiency of electrosynthesis with CO was two times
   higher than the conventional electrosynthesis using CO2 with higher CODH
   activity, whereas it was only half with lower CODH activity. The results
   show that an increase in CODH activity can be an efficient approach to
   enhance the electrosynthesis of CO.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a perioperative
   prophylactic strategy against de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
   in pediatric liver transplantation (LT) recipients with hepatitis B core
   antibody (HBcAb)-positive grafts. A total of 482 pediatric recipients
   transplanted between 2013 and 2017 were enrolled, and 170 recipients
   received HBcAb-positive liver grafts. The overall graft and recipient
   survival rates in HBcAb-positive and HBcAb-negative graft recipients
   were 91.8\% versus 91.3\% and 95.3\% versus 94.2\% at the end of
   follow-up. Preoperative hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titer >=
   1000 IU/L and postoperative HBsAb titer >= 200 IU/L were our
   prophylactic targets for recipients receiving HBcAb-positive grafts.
   While 11 recipients developed de novo HBV infection, 10 received
   HBcAb-positive grafts. Both the preoperative and postoperative HBsAb
   targets were achieved in 78 recipients, the infection rate of de novo
   HBV was 1.3\%; 24 recipients met the preoperative target, the infection
   rate was 4.2\%; 52 recipients met the postoperative target, the
   infection rate was 1.9\%; and 16 recipients met neither the preoperative
   nor postoperative HBsAb target, 43.8\% of the recipients were infected
   with de novo HBV, which was significantly higher than the recipients who
   met both or either of the preoperative and postoperative targets.
   Split-liver grafts positive for HBcAb showed higher risk of de novo HBV
   infection. Postoperative application of lamivudine to recipients whose
   preoperative HBsAb titer < 1000 IU/L did not show preventive effect. Out
   of 11 infected recipients, 3 showed seroconversion under entecavir
   treatment. In conclusion, the graft and recipient survival rates were
   similar in pediatric LT recipients receiving HBcAb-positive or
   HBcAb-negative grafts. Our prophylactic strategy was effective for
   preventing de novo HBV infection in HBcAb-positive liver graft
   recipients.}},

   facilitating cardiac imaging is not known. Methods This prospective,
   randomized double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of 120
   patients, referred for adenosine stress or viability MPS studies were
   randomized 1:1 to receive either UDCA or placebo. Outcome was
   quantitative \& qualitative improvement in imaging for better

   participants (59 +/- 11.9 years; 84 men) underwent adenosine stress MPS
   or viability MPS. Sixty participants had UDCA while 58 had placebo
   intervention. The study showed significant decrease in liver counts with
   improved myocardial to liver ratio at 30 and 60 minutes in adenosine

Abstract = {{Contamination of soils with organic pollutants is an increasing global
   problem, so novel soil remediation techniques are urgently needed. One
   such technique is electrokinetic remediation, in which an electric field
   is applied over the soil to extract contaminants. Previous evaluations
   of the technique have been limited to a few specific compounds. In this
   study, we integrated the latest advances in high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (HRMS) to identify molecular fingerprints, and used the
   results to improve the mechanistic understanding necessary for
   successful remediation. A laboratory-scale 0.38 mA cm(-2)
   electrodialytic treatment was applied for 21 days to a contaminated soil
   from a firefighter training facility in Sweden. Non-target analysis
   allowed generic evaluation of changes in the soil organic fraction by
   tentatively determining the elemental composition of compounds present.
   The results showed that smaller oxygen-rich molecules were significantly
   transported to the anode by electromigration, while larger
   hydrogen-saturated molecules were transported to the cathode by
   electroosmotic flow. Wide suspect screening with >3000 per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) tentatively identified seven new
   PFASs in the test soil, including perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS),
   and PFASs with butoxy, ethoxy, ethanol, and ethylcyclohexanesulfonate
   functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{Across the middle Miocene, Earth's climate underwent a major cooling and
   expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. However, the associated response
   and development of the tropical climate system is not fully understood,
   in part because this is influenced by both global climate and also
   low-latitude tectonic gateways and paleoceanography. Here we use
   combined delta O-18 and Mg/Ca of planktic foraminifera to reconstruct
   the thermal history and changes in hydrology from the Indo-Pacific
   region from 16.5 to 11.5 Ma. During the warmth of the early middle
   Miocene, our records indicate a dynamic ocean-atmosphere system in the
   Indo-Pacific region, with episodes of saltier and warmer tropical
   surface waters associated with high pCO(2) and retreat of the Antarctic
   ice sheet. We show that across the Middle Miocene Climate Transition
   (MMCT) surface ocean temperatures in the Indo-Pacific cooled by similar
   to 2 degrees C, synchronous with the advance of the Antarctic ice sheet.
   The associated cooling in the Southern Ocean appears to have started
   earlier and was stronger. Further, we show that western Pacific Ocean
   warmed and eastern tropical Indian Ocean freshened following the MMCT,
   likely caused by the constriction of the Indonesian Seaway and reduced
   connectivity between the Pacific and Indian Oceans following Antarctic
   glaciation. The MMCT therefore represented a key phase in the evolution
   of the West Pacific Warm Pool and associated tropical climate dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of chitosan nano-emulsion (CSNe) concentrations on the
   properties of CSNe reinforced poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposites
   is the aim of this study. Polymer solution of CSNe with different
   concentrations combined with PVA having a low (PVAL) and high (PVAH)
   molecular weight (Mw), respectively, was fabricated to be the
   nanocomposite membranes by an electrospinning technique. The
   morphological characterization of the nanofiber formed in the membranes
   and the chemical group of PVA and chitosan analysis was performed by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fouriertransform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The tensile properties of all the
   membrane specimens were tested according to the ASTM D-882. The
   neat-PVAL and CSNe/PVAL nanocomposite membranes were subjected to the in
   Vivo test of the open incision on mice. The results showed that an
   increase of CSNe concentration decreased the viscosity of CSNe-PVA
   polymer solution but increased the electrical conductivity. Those
   conditions reduced the nanofiber diameter with various fiber structures.
   Membranes used PVAL yielded in higher tensile strength and lower tensile
   modulus than those used PVAH. In Vivo test results of the CSNe/PVAL
   membrane showed acceptable effectiveness in the wound care treatment to
   the Sofra-tulle commercial membrane containing antibiotics, and both
   were better than the neat-PVA membrane. Thus, the CSNe/PVAL provides a
   promising chance for an alternative wound cover membrane.}},

   accounting for material property variability using a layered beam finite
   element approach}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this contribution the influence of material properties variability on
   the structural robustness of Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames is assessed
   using a computational approach. A layered beam finite element model is
   employed in a correlation reduced Latin Hypercube Sampling-based
   stochastic framework in which the material parameters driving the
   elastic, plastic and fracture behavior of both steel and concrete
   constituents are considered to be Random Variables (RVs). The
   probability characteristics of each RV are set to match relevant
   experimental data available in the literature. Structural robustness of
   each deterministic simulation is evaluated based on the outcome of a
   nonlinear dynamic progressive collapse computation using the Sudden
   Column Loss (SCL) scenario. The sensitivity of structural robustness and
   residual displacement to each material parameter is established first,
   considering their variations separately. The robustness of a RC frame
   designed following the European building code, incorporating all RVs
   simultaneously is assessed and critically compared to the results of the
   sensitivity analysis. The link between the structural degradation and
   failure mechanism and data extracted from the cross sectional behavior
   is established. The identification of structural mechanisms inducing
   failure or survival is attempted and a set of practically relevant
   recommendations for progressive collapse resistance is listed.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of a laboratory experiment focused on the
   assessment of the effect of different methods of application of ammonium
   nitrate (TD-top dressing and DP-deep placement) on N2O and CO2 emissions
   from soil without crop cover. Nitrogen application increased soil N2O-N
   fluxes by 24.3-46.4\%, compared to untreated soil (NIL). N2O-N emissions
   from TD treatment were higher by 12.7\%, compared to DP treatment. Soil
   CO2-C fluxes from DP treatment were significantly higher by 17.2\%,
   compared to those from NIL treatment. Nonetheless, the differences
   between soil CO2-C fluxes from DP and TD treatments, as well as from TD
   and NIL treatments, were of no statistical significance. The cumulative
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (a sum of cumulative soil emissions of
   CO2-C and N2O-N after conversion to the equivalent of CO2-C) from both
   N-fertilized soils were similar, and higher by 20\% than from untreated
   soil. The obtained data show that the effect of reduction of N2O-N soil
   emissions gained by deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer was completely
   lost through an increase in CO2-C emissions from the soil. This suggests
   that deep placement of nitrogen fertilizers in sandy soil without crop
   cover might not lead to a mitigation of soil GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Given the current climate of immigration discourse and proposed changes
   to US immigration policies, it is critical to examine how immigration is
   presented to society's youngest readers. Because racial tension is
   embedded in immigration policies, children's picture books with
   anthropomorphic characters offer the possibility of learning about
   immigration as a phenomenon removed from master narratives. We focus on
   five picture books with anthropomorphic characters and explore the
   portrayal of immigrants and their stories. Using critical multicultural
   analysis, we unpack stereotypes, storylines, relationships between
   characters, messages about different lifestyles, creators' backgrounds
   and perspectives, and loaded words. Cultural character traits were used
   purposefully to unpack messages about acceptance or the lack thereof.
   The storylines emphasize the characters' traits, agency, and strategies
   of inclusion. Parallels can be drawn between the current immigration
   discourse and the books' storylines, making the books appropriate
   resources to address immigration topics in the elementary education
   classroom.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in never-smokers exposed to
   organic dusts is still poorly characterized. Therapeutic strategies in
   COPD are only evaluated in smoking-related COPD. Understanding how
   never-smokers with COPD behave during exercise is an important
   prerequisite for optimal management. The objective of this study was to
   compare physiological parameters measured during exercise between
   never-smokers with COPD exposed to organic dusts and patients with
   smoking-related COPD matched for age, sex, and severity of airway
   obstruction. Healthy control subjects were also studied. Dyspnea (Borg
   scale), exercise tolerance, and ventilatory constraints were assessed
   during incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing in COPD
   patients at mild to moderate stages {[}22 exposed to organic dusts:
   postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital
   capacity (FVC) z score -2.44 +/- 0.72 and FEV1 z score -1.45 +/- 0.78;
   22 with smoking-related COPD: FEV1/FVC z score -2.45 +/- 0.61 and FEV1 z
   score -1.43 +/- 0.69] and 44 healthy control subjects (including 22
   never-smokers). Despite the occurrence of similar significant dynamic
   hyperinflation, never-smoker COPD patients exposed to organic dusts had
   lower dyspnea ratings than those with smoking-related COPD. They also
   had better ventilatory efficiency, higher peak oxygen consumption and
   peak power output than smoking-related COPD patients, all these
   parameters being similar to control subjects. Differences in exercise
   capacity between the two COPD groups were mainly driven by better
   ventilatory efficiency stemming from preserved diffusion capacity.
   Never-smokers exposed to organic dusts with mild to moderate COPD have
   better exercise capacities, better ventilatory efficiency, and better
   diffusion capacity than matched patients with smoking-related COPD.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It is unknown whether or not neversmokers with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) behave like their smoking
   counterparts during exercise. This is the first study showing that
   never-smokers with mild to moderate COPD {[}defined by a
   postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital
   capacity (FVC) < lower limit of normal] have preserved exercise
   capacities. They also have lower exertional dyspnea than patients with
   smoking-related COPD. This suggests that the two COPD groups should not
   be managed in the same way.}},

Abstract = {{Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein naturally present in milk. Its
   content varies throughout lactation, but also with mastitis; therefore
   it is a potential additional indicator of udder health beyond somatic
   cell count. Condequently, there is an interest in quantifying this
   biomolecule routinely. First prediction equations proposed in the
   literature to predict the content in milk using milk mid-infrared
   spectrometry were built using partial least square regression (PLSR) due
   to the limited size of the data set. Thanks to a large data set, the
   current study aimed to test 4 different machine learning algorithms
   using a large data set comprising 6,619 records collected across
   different herds, breeds, and countries. The first algorithm was a PLSR,
   as used in past investigations. The second and third algorithms used
   partial least square (PLS) factors combined with a linear and polynomial
   support vector regression (PLS + SVR). The fourth algorithm also used
   PLS factors, but included in an artificial neural network with 1 hidden
   layer (PLS + ANN). The training and validation sets comprised 5,541 and
   836 records, respectively. Even if the calibration prediction
   performances were the best for PLS + polynomial SVR, their validation
   prediction performances were the worst. The 3 other algorithms had
   similar validation performances. Indeed, the validation root mean
   squared error (RMSE) ranged between 162.17 and 166.75 mg/L of milk.
   However, the lower standard deviation of cross-validation RMSE and the
   better normality of the residual distribution observed for PLS + ANN
   suggest that this modeling was more suitable to predict the LF content
   in milk from milk mid-infrared spectra (R(2)v = 0.60 and validation RMSE
   = 162.17 mg/L of milk). This PLS +ANN model was then applied to almost 6
   million spectral records. The predicted LF showed the expected
   relationships with milk yield, somatic cell score, somatic cell count,
   and stage of lactation. The model tended to underestimate high LF values
   (higher than 600 rng/L of milk). However, if the prediction threshold
   was set to 500 mg/L, 82\% of samples from the validation having a
   content of LF higher than 600 mg/L were detected. Future research should
   aim to increase the number of those extremely high LF records in the
   calibration set.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: While many intoxication cases are cured with medical
   treatment, antidote therapy and symptomatic treatment; some cases may
   need hemodialysis treatment or even invasive mechanical ventilation
   support. We aimed to examine the place of hemodialysis in three rare
   intoxication cases seen in our hospital.
   Case Reports: 43-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency
   service with metformin intoxication. The patient with type B lactic
   acidosis was treated with urgent hemodialysis After a session of
   hemodialysis, the clinical and laboratory data returned to normal.
   19-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency service with
   theophylline intoxication. The blood theophylline level was toxic. The
   patient with symptoms of intoxication (tachycardia, hypokalemia, severe
   nausea and vomiting, etc.) regressed after a session of hemodialysis.
   22-year-old mental retarded male patient was admitted to the emergency
   service with loss of consciousness. The patient with metabolic acidosis
   was taken to the intensive care unit with coma of unknown cause. 4
   sessions of hemodialysis was applied to the patient who developed acute
   renal failure. It was learned that the patient drank ethylene glycol
   (antifreeze).
   Result: All our patients could be discharged with full
   recovery.Hemodialysis treatment has an important place in the treatment
   of intoxication cases.}},

   The use of this information by professors and students of chemistry

   little explored in the world. This work presents patentometry in a
   theoretical context and its practical application, taking as an example
   the area of rare earth in Brazil. Analyses will be presented in this
   work, such as the development of technologies over time and study of the
   maturity of the sector in question; potential markets; the most
   significant technology developers in the field; technological sectors
   related to rare earth in Brazil; attractiveness of the Brazilian market;
   the evolution of priority sectors; technological specialization; patent

Pages = {{887-903}},

Abstract = {{In cattle, pre-implantation embryo development occurs within the
   confinement of the uterine lumen. Current understanding of the
   bi-lateral molecular interactions between embryo and endometrium that
   are required for a successful pregnancy is limited. We hypothesized that
   the nature and intensity of reciprocal embryo-endometrium interactions
   depend on the extent of their physical proximity. Bovine endometrial
   epithelial cells (bEECs) and morulae were co-cultured in juxtacrine
   (Contact+) or non-juxtacrine (Contact-) apposition. Co-culture with
   bEECs improved blastocyst rates on day 7.5, regardless of juxtaposition.
   Contact+ regulated transcription of 1797 endometrial genes vs only 230
   in the Contact- group compared to their control (no embryos)
   counterparts. A subset of 50 overlapping differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) defined embryo-induced effects on bEEC transcriptome irrespective
   of juxtaposition. Functional analysis revealed pathways associated with
   interferon signaling and prostanoid biosynthesis. A total of 175 genes
   displayed a graded expression level depending on Contact+ or Contact-.
   These genes were involved in interferon-related and antigen presentation
   pathways. Biological processes enriched exclusively in Contact+ included
   regulation of cell cycle and sex-steroid biosynthesis. We speculate
   that, in vivo, embryonic signals fine-tune the function of surrounding
   cells to ultimately maximize pregnancy success.}},

Title = {{Monitoring of ammonia in marine waters using a passive sampler with
   biofouling resistance and neural network-based calibration}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A biofouling resistant passive sampler for ammonia, where the
   semi-permeable barrier is a microporous hydrophobic gas-diffusion
   membrane, has been developed for the first time and successfully applied
   to determine the time-weighted average concentration of ammonia in
   estuarine and coastal waters for 7 days. Strategies to control
   biofouling of the membrane were investigated by covering it with either
   a copper mesh or a silver nanoparticle functionalised cotton mesh, with
   the former approach showing better performance. The effects of
   temperature, pH and salinity on the accumulation of ammonia in the newly
   developed passive sampler were studied and the first two parameters were
   found to influence it significantly. A universal calibration model for
   the passive sampler was developed using the Group Method Data Handling
   algorithm based on seawater samples spiked with known concentrations of
   total ammonia under conditions ranging from 10 to 30 degrees C, pH 7.8
   to 8.2 and salinity 20 to 35. The newly developed passive sampler is
   affordable, user-friendly, reusable, sensitive, and can be used to
   detect concentrations lower than the recently proposed guideline value
   of 160 mg total NH3-N L-1, for a 99\% species protection level, with the
   lowest concentration measured at 17 nM molecular NH3 (i.e., 8 mg total
   NH3-N L-1 at pH 8.0 and 20 degrees C). It was deployed at four field
   sites in the coastal waters of Nerm (Port Phillip Bay), Victoria,
   Australia. Good agreement was found between molecular ammonia
   concentrations obtained with passive and discrete grab sampling methods
   (relative difference, 12\% to 19\%). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   (2007-2017) constrained by InSAR measurements: Evidence for shallow
   magma reservoir and lava field subsidence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{407}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Barren Island, situated in the Andaman Sea, is the northernmost active
   volcano of the Sunda arc. The oldest known eruption of the volcano was
   during the period 1787-1832. After about 150 years of quiescence,
   volcanic activity resumed in 1991 and continues since then. The magmatic
   plumbing system of this volcano is largely unknown due to lack of
   geophysical experiments owing to its remote location. We report, for the
   first-time, time series surface deformation measurements of Barren
   Island volcano from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
   during epochs 2007-2011 and 2015-2017. Line-of-Sight (LOS) deformation
   of -50 mm/yr during 2007-2011 at the cinder cone is interpreted as the
   co-eruptive pressure changes associated with the 2008-2010 eruptions.
   Bayesian inversion suggests a shallow magma reservoir at a depth of
   578-100 +300 m below the summit. The depth of the magma reservoir is
   shallower than that of other volcanoes of the Sunda arc, probably due to
   the extensional stress regime imposed by the oblique subduction. Based
   on the present studies and previous works, we propose a plausible source
   model for Barren Island volcano. We also discuss potential biases in the
   present source parameter estimation due to the lack of high quality
   InSAR data from both ascending and descending directions. Significant
   deformation (-15 to -150 mm/yr) observed along the lava delta of Barren
   Island volcano for both the epochs are interpreted as post-emplacement
   subsidence of the lava flow. Further, we characterise the lava flow
   including volcanic deposits by mapping its spatial extent and elevation
   changes during 1979-2000 and 2000-2017 periods using geodetic
   measurements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   India}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-57}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to develop an institutional framework to examine the
   role of governmental and social pressures on green product purchase
   intentions. Because of the increased focus on environmental issues in
   emerging markets, an examination of the institutional environment in
   India can provide unique insights into the drivers of green consumption.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A large-scale data collection is conducted via an online survey to test
   the validity of the theorized model. A survey methodology is used to
   collect responses from a sample of 400 consumers in India and analyzed
   via Smart PLS 3.0.
   Findings
   The findings suggest moral norms, injunctive and descriptive, have
   varying influences on consumers. Further, governmental influence, at
   least in India, may not have a positive impact one would expect. The
   results indicate the institutional framework developed in this research
   has a good predictive ability in green marketing settings and offers
   insights for businesses and policymakers to enhance consumers'
   motivations to purchase green products.
   Originality/value
   From a theoretical perspective, this research is the first to examine
   the institutional environment on green consumption in India and provides
   unique insights into the influences of green consumption. The results
   suggest the institutional environment in India presents unique
   opportunities for practitioners and policymakers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel image contrast enhancement technique that
   uses exposure-based energy curve equalization (ECE) with a plateau
   limit. In a primary deviation from the current histogram equalization
   process for contrast enhancement, the proposed approach uses an energy
   curve for the same. The energy curve is computed based on the modified
   Hopfield neural network architecture, which contains spatial context
   information. The calculated energy curve is clipped with a plateau limit
   computed as the average of the energy curve. The exposure threshold is
   computed and used to divide the clipped energy curve. The two resulting
   energy curves are equalized independently, and the final enhanced image
   is generated by integrating the images achieved by transforming the
   equalized energy curves. The performance of the proposed method is
   evaluated on a variety of low contrast images. The subjective and
   objective evaluations of the proposed method are compared with the
   various histogram equalization (HE) based methods and other
   state-of-the-art methods to exemplify the effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Genome-scale reconstruction of Gcn4/ATF4 networks driving a growth
   program}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   Cell growth needs a ready supply of chemical building blocks
   (resources), which requires careful management. These resources provide
   energy, and help synthesize proteins through the process of translation.
   Some metabolites, such as methionine, push cells to grow even if
   resources are limited. How cells manage or obtain resources in these
   conditions is not well known. However, cells must activate `master
   regulators', such as some transcription factors, to orchestrate programs
   to manufacture these building blocks. Here, using yeast cells as a
   model, we show how one such master regulator, the Gcn4/ATF4
   transcription factor, can drive a growth program when activated by
   methionine. Although Gcn4 is well studied for its role in managing
   starvation, we find that it can perform similar functions when triggered
   by methionine, but in this case push cells to grow rapidly. It helps
   cells to produce a steady supply of amino acids (which are important
   building blocks), and simultaneously `manage' the high rates of protein
   translation that are required in order to grow rapidly. This study
   highlights basic concepts of how cell growth is managed, and may be
   important for understanding similar observations from several cancers.
   Growth and starvation are considered opposite ends of a spectrum. To
   sustain growth, cells use coordinated gene expression programs and
   manage biomolecule supply in order to match the demands of metabolism
   and translation. Global growth programs complement increased ribosomal
   biogenesis with sufficient carbon metabolism, amino acid and nucleotide
   biosynthesis. How these resources are collectively managed is a
   fundamental question. The role of the Gcn4/ATF4 transcription factor has
   been best studied in contexts where cells encounter amino acid
   starvation. However, high Gcn4 activity has been observed in contexts of
   rapid cell proliferation, and the roles of Gcn4 in such growth contexts
   are unclear. Here, using a methionine-induced growth program in yeast,
   we show that Gcn4/ATF4 is the fulcrum that maintains metabolic supply in
   order to sustain translation outputs. By integrating matched
   transcriptome and ChIP-Seq analysis, we decipher genome-wide direct and
   indirect roles for Gcn4 in this growth program. Genes that enable
   metabolic precursor biosynthesis indispensably require Gcn4;
   contrastingly ribosomal genes are partly repressed by Gcn4. Gcn4
   directly binds promoter-regions and transcribes a subset of metabolic
   genes, particularly driving lysine and arginine biosynthesis. Gcn4 also
   globally represses lysine and arginine enriched transcripts, which
   include genes encoding the translation machinery. The Gcn4 dependent
   lysine and arginine supply thereby maintains the synthesis of the
   translation machinery. This is required to maintain translation
   capacity. Gcn4 consequently enables metabolic-precursor supply to
   bolster protein synthesis, and drive a growth program. Thus, we
   illustrate how growth and starvation outcomes are both controlled using
   the same Gcn4 transcriptional outputs that function in distinct
   contexts.}},

Journal = {{CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{733-738}},

Abstract = {{Background
   It remains unclear whether cardiovascular risk factors and access to
   healthcare for veterans with cardiovascular disease (CVD) vary among US
   regions. This study sought to determine the extent of regional
   variations in cardiovascular risk factors and access to medical care in
   a cohort of veterans with CVD in the USA.
   Methods
   The 2016 Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   Survey was utilized to identify a cohort of veteran patients with CVD.
   Participants were classified based on four US regions: (1) Northeast,
   (2) Midwest, (3) South, and (4) West. We compared demographic data,
   medical history, and access to care for veterans of each US region. The
   outcomes of interest included financial barriers to medical care and
   annual medical checkup.
   Results
   Among the 13 835 veterans, 18.3\% were from the Northeast, while 23.5,
   37.1, and 21.1\% were from the Midwest, South, and West, respectively.
   Veterans of each region differed significantly with respect to
   demographic characteristics, prior medical history, and access to care.
   Rates of financial barriers to medical care were similar across the four
   regions (7.3 vs. 7.1 vs. 8.0 vs. 6.9\%, P = 0.203). Veterans from the
   West had the lowest rates of medical checkup within the past year (91.7
   vs. 89.5 vs. 91.4 vs. 86.6\%). On multivariate analysis, the Midwest
   {[}odds ratio (OR) 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.89] and West (OR 0.53; 95\% CI
   0.41-0.68) regions were independently associated with lower rates of
   medical checkup within the past year compared to the Northeast.
   Conclusions
   In this observational study involving US veterans with CVD,
   cardiovascular risk factors and frequency of annual medical checkup
   differed amongst each US region. Further large-scale studies examining
   the prevalence of impaired access to care and quality of care in US
   veterans with CVD are warranted.}},

Title = {{Economic scheduling of a smart microgrid utilizing the benefits of
   plug-in electric vehicles contracts with a comprehensive model of
   information-gap decision theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid optimization approach is proposed to smart
   microgrid (SMG) operators to schedule the existing energy resources
   optimally to meet the load demand of the system. The proposed hybrid
   optimization is structured based on information-gap decision theory
   (IGDT) and two-stage stochastic programming to minimize the operational
   cost of the system in day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) power markets.
   The uncertainty of the day-ahead market price is tackled with the IGDT.
   The IGDT is furnished with robustness and opportunity functions leading
   to various risk-averse and risk-taker decision-making strategies. The
   problem is structured as bi-level programming, while by implementing the
   concept of envelop bounds, it is transferred into a single-level
   optimization problem. On the other hand, the uncertainties of the
   operation of the real-time market are modeled using scenarios with
   stochastic programming. The studied SMG is equipped with a photovoltaic
   system, a wind turbine, two microturbines (MTs), and battery storage.
   The results determine the scheduling of day-ahead exchange power and
   scheduled PEV contracts as here-and-now decisions of the optimization.
   However, the traded energy in the real-time market, MTs' dispatch, and
   the charging/discharging plan of battery storage are wait-and-see
   decisions made by the second stage of the programming. The results are
   obtained and discussed from the perspective of risk-neutral,
   risk-averse, and risk-taker decision-makers. As an example of
   performance, when the uncertainty horizon is increased by 10\% in the
   robustness mode, the operation cost is increased by about 27.5\%. In
   comparison, the same amount of increment of uncertainty horizon leads to
   cost-saving about 33.3\% addressing the positive aspect of uncertainty
   using opportunity function.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Ulcerative colitis {[}UC] is associated with
   excessive neutrophil infiltration and collateral tissue damage, but the
   link is not yet completely understood. Since c-MET receptor tyrosine
   kinase {[}MET] is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and
   cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor {[}HGF],
   we aimed to identify the function of HGF-MET signalling in neutrophils
   in UC patients and in mice during intestinal inflammation.
   Methods: Serum and colonic biopsies from healthy controls and UC
   patients with active {[}Mayo endoscopic subscore 2-3] and inactive
   {[}Mayo endoscopic subscore 0-1] disease were collected to assess the
   level of serum and colonic HGF. Disease progression and immune cell
   infiltration were assessed during dextran sodium sulphate {[}DSS]
   colitis in wild-type and MRP8-Cre MET-LoxP mice.
   Results: Increased mucosal HGF expression was detected in patients with
   active UC, and in mice during the inflammatory phase of DSS colitis.
   Similarly, serum HGF was significantly increased in active UC patients
   and positively correlated with C-reactive protein and blood neutrophil
   counts. Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated an upregulation of
   colonic MET+ neutrophils during DSS colitis. Genetic ablation of MET in
   neutrophils reduced the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Concomitantly,
   there was a decreased number of T(H)17 cells, which could be due to a
   decreased production of IL-1 beta by MET-deficient neutrophils.
   Conclusions: These data highlight the central role of neutrophilic
   HGF-MET signalling in exacerbating damage during intestinal
   inflammation. Hence, selective blockade of this pathway in neutrophils
   could be considered as a novel therapeutic approach in UC.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of a brief meditation workshop on a
   sample of 223 novice meditators. Participants attended a three-day
   workshop comprising daily guided seated meditation sessions using music
   without vocals that focused on various emotional states and intentions
   (open focus). Based on the theory of integrative consciousness, it was
   hypothesized that altered states of consciousness would be experienced
   by participants during the meditation intervention as assessed using
   electroencephalogram (EEG). Brainwave power bands patterns were measured
   throughout the meditation training workshop, producing a total of 5616
   EEG scans. Changes in conscious states were analysed using
   pre-meditation and post-meditation session measures of delta through to
   gamma oscillations. Results suggested the meditation intervention had
   large varying effects on EEG spectra (up to 50 \% increase and 24 \%
   decrease), and the speed of change from pre-meditation to
   post-meditation state of the EEG co-spectra was significant (with 0.76
   probability of entering end-meditation state within the first minute).
   There was a main 5 \% decrease in delta power (95 \% HDI = {[}-0.07,
   -0.03]); a global increase in theta power of 29 \% (95 \% HDI = {[}0.27,
   0.33]); a global increase of 16 \% (95 \% HDI = {[}0.13, 0.19]) in alpha
   power; a main effect of condition, with global beta power increasing by
   17 \% (95 \% HDI = {[}0.15, 0.19]); and an 11 \% increase (95 \% HDI =
   {[}0.08, 0.14]) in gamma power from pre-meditation to end-meditation.
   Findings provided preliminary support for brief meditation in altering
   states of consciousness in novice meditators. Future clinical
   examination of meditation was recommended as an intervention for mental
   health conditions particularly associated with hippocampal impairments.}},

Title = {{The crucial role of catalysts in the reaction of low temperature
   decomposition of hydrogen sulfide: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the
   irreversible process in an open system}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{497}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The reaction mechanisms of low-temperature H2S decomposition on sulfide
   and metal catalysts are considered in the framework of thermodynamics of
   non-equilibrium irreversible biological processes for open systems,
   since these reactions occur at room temperature without supplying
   thermal energy from the outside owing to the internal energy of
   substrate molecules - hydrogen sulfide. On sulfide catalysts the
   irreversible process of H2S decomposition proceeds through the stage of
   formation of hydrogen disulfide (disulfane), H2S2, as a key
   inter-mediate, and the reaction products are hydrogen and solid sulfur.
   The reaction occurs through a sequence of consecutive exothermic stages
   of dissociation of H2S molecules, in which the entropy of the system is
   reduced due to its dissipation into environment as the bound (waste)
   energy T Delta S. The remaining part of the free energy Delta G is
   accumulated on the catalyst surface and is used for the implementation
   of the energy-intensive step of decomposition of the adsorbed
   intermediate. Similarly, the metal catalyst provides capture and
   accumulation of energy from the exothermic processes of adsorption and
   dissociation of the initial H2S molecules in the atomic adsorbed species
   of hydrogen and sulfur. The stored energy is used for chemical
   conversion of adsorbed intermediates into the final reaction products -
   molecular hydrogen and diatomic triplet sulfur, followed by it does
   desorption into the gas phase. When H2S is decomposed on metal catalysts
   at room temperature, along with hydrogen, previously unknown diatomic
   gaseous sulfur in the ground triplet state is obtained, the existence of
   which is predicted by quantum chemistry. Some properties of the triplet
   sulfur and the white globular hexagonal sulfur obtained from its
   saturated aqueous solutions (which is also a previously unknown
   allotrope of solid sulfur) are considered. Similarity of the morphology
   of hydrophilic white sulfur globules and bacterial colorless sulfur S-0
   obtained by sulfur bacteria in the processes of chemosynthesis of
   organic matter from CO2 and H2S, allowed to develop an alternative
   hypothesis about the nature of bacterial sulfur S-0 and possible
   mechanism of chemosynthesis of carbohydrates with the participation of
   sulfur bacteria. Apparently, the low-temperature catalytic decomposition
   of hydrogen sulfide is the first example in heterogeneous catalysis,
   when the principles of non-equilibrium biological thermodynamics in open
   systems are used to justify the possibility implementing a heterogeneous
   catalytic reaction.}},

Abstract = {{A new optimization method for the assessment of the coefficients

   multistep method of solving nonlinear ordinary differential equations is
   used. The inverse problem of model parameter estimation is solved by the
   Rosenbrock optimization method. The methodology is illustrated by the
   example of the ultrasound-assisted convective drying of apple and
   carrot. A high level of agreement between the results obtained
   experimentally and numerically was found. The obtained results confirmed
   the great influence of ultrasound on the drying kinetics. It was found
   that ultrasound application improved the mass transfer by 20-80\% and
   heat transfer by 30-90\%. It was also found that the heating effect
   caused by the ultrasound's absorption was very small, with a value below

Abstract = {{Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are becoming an attractive area of
   application for small hydropower, which can contribute to the
   development of distributed energy generation from renewable sources.
   Indeed, WDNs experience considerable water leakages due to their age and
   water management authorities often divide the WDNs by inserting Pressure
   Reducing Valves (PRVs), which waste a potentially recoverable hydraulic
   head. The replacement of PRVs with Pump as Turbines (PaTs) can be
   considered as an economically feasible solution to achieve both an
   effective pressure control and a throttling energy recovery. The
   selection, installation and control strategy of a PaT in a WDN must
   consider the variability of the pressure and the flow rate demand.
   Starting from the evaluation of the available head and the water demand,
   in this work, we describe a methodology to select from pump catalogues
   the most suitable PaT and the best control criteria for a specific WDN.
   Then, knowing the pump geometry, it is possible to predict the
   characteristic curve of the pump operating as a turbine by using a 1-D
   performance prediction model. The WDN of a town in the Apulia region
   (Southern Italy) has been used as a case study. Finally, a
   techno-economic evaluation has been carried out by considering both
   economic and environmental benefits. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: The use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in immediate breast
   reconstruction (IBR) continues to rise despite ongoing concerns with
   respect to increased complication rates. While the indications for
   radiation continue to broaden, it is essential to critically evaluate
   ADM's performance in its context. The purpose of this study was to
   review complication rates between patients reconstructed with and
   without ADM, who underwent IBR and radiation.
   Methods: A retrospective review was performed for patients undergoing
   IBR and radiation from 2010 to 2019. Postoperative outcomes were
   compared between patients with and without ADM. Results: Over a 9-year
   period, 130 patients underwent IBR and radiation (42\% preoperatively
   and 59\% postoperatively). For patients with preoperative radiation (36
   ADM and 18 non-ADM), the average follow-up was 312 and 296 days,
   respectively. In this group, there was no difference in minor
   complications (25\% ADM, 22\% non-ADM, and p = 1.00) or major
   complications (31\% ADM, 22\% Non-ADM, and p = 0.52). For patients with
   postoperative radiation (53 ADM and 23 non-ADM), the average follow-up
   was 544 and 748 days, respectively. There was no difference in minor
   complications (21\% ADM, 26\% non-ADM, and p = 0.11) or major
   complications (21\% ADM, 26\% non-ADM, and p = 0.61). Multivariable
   logistic regression analyses showed no difference between ADM and
   non-ADM groups (OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.22-3.08, and p = 0.78).
   Conclusion: Despite increasing literature supporting the use of ADM in
   breast reconstruction, postoperative outcomes following radiation remain
   poorly understood. In the present study, we report no difference in
   overall complication rates between breasts reconstructed with and
   without ADM in an irradiated field. Nevertheless, the complication rate
   remains high, and future studies will be required to determine whether
   ADM-associated complications in an irradiated field outweigh the
   purported benefits. (C) 2020 British Association of Plastic,

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) were synthesized at various
   temperatures ranging from 650 to 950 degrees C, at 100 degrees C
   intervals, by chemical vapor deposition technique (CVD). The synthesized
   N-CNTs were employed as modifiers of glassy carbon paste electrodes
   (GCPE), which were further used as electrochemical sensors for the
   determination of dopamine (DA) and epinephrine (EP), two important
   catecholamines that display biological roles as neurotransmitters and
   hormones. The results revealed that electrodes modified with the N-CNTs
   synthesized at 650 degrees C (GCPE/N-CNT650) and 950 degrees C
   (GCPE/N-CNT950) presented better electrocatalytic activities and sensing
   capabilities than the others (GCPE/N-CNT750 and GCPE/N-CNT850). N-CNT950
   had the highest graphitization and the highest powder conductivity,
   whereas N-CNT650 had the lowest graphitization and the lowest powder
   conductivity. However, both N-CNT950 and N-CNT650 had the highest
   nitrogen contents, 3.5 and 3.8 at.\%, respectively, which probably
   enhanced their number of electroactive sites to interact with DA and EP
   molecules. This result is of high significance, because the use of the
   lowest temperature (650 degrees C) in the CVD process, yielded N-CNTs
   with improved electrocatalytic activity and less energy consumption

Abstract = {{This article seeks to identify the phonetic correspondence( s) of the
   digraph < cg > in Old English (OE) and Middle English (ME), assessing a
   range of sources: the etyma in early Germanic (Gmc) languages, the
   various spellings in OE and the spelling evidence in the Linguistic
   Atlas of Early Middle English. Almost all the textbooks on OE claim that
   < cg > was pronounced / d3/, i.e. as a phonemic affricate, in OE.
   Evidence is thin on the ground, and the argument rests on certain back
   spellings < cg > for words with etymological < d+g >, e.g. midgern <
   micgern >. Words with < cg > in OE go back to Gmc {*}g(g)j, which
   subsequently underwent palatalisation, and eventually assibilation and
   affrication. This article argues that the value {[}+j] is more likely
   for OE and early ME, and that such an interpretation agrees with the
   available spelling evidence for both OE and ME, in that there is not one
   < d >- type spelling in the entire historical corpus until late ME. It
   is also argued that the development of the voiced ( pre-)affricate was
   later than that of its voiceless counterpart, as voiced fricative
   phonemes are a late, and infrequent, development in Gmc. Moreover, it is
   likely that the development of /d3/ was affected by the high number of
   French loans with /d3/ which entered the English lexicon after 1066.
   Thus, the English system of consonant phonemes may not have acquired
   /d3/ until the thirteenth century at the earliest.}},

Abstract = {{In May 2019, the city of Akron in the state of Ohio was admitted into
   AARP's network of age friendly cities and communities. Akron has a long
   history of aging services initiative that date back to the 1970s. To
   provide direction for future aging initiatives, an assessment of Akron's
   current state was conducted in early 2020. A survey designed to capture
   information on the eight Age-friendly domains was designed and mailed to
   3000 randomized individuals in Akron's ten political wards. A total of
   656 individuals responded and returned the survey. Akron is rated good
   to excellent by older Akronites; people want to stay in their
   neighborhood and in their home. Most Akronites like and use their
   neighborhood parks, find their streets well-lit, and feel safe walking
   in their neighborhood. Most respondents rated transportation in Akron as
   good to very good, but they found sidewalks good to poor. There is a
   high level of access to social and educational activities and a
   substantial opportunity to include more people. About two-thirds of
   respondents participate in faith-based activities, volunteer, and
   participate in city-sponsored events. Loneliness is not or rarely a
   problem for three quarters of respondents. Around 56.5\% of respondents
   indicated they disagree they are disconnected from the community. There
   is high level of access to the Internet and public WiFi in Akron and a
   substantial opportunity to include more people. Overall, Akron has
   benefitted from its historical efforts and has the opportunity to impact
   on more older adults as the older population grows.}},

Title = {{Child-Related Bliss and Couples' Partnership Satisfaction in the Early

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{1046-1057}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research investigates the impact of parents' feelings of
   fulfillment and joy aroused by their infant and parenthood-referred to
   as child-related bliss-on their partnership satisfaction in the early
   period of parenthood between 6 and 24 months postpartum. In addition,
   the influence of partnership satisfaction during pregnancy and after
   childbirth on child-related bliss is investigated. Guided by family
   systems theory, we assumed both parents' child-related bliss to be
   positively associated with individual (i.e.. spillover effects) as well
   as the spouse's partnership satisfaction (i.e., crossover effects).
   Longitudinal dyadic data from N = 135 heterosexual couples were analyzed
   using the actor-partner interdependence model, which takes
   interdependencies between couples into account. Taken as a set. the
   findings suggest that fathers' child-related and partnership-related
   perceptions are more closely linked than is the case for mothers.
   Fathers' child-related bliss 6 months postpartum positively influenced
   their partnership satisfaction at that time, and at 12 and 24 months
   postpartum. For mothers, in contrast, such spillover effects were not
   detected. Most importantly with respect to interdependencies between
   couples, the results indicate crossover effects from fathers to mothers,
   that is. fathers' child-related bliss positively contributed to mothers'
   partnership satisfaction in the postnatal period. In contrast, mothers'
   bliss did not influence fathers' partnership satisfaction. The study
   demonstrates that fathers' parental feelings of fulfillment and bliss
   contribute to their individual and to mothers' partnership satisfaction.
   This highlights gender-specific couple dynamics, that is, an influence
   of fathers' blissful child-related feelings on mothers' partnership
   satisfaction in the postnatal period.}},

Title = {{Polarization under rising inequality and economic decline}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Social and political polarization is an important source of conflict in
   many societies. Understanding its causes has become a priority of
   scholars across disciplines. We demonstrate that shifts in socialization
   strategies analogous to political polarization can arise as a locally
   beneficial response to both rising wealth inequality and economic
   decline. In many contexts, interaction with diverse out-groups confers
   benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise
   from interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when
   the economic environment favors risk aversion, a strategy of seeking
   lower-risk in-group interactions can be important to maintaining
   individual solvency. Our model shows that under conditions of economic
   decline or increasing inequality, some members of the population benefit
   from adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we
   show that such in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole
   population and persist even when the conditions that produced it have
   reversed.}},

Abstract = {{In 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   caused a global pandemic. Disease diagnosis, appropriate clinical
   management and infection control are all important factors in
   controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The QIAreach (TM) Anti-SARS-CoV-2
   Total Test (Anti-CoV2) is a rapid, qualitative serological test, using
   proprietary nanoparticle fluorescence technology to detect total
   antibody (IgA, IgM, and IgG) against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the
   results of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical agreement
   study. Thirty positive plasma or serum samples were taken from
   consenting individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed
   SARS-CoV-2 infection >= 14 days from symptom onset. Seventy-five samples
   from before the believed circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (November 1, 2019)
   were used to assess specificity. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and
   negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated along with the
   corresponding exact two-sided 95 \% confidence intervals (CI) using an
   FDA Emergency Use Authorized PCR test as the reference method. Anti-CoV2
   was shown to have 100 \% sensitivity (PPA; 95 \% CI 88.4-100 \%) and 100
   \% specificity (NPA; 95 \% CI 95.2-100 \%). Against 157 pre-pandemic
   samples, no cross-reactivity was observed with seasonal coronaviruses or
   other respiratory pathogens tested. Additionally, no interference was
   observed when samples were spiked with: conjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml;
   unconjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml; hemoglobin 5 mg/ml; prednisolone 0.12
   mg/ml; triglycerides 15 mg/ml. In conclusion, Anti-CoV2 provides
   accurate qualitative detection of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.}},

Abstract = {{This essay reexamines the network centered on the Boston Congregational
   minister and theologian Cotton Mather, the great Pietist theologian
   August Hermann Francke, several of the latter's associates in Halle and
   London, and Halle-sponsored Lutheran missionaries in the Danish colony
   of Tranquebar. It pursues the question what this network (which existed
   from circa 1710 into the I730s) reveals about how the idea of a
   ``Protestant religion{''} evolved as a theological construct and how
   ``Protestantism{''} as a category of religious identity came to have
   meaning and resonance across denominational and linguistic divides.
   Through the Boston-Halle-Tranquebar exchange, the essay argues,
   ``awakened souls{''} from Anglo-American Reformed and German Lutheran
   churches converged toward a conservative but dogmatically minimalistic
   understanding of the Christian religion that combined an intensely
   Christocentric, biblicist, and experiential piety with an
   activist-missionary and eschatological orientation-a package which was
   now equated with being truly ``Protestant{''} or ``protestantisch,{''}
   respectively. This reflects how the historical development of
   ``Protestantism{''} intersected with larger philosophical and
   theological debates about ``religion{''} and the different
   ``religions{''} of humanity that involved Enlightenment thinkers as much
   as awakened Christians. The distinct version of ``the Protestant
   religion{''} that first developed among the correspondents of this
   network would continue to evolve through the transatlantic awakenings of
   the eighteenth century and remain influential into the nineteenth
   century.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Studies describing the performance characteristics of the
   cobas (R) 6800 system for SARS-CoV-2 detection in deep respiratory
   specimens and freeze-thaw stability are limited. The current study
   compares the clinical performance of the automated SARS-CoV-2 assay on
   the cobas (R) 6800 system to a lab-developed assay (LDA) and the cobas
   impact of freeze-thawing combined with lysis buffer.
   Methods: Both retrospective and prospectively selected deep respiratory
   samples and oroand nasopharyngeal samples in either E-swab (R) or
   GLYwere tested using the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas (R) 6800 System
   and compared to a lab developed assay. Additonally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA
   stability was assessed after one freeze-thaw cycle with or without lysis
   buffer.
   Results: In total, 221 (58.3 \%) oroand nasopharyngeal swabs, 131 (34.6
   \%) deep respiratory specimens, and n = 25 (6.6 \%) swabs of unknown
   origin were included to study clinical performance. Only 4 samples gave
   discrepant results, all being positive in the LDA and not the cobas (R)
   6800 system. For stability testing, 66 samples without and 110 with
   lysis buffer were included. No clinically significant difference was
   found in test results after one freeze-thaw cycle and addition of lysis
   buffer.
   Conclusion: Based on our findings, the cobas (R) 6800 SARS-CoV-2 RNA
   assay yielded similar results as the LDA in oro-/nasopharyngeal swabs
   and deep respiratory specimens. Moreover, the cobas (R) 6800 SARS-CoV-2
   RNA assay yielded similar results before and after a freeze-thaw cycle,
   with better preservation of low viral loads in lysis buffer.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emerging research has proposed a growing reliance on visual
   processing during motor performance in individuals following anterior
   cruciate ligament reconstruction. Reconstructed individuals display
   increased activation of visual processing areas during task execution
   and exhibit dramatic performance decrements when vision is completely
   removed, however the effect of visual information manipulation on
   performance remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine
   how manipulation of visual information changes performance in persons
   with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
   Methods: Twenty-one persons with anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction and 21 matched healthy adults reached to a target with
   the toe of the involved limb 50 times while wearing prism goggles that
   vertically shifted their visual field. Toe kinematics were collected to
   quantify endpoint error and reaching behavior.
   Findings: Statistical analyses failed to detect significant differences,
   evidencing both groups performed similarly with respect to endpoint
   error, movement duration, peak and maximum endpoint velocities, and
   initial direction error.
   Interpretation: When provided inaccurate information via a visual field
   perturbation, both groups demonstrated comparable adaptation and
   post-adaptation behavior. These results suggest this sample of persons
   with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are able to effectively
   integrate information across sensory systems as well as non-injured
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The main aims of this study is to analyze the effects of different
   irrigation regimes and norms of fertilization on morphological
   indicators and precocity of tomatoes, greenhouse production. The study
   of the influence of the irrigation regime was carried out against the
   background of different levels of fertilization. The experiment is
   derived by the block method on a flat surface according to scheme 110 +
   50 + 35 with the size of the plot of 10 m(2). The irrigation water was
   realized using a drip irrigation system with built-in droplets of 0.10
   cm. In the first experimental year, 33 irrigations with an irrigation
   late of 4950 m(3)/ha were delivered. The irrigation rate in the second
   year is 4050 m(3)/ha, realized through 27 irrigations. The size is
   dependent on the length of the growing season and on the need to
   irrigate in the optimum variant. The power of influence of the
   interaction of the factors irrigation and fertilization is established
   on the indicator plant height - it was 77.9 degrees/0, average for the
   study period. Factors in relation to other morphological indicators are
   with less force of impact. It was found that a strong influence on the
   variation of the trait has a factor fertilization, the force of impact
   by 81\% for the 1st harvest. Established role of the factor irrigation
   average for the period, with a high degree of reliability, is 91.8\% on
   the 2nd harvest. The high degree of influence of the irrigation factor
   on the 3rd harvest indicator is established, which is 86.9\%, average
   for the period. According to the one-factor dispersion analysis, the
   influence of both factors (irrigation and fertilization) separately, as
   well as their interaction, statistically proved with a very high degree
   of significance (p < 0.001) is the impact on the ``total yield{''}
   indicator. The fertilization has the strongest influence on the
   variation of the trait, with the force of impact 99\% for the indicator
   ``total yield{''}.}},

   grains after post-harvest spray applications. The recommendations for
   their use for Argentina and the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs)
   established by local and international pesticide regulations were
   considered. Supervised experimental trials were conducted in stored
   maize grains treated with 10 cc.t(-1) of pirimiphos-methyl and 20
   cc.t(-1) of dichlorvos. Samples were monitored 2, 30, 60, 90 and 120
   days after application. The pesticides were extracted from the maize
   grains using the QuEChERS technique and the residues were determined
   using high-resolution gas chromatography with mass detector. Residue
   dissipation percentages and daily dissipation rates differed between
   active ingredients. At 48 hours after application, pirimiphos-methyl
   residues were 5.1 +/- 0.42 mu g.g(-1), i.e. below the MRLs established
   by the Argentine Service for Agrifood Health and Quality (10 mu
   g.g(-1)), the USA (8 mu g.g(-1)) and the Codex Alimentarius (7 mu
   g.g(-1)), and close to the MRLs established by the EU (5 mu g.g(-1)).
   Dichlorvos residues reached 2.97 +/- 0.27 mu g.g(-1), and required at

Abstract = {{(1) Background: There is evidence of an attention bias-anxiety
   relationship in children, but lack of appropriate methods has limited
   the number of studies with children younger than eight years old. This
   study used eye tracking as a measure of overt attention in young
   children. The aim of this study was to assess anxiety-related attention
   bias in children aged four to eight years. Age was considered a
   moderator, and the influence of effortful control was investigated. (2)
   Method: A community sample of 104 children was shown pairs of
   happy-neutral and angry-neutral faces. Growth curve analyses were used
   to examine patterns of gaze over time. (3) Results: Analyses revealed
   moderation by age and anxiety, with distinct patterns of anxiety-related
   biases seen in different age groups in the angry-neutral face trials.
   Effortful control did not account for age-related effects. (4)
   Conclusions: The results support a moderation model of the development

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neuro-ophthalmologists specialize in complex, urgent,
   vision- and life-threatening problems, diagnostic dilemmas, and
   management of complex work-ups. Access is currently limited by the
   relatively small number of neuro-ophthalmologists, and consequently,
   patients may be affected by incorrect or delayed diagnosis. The
   objective of this study is to analyze referral patterns to
   neuro-ophthalmologists, characterize rates of misdiagnoses and delayed
   diagnoses in patients ultimately referred, and delineate outcomes after
   neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation.
   Methods: Retrospective chart review of 300 new patients seen over 45
   randomly chosen days between June 2011 and June 2015 in one tertiary
   care neuro-ophthalmology clinic. Demographics, distance traveled, time
   between onset and neuro-ophthalmology consultation (NOC), time between
   appointment request and NOC, number and types of providers seen before
   referral, unnecessary tests before referral, referral diagnoses, final
   diagnoses, and impact of the NOC on outcome were collected.
   Results: Patients traveled a median of 36.5 miles (interquartile range
   {[}IQR]: 20-85). Median time from symptom onset was 210 days (IQR:
   70-1,100). Median time from referral to NOC was 34 days (IQR: 7-86),
   with peaks at one week (urgent requests) and 13 weeks (routine
   requests). Median number of previous providers seen was 2 (IQR: 2-4;
   range:0-10), and 102 patients (34\%) had seen multiple providers within
   the same specialty before referral. Patients were most commonly referred
   for NOC by ophthalmologists (41\% of referrals). Eighty-one percent
   (242/300) of referrals to neuro-ophthalmology were appropriate
   referrals. Of the 300 patients referred, 247 (82\%) were complex or very
   complex; 119 (40\%) were misdiagnosed; 147 (49\%) were at least
   partially misdiagnosed; and 22 (7\%) had unknown diagnoses. Women were
   more likely to be at least partially misdiagnosed-108 of 188 (57\%) vs
   39 of 112 (35\%) of men (P < 0.001). Mismanagement or delay in care
   occurred in 85 (28\%), unnecessary tests in 56 (19\%), unnecessary
   consultations in 64 (22\%), and imaging misinterpretation in 16 (5\%).
   Neuro-ophthalmologists played a major role in directing treatment, such
   as preserving vision, preventing life-threatening complications, or
   avoiding harmful treatment in 62 (21\%) patients.
   Conclusions: Most referrals to neuro-ophthalmologists are appropriate,
   but many are delayed. Misdiagnosis before referral is common.
   Neuro-ophthalmologists often prevent vision- and life-threatening
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{Neutrinos undergoing stochastic perturbations as they propagate

   Such perturbations may result from fluctuations in space-time itself if
   gravity is a quantum force, including interactions between neutrinos and
   virtual black holes. In this work we model the influence of heuristic
   neutrino-virtual black hole interaction scenarios on neutrino
   propagation and evaluate the resulting signals in astrophysical and
   atmospheric neutrinos. We derive decoherence operators representing
   these effects in the framework of open quantum systems, allowing
   experimental constraints on such systems to be connected to quantum
   gravitational effects. Finally, we consider the energy-dependence of
   such Planck scale physics at energies observed in current neutrino
   experiments, and show that sensitivity to Planck scale physics well
   below the ``natural{''} expectation is achievable in certain scenarios.}},

Title = {{Detecting active eavesdropper in large-scale antenna systems over Rician

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Physical layer security is efficient in improving the security of
   transmission in wireless communications. It is effective in relaxing the
   complexity of the required cryptographic technologies. In this paper, we
   propose two detection schemes of an active eavesdropper in the physical
   layer of wireless communications. The system consists of a multi-antenna
   base station, a single-antenna legitimate user, and a single-antenna
   active eavesdropper. The large number of antennas at the base station is
   arranged as a planar array. It is assumed that the system is time
   division duplex (TDD) and the channels are of Rician distribution. The
   proposed two detection schemes are used to detect the eavesdropper by
   the base station and legitimate user, respectively. In both methods, the
   statistical characteristics of the received signals are analyzed and two
   test-statistics are constructed to detect the eavesdropper. The
   performances of the two methods are also analyzed. Simulation results
   show that both approaches are effective in detecting the active
   eavesdropper. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Macrophages, which can secret various inflammation mediators, have an
   essential role in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism(s)
   to regulate the production of inflammation mediator is not completely
   clear. Here we found that TRIM 59 could inhibit the production of NO and
   the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 2 (COX2) and TNF alpha. TRIM59 mediated suppression on
   nitric oxide (NO) production is through inhibiting the activation of
   JAK2-STAT1 signal pathway. In response to LPS, TRIM59 in macrophages was
   translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus and directly bound with STAT1.
   During this process, TRIM59 could recruit much more PIAS1 to bind with
   STAT1 to suppress the activation of STAT1. Finally, TRIM59 modified
   macrophages could promote tumor growth. Thus, TRIM59 mediated
   suppression on NO production by promoting the binding of PIAS1 and STAT1
   in macrophages may regulate tumor growth.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately classify digital printing defects with deep learning, we
   propose a digital printing defect classification algorithm based on
   convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, this method performs image
   preprocessing of RGH color space histogram equalization, Gaussian
   filtering, and local mean resolution adjustment in sequence to improve
   the image quality of the input network. Meanwhile, the sample data set
   is expanded by geometrically transforming the image. Then, the topology
   of CNN network is designed with 2 convolutional layers, 2 pooling
   layers, and 2 fully connected layers, which is the optimized CNN model
   of digital printing defect classification. Finally, the model is
   verified by 600 test samples. Experimental results show that the
   classification accuracy of proposed algorithm for all types of digital
   printing defects reaches above 90.0\%, and the Kappa coefficient value
   of multi-classification task is 0.91. The proposed method can accurately
   classify digital printing defects.}},

Abstract = {{A 44-year-old male person with tetraplegia (C-5 AIS-A (American Spinal
   Cord Injury Association Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal

   received appropriate antibiotic. Subsequently, he started sweating and
   shivering when he was sitting up; these symptoms resolved while lying on
   his back. Autonomic dysreflexia triggered by truncal movements continued
   to occur for 3 months. CT of the spine showed L5-S1 discitis. MRI of the
   spine showed diffuse marrow oedema in L5 and S1 vertebrae and a large
   abscess at L5/S1 level. Blood culture yielded Serratia marcescens
   sensitive to meropenem. Meropenem followed by ertapenem was given for 12
   weeks. After 11 months, MRI showed resolution of discitis and epidural
   collection. The patient was able to sit up for 9hours without developing
   autonomic dysreflexia. If a person with cervical spinal cord injury
   develops posture-related autonomic dysreflexia (eg, in sitting position,
   lying on sides or while hoisted), disco-vertebral pathology should be
   suspected.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to measure blur thresholds before and
   after refractive surgery. Methods: In this prospective cohort study
   conducted in a tertiary eye hospital in South India. Blur thresholds
   were measured for 30 young adult myopic patients 1 month prior to and
   after refractive surgery. Patients were asked to report three stages of
   blur, namely Detectable Blur (DB), Bothersome Blur (BB), and
   Non-resolvable Blur (NB). Blur was created by adding plus lenses (in
   steps of 0.12D) over their optimal subjective refraction. The blur
   judgments were made both monocularly and binocularly when looking
   through a 3 mm artificial pupil at one line above the best-corrected
   visual acuity. Results: A total of 30 participants were included in this
   study (mean age = 25.5 +/- 3.8 (20-36) years; 77\% female). The mean
   binocular preoperative blur of this group was: DB = 0.39 +/- 0.26D, BB =
   0.74 +/- 0.28D and NB = 1.04 +/- 0.42D. The corresponding mean binocular
   blur one-month post-operatively was DB = 0.46 +/- 0.28D, BB = 0.83 +/-
   0.35D, and NB = 1.21 +/- 0.44D. Although there was a marginal increase
   in the blur thresholds postoperatively, the difference was not
   statistically significant (DB: P = 0.320; BB: P = 0.229; NB: P = 0.054).
   Conclusion: All three blur thresholds showed an insignificant minimal
   increase at 1 month post-operatively suggesting that patients adapt to
   the induced blur following refractive surgery. A longer follow up would
   reveal how the adaptation to blur would change with time.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Treatment failure in oral cancer is mainly caused by
   uncontrolled cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis. We previously reported
   that CD11b+ cells are recruited into tumor hypoxic areas following
   radiation, leading to re-vascularization and relapse. Since lymphatic
   vessel formation has similarities with vascular formation, we examined
   whether surgery induces hypoxia and stimulates lymphangiogenesis.
   Materials and Methods: The recruitment of CD11b+ cells and the formation
   of lymphatic vessels were examined using orthotopic tongue cancer mouse
   models with glossectomy. Results: Surgery on OSC-19 tumor induced LN
   metastases and hypoxia, followed by CD11b+ cell influx. These phenomena
   were not observed in the no tumor or SAT tumor models. Stimulation of
   lymphangiogenesis was observed in the CD11b+ cell influx area, as the
   tumor grew. The localization of CD11b+ cells was changed from the lymph
   nodules to the medullary sinuses. Conclusion: Surgery-induced hypoxia in
   oral tumors leads to CD11b+ cell infiltration, lymphangiogenesis, and LN
   metastasis.}},

Title = {{Sitting at work \& waist circumference-A cross-sectional study of
   Australian workers}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studies examining associations of sitting time at work with obesity
   measures have produced inconsistent findings. Different sample
   characteristics across studies, e.g., the composition of different
   occupational groups, may be one explanation for the mixed findings. We
   examined cross-sectional associations of workplace sitting time with
   waist circumference in workers engaged in desk-based work and those
   engaged in other work settings using a population-based sample of
   Australian workers. Participants (5878 full-time workers in the 2014-15
   Australian National Health Survey) were categorized into desk-based (N =
   3006) or non-desk-based (N = 2872) workers, based on self-reported
   predominant behavior at work (sitting, standing, walking, and physical
   labor) and occupational group. Linear regression analyses examined
   associations of measured waist circumference with self-reported sitting
   time at work for each group, which was further stratified by gender and
   leisure-time physical activity level. Longer sitting time at work was
   associated with greater waist circumference in desk-based workers (b =
   0.45 {[}95\%CI: 0.09, 0.80] cm for a 1 h/day increment of sitting) but
   not in non-desk-based workers (b = 0.25 {[}95\%CI: -0.12, 0.63]). For
   desk-based workers, stratified analyses found significant associations
   in men and those who were insufficiently physically active during
   leisure time. Our findings support interventions to decrease
   occupational sitting time for desk-based workers to reduce their
   cardio-metabolic risk. Differential associations observed between
   desk-based and non-desk-based workers and between genders may be
   attributable to the ways in which sitting time is accumulated. Future
   research is needed to examine the impact of behavior patterns at work
   (sitting breaks, occupational physical activity) on adiposity in working
   adults.}},

Title = {{DimensionSlice: A main-memory data layout for fast scans of
   multidimensional data}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Multidimensional data are exploited in many application areas such as
   scientific data analysis, business intelligence, and geographic
   information systems. One of the most frequent operations applied to such
   multidimensional data is the selection of a subspace of the given
   multidimensional space, which involves predicate evaluation on multiple
   dimensions. Existing main-memory data layouts optimized for evaluating
   predicates on the columnar data can be used to accelerate the subspace
   extraction by sequentially performing filter scans on each dimension one
   at a time. However, optimization opportunities emerge if we can consider
   all predicates together. In this paper, we propose DimensionSlice, a new
   main-memory data layout optimized for evaluating predicates on multiple
   dimensions. More specifically, the dimension values are sliced into
   portions and the portions with the same order of each dimension are
   arranged together. Multiple predicates are simultaneously evaluated with
   the sliced dimension values during the scan. In addition, by storing the
   different portions separately, unnecessary loads and computations of
   lower portions can be eliminated if the evaluation results are assured
   after examining the upper portions. For further acceleration of scans,
   the DimensionSlice layout is designed to easily leverage the SIMD
   capabilities that most mainstream processors are equipped with. Through
   experiments, we demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed method
   over the columnar mainmemory layout that evaluates the partial
   predicates one dimension at a time. We also show that the proposed
   method outperforms the state-of-the-art multidimensional index structure
   when the selectivity is over a very low threshold. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background Symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are a
   common clinical problem. Although most of ventricular ectopic foci can
   be easily ablated, some are very challenging and require special
   manoeuvers. This case report presents an approach to improve electrode
   stability during ablation.
   Case summary A 19-year-old Asian male patient presented with frequent
   symptomatic PVCs having an inferior axis, left bundle branch morphology,
   and R/S transition in V4. Structural heart disease was excluded by
   echocardiography and general blood tests were normal. The treatment with
   a class Ic antiarrhythmic (ethacizine) over 2 months was ineffective and
   the patient was admitted for radiofrequency ablation. Activation mapping
   revealed a PVC focus in the superior part of the tricuspid annulus, but
   the femoral access approach resulted in frequent dislocation of the
   ablation tip. An internal jugular vein approach though resulted in
   improved stability and successful elimination of the PVC.
   Discussion In cases with PVCs from the superior portions of the right
   heart, stability of the electrode may be improved by a jugular venous
   access.}},

Title = {{Spatial-temporal aspects of continuous EEG-based neurorobotic control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The goal of this work is to identify the spatio-temporal
   facets of state-of-the-art electroencephalography (EEG)-based continuous
   neurorobotics that need to be addressed, prior to deployment in
   practical applications at home and in the clinic. Approach. Nine healthy
   human subjects participated in five sessions of one-dimensional (1D)
   horizontal (LR), 1D vertical (UD) and two-dimensional (2D) neural
   tracking from EEG. Users controlled a robotic arm and virtual cursor to
   continuously track a Gaussian random motion target using EEG
   sensorimotor rhythm modulation via motor imagery (MI) commands.
   Continuous control quality was analyzed in the temporal and spatial
   domains separately. Main results. Axis-specific errors during 2D tasks
   were significantly larger than during 1D counterparts. Fatigue rates
   were larger for control tasks with higher cognitive demand (LR, left-
   and right-hand MI) compared to those with lower cognitive demand (UD,
   both hands MI and rest). Additionally robotic arm and virtual cursor
   control exhibited equal tracking error during all tasks. However,
   further spatial error analysis of 2D control revealed a significant
   reduction in tracking quality that was dependent on the visual
   interference of the physical device. In fact, robotic arm performance
   was significantly greater than that of virtual cursor control when the
   users' sightlines were not obstructed. Significance. This work
   emphasizes the need for practical interfaces to be designed around
   real-world tasks of increased complexity. Here, the dependence of
   control quality on cognitive task demand emphasizes the need for
   decoders that facilitate the translation of 1D task mastery to 2D
   control. When device footprint was accounted for, the introduction of a
   physical robotic arm improved control quality, likely due to increased
   user engagement. In general, this work demonstrates the need to consider
   both the physical footprint of devices, the complexity of training
   tasks, and the synergy of control strategies during the development of
   neurorobotic control.}},

Title = {{Runs of homozygosity and analysis of inbreeding depression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pedigree information was traditionally used to assess inbreeding. The
   availability of high-density marker panels provides an alternative to
   assess inbreeding, particularly in the presence of incomplete and
   error-prone pedigrees. Assessment of autozygosity across chromosomal
   segments using runs of homozygosity (ROH) has emerged as a valuable tool
   to estimate inbreeding due to its general flexibility and ability to
   quantify the chromosomal contribution to genome-wide inbreeding.
   Unfortunately, the identification of ROH segments is sensitive to the
   parameters used during the search process. These parameters are
   heuristically set, leading to significant variation in the results. The
   minimum length required to identify an ROH segment has major effects on
   the estimation of inbreeding and inbreeding depression, yet it is
   arbitrarily set. To overcome this limitation, a search algorithm to
   approximate mutation enrichment was developed to determine the minimum
   length of ROH segments. It consists of finding genome segments with
   significant effect differences in trait means between animals with high
   and low burdens of autozygous intervals with a specific length. The
   minimum length could be determined heuristically as the smallest
   interval at which a significant signal is detected. The proposed method
   was tested in an inbred Hereford cattle population genotyped for 30,220
   SNPs. Phenotypes recorded for six traits were used for the approximation
   of mutation loads. The estimated minimum length was around 1 Mb for
   yearling weight (YW) and average daily gain (ADG) and 4 Mb for birth
   weight and weaning weight. These trait-specific thresholds estimated
   using the proposed method could be attributed to a trait-dependent
   effect of homozygosity. The detection of significant inbreeding effects
   was well aligned with the estimated thresholds, especially for YW and
   ADG. Although highly deleterious alleles are expected to be more
   frequent in recent inbreeding (long ROH), short ROH segments (<5 Mb)
   could contain a large number of less deleterious mutations with
   substantial joint effects on some traits (YW and ADG). Our results
   highlight the importance of accurate estimation of the ROH-based
   inbreeding and the necessity to consider a trait-specific minimum length
   threshold for the identification of ROH segments in inbreeding
   depression analyses. These thresholds could be determined using the
   proposed method provided the availability of phenotypic information.}},

Abstract = {{Like birds and many other animals, bats produce diverse acoustic calls
   for social communication. Geographical variation in social acoustic
   signals and perceptual discrimination abilities are well studied in
   birds but largely unexplored in bats. In this study, we recorded male
   territorial calls of the great Himalayan leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros
   armiger, from nine colonies at a large geographical scale and
   investigated the patterns and causes of geographical variation in
   acoustic signals. We also performed habituation-dishabituation playbacks
   to investigate whether males could discriminate between territorial
   calls of their own versus a foreign colony. Overall, our results showed
   significant geographical variation in calls across colonies. Neither
   climatic differences, morphological differences, geographical distances
   nor genetic distances between colonies explained the observed acoustic
   variation between colonies. A playback experiment indicated that males
   from eastern China were able to discriminate between calls of males from
   their own colony and those of males from a colony in southwestern China.
   This study provides the first experimental evidence that bats can
   discriminate geographical variation in social calls. (C) 2020 The

Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes a new shared mixed reality (MR)-bilateral
   telerobotic system. The main contribution of this study is to combine MR
   teleoperation and bilateral teleoperation, which takes advantage of the
   two types of teleoperation and compensates for each other's drawbacks.
   With this combination, the proposed system can address the asymmetry
   issues in bilateral teleoperation, such as kinematic redundancy and
   workspace inequality, and provide force feedback, which is lacking in MR
   teleoperation. In addition, this system effectively supports
   long-distance movements and fine movements. In this system, a new MR
   interface is developed to provide the operator with an immersive visual
   feedback of the workspace, in which a useful virtual controller known as
   an interaction proxy-is designed. Compared with previous virtual
   reality-based teleoperation systems, this interaction proxy can freely
   decouple the operator from the control loop, such that the operational
   burden can be substantially alleviated. Additionally, the force feedback
   provided by the bilateral teleoperation gives the operator an advanced
   perception about the remote workspace and can improve task performance.
   Experiments on multiple pick-and-place tasks are provided to demonstrate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system. (C) 2020

Title = {{Prediction for structure stability and ultrahigh hydrogen evolution
   performance of monolayer 2H-CrS2}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{By a combination of the first-principles calculations and climbing image
   nudged elastic band method (ciNEB) we investigate structure stabilities
   and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of monolayer 2H-CrS2.
   The results suggest the free energy for the Volmer reaction in the
   monolayer 2H-CrS2 with S vacancy is 0.07 eV, comparable with Pt-based
   catalyst, and HER on the surface of the monolayer is prone to the
   Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with no energy barrier. We propose that high
   HER performance stems from the reduction of the energy level of d-band
   center. Additionally, the S vacancy leads to defect states in the middle
   of electronic bandgap and the reduction of potential barrier between the
   S atom layer and the vacuum, which is conducive to improve HER
   performance.}},

Title = {{Long-term increase in rainfall decreases soil organic phosphorus
   decomposition in tropical forests}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increased rainfall may affect soil phosphorus (P) cycling in tropical
   forest ecosystems, yet the key biotic and abiotic factors that govern
   soil organic P transformations remain unclear. In this study, we
   conducted a long-term (7 years) rainfall manipulation experiment in the
   field to examine the effects of increased rainfall (+25\%) in the wet
   season on soil P dynamics in a tropical forest. We found that an
   increase in rainfall in the wet season enhanced the maximum P adsorption
   capacity of forest soil as a result of a greater availability of soil
   organic matter and organic iron (Fe)/aluminum (Al) oxides. Newly formed
   stable ternary complexes between soil organic matter, metals (Mn, Mg and
   Ca) and P increased the surface adsorption of soil organic P. Moreover,
   the alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP) activity was reduced under our
   experimental treatment owing to a decrease in the abundance of both
   ALP-producing bacteria (Bradyrhizobium and Methylobacterium being the
   dominant genera) and bacterivores (Rhabditis and Acrobeloides). Our
   findings demonstrated an overall negative impact of elevated rainfall in
   wet season on soil organic P decomposition in tropical forests through
   the enhancement of soil P adsorption capacity and the inhibition of soil
   ALP activities. Our results implied that a long-term rainfall increase
   in the wet season could increase soil organic P accumulation, which in
   turn further reduce soil P availability for plant uptake in the tropical
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the problem of private information delivery (PID),
   comprised of K messages, a user, and N servers (each holds M <= K
   messages) that wish to deliver one out of K messages to the user
   privately, i.e., without revealing the delivered message index to the
   user. The information theoretic capacity of PID, C, is defined as the
   maximum number of bits of the desired message that can be privately
   delivered per bit of total communication to the user. For the PID
   problem with K messages, N servers, M messages stored per server, and N
   >= inverted right perpendicularK/Minverted left perpendicular, we
   provide an achievable scheme of rate 1/inverted right
   perpendicularK/Minverted left perpendicular and an information theoretic
   converse of rate M/K, i. e., the PID capacity satisfies 1/inverted right
   perpendicularK/Minverted left perpendicular <= C <= M/K. This settles
   the capacity of PID when K/M is an integer. When K/M is not an integer,
   we show that the converse rate of M/K is achievable if N >= K/gcd(K,M) -
   (M/gcd(K,M) - 1)(left perpendicularK/Mi right perpendicular -1), and the
   achievable rate of 1/inverted right perpendicularK/Minverted left
   perpendicular is optimal if N = inverted right perpendicularK/Minverted
   left perpendicular. Otherwise if inverted right perpendicularK/Minverted
   left perpendicular <N < K/gcd(K, M) - (M/gcd(K, M) - 1 (left
   perpendicularK/M right perpendicular - 1), we give an improved
   achievable scheme and prove its optimality for several small settings.}},

   copper}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{541}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Metallic materials used in fission and fusion reactors will internally
   accumulate numerous lattice defects and bubbles because of high
   radiation. An in-depth understanding on the influence of bubbles is
   significant to the safety and life assessment of relevant engineering
   equipment. Here, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to
   investigate the effects of twin boundary (TB) spacing, inner-bubble
   pressure, temperature and bubble number density on uniaxial tensile
   deformation behaviors of helium bubbles implanted nano-twinned copper
   (nt-Cu). Simulation results reveal that the TB can significantly enhance
   the strength of nt-Cu because of the Hall-Petch effect. The increase of
   inner-bubble pressure reduces the critical stress of dislocation
   emission, which in turn reduces the yield stress. High temperature
   softens the models and increases the inner-bubble pressure. The weaken
   effect of pressure component is remarkable in the yield strength, while
   that has little impact on the elastic modulus and the average flow
   stress. In addition, the larger bubble number density is accompanied by
   the lower elastic modulus, yield stress and average flow stress. The
   present findings provide valuable suggestions for upgrading the design
   and fabrication of high radiation-resistant metallic materials. (C) 2020

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic MoS2 could be easily separated from water or solid suspensions.
   In this work, shell-core structured MoS2@Fe3O4 composite was fabricated
   through hydrothermal method and used as catalyst for recovering
   gold-thiosulfate complex ions (Au(S2O3)(2)(3-)) in aqueous solution. The
   results suggested that MoS2@Fe3O4 composite could effectively in-situ
   reduce Au(S2O3)(2)(3-)- to gold particles (Au-0) with an extremely high
   reduction capacity of 1541.1 mg/g; moreover, the gold loaded
   MoS2@Fe(3)O(4 )could be easily collected using a magnetic separator. The
   mechanism of reducing Au(S2O3)(2)(3-) to Au-0 was ascribed to the
   photoexcited electrons from MoS2@Fe3O4 composite. More importantly, the
   incorporation of Fe3O4 could effectively enhance the transferred
   efficiency of photoexcited electrons and accelerate separation of
   electrons-holes pairs. With great gold reduction capacity and magnetic
   recyclability, the MoS2@Fe3O4 composite could be a promising material
   for recovering gold from leaching solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The energy resolution of a LaBr3(Ce) scintillation counter can reach
   2.7\% (662 keV) at room temperature. As a radiation measuring device, it
   has remarkably good characteristics. However, the LaBr3(Ce) crystal has
   its own intrinsic radioactivity background, which mainly comes from
   La-138 and from Ac-227 and its daughters. La-138 can emit beta, gamma
   and X-rays through beta and gamma decay; Ac-227 and its daughters can
   emit alpha, beta and gamma-rays through a, beta and gamma decay. alpha,
   beta and X-ray energy are characteristic while beta-ray energy is
   continuous. The energy of alpha, beta and X-rays is mainly deposited in
   the crystal unless the alpha, beta and X-rays at the edge of the crystal
   can escape from the crystal. Therefore, the alpha, beta, gamma and
   X-rays generated by the intrinsic radioactivity of the crystal are
   superimposed on the instrument spectrum, which makes the instrument
   spectrum more complicated and produces the coincidence summing effects
   of gamma + X, gamma + beta and gamma + alpha.In this research, the
   GEANT4.9.5 software package was used to simulate the spectra of alpha,
   beta, gamma and X-rays. On the basis of a combination of fitting
   decomposition and reconstruction, the simulation spectrum of the
   LaBr3(Ce) self-radioactive background was obtained accurately and was
   verified by using physical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In order to broaden the application of potato pulp pectic polysaccharide
   (PPP) in stabilizing acidified milk drinks (AMDs) and investigate the
   stabilizing effect and physical properties of AMDs prepared with PPP, a
   comparative study was made among PPP, commercial high methoxyl pectin
   (HMP) and low methoxyl pectin (LMP). The zeta potential, rheology,
   particle size and serum separation of AMDs were evaluated after
   preparing with PPP, HMP and LMP, respectively. Results indicated that
   PPP led to lower serum separation than LMP (14.65\% for AMDs prepared
   with 0.5\% PPP compared to 25.05\% for AMDs prepared with 0.5\% LMP),
   but still higher than HMP (9.09\% for AMDs prepared with 0.5\% HMP).
   However, narrower particle size distribution and lower viscosity of AMDs
   was achieved by PPP than by LMP and HMP. PPP can electrostatically
   adsorb on the surface of casein and its abundant neutral sugar side
   chains would provide steric hindrance to prevent casein flocculation in
   AMDs. Our results might provide some new ideas for the application of
   PPP in improving the stability of AMDs.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress significantly contributes to heart disease, and thus
   might be a promising target for ameliorating heart failure. Mounting
   evidence suggests that selenium has chemotherapeutic potential for
   treating heart disease due to its regulation of selenoproteins, which
   play antioxidant regulatory roles. Oxidative stress-induced
   cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest contributes to the loss of
   cardiomyocytes during heart failure. The protective effects and
   mechanism of selenium against oxidative stress-induced cell cycle arrest
   in cardiomyocytes warrant further study. H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast cells
   were treated with hydrogen peroxide in the presence or absence of
   selenium supplementation. Na2SeO3 pretreatment alleviated H2O2-induced
   oxidative stress, increased thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) activity and
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and counteracted the H2O2-induced
   cell cycle arrest at the S phase. These effects were accompanied by
   attenuation of the H2O2-induced strengthening of the G2/M-phase
   inhibitory system, including increased mRNA and protein levels of
   cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and decreased p21 mRNA levels. Notably,
   Na2SeO3 pretreatment activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and
   inhibition of PI3K counteracted the protective effects of selenium on
   H2O2-induced cell cycle arrest. We corroborated our findings in vivo by
   inducing oxidative stress in pig heart by feeding a selenium deficient
   diet, which decreased the TXNRD activity, inactivated PI3K/AKT signaling
   and strengthened the G2/M-phase inhibitory system. We concluded that the
   cardioprotective effects of selenium supplementation against oxidative
   stress-induced cell cycle arrest in cardiomyocytes might be mediated by
   the selenoprotein-associated (GPx and TXNRD) antioxidant capacity,
   thereby activating redox status-associated PI3K/AKT pathways, which
   promote cell cycle progression by targeting the G2/M phase inhibitory
   system. This study provides new insight into the underlying mechanisms
   of cardioprotection effects of selenium at the cellular level.}},

Title = {{LncRNA MEG3 control Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection via controlled
   MiR-145-5p expression and modulation of macrophages proliferation}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intractable pathogen
   for humans to overcome. While as an important part of innate immunity,
   macrophages play an important role in resisting foreign pathogenic
   microorganisms, and it has been proved that there is a close
   relationship between macrophages and Mtb. In recent years, with the
   in-depth study of LncRNA, there have been crucial breakthroughs in the
   diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases, and understanding the
   impact of LncRNA on Mtb may also be conducive to providing new
   therapeutic targets for tuberculosis prevention and treatment in the
   future. Therefore, this study explore the role of MEG3 in the
   proliferation and apoptosis of Mtb-infected macrophages.
   Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2019, 84 consecutive
   pulmonary Mtd patients admitted to our hospital were selected as the
   observation group (OG), and concurrently, 88 healthy controls were
   selected as the control group (CG). MEG3 and miR-145-5p in peripheral
   blood of the two groups were detected, and their diagnostic value in
   pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was analyzed by receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves. In addition, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
   and mouse Raw264.7 macrophage strains were purchased to establish the
   Mtb-infected macrophage model. Colony forming unit (CFU) and flow
   cytometry were employed to determine the effects of MEG3 and miR-145-5p
   on macrophages, and the correlation between the two was performed by
   dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay.
   Results: MEG3 was highly expressed in PTB, while miR-145-5p was lowly
   expressed (P < 0.050). ROC analysis demonstrated that both MEG3 and
   miR-145-5p enjoyed favorable predictive value for the occurrence of PTB
   (P < 0.001). In the Mtb-infected macrophage model, MEG3 decreased (P <
   0.050) while miR-145-5p increased with the time of infection (P <
   0.050). Inhibited MEG3 and overexpressed miR-145-5p resulted in
   increased CFU and decreased apoptosis ability of macrophages (P <
   0.050). The DLR assay identified a targeting relationship between
   miR-145-5p and MEG3 (P < 0.050). The increase of MEG3 could inhibit the
   expression of in miR-145-5p (P < 0.050).
   Conclusion: MEG3 affects the biological activity of Mtb-infected
   macrophages by targeting miR-145-5p, which may be the key to the
   diagnosis and treatment of PTB and even all kinds of tuberculosis in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{The natural measurements of uranium (U) are important for establishing
   natural baseline levels of U in soil. The relations between U and other
   elements are important to determine the extent of geological origin of
   soil U. The present study was aimed at providing a three-dimensional
   view of soil U distribution in a forested catchment (ca. 38.5 ha) in
   western Germany. The evaluated data, containing 155 sampled points, each
   with four major soil horizons (L/O-f, O-h, A, and B), were collected
   from two existing datasets. The vertical U distribution, the lateral
   pattern of U in the catchment, and the occurrence of correlations
   between U and three groups of elements (nutrient elements, heavy metals,
   and rare earth elements) were examined. The results showed the median U
   concentration increased sevenfold from the top horizon L/O-f (0.14 mg
   kg(-1)) to the B horizon (1.01 mg kg(-1)), suggesting a geogenic origin
   of soil U. Overall, soil U concentration was found to be negatively
   correlated with some plant macronutrients (C, N, K, S, Ca) but
   positively with others (P, Mg, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Mo). The negative
   correlations between U and some macronutrients indicated a limited
   accumulation of plant-derived U in soil, possibly due to low
   phytoavailability of U. Positive correlations were also found between U
   concentration and heavy metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Ga, As, Cd, Hg, Pb) or rare
   earth elements, which further pointed to a geogenic origin of soil U in
   this forested catchment.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to investigate the future runoff into the
   Nong Han Lake under the effects of climate change. The hydrological
   model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been selected for this
   study. The calibration and validation were performed by comparing the
   simulated and observed runoff from gauging station KH90 for the period
   2001-2003 and 2004-2005, respectively. Future climate projections were
   generated by Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS)
   under the A2 and B2 scenarios. The SWAT model yielded good results in
   comparison to the baseline; moreover, the results of the PRECIS model
   showed that both precipitations and temperatures increased.
   Consequently, the amount of runoff calculated by SWAT under the A2 and
   B2 scenarios was higher than that for the baseline. In addition, the
   amount of runoff calculated considering the A2 scenario was higher than
   that considering the B2 scenario, due to higher average annual
   precipitations in the former case. The methodology and results of this
   study constitute key information for stakeholders, especially for the
   development of effective water management systems in the lake, such as
   designing a rule curve to cope with any future incidents.}},

Abstract = {{In a text matching similarity task, a model takes two sequence of text
   as an input and predicts a category or scale value to show their
   relationship. A developed model is to measure the similarity - one of
   relationship between those two text. The model is SIAMESE network that
   implement two copies of same network of CNN, it takes text\_1 and
   text\_2 as the inputs respectively for two CNN networks. The output of
   each CNN network is features vector of the corresponding text input,
   both outputs are then fed by a loss function to calculate the value of
   loss (i.e. similarity). This research implemented two types of loss
   functions, i.e. Triplet loss and Contrastive loss. The usage purpose of
   these two types of loss functions was to see the influence toward the
   measurement results of similarity between two text being compared. The
   metrices used for this comparison are precision, recall, and F1-score.
   Based on the experimental results done on 1500 pairs of sentences, and
   varied on the epoch value starting from 10 until 200 with an increment
   of 10, showed the best result was for epoch value of 180 with precision
   0.8004, recall 0.6780, and F1-score 0.6713 for Triplet loss function;
   and epoch value of 160 with precision 0.6463, recall 0.6440, and
   F1-score 0.6451 for Contrastive loss function gave the best performance.
   So that, the Triplet loss function gave better influence than
   Contrastive loss function in measuring similarity between two given
   sentences.}},

   urea (CO(NH2)(2)) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were daily injected into
   the sand to obtain the optimum results from the calcite precipitation.
   The highest value of urease enzyme activity occurs on the second day

   how much the influence of groundwater pressure from rainfall in the
   study area to the saltwater interface. The result of precipitation data
   indicates very low medium rainfall, with 0.6 mm for October 126.1 mm for
   November. In October, the coastal aquifer will be so pressed by salt
   water that sea water intrusion penetrates into freshwater areas. In
   November, the coastal aquifers are recharged by precipitation and
   replenished water flowing to the sea then prevent saltwater from
   encroaching into the area of freshwater. The resistivity survey detected
   the presence of seawater intrusion because it has a small resistivity
   range between 0.120-0.980 Om at a depth about 13.5 m to 26.9 m. 3D

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work is to investigate an effect of primary air
   draft and flow rate on thermal performance and CO/CO2 emission of the
   domestic stove fed with the briquette of coconut shell. The work is
   conducted by following the simplified water boiling test method.
   Firstly, the stove is tested under natural draft mode (ND). Secondly,
   the stove is run under force draft mode at two different air flow rates,
   such that 0.013 m(3)/s (FD 1) and 0.020 m(3)/s (FD 2). In the present
   work, temperatures of water, flame, and stove are measured. Thermal
   performance of the stove in terms of fuel consumption rates (FCR),
   firepower (P), heating rates (E-w), thermal efficiency (eta(T)), and
   specific useful energy (SUE) is calculated and analyzed. CO/CO2 in flue
   gas is also measured and analyzed. The result indicates that air flow
   rate affects the thermal performance and CO/CO2 emission of the stove.
   Increasing air flow rate enhances the FCR, P, E-w, eta(T), and SUE. On
   the other hand, increasing air flow rate reduces CO/CO2 in flue gas. The
   highest values of FCR, P, E-w, eta(T), and SUE are obtained at the
   higher air flow rate. The values are 1.43 kg/h, 8.024 kW, 0.294 kW,
   3.670\%, and 741.975 kJ/kg, correspondingly. Meanwhile, the lowest
   CO/CO2 of 0.009 is observed at the higher air flow rate.}},

Journal = {{JHEP REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Isolated autosomal-dominant polycystic liver disease
   (ADPLD) is generally considered a rare disease. However, the frequency
   of truncating mutations to ADPLD genes in large, population sequencing
   databases is 1:496. With the increasing use of abdominal imaging,
   incidental detection of hepatic cysts and ADPLD has become more
   frequent. The present study was performed to ascertain the incidence and
   point prevalence of ADPLD in Olmsted County, MN, USA, and how these are
   impacted by the increasing utilisation of abdominal imaging.
   Methods: The Rochester Epidemiology Project and radiology databases of
   Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center were searched to identify all
   subjects meeting diagnostic criteria for definite, likely, or possible
   ADPLD. Annual incidence rates were calculated using incident cases
   during 1980-2016 as numerator, and age- and sex-specific estimates of
   the population of Olmsted County as denominator. Point prevalence was
   calculated using prevalence cases as numerator, and age- and
   sex-specific estimates of the population of Olmsted County on 1 January
   2010 as denominator.
   Results: The incidence rate and point prevalence of combined definite
   and likely ADPLD were 1.01 per 100,000 person-years and 9.5 per 100,000
   population, respectively. Only 15 of 35 definite and likely incident
   ADPLD cases had received a diagnostic code, and only 8 had clinically
   significant hepatomegaly. The incidence rates were much higher when
   adding possible cases, mainly identified through radiology databases,
   particularly in recent years and in older patients because of the
   increased utilisation of imaging studies.
   Conclusions: Clinically significant isolated ADPLD is a rare disease
   with a prevalence <1:10,000 population. The overall prevalence of ADPLD,
   however, to a large extent not clinically significant, is likely much
   higher and closer to the reported genetic prevalence. (C) 2020 Published

Title = {{Functional polymers in photoelectrochemical biosensing}},
Journal = {{BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis is a detection technique that has
   gained a wide attention in sensing applications. PEC presents the
   advantages of high sensitivity, low background signal, simple equipment
   and easy miniaturization. In PEC detection, light is used as an
   excitation source while current or voltage is measured as the output
   detection signal. The ability to couple the PEC process with specific
   bioreceptors gives PEC biosensing a unique advantage of being both
   selective and sensitive. The growing interest in PEC bioanalysis has
   resulted in essential progress in its analytical performance and
   biodetection applications.
   Functional polymers have different applications in the development of
   novel PEC biosensing platforms. Recently, the interest in polymer-based
   photoactive materials has emerged as they are efficient and less toxic
   alternatives to certain kinds of inorganic semiconductors and
   sensitizers. Moreover, molecularly imprinted polymers are a class of
   synthetic bioreceptors that are increasingly used in PEC bioanalytics.
   In this review, we will provide an overview on functional polymer-based
   PEC biosensing approaches. Novel classes of polymers as photoactive
   materials are reviewed and selected applications are described.
   Furthermore, molecularly imprinted polymers in the development of smart
   and sensitive PEC bioanalytical strategies are discussed. (C) 2020

Title = {{Pathogenicity and immunogenicity of Edwardsiella piscicida ferric uptake
   regulator (fur) mutations in zebrafish}},

Abstract = {{Edwardsiella piscicida is the etiological agent of edwardsiellosis in
   fish and causes severe economic losses in global aquaculture.
   Vaccination would be the most effective method to prevent infectious
   diseases and their associated economic losses. The ferric uptake
   regulator (Fur) is an important transcriptional global regulator of
   Gramnegative bacteria. In this study, we examined the regulatory
   function of Fur in E. piscicida. We designed a strain that displays
   features of the wild-type virulent strain of E. piscicida at the time of
   immunization to enable strains first to effectively colonize lymphoid
   tissues and then to exhibit a regulated delayed attenuation in vivo to
   preclude inducing disease symptoms. Regulated delayed attenuation in
   vivo is based on the substitution of a tightly regulated araC P-araBAD
   cassette for the promoter of the fur gene such that expression of this
   gene is dependent on arabinose provided during growth. Thus, following
   E. piscicida mutant colonization of lymphoid tissues, the Fur protein
   ceases to be synthesized due to the absence of arabinose such that
   attenuation is gradually manifest in vivo to preclude induction of
   diseases symptoms. We deleted the promoter, including all sequences that
   interact with activator or repressor proteins, for the fur gene, and
   substituted the improved araC P-araBAD cassette to yield an E. piscicida
   strain with the Delta P-fur170:TT araC P-araBAD fur deletion-insertion
   mutation (chi 16012). Compared to the wild-type strain J118, chi 16012
   exhibited retarded growth and enhanced siderophore production in the
   absence of arabinose. mRNA levels of Fur-regulated genes were analyzed
   in iron deplete or replete condition in wild-type and fur mutant
   strains. We observed zebrafish immunized with chi 16012 showed better
   colonization and protection compared to the Delta fur (chi 16001).
   Studies showed that E. piscicida strain chi 16012 is attenuated and
   induces systemic and mucosal IgM titer in zebrafish. In addition, we
   found an increase in transcript levels of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-8 and
   ifn-gamma in different tissues of zebrafish immunized with chi 16012
   compared to the unimmunized group. We conclude that, E. piscicida with
   regulated delayed attenuation could be an effective immersion vaccine
   for the aquaculture industry.}},

Title = {{A unified water/ice kinematics approach for phase-field
   thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling of frost action in porous media}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{372}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This research work introduces a novel phase-field
   thermo-hydro-mechanical (P-THM) modeling approach that allows to deeply
   understand and model the freezing-thawing cyclic process in a
   fluid-saturated porous medium. In this, a biphasic macroscopic,
   non-isothermal porous media model, augmented by the phase-field method
   (PFM), is applied to account for the temperature development, the
   interstitial pore-fluid flow, and the volumetric deformations due to ice
   formation (phase change). Utilizing the theory of porous media (TPM) in
   the continuum mechanical formulation provides a well-founded basis for
   the description of deformable, fluid-saturated, non-isothermal porous
   solid materials. Of particular importance in the underlying work is the
   unified kinematics treatment of the ice and water constituents as a
   single pore-fluid, where the PFM is employed for the description of the
   phase transition between both constituents. The PFM is a
   diffuse-interface approach that relies on the specification of the free
   energy density function as the main driving force in the phase
   transition. It employs a scalar-valued, phase-field variable to indicate
   the state of the pore-fluid, i.e., a solid (ice) or a liquid (water). A
   significant virtue of using the PFM approach is its viability in the
   implementation within standard finite element frameworks, as no need to
   explicitly track the moving boundaries (interfaces) of the phase-change
   constituent. The numerical examples and comparisons presented at the end
   of the manuscript demonstrate the ability, reliability and usefulness of
   the proposed modeling framework in describing the freezing-thawing
   process in a saturated porous solid under thermal loading within an
   elastic deformation limit. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) are frequently used

   a 61-year-old cancer patient in which the TIVAD fractured and embolized
   to the patient's left knee 18 months after its initial placement. An
   endovascular procedure with intraoperative imaging revealed that the
   catheter had embolized to the popliteal artery and was successfully
   removed, the only explanation being the presence of an atrial septal
   defect. A bubble echocardiogram was unsuccessful in confirming the
   diagnosis. The catheter fracture could be related to an intravascular
   procedure that was performed 18 months prior to remove fibrin sheaths as
   a cause of port malfunction, or it could be a case of pinch-off

Abstract = {{Gas-insulated lines (GILs) have been increasingly used as high-current

   enclosures were determined analytically with the skin, and proximity
   effects were taken into account. The determined power losses were used
   as heat sources in thermal analysis. Considering the natural convection
   and radiation heat transfer effects, the heat balance equations on the
   surface of the phase conductors and the screens were established,
   respectively. Subsequently, the temperature of the phase conductors and
   the enclosures were determined. The validation of the proposed method

Abstract = {{In this study, a regional convolutional neural network (RCNN)-based deep

   are to detect rusted bolts distinguished from non-corroded ones and also
   to estimate bolt-loosening angles of the identified bolts. The following
   approaches are performed to achieve the goals. Firstly, a RCNN-based
   autonomous bolt detection scheme is designed to identify corroded and
   clean bolts in a captured image. Secondly, a HLT-based image processing
   algorithm is designed to estimate rotational angles (i.e.,
   bolt-loosening) of cropped bolts. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed
   framework is experimentally evaluated under various capture distances,
   perspective distortions, and light intensities. The lab-scale monitoring
   results indicate that the suggested method accurately acquires rusted
   bolts for images captured under perspective distortion angles less than
   15 degrees and light intensities larger than 63 lux.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are widely manufactured and
   can be released into the environment, where they have the potential to
   severely affect fish and human health. This study was conducted to
   evaluate the effect of TiO2-NPs on the growth of fingerlings of Labeo
   rohita. TiO2-NPs were used in different concentrations (1 mg/kg, 10
   mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg) mixed in fish basal feed for a period
   of 12 weeks. The mortality rate was recorded once the fish were
   acclimatized, after TiO2-NPs exposure. The growth in length (cm) and
   weight (g) of the fish was measured to evaluate the time and
   concentration dependent growth of the fingerlings. A high mortality rate
   was observed for the fish exposed to high concentrations of TiO2-NPs
   from week 10 onwards. A gradual increase in the body weight and length
   of the fish was observed for all treatments until the 8th week, which
   thereafter changed differently for different treatments. It could be
   shown that TiO2-NPs exert concentration dependent bimodal effects on
   fish growth with a longer exposure to high concentrations of TiO2-NPs
   having an adverse effect on the growth. Therefore, TiO2-NPs in natural
   water bodies may affect the aquaculture industry as well as inland
   fisheries. (C) 2020 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

Abstract = {{New strategies for early diagnosis and careful follow-up of systemic
   sclerosis are urgently needed. We unconventionally used a video
   capillaroscopy system to measure the amount of sweating on finger pads,
   and investigated its clinical significance. Thirty-three Japanese
   patients who were diagnosed with typical or pre-clinical stage patients
   of systemic sclerosis were included in this study. Five healthy subjects
   were also included. Among twenty-one patients with typical systemic
   sclerosis that fulfilled ACR/EULAR 2013 classification criteria, seven
   had increased sweating levels. On the other hand, among twelve
   pre-clinical stage patients that did not fulfill the classification
   criteria, no patient showed increase in finger sweating. We found that
   there was statistically significant difference. The ratio of diffuse
   cutaneous systemic sclerosis was also found to be significantly higher
   in subjects with increased amounts of sweating than in subjects with
   normal levels. Furthermore, the positivity of topoisomerase I antibody
   was statistically higher in patients with increased sweating levels than
   in those without. These results indicated that measurement of finger
   sweating levels may be a useful tool for early diagnosis and
   clarification of pathogenesis in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, SARS-CoV-2 identified in Wuhan
   city of China in December 2019, continues to spread at a rapid rate
   worldwide. There are no specific therapies available and investigations
   regarding the treatment of this disease are still lacking. In order to
   identify a novel potent inhibitor, we performed blind docking studies on
   the main virus protease M-pro with eight approved drugs belonging to
   four pharmacological classes such as: anti-malarial, anti-bacterial,
   anti-infective and anti-histamine. Among the eight studied compounds,
   Lymecycline and Mizolastine appear as potential inhibitors of this
   protease. When docked against M-pro crystal structure, these two
   compounds revealed a minimum binding energy of -8.87 and -8.71 kcal/mol
   with 168 and 256 binding modes detected in the binding substrate pocket,
   respectively. Further, to study the interaction mechanism and
   conformational dynamics of protein-ligand complexes, Molecular dynamic
   simulation and MM/PBSA binding free calculations were performed. Our
   results showed that both Lymecycline and Mizolastine bind in the active
   site. And exhibited good binding affinities towards target protein.
   Moreover, the ADMET analysis also indicated drug-likeness properties.
   Thus it is suggested that the identified compounds can inhibit
   Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Journal = {{EPL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of networks representing complex systems from the brain
   to social graphs have revealed their higher-order architecture, which
   can be described by aggregates of simplexes (triangles, tetrahedrons,
   and higher cliques). Current research aims at quantifying these hidden
   geometries by the algebraic topology methods and deep graph theory and
   understanding the dynamic processes on simplicial complexes. Here, we
   use the recently introduced model for geometrical self-assembly of
   cliques to grow nano-networks of triangles and study the field-driven
   spin reversal processes on them. With the antiferromagnetic interactions
   between the Ising spins attached to the nodes, this assembly ideally
   supports the geometric frustration, which is recognized as the origin of
   some new phenomena in condensed matter physics. In the dynamical model,
   a gradual switching from the pairwise to triangle-based interactions is
   controlled by a parameter. Thus, the spin frustration effects on each
   triangle give way to the mesoscopic ordering conditioned by a complex
   arrangement of triangles. We show how the balance between these
   interactions changes the shape of the hysteresis loop. Meanwhile, the
   fluctuations in the accompanying Barkhausen noise exhibit robust
   indicators of self-organized criticality, which is induced by the
   network geometry alone without any magnetic disorder. Copyright (C) 2021

   albidipennis in daily and life time scales, respectively. There were
   significant differences in all life history parameters between the two
   predators (p<0.01). The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was
   significantly higher in S. gilvifrons than O. albidipennis (0.1514 +/-
   0.0045 vs. 0.1010 +/- 0.0065 d(-1)). Daily prey consumption rate of
   female and male S. gilvifrons was 31.0\% and 63.0\% more than that of O.
   albidipennis. Moreover, life time prey consumption rate of adult S.
   gilvifrons was 2.7 and 3.2 folds more than O. albidipennis females and
   males respectively. Stethorus gilvifrons allocated more energy of its
   ingested food for reproduction than O. albidipennis. Results of the

   The HPV-AHEAD Study}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   This is the largest and most comprehensive assessment of the role of
   human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck cancer (HNC) in Italy, which
   is a region currently considered bearing a low burden of HPV-driven HNC.
   p16(INK4a), HPV-DNA, and HPV RNA biomarkers were used to assess the HPV
   status in head and neck cancer in a retrospective cohort of
   approximately 700 patients. In our study, HPV prevalence in
   oropharyngeal cancers was much higher than in oral and laryngeal
   cancers, and HPV positivity conferred better prognosis only in
   oropharyngeal cancers. Importantly, we have observed an increase of the
   prevalence of HPV positivity in oropharyngeal cancers in the most recent
   calendar periods, suggesting that this disease is increasing in Italy,
   as has happened before in other developed regions.
   Literature on the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck
   cancer (HNC) in Italy is limited, especially for non-oropharyngeal
   tumours. Within the context of the HPV-AHEAD study, we aimed to assess
   the prognostic value of different tests or test algorithms judging HPV
   carcinogenicity in HNC and factors related to HPV positivity at the
   European Institute of Oncology. We conducted a retrospective cohort
   study (2000-2010) on a total of 696 primary HNC patients.
   Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer tissues were studied. All
   HPV-DNA-positive and a random sample of HPV-DNA-negative cases were
   subjected to HPV-E6{*}I mRNA detection and p16(INK4a) staining.
   Multivariate models were used to assess for factors associated with HPV
   positivity and proportional hazards for survival and recurrence. The
   percentage of HPV-driven cases (considering HPV-E6{*}I mRNA positivity)
   was 1.8, 2.2, and 40.4\% for oral cavity (OC), laryngeal (LC), and
   oropharyngeal (OPC) cases, respectively. The estimates were similar for
   HPV-DNA/p16(INK4a) double positivity. Being a non-smoker or former
   smoker or diagnosed at more recent calendar periods were associated with
   HPV-E6{*}I mRNA positivity only in OPC. Being younger was associated
   with HPV-E6{*}I mRNA positivity in LC. HPV-driven OPC, but not
   HPV-driven OC and LC, showed better 5 year overall and disease-free
   survival. Our data show that HPV prevalence in OPC was much higher than
   in OC and LC and observed to increase in most recent years. Moreover,
   HPV positivity conferred better prognosis only in OPC. Novel insights on
   the role of HPV in HNC in Italy are provided, with possible implications
   in the clinical management of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of cognitive dysfunctions and anxiety and mood disorders
   has been shown to be higher in migraine patients. Nitric Oxide (NO) is a
   significant neurotransmitter in the pathophysiology of migraine, anxiety
   and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the present study was
   conducted to evaluate the role of NO system in migraine-induced memory
   impairment and anxiety like behaviors. Nitroglycerin (NTG) was
   administered to the animals as an animal model of migraine and
   pretreatment with L-Arginine, L-NAME and saline were implemented to
   evaluate the role of NO system in possible cognitive impairments in
   animal model of migraine. Avoidance learning and memory performance,
   object recognition memory, anxiety-like behavior and motor activity were
   assessed using a shuttle box apparatus, novel object recognition,
   elevated plus-maze, and open field tests respectively. The data showed
   that the injection of nitroglycerin disturbs learning and memory and
   elicit anxiety like behavior in the animals. L-NAME administration
   suppressed the observed effect of nitroglycerin on memory and anxiety.
   Overall, the results indicated that nitric oxide system is implicated in
   memory impairments and anxiety like behavior in an animal model of
   migraine.}},

Abstract = {{The N-glycoforms of glycoproteins modify protein function and control a
   number of biological pathways. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the correlation between alterations in N-glycans and cancer
   aggressiveness in terms of cancer cell invasion ability. The expression
   of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and
   N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) in liver cancer cell lines was
   analyzed by western blotting. Cell invasiveness was analyzed by Matrigel
   invasion assays. uPA and GnT-V expression in liver cancer cell lines was
   knocked down by RNA interference. Furthermore, uPA was overexpressed in
   liver cancer cells using lentiviral vectors, and a mutant strain of
   HepG2 cells overexpressing uPA deficient in N-glycans was established. A
   glycoblotting-assisted matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry-based
   quantitative analysis of liver cancer cell lines was performed, in which
   invasiveness was altered by modifying the expression of uPA and GnT-V.
   N-glycan profiles were found to differ between the highly invasive liver
   cancer cell line HLE and the less invasive cell line HepG2. The
   expression of several N-glycans, including a form with m/z=1892, was
   changed according to invasiveness controlled by knockdown and
   overexpression of uPA. The invasiveness of HepG2 cells with mutant uPA
   did not increase regardless of the level of expression of uPA. Following
   GnT-V knockdown and N-glycan alteration, uPA expression did not change,
   whereas cell invasiveness decreased. One N-glycan (m/z=1892) was common
   among N-glycans in the comparative analysis between HLE and HepG2, HLE
   and uPA knockdown HLE, HepG2 and uPA-overexpressing HepG2, and HLE and
   GnT-V knockdown HLE cells and among N-glycan profiles in human uPA.
   Therefore, N-glycosylation is an important factor controlling
   invasiveness of liver cancer cells, and a specific N-glycan (m/z=1892)
   associated with the invasion of liver cancer cells via uPA was
   identified in the present study.}},

Title = {{Effects of Neurotrophin-3 on Intrinsic Neuronal Properties at a Central
   Auditory Structure}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE INSIGHTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Neurotrophins, a class of growth factor proteins that control neuronal
   proliferation, morphology, and apoptosis, are found ubiquitously
   throughout the nervous system. One particular neurotrophin (NT-3) and
   its cognate tyrosine receptor kinase (TrkC) have recently received
   attention as a possible therapeutic target for synaptopathic
   sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, research shows that NT-3-TrkC
   signaling plays a role in establishing the sensory organization of
   frequency topology (ie, tonotopic order) in the cochlea of the
   peripheral inner ear. However, the neurotrophic effects of NT-3 on
   central auditory properties are unclear. In this study we examined
   whether NT-3-TrkC signaling affects the intrinsic electrophysiological
   properties at a first-order central auditory structure in chicken, known
   as nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Here, the expression pattern of
   specific neurotrophins is well known and tightly regulated. By using
   whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we show that NT-3 application
   to brainstem slices does not affect intrinsic properties of
   high-frequency neuronal regions but had robust effects for low-frequency
   neurons, altering voltage-dependent potassium functions, action
   potential repolarization kinetics, and passive membrane properties. We
   suggest that NT-3 may contribute to the precise establishment and
   organization of tonotopy in the central auditory pathway by playing a
   specialized role in regulating the development of intrinsic neuronal
   properties of low-frequency NM neurons.}},

   relation to differentially expressed serum proteins using
   two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) approach-in high fat diet (HFC)
   fed C57BL6 mice.
   The HFC group exhibited a significant increase in body weight, insulin
   level and lipid profile. The ELISA and Western blot analysis of serum
   proteins of HFC group also exhibited increased level of inflammatory
   markers (TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and interleukin-1 beta), tissue
   transcription factors (SREBP-2 \& PPAR gamma) and were validated by gene
   expression and immunohistochemistry. However, the treatment with WBA 1
   and 2\% significantly lessened lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 cells. Reduced
   insulin level, down-regulated transcription factors and associated
   inflammatory cytokines by activating AMPK in HFC-fed mice. Furthermore,
   WBA treatment directly reversed differentially expressed recombinant
   proteins of KCTD family and Zinc finger protein 236 isoform.
   Bioactive fraction of WBA had beneficial effect on ameliorating obesity
   related complications mainly through phosphorylation of AMPK and
   inflammatory cytokines which was authenticated by proteomic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The pathological significance of amyloid-beta(1-42) (A beta(1-42))
   dynamics is poorly understood in the brain extracellular compartment.
   Here we test which of the concentration or the retention is critical for
   A beta(1-42) toxicity after injection of equal dose into dentate granule
   cell layer of freely moving rats. The toxicity of A beta(1-42) (25 mu M)
   was compared between injections at the rate of 0.25 mu L/min for 4 min
   (fast injection) and 0.025 mu L/min for 40 min (slow injection). Dentate
   gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP) was affected 1 and 2 h after the fast
   injection, but not 4 h. In contrast, LTP was affected even 72 h after
   the slow injection. A beta(1-42) staining 5 min after finish of the slow
   injection was more intense in the dentate granule cell layer than of the
   fast injection. The present study indicates that the retention of A
   beta(1-42) in the extracellular fluid is correlated with neuronal A
   beta(1-42) uptake and plays a key role in A beta(1-42) neurotoxicity. In
   the extracellular fluid of the dentate gyrus, the retention period of A
   beta(1-42) is much more critical for A beta(1-42) toxicity than A
   beta(1-42) concentration. It is likely that A beta(1-42) toxicity is
   accelerated by the disturbance of A beta(1-42) metabolism in the dentate
   gyrus.}},

Abstract = {{Dystonia secondary to cerebral infarcts presents months to years after
   the initial insult, is usually unilateral and causes significant
   morbidity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus
   (GPi) is established as the most frequent target in the management of
   the dystonic symptoms. We report our experience with subthalamic nucleus
   (STN) DBS in 3 patients with post-infarct dystonia, in whom GPi DBS was
   not confidently possible due to the presence of striatal infarcts. Two
   patients had unilateral STN DBS implantation, whereas the third patient
   had bilateral STN DBS implantation for bilateral dystonic symptoms.
   Prospectively collected preoperative and postoperative functional
   assessment data including imaging, medication and neuropsychology
   evaluations were analyzed with regard to symptom improvement. Median
   follow-up period was 38.3 months (range 26-43 months). All patients had
   clinically valuable improvements in dystonic symptoms and pain control
   despite variable improvements in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating
   scores. In our series, we have demonstrated that STN DBS could be an
   alternative in the management of post-infarct dystonia in patients with
   abnormal striatal anatomy which precludes GPi DBS. A multidisciplinary
   team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) compromises bone
   health purportedly due to lower levels of physical activity. The
   potential of an exercise intervention to improve bone health parameters
   in adolescents with DCD has not previously been studied. This study thus
   aimed to determine the impact of a multi modal exercise intervention on
   bone health in this population at-risk of secondary osteoporosis.
   Methods: Twenty-eight adolescents (17 male, 11 female) aged between
   12-17 years (M-age=14.1) with DCD participated in a twice weekly,
   13-week generalised multimodal exercise intervention. Peripheral
   quantitative computed tomography scans of the tibia (4\% and 66\%) were
   performed over a six month period. Generalised estimating equations were
   used to examine the impact of fitness measures on bone parameters over
   time. Results: An overall improvement trend was observed for bone
   health, with significant increases at the 66\% tibial site for bone mass
   (4.12\% increase, d(cohen)=0.23, p=0.010) and cortical area (5.42\%
   increase, eta(2)=12.09, p=0.014). Lower body fitness measures were
   significantly associated with improvements in bone health parameters,
   tempered by the degree of motor impairment. Conclusion: A multimodal
   exercise intervention may be effective in improving bone health of
   adolescents with DCD. Given the impact of motor impairments, gains may
   be greater over an extended period of study.}},

Abstract = {{Phenylalanine levels are associated with pulmonary hypertension in
   metabolic profiling clinical studies. However, the pathophysiological
   role of phenylalanine on pulmonary circulation is still unclear. We
   experimentally addressed the direct impact of phenylalanine on pulmonary
   circulation in rats and explored the underlying molecular pathway.
   Phenylalanine was injected intraperitoneally into Sprague-Dawley rats
   (400 mg/100 g body wt) as a single dose or daily in a chronic manner for
   2, 3, and 4 wk. Chronic injection of phenylalanine induced pulmonary
   hypertension with time-dependent severity, evidenced by elevated
   pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance as well as
   pulmonary artery and right ventricular hypertrophy. Using tandem mass
   spectrometry analysis, we found a quick twofold increase in blood level
   of phenylalanine 2 h following injection. This increase led to a
   significant accumulation of phenylalanine in lung after 4 h, which
   remained sustained at up to a threefold increase after 4 wk. In
   addition, a cellular thermal shift assay with lung tissues from
   phenylalanine-injected rats revealed the binding of phenylalanine to the
   calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). In vitro experiments with cultured
   pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells showed that phenylalanine
   activated CaSR, as indicated by an increase in intracellular calcium
   content, which was attenuated or diminished by the inhibition or
   knockdown of CaSR. Finally, the global knockout or lung-specific
   knockdown of CaSR significantly attenuated phenylalanine-induced
   pulmonary hypertension. Chronic phenylalanine injection induces
   pulmonary hypertension through binding to CaSR and its subsequent
   activation. Here, we demonstrate a pathophysiological role of
   phenylalanine in pulmonary hypertension through the CaSR. This study
   provides a novel animal model for pulmonary hypertension and reveals a
   potentially clinically significant role for this metabolite in human
   pulmonary hypertension as a marker, a mediator of disease, and a
   possible therapeutic target.}},

Abstract = {{The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), proposed as a future
   Higgs boson factory, will operate at a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV
   and will accumulate 5.6 ab(-1) of integrated luminosity in 7 years. In
   this study, we estimate the upper limit of BR(H -> inv) for three
   independent channels, including two leptonic channels and one hadronic
   channel, at the CEPC. Based on the full simulation analysis, the upper
   limit of BR(H -> inv) could reach 0.26\% at the 95\% confidence level.
   In the Stand Model (SM), the Higgs boson can only decay invisibly via H
   -> ZZ{*} -> v (v) over barv (v) over bar, so any evidence of invisible
   via Higgs decays that exceed BR(H -> inv) of the SM will indicate a
   phenomenon that is beyond the SM (BSM). The invariant mass resolution of
   the visible hadronic decay system ZH(Z -> qq, H -> inv) is simulated,
   and the physics requirement at the CEPC detector for reaching this is
   given.}},

   indirect restoration method, and CAD/CAM, and bovine enamel (substrate
   specimen). As a result, there was a difference in wear volume between
   resin-based composite and bovine enamel depending on the fabrication
   method. Resin composite used for indirect restoration method showed more
   wear in both the abrader and substrate specimens. Resin composite used
   for CAD/CAM crowns showed greater wear volume in the abrader specimen.
   In conclusion, results clarified that fabrication method of restorative

Abstract = {{Objective: The study objective was to investigate the progression of
   uncorrected mild aortic insufficiency and its impact on survival and
   functional status after left ventricular assist device implantation.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 694 consecutive patients who
   underwent implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist
   device between January 2006 and March 2018. Pre-left ventricular assist
   device transthoracic echocardiography identified 111 patients with mild
   aortic insufficiency and 493 patients with trace or no aortic
   insufficiency. To adjust for differences in preoperative factors,
   propensity score matching was used, resulting in 101 matched patients in
   each of the mild aortic insufficiency and no aortic insufficiency
   groups.
   Results: Although both groups showed similar survival (P = .58), the
   mild aortic insufficiency group experienced higher incidence of
   readmission caused by heart failure (hazard ratio, 2.62; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.42-4.69; P<.01). By using the mixed effect model, pre-left
   ventricular assist device mild aortic insufficiency was a significant
   risk factor for both moderate or greater aortic insufficiency and
   worsening New York Heart Association functional status (P<.01).
   Conclusions: Patients with uncorrected mild aortic insufficiency had a
   higher risk of progression to moderate or greater aortic insufficiency
   after left ventricular assist device implantation with worse functional
   status and higher incidence of readmission caused by heart failure
   compared with patients without aortic insufficiency. Further
   investigations into the safety and efficacy of concomitant aortic valve
   procedures for mild aortic insufficiency at the time of left ventricular
   assist device implant are warranted to improve patients' quality of
   life, considering the longer left ventricular assist device use as
   destination therapy and bridge to transplant with the new US heart
   allocation system.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Pneumonia is a frequent cause of hospitalization among
   nursing home (NH) residents, but little information is available as to
   how clinical presentation and other characteristics relate to
   hospitalization, and the differential use of antimicrobials based on
   hospitalization status. This study examined how hospitalized and
   nonhospitalized NH residents with pneumonia differ.
   Design: Data from a 2-year prospective study of residents who
   participated in a randomized controlled trial. Setting and Participants:
   All residents from 14 NHs in North Carolina followed for pneumonia over
   a 2year period.
   Methods: Clinical features, antimicrobial treatment, hospitalization,
   and demographic data on residents with a pneumonia diagnosis were
   abstracted from charts; NH information was obtained from NH
   administrators.
   Results: A total of 509 pneumonia episodes were reported for 395 unique
   residents; the incidence was not higher in the winter months, and 28\%
   were hospitalized. The likelihood of hospitalization did not differ by
   clinical characteristics except that residents with a respiratory rate
   >25 breaths per minute were more likely to be hospitalized. Being on
   hospice {[}odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-7.4]
   and not having dementia (OR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.2) also related to
   increased likelihood of hospitalization. Fluoroquinolone (usually
   levofloxacin) monotherapy was the most common treatment (54\%) in both
   settings, and ceftriaxone monotherapy varied by hospitalization status
   (7\% of hospitalized vs 16\% treated on-site). Approximately 36\% of
   nonhospitalized residents received antimicrobials for more than 7 days.
   Conclusions/Implications: Respiratory rate is associated with
   hospitalization but was not documented for more than a quarter of
   residents, suggesting the clinical benefit of more consistently
   conducting this assessment. Differential hospitalization rates for
   persons with dementia and on hospice suggest that care is being tailored
   to individuals' wishes, but this assumption merits study, as does use of
   fluoroquinolones (due to side effects) and treatment duration (due to
   potential contribution to antibiotic resistance). (C) 2020 AMDA - The

   Methods: Between December 2013 and July 2015, 100 patients who presented
   consecutively with ABC in a tertiary institution in Singapore were
   recruited to participate in an interviewer-led questionnaire exploring
   psychosocial and economic issues.
   Results: Among the 100 patients, 63 and 37 presented with stages 3 and 4
   breast cancer respectively. Median age was 57 (27-86), 52\% had at least
   secondary education, 53\% had no formal employment and 71\% were
   married; 88\% were aware of breast cancer symptoms, 82\% were aware that
   mammography can help detect cancer, 82\% believed that current treatment
   modality for breast cancer is effective, 96\% had never undergone a
   mammography and 52.9\% felt mammograms were unnecessary. A total of 64\%
   presented symptomatic from the breast tumour, with a median duration of
   3 months. Many of the patients were aware of breast cancer symptoms and
   the utility of mammography. However, a group of patients did not comply
   with screening. This may be due to poor understanding about breast
   screening and detection in its asymptomatic phase.
   Conclusion: Further public education to improve understanding of breast
   cancer and screening mammography may help to improve rates for earlier
   detection of breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum/copper dissimilar joints are widely used in electronics, the
   automobile industry, and battery manufacturing. Ultrasonic spot welding
   (USW), as a quality, efficient, clean, and low-consumption solid phase
   bonding (SPB) technology, is applicable for the connections of
   aluminum/copper and other highly conductive and heat-conducting
   materials. At present, this technique has been applied by automobile
   producers and lithium battery manufacturers at home and abroad. In this
   work, the optimal performance of the ultrasonic welding process of
   aluminum/copper dissimilar joints was studied. Based on a single-factor
   test on how welding parameters (lap mode, welding pressure, welding
   amplitude, and welding energy) influence the quality of welding joints,
   the lap mode of aluminum plates on the top and copper plates on the
   bottom (Al/Cu) was deemed better than that of copper plates on the top
   and aluminum plates on the bottom (Cu/Al) under the same optimal
   parameters (40 psi, 45 mu m, and 500 J). With this group of parameters,
   the Al/Cu joint formed a cladding mechanical occlusion. The element had
   a diffusion layer of 2 mu m and a joint specimen maximum failure load of
   605 N.}},

Abstract = {{Promoting patient safety culture (PSC) is a critical issue for
   healthcare providers. Quality control circles program (QCCP) can be used
   as an effective tool to foster long-lasting improvements on the quality
   of medical institution. The effect of QCCP on PSC is still unknown. This
   was a retrospective study conducted with matching data. A safety
   attitudes questionnaire (SAQ) was used for the evaluation of PSC. The
   association between all scores of six subscales of SAQ and the
   participation QCCP were analyzed with both the Mann-Whitney and
   Kruskal-Wallis tests. A total of 2718 valid questionnaires were
   collected. Most participants of QCCP were females (78.9\%), nurses
   (52.6\%), non-supervisors (92.2\%), aged <40 years old (64.8\%), degree
   of specialist or university graduates (78\%), and with work experience
   of <10 years (61.6\%). Of all participants, the highest scores were in
   the dimension of safety climate (74.11 +/- 17.91) and the lowest scores
   in the dimension of working conditions (68.90 +/- 18.84). The
   participation of QCCP was associated with higher scores in four
   dimensions, namely: teamwork climate (p = 0.006), safety climate (p =
   0.037), perception of management (p = 0.009), and working conditions (p
   = 0.015). The participation or not of QCCP had similar results in the
   dimension of job satisfaction and stress recognition. QCCP was
   associated with SAQ in subjects with the following characteristics:
   female, nurse, non-supervisor, aged >50 years old, higher education
   degrees and with longer working experiences in the hospital. In this
   first study on the association between each dimension of SAQ and the
   implementation of QCCP, we found that QCCP interventions were associated
   with better PSC. QCCP had no benefits in the dimensions of job
   satisfaction and stress recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive malignancy and is often
   resistant to currently available therapies. Inhibition of ribonucleotide
   reductase small subunit M2 (RRM2) in tumors is speculated to mediate
   chemosensitization. Previous studies have reported that Osalmid could
   act as an RRM2 inhibitor. We explored whether RRM2 was involved in
   radioresistance and the antitumor effects of Osalmid in EC.
   Methods and Materials: RRM2 expression was detected by
   immunohistochemistry in EC tissues. The effects of Osalmid on cell
   proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle were assessed using
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphhenyl tetrazolium, colony
   formation, and flow cytometry assays. DNA damage, cell apoptosis, and
   senescence induced by Osalmid or ionizing radiation (IR) alone, or both,
   were detected with immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blot, and
   beta-galactosidase staining. A xenograft mouse model of EC was used to
   investigate the potential synergistic effects of Osalmid and IR in vivo.
   Results: The expression of RRM2 in treatment-resistant EC tissues is
   much higher than in treatment-sensitive EC, and strong staining of RRM2
   was correlated with shorter overall survival. We observed direct
   cytotoxicity of Osalmid in EC cells. Osalmid also produced inhibition of
   the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway and substantially enhanced
   IR-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and senescence. Furthermore, treatment
   with Osalmid and IR significantly suppressed tumor growth in xenograft
   EC models without additional toxicity to the hematologic system and
   internal organs.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that RRM2 played a vital role in
   radioresistance in EC, and Osalmid synergized with IR to exert its
   antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as a pandemic by the
   World Health Organization (WHO). It was initially detected in Wuhan,
   China and spread to other cities of China and all countries. It has
   caused many deaths and the number of infections became greater than 18
   million as of 5 August 2020. This study aimed to analyze the situation
   of COVID-19 in Thailand and the challenging disease control by employing
   a dynamic model to determine prevention approaches. We employed a
   statistical technique to analyze the ambient temperature influencing the
   cases. We found that temperature was significantly associated with daily
   infected cases (p-value < 0.01). The SEIR (Susceptible Exposed
   Infectious and Recovered) dynamic approach and moving average estimation
   were used to forecast the daily infected and cumulative cases until 16
   June as a base run analysis using STELLA dynamic software and
   statistical techniques. The movement of people, both in relation to
   local (Thai people) and foreign travel (both Thai and tourists), played
   a significant role in the spread of COVID19 in Thailand. Enforcing a
   state of emergency and regulating social distancing were the key factors
   in reducing the growth rate of the disease. The SEIR model reliably
   predicted the actual infected cases, with a root mean square error
   (RMSE) of 12.8. In case of moving average approach, RMSE values were
   0.21, 0.21, and 0.35 for two, three and five days, respectively. The
   previous records were used as input for prediction that caused lower
   values of RMSE. Two-days and three-days moving averages gave the better
   results than SEIR model. The SEIR model is suitable for longer period
   prediction, whereas the moving average approach is suitable for short
   term prediction. The implementation of interventions, such as
   governmental regulation and restrictions, through collaboration among
   various sectors was the key factor for controlling the spreading of
   COVID-19 in Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Image-guided breast biopsy of a res dual imaging abnormality
   or tumor bed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is increasingly used
   to assess residual cancer, facilitate risk-adaptive surgery, and
   potentially identify exceptional responders in whom local therapy may be
   de-escalated.
   OBJECTIVE To further assess the accuracy of post-NACT image-guided
   biopsy to predict residual cancer in the breast.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This diagnostic study analyzed
   multicenter patient-level data of patients with breast cancer who were
   treated with NACT and underwent image-guided biopsy before surgery at
   Royal Marsden Hospital in London, UK; Seoul National University Hospital
   in Seoul, South Korea; and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.
   Data were analyzed from June to July 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnostic accuracy of post-NACT image-guided
   biopsy. Final surgical pathology was used as reference standard.
   RESULTS Data from 166 women were analyzed. The median (range) age was 49
   (25-76) years. The median (range) tumor size on pretreatment and
   posttreatment imaging was 33.5 (12-100) mm and 10 (0-100) mm,
   respectively. The overall pathologic complete response rate was 51.2\%
   (n = 85) (16.1\% {[}5 of 31] for hormone receptor-positive/ERBB2
   (formerly HER2)-negative; 44.7\% {[}21 of 47] for hormone
   receptor-positive/ERBB2-positive; 69\% {[}20 of 29] for hormone
   receptor-negative/ERBB2-positive; and 66.1\% {[}39 of 59] for triple
   negative). The majority (143 {[}86.1\%]) underwent image-guided
   vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB), and 23 had core-cut biopsy. The median
   (range) needle gauge was 10 (7-14), and the median (range) number of
   samples was 6 (2-18). When image-guided biopsy (VAB and core-cut biopsy)
   was representative (159 {[}95.8\%]), the false -negative rate across the
   whole cohort was 18.7\% (95\% CI, 10.6\%-29.3\%). Subgroup analysis of
   patients with a complete/partial clinical response and residual imaging
   abnormality of 2 cm or smaller with at least 6 VABs taken (76
   {[}45.8\%]) demonstrated a false -negative rate of 3.2\% (95\% CI,
   0.1\%-16.7\%), a negative predictive value of 97.4\% (95\% CI,
   86.5\%-99.9\%), and an overall accuracy of 89.5\% (95\% CI,
   80.3\%-95.3\%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This large multicenter pooled data analyis is
   suggests that a standardized protocol using image-guided VAB of a tumor
   bed measuring 2 cm or smaller with 6 or more representative samples
   allows reliable prediction of residual disease. These results could
   inform the design of de-escalation trials in NACT exceptional responders
   testing the safety of eliminating surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an isolated type of
   lymphoma of the central nervous system and has a dismal prognosis
   despite intensive chemotherapy. Recent genomic analyses have identified
   highly recurrent mutations of MYD88 and CD79B in immunocompetent PCNSL,
   whereas LMP1 activation is commonly observed in Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV)-positive PCNSL. However, a lack of clinically representative
   preclinical models has hampered our understanding of the pathogenic
   mechanisms by which genetic aberrations drive PCNSL disease phenotypes.
   Here, we establish a panel of 12 orthotopic, patient-derived xenograft
   (PDX) models from both immunocompetent and EBV-positive PCNSL and
   secondary CNSL biopsy specimens. PDXs faithfully retained their
   phenotypic, metabolic, and genetic features, with 100\% concordance of
   MYD88 and CD79B mutations present in PCNSL in immunocompetent patients.
   These models revealed a convergent functional dependency upon a
   deregulated RelA/p65-hexokinase 2 signaling axis, codriven by either
   mutated MYD88/ CD79B or LMP1 with Pin1 overactivation in immunocompetent
   PCNSL and EBV-positive PCNSL, respectively. Notably, distinct molecular
   alterations used by immunocompetent and EBV-positive PCNSL converged to
   deregulate RelA/p65 expression and to drive glycolysis, which is
   critical for intracerebral tumor progression and FDG-PET imaging
   characteristics. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of this key
   signaling axis potently suppressed PCNSL growth in vitro and in vivo.
   These patient-derived models offer a platform for predicting clinical
   chemotherapeutics efficacy and provide critical insights into PCNSL
   pathogenic mechanisms, accelerating therapeutic discovery for this
   aggressive disease.
   Significance: A set of clinically relevant CNSL xenografts identifies a
   hyperactive RelA/p65-hexokinase 2 signaling axis as a driver of
   progression and potential therapeutic target for treatment and provides
   a foundational preclinical platform.}},

Abstract = {{A performance enhancement model for multi-state renewable energy systems
   is introduced and developed in this paper. This model's objective is to
   provide a maintenance decision support, taking into account units'
   degradations and system interdependencies. Performance enhancement
   actions consider both preventive and corrective strategies and the
   model's thresholds are based on units' performance. The Universal
   Generating Function was used to assess unit performance, dependence and
   degradation. A case study is provided based on a simple series-parallel
   wind energy multi-state system, and the results show how this decision
   support model can be cost effective and enhance the global performance
   of the system. Afterwards, importance measure analysis was used to
   assess the performance thresholds of this model. (C) 2020 TheAuthors.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Like other surveys, time use surveys are facing declining response
   rates. At the same time paper-and-pencil surveys are increasingly
   replaced by online surveys. Both the declining response rates and the
   shift to online research are expected to have an impact on the
   representativeness of survey data questioning whether they are still the
   most suitable instrument to obtain a reliable view on the organization
   of daily life. This contribution examines the representativeness of a
   self-administered online time use survey using Belgian data collected in
   2013 and 2014. The design of the study was deliberately chosen to test
   the automated processes that replace interviewer support and its
   cost-efficiency. We use weighting coefficients, a life table and
   discrete-time survival analyses to better understand the timing and
   selectivity of dropout, with a focus on the effects of individual time
   use patterns and the survey design. The results show that there are
   three major hurdles that cause large groups of respondents to drop out.
   This dropout is selective, and this selectivity differs according to the
   dropout moment. The contribution aims to provide a better insight in
   dropout during the fieldwork and tries to contribute to the further
   improvement of survey methodology of online time use surveys.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Individual magnetic wax spheres with specific gravities of 1.006, 1.054
   and 1.152 were released from rest on a smooth wall in water at friction
   Reynolds numbers, Re-tau = 680 and 1320 (sphere diameters d(+) = 58 and
   122 viscous units, respectively). Three-dimensional tracking was
   conducted to understand the effects of turbulence and wall friction on
   sphere motions. Spheres subjected to sufficient mean shear initially
   lifted off of the wall before descending back towards it. These lifting
   spheres translated with the fluid above the wall, undergoing saltation
   or resuspension, with minimal rotations about any axis. By contrast,
   spheres that did not lift off upon release mainly slid along the wall.
   These denser spheres lagged the fluid more significantly due to greater
   wall friction. As they slid downstream, they began to roll forward after
   which small repeated lift-off events occurred. These spheres also
   rotated about both the streamwise and wall-normal axes. In all cases,
   the sphere trajectories were limited to the buffer and logarithmic
   regions, and all wall collisions were completely inelastic. In the plane
   parallel to the wall, the spheres migrated in the spanwise direction
   about 12\% of the streamwise distance traveled suggesting that spanwise
   forces are important. Variations in sphere kinematics in individual runs
   were likely induced by high and low momentum zones in the boundary
   layer, vortex shedding in the sphere wakes, and wall friction. The
   repeated lift-offs of the forward rolling denser spheres were attributed
   to a Magnus lift. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A tablet microstructure, especially the porosity, is a crucial parameter
   that influences the mechanical properties. Herein, tablet subdivisions
   were studied as a function of tablet porosity. The tablets were
   manufactured in the presence of different diluents, namely
   microcrystalline cellulose, Ludipress (R), or lactose monohydrate.
   Furthermore, the addition of Camphor was investigated, which was
   thereafter sublimated with a view of obtaining tablets having varying
   degrees of porosity. Microstructural assays were correlated to the
   subdivision performance. The increase in porosity reduced the hardness
   and increased the tablet friability, adversely impacting the
   subdivision. For all the excipients, an increase in relative porosity
   >90\% represented the threshold level from which an inadequate
   subdivision occurred. The increase in tablet porosity led to a reduction
   in mechanical resistance, which, combined with a heterogeneous and
   discontinuous distribution of pores within the matrix, resulted in poor
   subdivision results. Controlling tablet porosity is an important
   consideration when designing tablets having a subdivision purpose. (C)

   between 0.25 and 0.75\%, and calcium chloride, 0-1.0\%, in the formation

   encapsulation efficiency (>99\%) was not affected by these factors. The
   PECs exhibited a gel-like behavior, consistent with the formation of
   chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA) complexes. Complex formation and
   AO encapsulation were also confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and
   thermogravimetric analyses. AO and the optimized PEC (0.5\% AO and 0.5\%

Abstract = {{Infrared thermography (IRT) has become a commonly applied
   non-destructive testing method for assessing building envelopes. Like
   any diagnosis tool, IRT requires an appropriate experience and principle
   understanding, mainly when the method is used for quantitative analyses.
   The challenges of the IRT often deal with the dynamic properties of
   building partitions. Climatic conditions have a certain variability, and
   the accumulated energy storage in the building components can affect
   their temperature as well as the calculated thermal performance. This
   paper aims to analyze how stationary and dynamic regimes of a
   quantitative IRT test could impact the measured thermal transmittance of
   heavy multi-leaf walls. Investigation in two European countries with
   different climatic conditions are reported. In this way, it is discussed
   which boundary conditions should be guaranteed to provide reliable
   information about a building envelope using quantitative IRT. In order
   to check the quality of the measurements, the heat flux meter (HFM)
   method was also implemented, following the ISO 9869. The research
   revealed that it could be possible to use short-lasting tests in the
   climatic conditions of Southern Europe, while long-term tests should be
   implemented in Northern European countries where climatic conditions are
   less regular.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to ascertain whether happiness varies
   depending on sports participation and religious practice. The sample
   comprised 2,378 participants aged between 18 and 92 years. All analysis
   were carried out by testing the interaction effects of the variables of
   sex and age on sports participation, religious practice, and happiness.
   We found a high average level of happiness (M = 7.299, range 0-10).
   However, people who do not participate in sports or practice a religion
   indicated a level of happiness (M = 6.979) that was statistically lower
   than that of the other groups: people who practice a religion but do not
   participate in sports (M = 7.135); people who participate in sports but
   do not practice a religion (M = 7.478); and people who both participate
   in sports and practice a religion (M = 7.717). We conclude that
   happiness is associated with sports participation and religious

Abstract = {{We report, in this study, the impact of gold nanoparticles on
   low-voltage operating GaN ultraviolet (UV) photodetector through
   parameters such as detectivity, responsivity, repeatability, stability,
   and photo-to-dark current ratios. These studies revealed prominent
   increases in detectivity and responsivity of the device due to Au
   nanoparticle application, thus allowing it to detect weaker signals and
   obtain higher on/off current ratios. After the application of different
   quantities of Au nanoparticles to the device surface, the investigated
   photoelectric properties were enhanced reaching a peak detectivity of
   1.09 x 10(11) Jones and a photo- to-dark current ratio of 486 at 2-V
   bias. Moreover, the photocurrent increased by two-fold (from 35.3 to
   70.6 nA) at a low bias of 0.5 V following the application of the Au
   nanoparticles to the device surface. The modified GaN photodetector with
   a remarkable detectivity offers solutions toward improving detectivity
   of UV photodetectors. In consequence, having established such prosperous
   properties under relatively low-voltage levels with this practical and
   cost-effective fabrication route provides a good approach toward a wide
   range of UVoptoelectronic devices. (c) 2020 Society of PhotoOptical

   a long time and took the necessary measures. Repair and maintenance of
   the waterlines, which had deteriorated over time, were closely dealt

   central treasury and/or the Egyptian treasury. Additional water sources
   were sought to eliminate the water shortages caused by population
   increases and drought; this was attempted with respect to the periodic

Abstract = {{In contemporary food production, an important role is given to the
   increase in the nutritional quality of foodstuff. In the bakery
   industry, one of the main cereals used is wheat flour (WF), which
   creates bread with proper sensory evaluation but is nutritionally poor.
   Soy-flour (SF) has increased nutrient content, and its consumption is
   recommended due to several health benefits. Dough fermentation with
   lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increases bread shelf life, improves flavor,
   and its nutritional quality, mostly due to its high organic acid
   production capability. In the present study, the addition of SF to WF,
   through fermentation with the cocultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and
   Lactobacillus casei was analyzed. Three different batches were performed
   by using WF supplemented with SF, as follows: batch A consisting of 90\%
   WF and 10\% SF; batch B-95\% WF and 5\% SF; batch C-100\% WF. The
   fermentation with these two LABs presented several positive effects,
   which, together with increased SF content, improved the dough's
   rheological and physicochemical characteristics. The dynamic rheological
   analysis exhibited a more stable elastic-like behavior in doughs
   supplemented with SF (G ` 4936.2 +/- 12.7, and G `' 2338.4 +/- 9.1).
   Organic acid production changes were the most significant, especially
   for the lactic, citric, and tartaric content.}},

Abstract = {{The Darcy-scale properties of reservoir rocks, such as capillary
   pressure and relative permeability, are controlled by multiphase flow
   properties at the pore scale. In the present paper, we implement a
   volume of fluid (VOF) method coupled with a physically based dynamic
   contact angle to perform pore-scale simulation of two-phase flow within
   a porous medium. The numerical model is based on the resolution of the
   Navier-Stokes equations as well as a phase fraction equation
   incorporating a dynamic contact angle model with wetting hysteresis
   effect. After the model is validated for a single phase, a two-phase
   flow simulation is performed on both a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian
   fluid; the latter consists of a polymer solution displaying a
   shear-thinning power law viscosity. To investigate the effects of
   contact angle hysteresis and the non-Newtonian nature of the fluid,
   simulations of both drainage and imbibition are carried out in order to
   analyze water and oil saturation-particularly critical parameters such
   as initial water saturation (Swi) and residual oil saturation (Sor) are
   assessed in terms of wettability. Additionally, the model sensitivities
   to the consistency factor (chi), the flow behavior index (n), and the
   advancing and receding contact angles are tested. Interestingly, the
   model correctly retrieves the variation in Sor and wettability and
   predicts behavior over a wide range of contact angles that are difficult
   to probe experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of irregularity and corruption was initiated in 1920 on
   Mehmet Rapp Zorbazzade, who served as the Mayor of Mugla between 1914

   of dismissal was made on the grounds that he had committed illegal acts.
   As the investigation was initiated when Zorbazzade organized the

   organized in Izmir and Nazilli and supported the National Struggle; it
   gave rise to the suspicion that the real aim was to prevent him from.

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
   originated in Wuhan, China, in 2019, is responsible for the COVID-19
   pandemic. It is now accepted that the wild fauna, probably bats,
   constitute the initial reservoir of the virus, but little is known about
   the role pets can play in the spread of the disease in human
   communities, knowing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect some domestic
   animals. In this cross-sectional study, we tested the antibody response
   in a cluster of 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close
   contact with their owners (belonging to a veterinary community of 20
   students) in which two students tested positive for COVID-19 and several
   others (n = 11/18) consecutively showed clinical signs (fever, cough,
   anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets
   presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no
   antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood one month
   after the index case was reported, using an immunoprecipitation assay.
   These original data can serve a better evaluation of the host range of
   SARS-CoV-2 in natural environment exposure conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this research a new analytical solution is used for finding the
   buckling loads of rectangular plates with rotationally restrained edges.
   Until now, analytical solution were available only for a small number of
   specific combinations of boundary conditions. The solution method in
   this study is based on the development of a static solution for a plate.
   The solution is obtained in series form, and the coefficients are solved
   to match the edge conditions. The solution fits all the combinations of
   possible boundary conditions, of the deflection, slope, shear force and
   bending moment along the edges of the plate. The problem of buckling of
   part of an open cross section with a free edge is solved analytically.
   Any number of edges, from one to four, with rotational stiffening
   springs can be solved. Using this new method, the exact buckling loads
   and modes are found. The results are verified with published data, and
   many new cases are presented for uni-axially and bi-axially loaded
   plates.}},

Title = {{Enhanced electrochemical decontamination and water permeation of
   titanium suboxide reactive electrochemical membrane based on
   sonoelectrochemistry}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{69}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) allows electrochemical oxidation
   (EO) water purification under flow-through operation, which improves
   mass transfer on the anode surface significantly. However, O-2 evolution
   reaction (OER) may cause oxygen bubbles to be trapped in small-sized
   confined flow channels, and thus degrade long-term filterability and
   treatability of REM. In this study, ultrasound (ultrasonic vibrator, 28
   kHz, 180 W) was applied to EO system (i. e. sonoelectrochemistry)
   containing titanium suboxide-REM (TiSO-REM) anode for enhanced oxidation
   of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) target pollutant. Both experimental and
   modeling results demonstrated that ultrasound could mitigate the
   retention of O-2 bubbles in the porous structures by destructing
   large-size bubbles, thus not only increasing permeate flux but also
   promoting local mass transfer. Meanwhile, oxidation rate of 4-CP for EO
   with ultrasound (EO-US, 0.0932 min(-1)) was 216\% higher than that for
   EO without ultrasound (0.0258 min(-1)), due to enhanced mass transfer
   and center dot OH production under the cavitation effect of ultrasound.
   Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the most
   efficient pathway of 4-CP removal to be direct electron transfer of 4-CP
   to form {[}4-CP](center dot+), followed by subsequent oxidation mediated
   by center dot OH produced from anodic water oxidation on TiSO-REM anode.
   Last, the stability of TiSO-REM could be improved considerably by
   application of ultrasound, due to alleviation of electrode deactivation
   and fouling, indicated by cyclic test, scan electron microscopy (SEM)
   observation and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
   characterization. This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration
   of ultrasound for enhanced EO of recalcitrant organic pollutants by REM
   anode, making decentralized wastewater treatment more efficient and more
   reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperthermia (HT) treatment is a noninvasive cancer therapy, often used
   with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Compared with 37 degrees C, 42
   degrees C is mild heat stress for cells and produces reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) from mitochondria. To involve subsequent intracellular
   accumulation of DOX, we have previously reported that the expression of
   ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), an exporter of
   doxorubicin (DOX), was suppressed by a larger amount of intracellular
   mitochondrial ROS. We then hypothesized that the additive effect of HT
   and chemotherapy would be induced by the downregulation of ABCG2
   expression via intracellular ROS increase. We used human breast cancer
   cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453, incubated at 37 degrees C or 42
   degrees C for 1 h to clarify this hypothesis. Intracellular ROS
   production after HT was detected via electron spin resonance (ESR), and
   DOX cytotoxicity was calculated. Additionally, ABCG2 expression in whole
   cells was analyzed using Western blotting. We confirmed that the ESR
   signal peak with HT became higher than that without HT, indicating that
   the intracellular ROS level was increased by HT. ABCG2 expression was
   downregulated by HT, and cells were injured after DOX treatment. DOX
   cytotoxicity enhancement with HT was considered a result of ABCG2
   expression downregulation via the increase of ROS production. HT
   increased intracellular ROS production and downregulated ABCG2 protein
   expression, leading to cell damage enhancement via DOX.}},

Abstract = {{Background Complete childhood vaccination remains poor in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, despite major improvement in childhood vaccination coverage
   worldwide. Globally, an estimated 2.5 million children die annually from
   vaccine-preventable diseases. While studies are being conducted in
   different East African countries, there is limited evidence of complete
   basic childhood vaccinations and associated factors in East Africa among
   children aged 12-23 months. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
   complete basic childhood vaccinations and associated factors among
   children aged 12-23 months in East Africa. Methods Based on the
   Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) of 12 East African countries
   (Burundi, Ethiopia, Comoros, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Mozambique,
   Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia, and Malawi), secondary data
   analysis was performed. The study included a total weighted sample of
   18,811 children aged 12-23 months. The basic childhood vaccination
   coverage was presented using a bar graph. Multilevel binary logistic
   regression analysis was fitted for identifying significantly associated
   factors because the DHS has a hierarchical nature. The Intra-class
   Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Proportional
   Change in Variance (PCV), and deviance (-2LLR) were used for checking
   model fitness, and for model comparison. Variable with p-value <= 0.2 in
   the bi-variable multilevel analysis were considered for the
   multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel analysis, the
   Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) were
   reported to declare the significance and strength of association with
   full vaccination. Results Complete basic childhood vaccination in East
   Africa was 69.21\% (95\% CI, 69.20, 69.21\%). In the multivariable
   multilevel analysis; Mothers aged 25-34 years (AOR = 1.21, 95\% CI:
   1.10, 1.32), mothers aged 35 years and above (AOR = 1.50, 95\% CI: 1.31,
   1.71), maternal primary education (AOR = 1.26, 95\% CI: 1.15, 1.38),
   maternal secondary education and above (AOR = 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.36,
   1.75), husband primary education (AOR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.13, 1.39),
   husband secondary education and above (AOR = 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.11, 1.40),
   media exposure (AOR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.13, 1.33), birth interval of
   24-48 months (AOR = 1.28, 95\% CI: 1.15, 1.42), birth interval greater
   than 48 months (AOR = 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.21, 1.50), having 1-3 ANC visit
   (AOR = 3.24, 95\% CI: 2.78, 3.77), four and above ANC visit (AOR = 3.68,
   95\% CI: 3.17, 4.28), PNC visit (AOR = 1.34, 95\% CI: 1.23, 1.47),
   health facility delivery (AOR = 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.35, 1.62), large size
   at birth 1.09 (AOR = 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.19), being 4-6 births (AOR =
   0.83, 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.91), being above the sixth birth (AOR = 0.60,
   95\% CI: 0.52, 0.70), middle wealth index (AOR = 1.16, 95\% CI: 1.06,
   1.28), rich wealth index (AOR = 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.33), community
   poverty (AOR = 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.11, 1.32) and country were significantly
   associated with complete childhood vaccination. Conclusions In East
   Africa, full basic childhood vaccine coverage remains a major public
   health concern with substantial differences across countries. Complete
   basic childhood vaccination was significantly associated with maternal
   age, maternal education, husband education, media exposure, preceding
   birth interval, number of ANC visits, PNC visits, place of delivery,
   child-size at birth, parity, wealth index, country, and community
   poverty.
   Public health interventions should therefore target children born to
   uneducated mothers and fathers, poor families, and those who have not
   used maternal health services to enhance full childhood vaccination to
   reduce the incidence of child mortality from vaccine-preventable
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Gray mold is the main postharvest disease of pomegranate fruit worldwide
   caused by Botrytis cinerea. However, recent advances in phylogeny of
   Botrytis spp. revealed that B. cinerea is a complex species. In this
   study, in total 150 and 246 Botrytis spp. isolates were collected during
   2015 and 2016 from Greek and Californian pomegranate packinghouses,
   respectively, and used to investigate the disease etiology, the fungal
   population structure and the fungicide resistance profile of the
   isolates. Identification of causal agents showed that, both in Greece
   and California, gray mold of pomegranate is caused by a complex of
   Botrytis species/groups that includes B. cinerea, B. pseudocinerea and
   Botrytis group S. B. cinerea sensu stricto was the predominant species
   associated with the disease, although B. pseudocinerea was also
   identified at relatively high frequencies. B. pseudocinerea is reported
   for first time as an agent of the disease on pomegranates. The
   population structure was investigated using as marker the presence of
   two transposable elements (TEs, Boty and Flipper). Results showed that
   boty and transposa isolates (both TEs present) were predominant in the
   B. cinerea subpopulations in Greece and California, respectively, while
   vacuma (both TEs absent) and boty isolates were found to be predominant
   in the B. pseudocinerea subpopulations. Measurements of fungicide
   sensitivity revealed the complete absence of fungicide resistance in the
   fungal population originating from Greece, while in the Californian
   subpopulations high frequencies of fungicide resistance were observed in
   B. cinerea sensu stricto isolates but not in B. pseudocinerea and B.
   cinerea group S. The higher frequencies of resistance were observed for
   QoIs, SDHIs and benzimidazoles. In summary, this study provided a
   description of the structure of Botrytis species complex on pomegranate
   fruit in 2 different geographic regions of the world and on their
   fungicide resistance status that will be useful for a better adaptation
   of the disease control strategies and a better understanding of the risk
   for fungicide resistance development.}},

Abstract = {{Ornate prose is one of the main types of prose in the classical Turkish
   literature. The impressive power of poetry, the leading literary genre
   of the period, also influenced prose. Ornate prose, characterized by
   flashy metaphors, various literary arts, elaborated language,
   predominant internal rhyme (seci), harmonious and rhythmic resonance,
   emerged as the result of this influence. The first example of ornate
   prose in the classical Turkish literature is the 15th-century
   `Tazarruname' by Sinan Pasha. Other representatives of this prose are
   Fuzuli, Veysi, Nergisi, to name just a few. In the Russian literature,
   the origins of ornate prose were first seen in the 15th century in such
   hagiographies as Life of Stefan of Perm and Life of Sergius of Radonezh
   by Epiphanius the Wise. Although its origins in the Russian literature
   date back to the 15th century, the ornate prose reappeared as a result
   of the search for new styles starting with neorealism in the 1920s. This
   study sets out to clarify the emergence of ornate prose in the Turkish
   and Russian literatures, its developmental stages, stylistic features,
   common aspects, and differences comparatively from the general to the
   specific. In this context, when the rhetoric and semantic arts and
   rhymes in the pieces belonging to various works belonging to the ornate
   prose were analyzed, deep similarities were observed in the ornate
   samples of both literature and it was determined that the artistic
   expression that is used was carried out mainly based on the aesthetic
   concerns of the artists.}},

Title = {{Analyzing the Impacts of Serial Correlation and Shift on the Streamflow
   Variability within the Climate Regions of Contiguous United States}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The spatiotemporal hydrologic variability over different regions of the
   contiguous United States poses the risk of droughts and floods.
   Understanding the historic variations in streamflow can help in
   accessing future hydrologic conditions. The current study investigates
   the historic changes in the streamflow within the climate regions of the
   continental United States. The streamflow records of 419 unimpaired
   streamflow stations were grouped into seven climate regions based on the
   National Climate Assessment, to evaluate the regional changes in both
   seasonal streamflow and yearly streamflow percentiles. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test were utilized to
   evaluate the streamflow variability as a gradual trend and abrupt shift,
   respectively. The Walker test was performed to test the global
   significance of the streamflow variability within each climate region
   based on local trend and shift significance of each streamflow station.
   The study also evaluated the presence of serial correlation in the
   streamflow records and its effects on both trend and shift within the
   climate regions of the contiguous United States for the first time.
   Maximum variability in terms of both trend and shift was observed for
   summer as compared to other seasons. Similarly, a greater number of
   stations showed streamflow variability for 5th and 50th percentile
   streamflow as compared to 95th and 100th percentile streamflow. It was
   also observed that serial correlation affected both trends and steps,
   while accounting for the lag-1 autocorrelation improved shift results.
   The results indicated that the streamflow variability has more likely
   occurred as shift as compared to the gradual trend. The outcomes of the
   current result detailing historic variability may help to envision
   future changes in streamflow. The current study may favor the water
   managers in developing future decisions to resolve the issues related to
   the streamflow variability in flood and drought-prone regions.}},

Abstract = {{Background Effective crisis leadership is dependent on the key tasks of
   sense-making, decision-making, meaning-making, learning and crisis
   termination. While instant messaging and social media provided abundant
   and powerful sources of information during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   infodemic-an overabundance of information, some of which is
   inaccurate-has also complicated the tasks of crisis leadership.
   Methods A qualitative study was undertaken, using semistructured
   interviews with physician leaders in the hospital dealing with majority
   of Singapore's COVID-19 cases. Participants were asked about how they
   used digital communication tools in their leadership roles before and
   during the outbreak, and their reflections on the use of these tools.
   Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and subjected to
   inductive thematic analysis.
   Results Twenty-four physician leaders described the adaptations to
   crisis leadership tasks using digital communication tools. While these
   tools were useful for rapid collective sense-making, meaning-making was
   the most challenging because information was posted by others who were
   faster, competed with their ability to create nuanced versions of a
   coherent narrative for stakeholders. Leaders also shared the need to
   balance their relationship with their smartphone and use digital tools
   to communicate purpose and meaning to and with their staff when
   face-to-face meetings are not possible.
   Conclusions The COVID-19 infodemic has disrupted the key tasks of crisis
   leadership. For each task leaders on the front line can adopt measures
   to harness the power of and minimise the risk of damage by instant
   messaging. Infodemic management must be explicitly included in crisis
   management training for leaders.}},

Abstract = {{There are two kinds of sequential rules. They are classical sequential
   rules and common sequential rules. The common sequential rules present
   the relationship between unordered itemsets in which all the items in
   the antecedent part have to appear before the ones in the consequent
   part. All existing algorithms for mining common sequential rules can not
   apply to quantitative sequence databases. Furthermore, the common
   sequential rules found so far did not yet reveal the time gap about the
   apperance of itemsets in its antecedent and consequent parts. The
   purpose of this article is to overcome the two disadvantages mentioned
   above. Specifically, the article proposes an algorithm called IFERMiner
   to discover common sequential rules in quantitative sequence databases,
   where the time gap about appearance of two attribute sets in its
   antecedent and consequent parts is taken account. This algorithm was
   developed from the ERMiner algorithm that is the most efficient
   algorithm to discover common sequential rules in transactional sequence
   databases now. The computational complexity of the IFERMiner algorithm
   is also shown in the article and it is polynomial. The FCSI rules found
   out by the IFERMiner algorithm are useful for marketing domain and

   (Clade 2.3.4) and AIV-H9N2 (Clade 9.4.2) by using Hemagglutination
   Inhibition (HI) assay. The result of NP-ELISA assay showed that 12.88 \%
   (80/621) of poultry in LBM was positive for AIV antibodies. In detail,
   38.06 \% (51/134) of layers, 7.08 \% (8/113) of backyard chicken, 2.07
   \% (5/242) of broilers and 12.12 \% (16/132) of ducks were AIV positive.
   The HI test for specific antibodies against AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 were
   1.77 \% (11/621) and 4.51 \% (28/621), respectively. Our findings
   revealed the evidence of AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 exposure in both chicken
   and ducks in the LBM in Yangon, Myanmar. Risks of influenza infections
   and transmission among poultry and humans in the LBMs could not be
   ignored.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent emotional interactions between professional helpers and their
   clients mean that helpers must possess a high level of emotional
   intelligence (EI). No previous study explores the specific aspects of EI
   needed to become efficient helpers. Moreover, most EI research has been
   carried out in Western countries, where the concept of EI may be
   different in comparison to the Malaysian context. Therefore, this study
   explores the idea of EI from the perspective of professional helpers in
   Malaysia through a qualitative research design. Twenty-four professional
   helpers, with a minimum of five years working experience in their
   respective fields, were recruited for four focus group interviews.
   Participants included counsellors, psychologist, rehabilitation officers
   and social workers. Data were analysed using Atlas.ti, and the results
   yielded 11 themes. They were self-awareness, self-expression,
   self-understanding, self-acceptance, self-management, social awareness,
   effective decision making, effective communication, management of others
   emotion, intrapersonal professional competencies. The research
   highlights the vital components of EI from the perspective of
   professional helpers in the multicultural society of Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common form of organ dysfunction
   occurring in patients admitted to the intensive care unit and
   contributes significantly to poor long-term outcomes. Despite this
   public health impact, no effective pharmacotherapy exists for AKI. One
   reason may be that heterogeneity is present within AKI as currently
   defined, thereby concealing unique pathophysiologic processes specific
   to certain AKI populations. Supporting this notion, we and others have
   shown that diversity within the AKI clinical syndrome exists, and the
   ``one-size-fits-all{''} approach by current diagnostic guidelines may
   not be ideal. A ``precision medicine{''} approach that exploits an
   individual's genetic, biologic, and clinical characteristics to identify
   AKI sub-phenotypes may overcome such limitations. Identification of AKI
   sub-phenotypes may address a critical unmet clinical need in AKI by (1)
   improving risk prognostication, (2) identifying novel pathophysiology,
   and (3) informing a patient's likelihood of responding to current
   therapeutics or establishing new therapeutic targets to prevent and
   treat AKI. This review discusses the current state of phenotyping AKI

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients often enquire when they can start driving following
   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. Brake response time is an
   essential factor when resuming driving, and this has been extensively
   reported, but no data is available on when the patient can get safely in
   and out of a car based on the restricted knee flexion.
   Methods: We investigated the degree of difficulty and required knee
   flexion (RKF) to get into different car types, comprised of Sedans and
   Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), using 11 volunteers with healthy knees.
   We used an electronic goniometer to record knee flexion required to get
   into the driver's seat, and participants were asked about their
   perceived difficulty getting into the car using a Visual Analog Scale
   (VAS) score (1 no difficulty to 10 impossible). We then restricted the
   knee flexion to 90, 60 and 30 degrees (using braces) to mimic knee
   stiffness following TKR surgery.
   Results: We observed that the mean range of knee flexion to get into a
   car comfortably was 101.8 degrees on the left and 110.6 degrees on the
   right. Restricting knee flexion to 60 and 30 degrees increased the
   leading leg entry time and led to abnormal body movements more so with
   SUV's compared to Sedans. This was confirmed by higher VAS scores for
   SUV's (p<0.005).
   Conclusion: Following a left TKA, patients should be allowed to resume
   driving a Sedan or SUV if they achieve 90 degrees of knee flexion
   whereas following a right TKA a knee flexion of 60 degrees is required
   for a Sedan and 90 degrees for an SUV.}},

Title = {{Prevention of hypotension during elective cesarean section with a
   fixed-rate norepinephrine infusion versus a fixed-rate phenylephrine
   infusion. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spinal anesthesia for cesarean section can be complicated by
   hypotension, with untoward effects for both the mother and fetus.
   Frequently used phenylephrine can lead to bamreceptor-mediated reflex
   bradycardia. The aim of the present study was to compare a fixed-rate
   prophylactic norepinephrine infusion to a fixed-rate prophylactic
   phenylephrine infusion during elective cesarean section under combined
   spinal-epidural anesthesia.
   Materials and methods: Eighty-two parturients were randomized to either
   norepinephrine 4 mu g/min or phenylephrine 50 mu g/min fixed-rate
   infusions, starting simultaneously with the administration of the
   subarachnoid solution. The primary endpoint was the incidence of
   maternal bradycardia. Maternal hemodynamics at specific timepoints, the
   incidence of hypotension or hypertension, the requirement for ephedrine
   or atropine bolus administration as well as the acid-base status and
   Apgar score of the neonate were recorded.
   Results: The incidence of bradycardia as well as the requirement for
   atropine administration was lower in the norepinephrine group (4.8\% vs.
   31.7\%, p = 0.004 and 2.4\% vs. 24.3\%, p = 0.01, respectively). Fetal
   pH, and fetal blood glucose concentration were higher in the
   norepinephrine group (p = 0.027 and 0.019, respectively). No difference
   in the occurrence of hypotension, hypertension, in the requirement for
   bolus vasoconstrictive medication or in Apgar scores was demonstrated.
   Conclusions: A fixed-rate infusion of norepinephrine is as effective in
   the management of hypotension during regional anesthesia for cesarean
   section as a fixed-rate infusion of phenylephrine, with the avoidance of
   phenylephrine-induced bradycardia. The more favourable neonatal
   acid-base profile of noradrenaline might be due to better maintenance of
   placental blood flow in the noradrenaline group due to its beta action,
   while the higher fetal glucose concentration in the same group might
   result from a catecholamine-stimulated glucose metabolism increase and a
   p-receptor mediated insulin decrease.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1238-1264}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, issues related to immigration have become
   increasingly salient across Western democracies. This increasing
   salience has made it more important to understand people's attitudes
   toward immigration, including the effects of media use on those
   attitudes. Differentiating between attitudes toward different types of
   immigration, attitudes toward immigration from different parts of the
   world, and perceptions of immigration's impact, this article
   investigates the effects of media use on attitudes toward and
   perceptions of immigration in Sweden. Based on a three-year, three-wave
   panel study, it investigates the effects of media use on the individual
   level. Among other things, results show that there are limited effects
   of using traditional news media but more substantial effects on people's
   immigration attitudes of using anti-immigration, right-wing alternative
   media and pro-immigration, left-wing alternative media. These findings
   imply that it is highly relevant to account for media use, especially
   alternative media use, when studying public attitudes toward
   immigration. Further, we find that variations in people's immigration
   attitudes, to a high degree, depend on the type of immigration and on
   where migrants are coming from. This finding underlines the importance
   of measuring both of these aspects when the aim is understanding general
   attitudes toward immigration and/or key predictors behind immigration
   attitudes.}},

Journal = {{LEUKEMIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1933-1948}},

Abstract = {{Pharmacological inhibition of MDM2/4, which activates the critical tumor
   suppressor p53, has been gaining increasing interest as a strategy for
   the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While clinical trials of
   MDM2 inhibitors have shown promise, responses have been confined to
   largely molecularly undefined patients, indicating that new biomarkers
   and optimized treatment strategies are needed. We previously reported
   that the microRNA miR-10a is strongly overexpressed in some AML, and
   demonstrate here that it modulates several key members of the p53/Rb
   network, including p53 regulator MDM4, Rb regulator RB1CC1, p21
   regulator TFAP2C, and p53 itself. The expression of both miR-10a and its
   downstream targets were strongly predictive of MDM2 inhibitor
   sensitivity in cell lines, primary AML specimens, and correlated to
   response in patients treated with both MDM2 inhibitors and cytarabine.
   Furthermore, miR-10a inhibition induced synergy between MDM2 inhibitor
   Nutlin-3a and cytarabine in both in vitro and in vivo AML models.
   Mechanistically this synergism primarily occurs via the p53-mediated
   activation of cytotoxic apoptosis at the expense of cytoprotective
   autophagy. Together these findings demonstrate that miR-10a may be
   useful as both a biomarker to identify patients most likely to respond
   to cytarabine+MDM2 inhibition and also a druggable target to increase
   their efficacy.}},

   credit, significantly affect the prevalence of undernourishment. An
   increase in them reduces food insecurity. The elasticity of
   non-agricultural value added is higher (-4.08), followed by that of
   demography (-3.04). The elasticity of agricultural value added is -1.46
   and that of financing is -0.43. Four economic policy implications are
   formulated: strengthening and diversifying agricultural financing,
   promoting the development of food markets, accompanying transformation
   through light industrialisation, and setting up an institutional
   framework capable of promoting agricultural production in Senegal.}},

Title = {{Modeling of Mass Balance Variability and Its Impact on Water Discharge
   from the Urumqi Glacier No. 1 Catchment, Tian Shan, China}},

Abstract = {{Originating in the Tian Shan mountains, Urumqi River plays a key role in
   terms of water supply to downstream areas. In its headwaters, Urumqi
   Glacier No. 1 (UG1) is the largest glacier contributing to water
   discharge. Assessing its response to the changing climatic conditions in
   the area is of major importance to quantify future water availability.
   We here apply COSIPY, a COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass
   balance model in PYthon, to UG1, implementing a new albedo
   parameterization which integrates site-specific bare-ice albedo values
   on a pixel-by-pixel basis observed by remote sensing. We assess model
   performance threefold: quantitatively based on long-term measurement
   data of (1) surface mass balance (SMB) and (2) water discharge as well
   as qualitatively (3) comparing simulated snow line altitudes to such
   imated on the basis of time-lapse photography. Comparison of the modeled
   SMB with annually-averaged data from ablation stakes reveals that COSIPY
   including the new albedo parameterization accounts for 57.6\% of the
   variance observed in the measurements. The original albedo
   parameterization performs only slightly inferior (57.1\%). Glacier-wide
   comparison between modeled and glaciological SMB shows high agreement.
   In terms of discharge prediction, COSIPY reproduces onset and duration
   of the discharge season well. Estimated discharge from the whole
   catchment shows shortcomings in exactly matching the measured times
   series, but interannual variability is captured.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and higher
   occurrence of infections. These complications suggest altered responses
   of the innate immune system. Recent studies have shown that energy
   metabolism of monocytes is crucial in determining their functionality.
   Here we investigate whether monocyte metabolism and function are changed
   in patients with diabetes and aim to identify diabetes-associated
   factors driving these alterations. Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
   (n = 41) and healthy age-, sex-, and BMI-matched control subjects (n =
   20) were recruited. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood to
   determine immune functionality, metabolic responses, and transcriptome
   profiles. Upon ex vivo stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 or
   TLR-2 agonists, monocytes of patients with T1D secreted lower levels of
   various cytokines and showed lower glycolytic rates compared with
   monocytes isolated from matched control subjects. Stratification based
   on HbA(1c) levels revealed that lower cytokine secretion was coupled to
   higher glycolytic rate of monocytes in patients with a higher glycemic
   burden. Circulating monocytes displayed an enhanced inflammatory gene
   expression profile associated with high glycemic burden. These results
   suggest that a high glycemic burden in patients with T1D is related to
   expression of inflammatory genes of monocytes and is associated with an
   impaired relationship between metabolism and inflammatory function upon
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is a critical health
   concern for the treatment of infectious diseases. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of CRAB emphasizing the
   presence of oxacillinase (OXA)-type beta-lactamase-encoding genes, one
   of the most important carbapenem resistance mechanisms. In this study, a
   total of 183 non-repetitive CRAB isolates collected from 11 tertiary
   care hospitals across Thailand were investigated. As a result, the
   blaoxa-51-like gene, an intrinsic enzyme marker, was detected in all
   clinical isolates. The blaoxa-23-like gene was presented in the majority
   of isolates (68.31\%). In contrast, the prevalence rates of
   blaoxa-40/24-like and blaoxa-58-like gene occurrences in CRAB isolates
   were only 4.92\% and 1.09\%, respectively. All isolates were resistant
   to carbapenems, with 100\% resistance to imipenem, followed by meropenem
   (98.91\%) and doripenem (94.54\%). Most isolates showed high resistance
   rates to ciprofloxacin (97.81\%), ceftazidime (96.72\%), gentamicin
   (91.26\%), and amikacin (80.87\%). Interestingly, colistin was found to
   be a potential drug of choice due to the high susceptibility of the
   tested isolates to this antimicrobial (87.98\%). Most CRAB isolates in
   Thailand were of ST2 lineage, but some belonged to ST25, ST98, ST129,
   ST164, ST215, ST338, and ST745. Further studies to monitor the spread of
   carbapenem-resistant OXA-type beta-lactamase genes from A. baumannii in
   hospital settings are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the correlation between invasively measured
   renal venous oxygen saturation (SrvO(2)) and tissue oxygenation (rSO(2))
   measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in adult patients
   undergoing cardiac surgery.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Single cardiac surgery center at a university hospital.
   Participants: Thirteen adult patients with skin- to- kidney distance <=
   4 cm undergoing open cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Interventions: All patients received renal vein catheters for invasive
   measurement of SrvO(2), and NIRS electrodes for assessment of renal
   rSO(2) were placed over the kidney using ultrasound guidance.
   Measurements were made before CPB, during CPB at 3 different flow rates
   (2.4, 2.7, and 3.0 L/min/m(2)), and after CPB.
   Measurements and Main Results: Repeated- measures correlation analyses
   and Bland-Altman plots were used to study the correlation and agreement
   between rSO(2) and SrvO(2). For all measurement points, renal rSO(2)
   correlated with SrvO(2) (r(rm) = 0.61, p < 0.001), and the mean
   difference (bias) between rSO(2) and SrvO(2) was -2.71 +/- 7.22 (p =
   0.002), with an error of 17.6\%. When measurements during CPB and before
   and after CPB were studied separately, rSO(2) and SrvO(2) were
   correlated (r(rm) = 0.51, p < 0.007 and r(rm) = 0.73, p < 0.001,
   respectively). During CPB, renal rSO(2) predicted SrvO(2) with a bias of
   -3.41 +/- 7.76 (p = 0.009) and an error of 18.8\%. Before and after CPB,
   the mean difference was -1.93 +/- 6.60 (p = 0.092), with an error of
   16.2\%.
   Conclusions: Renal rSO(2) is correlated to and predicts SrvO(2) with a
   small bias and acceptable agreement. Further studies are needed before
   renal NIRS can be used as a surrogate marker of renal oxygenation in
   clinical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To identify distinct recovery trajectories of acute flares of
   knee pain and associated participant characteristics.
   Methods Data were from the FLARE randomized controlled trial, a
   multicenter trial in 27 primary care centers in the UK and Netherlands
   of 3 regimes of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy for acute
   flares of knee pain. Individuals with a history of inflammatory/crystal
   arthritis, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain syndrome were excluded. Latent
   class growth analysis was applied to measures of pain intensity repeated
   over 5 days to identify distinct recovery trajectories. The concurrent
   courses of interference with activity, stiffness, and swelling for each
   trajectory group were modelled using generalized estimating equations.
   Participant age, sex, obesity, and osteoarthritis diagnosis were
   described for each trajectory group.
   Results A total of 449 participants were included (median age 55 years,
   41\% female, 35\% obese, and 42\% diagnosed with osteoarthritis). A
   6-group cubic model was deemed optimal, with trajectories distinguished
   by rate of pain reduction and absolute level at final measurement. At
   the extremes were rapid and near-complete resolution (n = 41, 9\%) and
   persistent, high pain (n = 25, 6\%), but most participants showed a
   reduction and plateau in pain severity within 3-5 days. Within each pain
   trajectory group, interference with activity, stiffness, and swelling
   followed the same course as pain. Baseline characteristics did not
   differ substantially between trajectory groups.
   Conclusion Even under a well-adhered to regime of oral nonsteroidal
   antiinflammatory medication, recovery following acute flares of knee
   pain is heterogeneous. Our observations that favorable trajectories are
   apparent within 3-5 days can help to inform treatment decision-making in
   the patient-health care professional consultation.}},

   hospitalisation and then deprescribe them judiciously. Limiting scrutiny
   to the most frequent PIMs and PPOs will identify many moderate, severe,
   or fatal risks of causing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) but to identify
   all PIMs or PPO involving moderate or severe risks of ADRs also involves
   searching lower in the frequency list of patients. Deciding whether to
   use the STOPP or AGS Beers PIM lists is an important issue in searching
   for ADRs, because the Pearson correlation coefficient for agreement
   between the STOPP and AGS Beers PIM totals in this study was 0.7051
   (95\% CI 0.7016 to 0.7085; p < 0.001). The combined lists include 289
   individual PIM medications but STOPP and AGS have only 159 (55\%) in
   common. The AGS Beers lists include medications used in the US and
   STOPP/START those used in Europe. The AGS authors recommend using both
   criteria. The ideal solution to the problem is to implement carefully
   constructed Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) as in the SENATOR
   trial, then for an experienced pharmacist to focus on the key PIMs and
   PPOs likely to lead to moderate, severe, or fatal ADRs. The pharmacist
   and key decision makers on the services need to establish a collegial
   relationship to discuss frequently changing the medications that place
   the patients at risk. Then, the remaining PIMs and PPOs that relate to
   chronic disease management can be discussed by phone with the family
   physician using the discharge summary, which lists the medications for
   potential deprescribing.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{1. Indigenous peoples have been monitoring and managing the natural
   resources in their homelands and waters for millennia. Meanwhile,
   social-ecological systems thinkers are embracing the capacity of
   Indigenous knowledge systems, which are informed by land-based
   practices, to inform adaptive management.
   2. Following the collaborative design of a community-based
   social-ecological monitoring system over two traditional seafood
   harvesting seasons, we conducted a conceptual framework analysis of
   meeting notes and interview transcripts with Gitga'at harvesters and
   knowledge holders to discern how Gitga'at people monitor their territory
   and what indicators they focus on.
   3. An interconnected set of social-ecological concepts and indicators
   emerged, evidencing an intrinsic part of Gitga'at life: Gitga'at
   harvesters closely monitor their coastal social-ecological system
   through ongoing land- and sea-based practices.
   4. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of maintaining and
   revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and harvesting practices to inform
   social-ecological monitoring and adaptive management at local and
   broader scales.
   5. Amidst discussions of marine and coastal resource co-management in
   British Columbia, our results also suggest opportunities for scientific
   approaches to situate themselves within and support existing Indigenous
   frameworks and priorities.
   6. This research also adds to the discussion on the development of
   appropriate regional and global indicators and frameworks to monitor the
   resilience of social-ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon (C-14) dates in North American
   archaeology is increasing, especially among archaeologists working in
   deeper time. However, historical archaeologists have been slow to
   embrace these new techniques, and there have been only a few examples of
   the incorporation of calendar dates as informative priors in Bayesian
   models in such work in the United States. To illustrate the value of
   Bayesian approaches to sites with both substantial earlier Native
   American occupations as well as a historic era European presence, we
   present the results of our Bayesian analysis of C-14 dates from the
   earlier Guale village and the Mission period contexts from the Sapelo
   Shell Ring Complex (9MC23) in southern Georgia. Jefferies and Moore have
   explored the Spanish Mission period deposits at this site to better
   understand the Native American interactions with the Spanish during the
   16th and 17th centuries along the Georgia Coast. Given the results of
   our Bayesian modeling, we can say with some degree of confidence that
   the deposits thus far excavated and sampled contain important
   information dating to the 17th-century mission on Sapelo Island. In
   addition, our modeling of new dates suggests the range of the
   pre-Mission era Guale village. Based on these new dates, we can now say
   with some degree of certainty which of the deposits sampled likely
   contain information that dates to one of the critical periods of Mission
   period research, the AD 1660-1684 period that ushered in the close of
   mission efforts on the Georgia Coast.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cities in developing countries face acute pressures due to increased
   motorization, urbanization and growing population. Urban transport
   planning systems can fuel healthy cities, yet research examining the
   interface between policies and needs in Africa remains scarce. A
   mixed-methods approach was used to assess the alignment between urban
   transport policies and self-reported citizens' needs in Port Louis city
   (Mauritius). Logistic regression models were run to detect associations
   between needs and demographic indicators (age, gender, income). Three
   policy measures were assessed: light metro rail system, bus
   modernization scheme and road decongestion program. Six citizen needs
   and six mode of transit preferences were extracted from 1523 surveys
   (N). Citizens reported the need for improving sidewalks (80\%), public
   spaces (77\%), green spaces (67\%), pedestrianizing strategic areas
   (66\%), centralizing street-vendors at bus stations (57\%) and
   regulating private vehicles entry in town (40\%). The policies addressed
   3 out of 6 needs, of which all were more likely to be expressed by
   poorer population groups. The policies did not respond to citizen needs
   for active modes of travel. They did not address health and social co
   benefits of transport. Rather they emphasized an economic agenda focused
   on transport infrastructure as opposed to policy reforms in line with
   public needs that much more strongly highlight the integration of urban
   transport planning in social life. Citizen-centred approaches provide a
   unique opportunity to reform urban transport planning policies towards
   more healthy and equitable cities in developing countries.}},

   transportation equipment industry}},
Journal = {{JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Japan has experienced several appreciation episodes. These appreciations
   may squeeze profit margins and lower export volumes. This paper
   investigates whether firms can weather appreciation periods by producing
   differentiated rather than commoditized products. To do this it
   investigates different sectors within the Japanese transportation
   equipment industry. Results from estimating pricing-to-market (PTM)
   coefficients indicate that firms producing differentiated products can
   pass-through more of exchange rate appreciations into higher foreign
   currency prices and thus better preserve their profit margins. Results
   from estimating trade elasticities are consistent with the PTM results
   and indicate that the automobile industry has exported much less than
   predicted after the yen depreciated in 2012. Finally, estimates of the
   stock market exposure across sectors indicates that the profitability of
   firms producing differentiated products is less exposed to
   appreciations. Producing differentiated, knowledge-intensive goods can
   thus help firms to survive endaka periods.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Through a series of simulated observations, we investigate the
   capability of the instruments aboard the forthcoming THESEUS mission for
   the detection of a characteristic signal from decaying dark matter (DM)
   in the keV-McV energy range. We focus our studies on three well studied
   Standard Model extensions hosting axionlike particles, dark photon, and
   sterile neutrino DM candidates. We show that, due to the sensitivity of
   THESEUS' x and gamma imaging spectrometer instrument, existing
   constraints on dark matter parameters can be improved by a factor of up
   to similar to 300, depending on the considered DM model and assuming a
   zero level of systematic uncertainty. We also show that even a minimal
   level of systematic uncertainty of 1\% can impair potential constraints
   by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that nonetheless, the
   constraints imposed by THESEUS will be substantially better than
   existing ones and will well complement the constraints of upcoming
   missions such as eXTP and Athena. Ultimately, the limits imposed by
   THESEUS and future missions will ensure a robust and thorough coverage
   of the parameter space for decaying DM models, enabling either a
   detection of dark matter or a significant improvement of relevant
   limits.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the fundamental tradeoff between the storage cost and the
   download cost in private information retrieval (PIR) systems, without
   any explicit structural restrictions on the storage codes, such as
   maximum distance separable codes or uncoded storage. Our focus in this
   work is on the two extreme points: the point when the storage cost is
   minimal, and the point when the download cost is minimal. Two novel
   outer bounds are provided, which have the following implications at
   these two extreme points. When the messages are stored without any
   redundancy across the databases, the optimal PIR strategy is to download
   all the messages; on the other hand, for PIR capacity-achieving codes,
   each database can reduce the storage cost, from storing all the
   messages, by no more than one message on average. To better understand
   the second extreme point, we then focus on the two-message two-database
   case, and show that a stronger outer bound can be derived through a
   novel pseudo-message technique. This stronger outer bound suggests that
   a precise characterization of the storage-download tradeoff may require
   more sophisticated bounding techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Existing methods of parameters identification do not consider the
   torsion characteristics of a ball screw and the worktable position
   simultaneously. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-position
   identification method based on receptance coupling. Firstly, the
   mathematical model of the feed drive system is established by the
   improved receptance coupling, and this model considers both axial and
   torsional vibration of the ball screw. Secondly, the identification
   equation is established by minimum error of the modal parameters of
   multiple worktable position, and differential evolution algorithm is
   used to calculate the stiffness and damping of the joint. Finally, the
   self-developed ball screw feed drive system is used for experimental
   study. The maximum error of the first four orders of natural frequencies
   predicted through multi-position identification results is 2.95\%, and
   the multi-position method is more robust than the common method
   identification at one position. The experiment study showed that the
   proposed method is accuracy and necessity.}},

Abstract = {{Fat accumulation in the mesenteric adipose tissue is a serious problem
   in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) culture. Lipid droplet-related
   proteins (LDRPs) are involved in the formation, degradation, and
   biological functions of lipid droplets. In this study, we aimed to
   provide reference proteomics data to study lipid droplet regulation in
   fish. We isolated LDRPs from the mesenteric adipose tissue of grass carp
   (1-year-old) after normal feeding and 7 days of starvation, and
   identified and analysed them using isobaric tags for relative and
   absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology. Short-term starvation had no
   significant effect on the body weight, condition factor, visceral index,
   hepatopancreas index, intraperitoneal fat index, adipose tissue
   triglyceride content, and adipocyte size of grass carp. Nine hundred and
   fifty proteins were identified and annotated using the Gene Ontology
   (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases; they
   are involved in a variety of metabolic and signalling pathways,
   including amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism, and the
   PI3KAkt signalling pathway. There were 296 differentially expressed
   proteins (DEPs), with 143 up-regulated and 153 down-regulated proteins.
   Three proteins involved in triglyceride and fatty acid syntheses and two
   proteins involved in autophagy were up-regulated, and six proteins
   involved in lipid catabolism were down-regulated. These results indicate
   that under short-term starvation, lipid droplets in the adipose tissue
   of grass carp may maintain their shape by promoting fat production and
   inhibiting lipolysis, and autophagy may be one of the main strategies
   for coping with short-term energy deprivation.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen induced plasticity has been found in metallic glasses; however,
   the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we studied a Cu-Zr
   metallic glass charged in a hydrogen atmosphere inside an environmental
   transmission electron microscope. Compression tests of hydrogen charged
   nanopillars show more controllable deformation compared to uncharged
   ones. A variable resolution fluctuation electron microscopy study of the
   hydrogen charged samples reveals an increase in the correlation length
   of the medium-range order. Our results provide experimental evidence for
   hydrogen-induced heterogeneity and support the idea that increasing the
   degree of heterogeneity leads to multiple local shear events and
   suppresses catastrophic shear banding. Impact statement Direct evidence
   of an increase in the spatial correlation length of the medium-range
   order is found during hydrogen charging of a Cu-Zr metallic glass and
   leads to enhanced plastic deformation.}},

Abstract = {{2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is an important high-grade aromatic alcohol,
   which is widely used in the cosmetics, perfumery and food industries.
   However, 2-PE is mainly synthesized using a chemical route, which
   produces environmental pollution and harmful by-products. Screening of
   high-yielding wild-type strains has become an important goal for the
   future biosynthesis of 2-PE. In this study, a wild-type Wickerhamomyces
   anomalus was isolated from rice wine fermented mash. By optimizing the
   initial glucose and L-phenylalanine concentrations, 2630.7 mg/L of 2-PE
   was obtained in shaking flasks. The conditions of initial glucose and
   L-phenylalanine concentration, pH, and inoculation amount were optimized
   for 2-PE production with W. anomalus. Finally, based on the optimal
   conditions, the 2-PE titer reached 4,727.3 mg/L by a single-dose
   fed-batch strategy in a 5-L bioreactor. The results showed that the
   ability was expanded to harness the Ehrlich pathway for the production
   of high-value aromatics in aroma-producing yeast species.}},

Abstract = {{This brief is concerned with the problem of observed-based asynchronous
   control for a class of semi-Markov jump systems (SMJSs) in
   continuous-time domain. There exists an asynchronous phenomenon between
   the system modes and the controller modes due to the limitations of the
   actual environment. System modes and controller modes are usually
   described as hidden modes and observable modes, respectively. Their
   relationship can be exhibited by emission probabilities. In this brief,
   a hidden semi-Markov model is used to describe such phenomenon. A
   conventional approach is employed and an improved result is derived to
   solve observed-based control problem. Based on a common Lyapunov
   function, an observed-based asynchronous control law depending on the
   observable mode is synthesized to ensure the stochastic stability of the
   closed-loop system. Finally, a practical RLC circuit system example is
   provided to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed
   methods.}},

Title = {{Comparison of circular stapling, triangulating stapling and T-shape
   stapling for cervical anastomosis with minimally invasive esophagectomy}},

Abstract = {{Background: The triangulating stapling (TST) and T-shape stapling (TS)
   methods have been proposed to decrease the incidence of anastomotic
   leakage after esophagectomy, but few studies have compared them to the
   circular stapling technique (CS). This retrospective study aimed to
   compare the efficacy and safety of three cervical anastomosis methods
   after esophagectomy.
   Methods: Squamous cell carcinoma patients who underwent minimally
   invasive esophagectomy (MIE) with CS, TST or TS anastomosis between
   April 2010 and June 2012 were recruited. Their clinical characteristics
   and short-term outcome were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analyses compared
   with log-rank test were used to calculate the effect of the three types
   of cervical anastomosis on overall survival (OS) and disease-free
   survival (DFS).
   Results: The incidence of anastomotic leakage was 21.8\% in the CS
   group, 7.7\% in the TS group and 11.9\% in the TST group (P=0.029).
   There were significant differences in the incidence of gastroesophageal
   reflux among the three groups (P<0.001). Rates of anastomotic stenosis,
   pulmonary infection, chylothorax and hoarseness were not different among
   the groups. There were significant differences in anastomotic time,
   operation time and hospitalization time (all P<0.001), but there was no
   significant difference in albumin content at 1 month after operation
   (P=0.226). There was no differences in long-term surgical effects of the
   three types of anastomosis
   Conclusions: Cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by TST or TS can be
   considered feasible and safe and with improved short-term outcome.}},

   (the estuary and the central zone) is similar to that of freshwater
   lakes, this dynamics in the seawater zone is different. The authors
   explain this difference by an increase in water salinity and,
   consequently, an increase in radiation absorption in the lower ice
   layer, which is in contact with the water surface. The regularities of
   seasonal variations of brightness temperature in different zones of the
   Gulf of Ob and related ice-cover phases can be used to assess salinity
   and water mixing in large estuaries of the Arctic in winter based on

Abstract = {{Background: A farm upbringing has been associated with lower risk of
   asthma and methylation of asthma-related genes. As such, a farm
   upbringing has the potential to transfer asthma risk across generations,
   but this has never been investigated. We aimed to study the generational
   effects from a parental farm upbringing on offspring asthma.
   Methods: Our study involved three generations: 5759 participants from
   the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) study (born
   1945-1971, denoted G1), their 9991 parents (GO) and their 8260 offspring
   (G2) participating in RHINESSA (Respiratory Health In Northern Europe,
   Spain and Australia). Questionnaire data were collected on GO and G1
   from G1 in 2010 and on G2 from themselves in 2013. The
   parental/grandparental place of upbringing was categorized: (i) both
   parents from farm; (ii) mother from farm, father from village/city;
   (iii) father from farm, mother from village/city; (iv) both parents from
   village or one parent from village and one from city; (v) both parents
   from city (reference group). Grandparental upbringing was equivalently
   categorized. Offspring asthma was self-reported and data were analysed
   using Cox-regression models with G2 age as the time scale.
   Results: A parental farm upbringing was not associated with offspring
   asthma when compared with city upbringing {[}hazard ratio (HR) 1.12,
   95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.69]. Findings remained similar when
   stratified by offspring upbringing and asthma phenotypes. Quantitative
   bias analyses showed similar estimates for alternative data sources. A
   grandparental farm upbringing was not associated with offspring asthma
   in either the maternal (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.67-1.65) or paternal line (HR
   1.02, 95\% CI 0.62-1.68).
   Conclusions: This multigenerational analysis suggests no evidence of an
   association between parental/grandparental farm upbringing and offspring
   asthma.}},

Title = {{Modified manual small incision cataract surgery technique for

Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To present the technique and outcomes of a modified manual
   small incision cataract surgery designed for the phacoemulsification
   surgeons who are learning to perform manual small incision cataract
   surgery.
   Methods: This was a retrospective, single-centred, comparative study. We
   included all the patients who underwent the modified manual small
   incision cataract surgery for visually significant cataract at Singapore
   National Eye Centre. All surgeries were performed by either a senior
   phaco-trained surgeon (M.A.) who had performed more than 500 manual
   small incision cataract surgery or a junior phaco-trained surgeon (D.C.)
   who had performed around 500 phacoemulsification but never performed any
   manual small incision cataract surgery. The main modification of this
   technique lies in the creation of an additional phaco-like main wound at
   90 degrees to the scleral tunnel wound, with most surgical steps
   performed through this additional wound. The outcomes were analysed and
   compared between the senior and junior surgeons. The main outcome
   measures were visual outcome and major intraoperative complications such
   as posterior capsular rupture and zonular dialysis.
   Results: A total of 132 cases were included; 102 (77.3\%) and 30
   (22.7\%) cases were performed by the senior and junior surgeons,
   respectively. Pre-operatively, 85.6\% eyes had best-corrected visual
   acuity of counting fingers or worse. Postoperatively, the visual outcome
   at 1 month was similar between the senior and junior surgeons, with
   68.7\% eyes achieving a best-corrected visual acuity of > 6/12 (p =
   0.17). No posterior capsular rupture, zonular dialysis or
   endophthalmitis was observed during the study period.
   Conclusions: This modified technique may serve as a useful transition
   technique for the phaco-trained surgeons to develop skills in manual
   small incision cataract surgery, with demonstrable good visual outcome
   and safety.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limiting natural resources, greenhouse effect and global
   warming crisis, the bio-based chemicals which are environmentally
   friendly materials have gradually become urgent and important.
   Cadaverine, a 1,5-diaminopentane (DAP), is widely used as block
   chemicals for synthesis of biopolymer, which can be produced from lysine
   by lysine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.18) in Escherichia coli. However, the
   DAP will be further utilized into by-products through downstream genes
   of speE, puuA, speG and ygjG, which decrease the amount of product. In
   this study, two approaches including Lambda-Red system for gene
   knockout, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
   interference (CRISPRi) for gene knockdown; are explored to manipulate
   the metabolic flux among 26 genetic E. coli. As a result, CadA driven by
   inducible T7 promoter accumulated more DAP from CRISPRi targeted on
   single-gene repressive strains such as BT7AiE, BT7AiP, BT7AiG and
   BT7AiY. The highest DAP titer and productivity was obtained to 38 g/L
   and 2.67 g/L/h in BT7AiY (repression of ygjG). We also investigated the
   co-factor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) effect on lysine consumption and
   DAP production from different E. coli derivatives. In contrast to
   CRISPRi-mediated strains, 4 genes knockout strain (BT7AdEPGY) deal with
   98\% lysine consumption and achieved 37.45 g/L DAP and 3.17 g/L/h DAP
   productivity. The metabolic regulation by CRISPRi is a simple strategy
   and the results are consistent with gene knockout to manipulate the
   pathway for DAP production. (C) 2020, The Society for Biotechnology,

Abstract = {{Aim: Task interdependence among staff in nursing homes is high, and
   staff teams are typically composed of employees from different cultural
   backgrounds with varying levels of skills and qualifications. By
   applying relational coordination theory as an analytic lens, we
   investigated how communication and cooperation challenges are
   experienced and dealt with.
   Design: This is a qualitative study.
   Method: In-dept interviews with 31 members of staff in two nursing homes
   and thematic analysis of the material.
   Results: The study identified challenges in direct communication and
   collaboration difficulties related to understanding how to use
   professional discretion in daily care practices in both nursing homes.
   The management in one of the two nursing homes arranged frequent
   meetings to share knowledge about the residents, their care status and
   introduced initiatives to build competence among all members of staff,
   including substitute and temporary staff. This contributed to ensuring
   shared goals and mutual respect at the workplace.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Power injection patterns will become more diverse in the future as more
   intermittent generation, bulk energy storage, and aggregated flexible
   loads become integrated into the grid. Designing flexible and, in a way,
   patchable grids is an emerging area of research to accommodate the
   increased dispatch diversity from supplyand demand-sides. This work
   presents an approach that reduces total grid inadequacy for power
   jection diversity by combining the benefits of (1) reduced inherent grid
   inadequacy via grid expansion and additional grid flexibility via line
   switching. Unlike most models that minimize cost under uncertainty,
   proposed approach directly minimizes total grid inadequacy using the
   size of a scenario-based representation the power flow infeasible set to
   find meritorious line and switch installation options. Experiments using
   the and 118-bus test systems show reduced total grid inadequacy,
   especially when both solutions are considered simultaneously. We hope
   that this work can inspire future work on integrating grid flexibility
   in expansion planning.}},

   and product diversity on satisfaction and word of mouth (WoM) and its
   impact on customer loyalty. Furthermore, this study also examined the
   mediating effects of satisfaction and WoM in the relationship between
   service quality and product diversity on customer loyalty. This
   research's object took the customers of Batik Semarangan Craftwork,
   Indonesia, with the phenomenon of always developing creative and
   innovative Batik motif designs that can be accepted by the market
   without leaving Semarang's uniqueness. The total sample was 98
   customers. The results of the study showed that service quality and
   product diversity positively affected satisfaction and WoM and had a
   positive effect on customer loyalty. Besides, satisfaction and WoM had a
   mediating effect on the effect of service quality and product diversity
   on loyalty. Thus, it is essential for management to create and increase

Abstract = {{Thin films comprising three dimensional germanium (Ge) quantum dot
   lattices formed by nitrogen (N) assisted magnetron sputtering deposition
   in alumina (Al2O3) matrix have been studied for light harvesting
   purposes. In order to expand the application of this material it is
   necessary to reduce germanium oxidation and to achieve stabilization of
   the germanium/alumina interface. Effects of tuning the N concentration,
   substrate temperature and Ge sputtering power during the films
   preparation are monitored. It is shown that the N presence not only
   reduces Ge oxidation during annealing but also affects the internal
   structure, size and arrangement of Ge quantum dots. Additionally, the
   deposition temperature and Ge sputtering power are used to tune the Ge
   quantum dot size, separation and the regularity of their positions. It
   is shown that the optical and electrical properties of the films,
   especially their photo-induced current, and quantum efficiency are
   strongly tunable by the deposition conditions. Moreover, a significant
   photo-response and effect of multiple exciton generation effect is
   observed. The materials presented could be used as a sensitive layer for
   photodetectors or photovoltaic light harvesting devices. The presented
   tools can be used for future fine tuning of the material to achieve the
   optimal quantum efficiency.}},

   the Pandora's Box?}},
Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article studies Russia's stance on the legal status and regime of
   the Spitsbergen's waters and the logic behind it. Russia has
   traditionally disagreed with the Norwegian policies related to maritime
   areas beyond the Spitsbergen's territorial waters. In respect to both
   the Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ) and the shelf around Spitsbergen,
   Russia has strongly opposed the unilateral nature of the Norwegian
   measures. In the case of the FPZ, Russia has asserted that the maritime
   areas beyond the territorial waters constitute high seas, at the same
   time cooperating with Norway on managing the living resources basing on
   bilateral and international arrangements. Whereas in the case of the
   seabed off Spitsbergen, Russia has recognized that the archipelago
   generates the shelf, which is subject to the Spitsbergen Treaty's
   regime, accepting the equal rights of access to the shelf of all the
   signatories to the Treaty. This article argues that in the long run,
   Russia is interested in maintaining the current status-quo in the issues
   related to the Spitsbergen's waters. The paper also discusses possible
   implications of the 2010 Russia-Norway delimitation Treaty on the
   Russian position towards the Spitsbergen waters.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and
   validity of the Relational Needs Satisfaction Scale (RNSS) in Turkish,
   an inventory that was developed based on Erskine's Relational Needs
   Model. Methods: The study was conducted on a sample of 561 people, which
   consisted of students from faculties of Medicine, Engineering, Law, Fine
   Arts, Health Sciences and Sports Sciences as well as employees from
   Faculty of Medicine in Kocaeli University. Reliability and validity
   analyses were conducted after analysis of the linguistic equivalence of
   the scale. The construct validity of the scale was investigated using
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Experiences in Close
   Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), Scale of Dimensions of Interpersonal
   Relationships (SDIR) and Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) were utilized to
   test convergent validity. To evaluate the reliability of the scale,
   test-retest correlation, Cronbach alfa and total item correlation were
   calculated. Findings: The five-factor structure and the hierarchical
   model was confirmed via CFA. Levels of fit indices were sufficient and
   acceptable for both the five-factor model (chi(2)/df=2.03, RMSEA=0.048,
   CFI=0.928, TLI=0.914, IFI=0.921, AIC=464.211) and the hierarchical model
   (corrected) (chi(2)/df=2.05, RMSEA=0.048, CFI=0.924, TLI=0.912,
   IFI=0.925, AIC=468.610). Cronbach's alpha reliability score was found to
   be 0.83, indicating that the internal consistency of the scale was high.
   The Turkish version of the scale contains 20 items just like the
   original one. Comparison of RNSS with ECR-R, SDIR and SCS revealed that
   convergent validity was ensured. Conclusion: In light of the findings,
   the Turkish version of the RNSS was concluded to be a reliable and valid
   measurement tool and it is suggested that it can be utilized in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive diversity in dental form across mammals and its strong
   relationship with function provides insights into the diet, habitat, and
   behavior, of both extant and extinct taxa. Understanding the extent of
   variation in dental morphology across species allows for more accurate
   identification of fossils and a better ability to infer relationships
   between form and function and ecology. We examined variation in the size
   and shape of the first upper molar among the genus Neotoma. We employed
   elliptical Fourier analysis to quantify differences in the shape of 2D
   outlines for 23 populations and six species of Neotoma, varying in body
   size and habitat preference. As expected, molar length is a strong
   predictor of body size and is significantly and negatively correlated
   with temperature, particularly in species whose ranges span large
   latitudinal gradients. We found that differences in molar shape separate
   species into three general morpho-groups, with no evidence of a
   phylogenetic signal. While outline analysis could not robustly classify
   all molars to the species level, it did perform well for Neotoma
   cinerea, probably because of the greater degree of folding and more
   acute angling of molar lophs. In contrast, wider lophs with shallower
   enamel infolding was characteristic of species specializing on softer,
   more succulent resources (i.e., Neotoma albigula and Neotoma micropus).
   Neotoma floridana were inaccurately classified to species in the
   majority of cases, but were the only molars correctly identified to
   locality 100\% of the time, suggesting that dietary specializations at a
   local level may drive morphological changes within the species as well
   as across the genus.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution seeks to shed light on global dimensions of language
   contact and language change with regard to African youth languages.
   Looking at the influences of Jamaican speech forms on youth language
   practices in Africa, the focus will be on transatlantic linguistic ties
   that link Africa and its Diaspora. As the case studies will illustrate,
   Jamaican has a huge impact on youths in Africa and is used extensively
   in their communicative practices. Music, in this regard, plays an
   important role: Reggae and Dancehall music are highly popular in many
   (especially Anglophone) African countries, and these Jamaican music
   genres are quite influential with regard to language practices among
   African youth and beyond. Music thus represents an important site of
   language contact, and also serves as a means to learn the Jamaican
   language. In our paper we will draw on examples from different African
   countries to illustrate the wide spread of Jamaican influences. Our
   focus will be on case studies in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Ethiopia,
   South Africa and the Gambia. We will discuss selected song examples from
   a sociolinguistic perspective that takes these various language
   practices as a base and then looks at the contexts and motivations for
   the use of Jamaican speech forms.}},

Abstract = {{A rare case of intraosseous cavernous hemangioma was identified in the
   nasal root. Using a combination of endoscopic surgery and open
   rhinoplasty, an osteotomy was performed and resection of the hemangioma
   was successfully achieved with transcolumellar and infracartilaginous
   incisions and 2 stab incisions. No adverse side effects were observed
   after the procedure, no tumor recurrence was observed at the
   16-month-postoperative follow-up. The preserved periosteum contributed
   to the osteogenesis and thus, a need for a reconstructive surgery was
   indicated. The favorable outcomes associated with this approach justify
   and authenticate the use of endoscopy-assisted open rhinoplasty in the
   treatment of intraosseous cavernous hemangiomas without leaving ventral
   surgical scarring. (C) 2019 Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan

Abstract = {{This investigation aimed to compare the cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA)
   plasma present in three trimesters of pregnancy in Torkaman pregnant
   mare. Peripheral blood samples of 32 pregnant mares in three trimesters
   of pregnancy were collected in tubes containing
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at three time points. Circulating cffDNA
   was extracted from 3 mL of maternal plasma. Using outer and inner
   primers, a conventional polymerase chain reaction was performed for the
   sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene present in the Y chromosome. Of the
   total 32 Torkaman pregnant mares, 24 were carrying male fetuses and
   eight were carrying female fetuses. In total, the accuracy of the test
   was 48.75\%, 68.75\%, and 75\% in the first, second, and third
   trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. The sensitivities were 25\%,
   58.32\%, and 66.66\%, respectively, whereas their specificities were
   100\% in all trimesters. In conclusion, the SRY gene can permit the
   detection of equine fetal sex with good accuracy through cffDNA analysis
   in maternal plasma just in the third trimester of pregnancy, although
   specificity in all duration of pregnancy was 100\%. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The nutritional properties of subterranean termite exuviae (shed

   numbers of exuviae is reported here for the Asian subterranean termite,
   Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), an invasive
   and economically important tropical termite species. In this study,
   groups of 1,000 C. gestroi workers from 4-yr-old laboratory colonies (n
   = 3) were allowed to feed on a media pad dyed with Nile Blue A for 2 d.
   Approximately 16\% of the original 1,000 workers did not uptake dye.
   These individuals were then placed into a Petri dish with dyed filter
   paper and checked hourly (10: 00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.) for 7 d. Newly
   molted workers and those individuals that started turning blue were
   removed to prevent feeding on exuviae. An average of 14 workers molted
   per d that yielded an average of 12 exuviae with an overall mean of 86
   exuviae collected over the 7 d study period. We also found the number of
   individuals that acquired dye during the study significantly decreased
   by d. However, variables such as the number of exuviae, newly molted
   individuals, and cadavers were not correlated with d of collection
   because termites molt asynchronously.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Preoperative anxiety has been related with postoperative
   behaviour changes, and it is characterised by subjective feelings. The
   modified Yak Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) is a tool, which
   indicates preoperative anxiety in children older than 2 years. The
   objective of this study was to investigate factors affecting the level
   of preoperative anxiety after conduct validity and reliability of the
   Turkish version of mYPAS.
   Methods: After obtaining approval from the ethics committee, 330
   children aged 5-16 years were included in the study. Relationships be
   tween possible anxiety factors and anxiety levels were evaluated after
   validity and interrater reliability of the Turkish version.
   Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient between the three
   observers was 0.9949(95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.9939-0.9958) for
   the playroom assessments and 0.9932 (95\% CI: 0.9942-0.9960) for the
   operating room assessments. The anxiety level was significantly lower in
   premedicated patients (p<0.001. There was a negative correlation between
   age and anxiety level (p<0.001, r=-0.330).
   Conclusion: The Turkish version of mYPAS has high validity and
   reliability and is suitable for use in the paediatric population of our
   country. Premedication significantly decreased preoperative anxiety, and
   younger patients tended to have higher anxiety level. For the 3-12 years
   age range, the level of anxiety decreased with age. More clinical
   studies are needed to investigate factors that contribute to
   preoperative Anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the college hook up culture and slut discourse. I
   analyze the documentary feature ``Spitting Game: The College Hook Up
   Culture'' that present a provocative sense of the hook up culture.
   Drawing from the narratives of students presented in the documentary, I
   argue that the college hook up culture is bounded with
   heteronormativity, where participants of the culture are performing
   gender positions available to them. I claim that the culture privileges
   masculinity and necessitates heteronormal performances in order for
   students to participate. Often ignored by the discourse of campus crime,
   I argue that women are true victims and they take up sexual performances
   only with great difficulty as articulated with slut discourse.}},

Abstract = {{Since there are more and more highly automated vehicles in road
   transportation with various extremely safety-critical functions, it is
   crucial to intensify the development of testing methods. Following this
   consideration, this paper introduces a new methodological framework for
   evaluating automated vehicle functions. In the first step, the article
   proposes a method to select and calibrate the possibly applied and
   implemented control model. Following this, the developed approach
   suggests the comparison of the performed test results and the identified
   theoretical model outputs by evaluating the similarity of the
   investigated distributions based on statistical hypothesis tests. If the
   distributions of the real system's output and the theoretical model's
   output are close enough to each other, we can assume that the operation
   performance of the real system in the case of the investigated operation
   scenario is acceptable.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the performance of an acoustic radiation force
   impulse (ARFI)-based outcome parameter, the decadic logarithm of the
   variance of acceleration, or log(VoA), for measuring carotid fibrous cap
   thickness. Carotid plaque fibrous cap thickness measurement by log(VoA)
   was compared to that by ARFI peak displacement (PD) in patients
   undergoing clinically indicated carotid endarterectomy using a
   spatially-matched histological validation standard. Fibrous caps in
   parametric log(VoA) and PD images were automatically segmented using a
   custom clustering algorithm, and a pathologist with expertise in
   atherosclerosis hand-delineated fibrous caps in histology. Over 10
   fibrous caps, log(VoA)-derived thickness was more strongly correlated to
   histological thickness than PD-derived thickness, with Pearson
   correlation values of 0.98 for log(VoA) compared to 0.89 for PD. The
   log(VoA)-derived cap thickness also had better agreement with
   histology-measured thickness, as assessed by the concordance correlation
   coefficient (0.95 versus 0.62), and, by Bland-Altman analysis, was more
   consistent than PD-derived fibrous cap thickness. These results suggest
   that ARFI log(VoA) enables improved discrimination of fibrous cap
   thickness relative to ARFI PD and further contributes to the growing
   body of evidence demonstrating ARFI's overall relevance to delineating
   the structure and composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaque for
   stroke risk prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Migrants, and particularly asylum seekers, are at increased
   risk of psychiatric disorders in comparison with natives. At the same
   time, inequalities in access to mental health care are observed.
   Methods: In order to evaluate whether the Parisian public psychiatric
   system is optimally structured to meet the needs of this population, we
   examined data on mental health and service use considering three
   different levels: the global system treatment level, a psychiatric
   reception center, and mobile teams specializing in access to psychiatric
   care for asylum seekers. Results: We found higher treatment rates among
   migrants than among natives (p < 0.001) but inequalities in pathways to
   care: more mandatory admissions (OR = 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.80) and
   fewer specialized consultations (OR = 0.56, 95\% CI: 0.38-0.81). We
   observed a mismatch between increased need and provision of care among
   migrants without stable housing or seeking asylum. Conclusions:
   Inequalities in the provision of care for migrants are observed in the
   Parisian public psychiatric system, particularly for those experiencing
   poor social and economic conditions. There is a need to facilitate
   access to mental health care and develop more tailored interventions to
   reduce discontinuity of care.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Power Flow solution in large scale ill-conditioned systems
   has attracted huge attention. Despite the considerable efforts conducted
   in this line, this issue may be considered an open topic nowadays.
   Consequently, the paper aims at filling this gap by proposing a novel
   robust and efficient Power Flow solution technique inspired by the
   Romberg's Integration Scheme. The resulting algorithm is numerically
   stable and has a computational burden comparable to the Newton's
   technique. Several numerical results in different ill-conditioned
   systems from 3012-, to 13659-bus systems serve to show the performance
   of the developed method. Other available Power Flow solvers are
   considered for comparison. In all studied cases, results obtained with
   the developed method were promising, outperforming the other considered

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. There is an unmet need to develop seizure detection
   algorithms from brain regions outside the epileptogenic cortex. The
   study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of classifying seizures and
   interictal states from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the
   human thalamus-a subcortical region remote to the epileptogenic cortex.
   We tested the hypothesis that spectral and entropy-based features
   extracted from LFPs recorded from the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
   (ANT) can distinguish its state of ictal recruitment from other
   interictal states (including awake, sleep). Approach. Two supervised
   machine learning tools (random forest and the random kitchen sink) were
   used to evaluate the performance of spectral (discrete wavelet
   transform-DWT), and time-domain (multiscale entropy-MSE) features in
   classifying seizures from interictal states in patients undergoing
   stereo-electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation for epilepsy surgery.
   Under the supervision of IRB, field potentials were recorded from the
   ANT in consenting adults with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.
   Seizures were confirmed in the ANT using line-length and visual
   inspection. Wilcoxon rank-sum method was used to test the differences in
   spectral patterns between seizure and interictal (awake and sleep)
   states. Main results. 79 seizures (10 patients) and 158 segments
   (approx. 4 h) of interictal stereo-EEG data were analyzed. The mean
   seizure detection latencies with line length in the ANT varied between
   seizure types (range 5-34 s). However, the DWT and MSE in the ANT showed
   significant changes for all seizure types within the first 20 s after
   seizure onset. The random forest (accuracy 93.9\% and false-positive
   4.6\%) and the random kitchen sink (accuracy 97.3\% and false-positive
   1.8\%) classified seizures and interictal states. Significance. These
   results suggest that features extracted from the thalamic LFPs can be
   trained to detect seizures that can be used for monitoring seizure
   counts and for closed-loop seizure abortive interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Self-standing carbon nanofibers (CNF) were electrospun and tested in
   K-ion batteries (KIP). The comparison of the electrochemical performance
   of KIP using potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) and potassium
   hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) carbonate-based electrolytes revealed that,
   despite the coulombic efficiency is more readily stabilized with KFSI
   than with KPF6, the long-term cycling is quite the same, with a specific
   capacity of 200 mAh.g(-1) for the CNF electrode. Post-mortem X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows a more stable solid
   electrolyte interphase (SEI) for KIP employing KFSI. Finally, the K+ ion
   storage mechanism was investigated by combining cyclic voltammetry and
   operando Raman spectroscopy, showing a combination of adsorption and
   intercalation processes.
   The rate capability is, however, better with the KPF6 salt due to SEI
   layers formed at both CNF and K metal electrode, highlighting that full
   cell may lead to even superior results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a common human pathogen that results in a
   chronic asymptomatic infection in healthy adults. Under conditions of
   immunosuppression, JCPyV spreads to the central nervous system and can
   cause the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal
   leukoencephalopathy (PML), a disease for which there are no vaccines or
   antiviral therapies. Retro-2 is a previously identified small molecule
   inhibitor that was originally shown to block retrograde transport of
   toxins such as ricin toxin from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Retro-2.1 is a chemical analog of
   Retro-2 that has been shown to inhibit ricin intoxication of cells at
   low nanomolar concentrations. Retro-2 has previously been shown to
   prevent retrograde transport of JCPyV virions to the ER, but the effect
   of Retro-2.1 on JCPyV infectivity is unknown. Here it is shown that
   Retro-2.1 inhibits JCPyV with an EC50 of 3.9 mu M. This molecule
   inhibits JCPyV infection at dosages that are not toxic to human tissue
   culture cells. Retro-2.1 was also tested against two other
   polyomaviruses, the human BK polyomavirus and simian virus 40, and was
   also shown to inhibit infection at similar concentrations. Viral
   uncoating studies demonstrate that Retro-2.1 inhibits BKPyV infectivity
   in a manner similar to Retro-2. These studies demonstrate that improved
   analogs of Retro-2 can inhibit infection at lower dosages than Retro-2
   and further optimization of these compounds may lead to effective
   treatment options for those suffering from JCPyV infection and PML.}},

Title = {{Public land privatisation and commodification as a field of changing
   social relations: The making of the Albanian Riviera}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The paper critically explores public land privatisation and
   commodification as a particularly significant field of changing social
   relations. It focuses on Albania's southern coast as it changed from an
   area of rural communities with light vacation and recreation activities
   and re-oriented itself towards international migration networks,
   intensifying coastal tourism, and the gradual making of the Albanian
   Riviera. By providing empirical evidence from fieldwork in the area of
   Himara, along with a review of the legal framework, and through the
   theoretical lenses of neo-liberalism and post-socialism, the paper
   investigates two episodes of public land privatisation and
   commodification: first, the de-collectivisation of cooperative
   agricultural land in the 1990s, and second, the longterm leasing of
   public land for large-scale tourism development since the mid-2000s.
   Analysing these two episodes sheds light on how the state provided the
   respective legal frameworks so as to open up differentiated land
   markets, and on the close relationship between the making of the
   Albanian Riviera, the ``restitution{''} of private ownership, and the
   unmaking of common and collective social relations and significations.
   In turn, the paper argues that public land privatisation and
   commodification have destabilised and qualitatively changed social
   relations centred on the land which had survived from the pre-socialist
   and the socialist eras, by turning them into primarily commodity
   relations. This has also heightened multiple social tensions and
   conflicts, leading to a multiply-contested rural space and the rise of
   new social stratifications, polarisations, and inequalities in the
   post-socialist era.}},

Abstract = {{Mercosur (a.k.a. Mercosul) is a trade bloc comprising five South
   American countries. In 2018, a unified Mercosur license plate model was
   rolled out. Access to large volumes of ground truth Mercosur license
   plates with sufficient presentation variety is a significant challenge
   for training supervised models for license plate detection (LPD) in
   automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) systems. To address this
   problem, a Mercosur license plate generator was developed to generate
   artificial license plate images meeting the new standard with sufficient
   variety for ALPR training purposes. This includes images with variation
   due to occlusions and environmental conditions. An embedded system was
   developed for detecting legacy license plates in images of real
   scenarios and overwriting these with artificially generated Mercosur
   license plates. This data set comprises 3,829 images of vehicles with
   synthetic license plates that meet the new Mercosur standard in real
   scenarios, and equivalent number of text files containing label
   information for the images, all organized in a CSV file with compiled
   image file paths and associated labels. (c) 2020TheAuthors. Published by

Journal = {{TRENDS IN HEARING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have demonstrated that extended high frequencies (EHFs;
   >8 kHz) in speech are not only audible but also have some utility for
   speech recognition, including for speech-in-speech recognition when
   maskers are facing away from the listener. However, the contribution of
   EHF spectral versus temporal information to speech recognition is
   unknown. Here, we show that access to EHF temporal information improved
   speech-in-speech recognition relative to speech bandlimited at 8 kHz but
   that additional access to EHF spectral detail provided an additional
   small but significant benefit. Results suggest that both EHF spectral
   structure and the temporal envelope contribute to the observed EHF
   benefit. Speech recognition performance was quite sensitive to masker
   head orientation, with a rotation of only 15 degrees providing a highly
   significant benefit. An exploratory analysis indicated that pure-tone
   thresholds at EHFs are better predictors of speech recognition
   performance than low-frequency pure-tone thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. - In 2016, the Herault tumor registry collected 1961cancers in
   urology (21.4 \% from all Herault cancers this year). RHESOU was created
   to complete RTH' data with specific parameters in onco-urology. The aim
   of this study is to describe RHESOU and to give some examples with our
   first results.
   Material and methods. - In November 2018, RHESOU (Registry HErault
   Specialised in Onco-Urology) was founded with the same registry
   recommendations. It collects specific oncologic parameters and also
   complete RTH's data. For each urological cancer, a specific survey with
   different choices was performed to collect a maximum of data which could
   be present in patients' file. These surveys were used for urological
   cancers cases that live in Herault in 2017.
   Results. - In 2017, we collected 970 prostate cancers, 581 bladder
   cancers, 212 kidney cancers, 51 upper excretory tract cancers, 28
   testicle cancers and 9 penil cancers. Our urological data collection
   gives many possibilities to create many requests for detailed analysis
   in urological cancers. In this article, we reported data from kidney,
   bladder and prostate cancers.
   Conclusions. - RHESOU is a new toot opened to the different urologic
   corporations (urologists, pathologists, oncologists, radiotherapists,
   radiologists) that permits an overview in urological cancers in Herault.
   Finally, one important aim is that this tool will be adapted when new
   treatments or new important parameters appear in the years ahead. (C)

Abstract = {{The paper presents the case of biodiversity misuse in urban and rural
   areas of Greece during the years of economic recession (2008-2019). The
   hypothesis addressed is that if fiscal crisis and economic recession
   lead to biodiversity misuse, then, even strong conservation strategies
   such as those allegedly implemented in developed countries may not be
   resilient to macro-economic shocks. Empirical data and official
   statistics are combined in an interpretive way. Mechanisms that enable
   criminal misuse of biotic resources in protected areas, forests and
   coastal areas of the country are defined and quantified through specific
   examples of illegal hunting, logging and fishing. They are defined as
   the Active Sampling effect, the Market De-concentration effect and the
   Underground Market effect of crisis. Such crime enablers are not, most
   likely, country-level singularities; they can be generalized both
   through their trans-boundary effects and in view of their interference
   with international conservation strategy and Law.}},

Title = {{Defining postoperative weight change after pancreatectomy: Factors

Abstract = {{Background: Weight change offers the simplest indication of a patient's
   recovery after an operation. There have been no studies that have
   thoroughly investigated postoperative weight dynamics after
   pancreatectomy. The aim of this study was to define postoperative weight
   change after a pancreatectomy and determine factors associated with
   optimal and poor weight trajectories.
   Methods: From 2004 to 2019,1,090 proximal (65\%) and distal (35\%)
   pancreatectomies were performed in patients with adequate data in the
   medical records. Patient weights were acquired preoperatively and at
   postoperative months 1, 3, and 12. Optimal (top quartile, weight
   restoration) and poor (bottom quartile, persistent weight loss)
   postoperative weight cohorts were identified at 1 year postoperatively.
   Results: The median percentage weight change 1 year postpancreatectomy
   was-6.6\% (interquartile range: -1.4\% to -12.5\%), -7.8\% for proximal
   pancreatectomy, and -4.2\% for distal pancreatectomy. For most patients
   (interquartile range cohort), the median percentage weight change at 1,
   3, and 12 months was-6.2\%,-7.2\%, and-6.6\%. The independent factors
   associated with weight restoration were age <65, nonobesity (body mass
   index 30kg/m(2)), receiving total parenteral nutrition/total enteral
   nutrition preoperatively, experiencing preoperative weight loss 10\%,
   distal pancreatectomy, not undergoing vascular resection, and no
   readmission within 30 days. Conversely, persistent weight loss was
   associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists classes III to IV,
   obesity, malignancy, proximal pancreatectomy, blood loss >350mL, and
   experiencing readmission within 30 days. Focusing on pancreatic ductal
   adenocarcinoma (n = 372) patients, the factors associated with
   persistent weight loss were obesity, proximal pancreatectomy, and
   experiencing recurrence within 1 year; however, weight cohorts were not
   associated with overall survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
   patients.
   Conclusion: These data define weight kinetics after pancreatectomy.
   Ultimately, postoperative weight trajectories appear to be largely
   predetermined but may be mitigated by limiting readmissions and
   complications. Clinicians should use these data to identify patients who
   continue to lose weight between the first and third month
   postoperatively with a high suspicion for the requirement of nutritional
   monitoring or other interventions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Estimating the Academic Performance of Secondary Education Mathematics
   Students: A Gain Lift Predictive Model}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several socioeconomic, environmental, ethnic, family, and educational
   factors influence an individual's academic performance and can determine
   their school performance in mathematics. Mathematical competence is one
   of the skills that allow students to build visions of the future from
   performance in the present. However, the perception that students have
   of mathematics, in addition to the teacher-student relationship, the
   classroom, gender, teaching-learning, and motivation are crucial factors
   for achieving an optimal academic performance and preventing school
   failure. The aim of the present study was: (1) to examine which
   variables of the dimensions ``Learning Mathematics{''} and ``School
   Environment{''} significantly contribute to the marks in the second
   quarter and quantify their relative importance; (2) to determine the
   optimal algorithm model for predicting the maximum gain in students'
   marks in the second quarter and quantifying it; and (3) to analyze the
   maximum gain in terms of gender. A total of 2018 high school students in
   Melilla were included in this cross-sectional study. Mathematical
   learning and the school environment were assessed using a validated
   14-item questionnaire. Gain lift was employed to quantify the
   improvement in students' performance. The role of the classroom and
   teacher-student relationship had a greater influence on mathematics
   scores than affinity indicators, teaching, study time, teaching
   resources used, study aids, and motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Tomato fruits are considered as an excellent source of hydrophilic and
   lipophilic antioxidants. It is generally believed that on-vine ripened
   tomatoes are characterized by superior nutritional value comparing to
   post-harvest ripened fruits. The objective of this study was to
   elucidate this belief with respect to antioxidant activity of tomatoes.
   Hydroponically grown cherry type tomatoes Solanum lycopersicum L. var.
   Chiou were harvested at mature green, breaker and red ripe stages.
   Tomatoes at breaker stage were post-harvest ripened at room temperature.
   Total phenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and lycopene content of
   on-vine and post-harvest ripened tomatoes were estimated. The results
   suggest that post-harvest ripening reduced total phenols but increased
   ascorbic acid and lycopene content. Antioxidant activity was evaluated
   with the use of DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. The hydrophilic antioxidant
   activity (HAA) values depended on the assay. DPPH and ORAC methods
   showed higher HAA for post-harvest tomatoes but FRAP estimated higher
   HAA for on-vine ripened fruits. All methods revealed that post-harvest
   ripened tomatoes exhibited significantly higher lipophilic antioxidant
   activity (LAA). The findings revealed that post-harvest ripening had
   contradictory implications to water soluble antioxidants and hence to
   HAA of tomatoes, while LAA levels due to lycopene accumulation were
   significantly increased.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its cleaving protease a
   disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats
   13 (ADAMTS13) are pivotal mediators of thrombosis and are associated
   with the progression of atherosclerosis. We investigated the impact of
   VWF, ADAMTS13 and VWF/ADAMTS13 on long-term major adverse cardiovascular
   outcomes (MACE) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI).
   Methods: We analysed 701 patients undergoing PCI between 2003 and 2006.
   VWF and ADAMTS13 antigen levels were measured before PCI. As primary
   endpoint, we investigated MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality,
   myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke during 8 years of follow-up. As
   secondary endpoint, we investigated all-cause mortality.
   Results: Mean age was 63.8 years, 496 (70.8\%) were male. Acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS) was diagnosed in 347 (49.5\%) patients, stable coronary
   artery disease (SCAD) in 354 (50.5\%). During follow-up 228 (32.5\%)
   patients experienced MACE, and 161 (23.0\%) died. In ACS patients, VWF
   was significantly associated with MACE (HR 1.402 (95\%CI 1.003-1.959), p
   = 0.048), whereas ADAMTS13 and VWF/ADAMTS13 had no predictive value. In
   SCAD, neither VWF, ADAMTS13, nor VWF/ADAMTS13 correlated with MACE. VWF
   was significantly associated with all-cause death in ACS patients (HR
   1.841 (95\%CI 1.187-2.856), p = 0.006), but not in SCAD (1.394 (95\%CI
   0.856-2.269), p = 0.181). ADAMTS13 and VWF/ADAMTS13 were not correlated
   with ACS and SCAD, respectively.
   Conclusion: VWF but not ADAMTS13 and VWF/ADAMTS13 was associated with
   MACE and mortality in patients with ACS but not SCAD. This finding
   highlights the importance of VWF as an essential marker of risk in
   patients with ACS.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: While the intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen
   activator (rt-PA) therapy for acute ischemic stroke patients with cancer
   is recommended when survival of >= 6 months is expected, the risk
   factors for death and stroke recurrence within 6 months after stroke are
   not well known. Thus, we aimed to identify markers for death and
   recurrence risks within six months from stroke onset in patients with
   cancer. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, the
   subjects comprised acute ischemic stroke patients with cancer
   hospitalized at St. Marianna University hospital from 2008 through 2019.
   To evaluate the associations between the clinical factors within 24 h of
   the initial stroke and death or stroke recurrence events within 6 months
   from stroke onset, Logistic analysis and Cox proportional hazards
   regression analysis was used respectively. Next, the optimal cutoff
   point of markers for different mortality groups was determined using the
   receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and cumulative outcome
   rate of each group was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results:
   Among 194 patients with cancer who developed acute stroke, 167 were
   ultimately selected for analysis. 47 subjects (28.14\%) passed away
   within 6 months following stroke onset, and 20 subjects (11.98\%) had
   stroke recurrence. High D-dimer levels, low fibrinogen levels, high
   Glasgow prognostic scores (GPS), and multiple vascular territory
   infarctions was independently associated with death, where higher death
   rate was significantly confirmed in the group with D-dimer levels of >=
   3.95 mg/dl, fibrinogen levels <277.5 mg /dl and GPS scores of 2. Low
   fibrinogen level, lack of antithrombotic therapy, and the presence of
   metastasis were associated with stroke recurrence. Conclusions: When
   patients with cancer suffer stroke, D-dimer levels, fibrinogen levels,
   GPS, and multiple vascular territory infarctions would be associated
   with the risk of death within 6 months. Low fibrinogen levels, lack of
   antithrombotic therapy, and the presence of metastasis correlated with
   high risk of stroke recurrence.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a short-term wind power forecasting model for the
   next day based on historical marine weather and corresponding wind power
   output data. Due the large amount of historical marine weather and wind
   power data, we divided the data into clusters using the data regression
   (DR) algorithm to get meaningful training data, so as to reduce the
   number of modeling data and improve the efficiency of computing. The
   regression model was constructed based on the principle of the least
   squares support vector machine (LSSVM). We carried out wind speed
   forecasting for one hour and one day and used the correlation between
   marine wind speed and the corresponding wind power regression model to
   realize an indirect wind power forecasting model. Proper parameter
   settings for LSSVM are important to ensure its efficiency and accuracy.
   In this paper, we used an enhanced bee swarm optimization (EBSO) to
   perform the parameter optimization for LSSVM, which not only improved
   the forecast model availability, but also improved the forecasting
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer cells are dysregulated and addicted to continuous supply and
   metabolism of nutritional glucose and amino acids (e.g., arginine) to
   drive the synthesis of critical macromolecules for uncontrolled growth.
   Recent studies have revealed that genome-derived microRNA (miRNA or
   miR)-1291-5p (miR1291-5p or miR-1291) may modulate the expression of
   argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) and glucose transporter protein type 1
   (GLUT1). We also developed a novel approach to produce recombinant
   miR-1291 agents for research, which are distinguished from conventional
   chemo-engineered miRNA mimics. Herein, we firstly demonstrated that
   bioengineered miR-1291 agent was selectively processed to high levels of
   target miR1291-5p in human pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. After the
   suppression of ASS1 protein levels, miR-1291 perturbed arginine
   homeostasis and preferably sensitized ASS1-abundant L3.3 cells to
   arginine deprivation therapy. In addition, miR1291 treatment reduced the
   protein levels of GLUT1 in both AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells, leading to a
   lower glucose uptake (deceased > 40\%) and glycolysis capacity (reduced
   approximately 50\%). As a result, miR-1291 largely improved cisplatin
   efficacy in the inhibition of PC cell viability. Our results
   demon-strated that miR-1291 was effective to sensitize PC cells to
   arginine deprivation treatment and chemotherapy through targeting ASS1-
   and GLUT1-mediated arginolysis and glycolysis, respectively, which may
   provide insights into understanding miRNA signaling underlying cancer
   cell metabolism and development of new strategies for the treatment of
   lethal PC.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
   Many anticancer drugs in clinical use and under investigation exert
   pharmacological effects or improve efficacy of coadministered
   medications by targeting cancer cell metabolism. Using new recombinant
   miR-1291 agent, we revealed that miR-1291 acts as a metabolism modulator
   in pancreatic carcinoma cells through the regulation of
   argininosuccinate synthase- and glucose transporter protein type
   1-mediated arginolysis and glycolysis. Consequently, miR-1291
   effectively enhanced the efficacy of arginine deprivation (pegylated
   arginine deiminase) and chemotherapy (cisplatin), offering new insights
   into development of rational combination therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Pterostilbene (Pte) can attenuate symptoms associated with ischemic

   Then the protective effects of Pte on SH-SY5Y cells and mice were
   assessed with a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. The results of
   microarray showed that 353 miRs were dys-expressed under the Pte
   treatment, including 108 up-regulated and 245 down-regulated
   miRs.MiR-21-5p showed the highest sensitivity to Pte. Pte suppressed
   apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, improved tissue structure, and reduced
   infarct area in mice by inducing miR-21-5p and inhibiting PDCD4. By
   suppressing miR-21-5p level, the effects of Pte on SH-SY5Y cells were
   counteracted. Pte showed protective function on both neurons and
   cerebral tissues against IS injuries, and the function was associated
   with the induced miR-21-5p level.}},

Title = {{Greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity over Bi2WO6 by MIL-53 (Fe)
   modification}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{110}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Photocatalysis is one of the most promising techniques for degrading
   organic dyes under ambient conditions, due to that it has the
   characteristics of green and environmentally friendly. However,
   inhibited by the rapid recombination of the photogenerated charges and
   the low utilization of visible light, this process requires efficient
   photocatalysts to solve those problems. Herein, we report our recently
   finding that the MIL-53(Fe)/Bi2WO6 heterostructure as a high-efficient
   photocatalyst for Rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol degradation with
   excellent performance and photocatalytic stability. The catalytic rate
   constant of MIL-53(Fe)/Bi2WO6 (5 wt\% MIL-53(Fe) for RhB and phenol
   degradation are 3.75 and 3.27 times higher than that of pur Bi2WO6,
   respectively. By introducing MIL-53(Fe) into Bi2WO6, the specific
   surface area becomes larger exposing more active sites and the band-gap
   width becomes narrower, which increases transfer rate of photogenerated
   electrons to the surface enhancing the electron-hole separation.
   Moreover, it also increased the absorption of visible light and improved
   the photocatalytic activity, which forcefully demonstrate that
   MIL-53(Fe)/Bi2WO6 is a promising photocatalyst for the removal of
   organic pollutants. Finally, the possible mechanism of photocatalytic
   degradation was discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents an analytical description of the Siberian
   dialectological materials of the founder of the Tomsk Dialectological
   School Alexander Dmitrievich Grigoriev, a Russian ethnographer,
   historian, dialectologist, folklorist, and public figure. Grigoriev's
   dialectological materials are records of the Russian Siberian dialect
   speech of the first third of the 20th century. They have practically not
   been described in the domestic studies and have not been introduced into
   the research discourse. Grigoriev's research and teaching activities at
   Tomsk University are Siberian dialectological studies. He investigates
   the Russian dialects of Siberia, organizes expeditions and actively
   participates in them. The materials collected during these expeditions
   were the basis for further research of the Russian dialects of Siberia,
   which Grigoriev continued in Czechoslovakia. His personal handwritten
   and typewritten archival fund is stored in Prague. Part of Grigoriev's
   Prague archive is housed in the Slavonic Library, a division of the
   National Library of the Czech Republic (Clementinum, Prague). It is here
   that the Siberian dialectological materials this article describes are
   located. The archive under study includes (1) several copies of the
   publication Program for Collecting Information Necessary for Compiling a
   Dialectological Map of the Russian Language in Siberia: North Great
   Russian and Middle Great Russian Dialects by A.D. Grigoriev, and (2)
   handwritten records of the speech of Siberians made during
   dialectological expeditions. The Program was analyzed for its content
   and the nature of handwritten notes, including researchers' and
   respondents ones. The expedition materials were analyzed for the
   information they contain and for the organization of their recording. As
   a result, it has been revealed that Grigoriev's dialectological
   materials consistently reflect the specifics of the research paradigm
   linguistics used at the origins of dialectological studies. The notes
   that are significant for the study can also be used for solving modern
   dialectological problems. The materials of the studied archive
   correspond to the initial stage of the formation of methods of field
   linguistics.}},

Title = {{A network model for stemflow solute transport}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{266-282}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{While the role of stemflow in directing and concentrating water and
   nutrients at the tree base is rarely in dispute, its mathematical
   representation remains a subject of inquiry and research. A network
   model that seeks to estimate stemflow solute concentration and leaching
   is proposed. The model accommodates the physico-chemical properties of
   individual furrows embedded within the tree bark and their
   interconnections. The within-furrow equations for water and solute
   transport that include leaching are first developed and integrated along
   a rough-bark network topology to describe solute concentration and
   fluxes out of the network. The model is parameterized using published
   data on stemflow, field measurements of bark geometry, and laboratory
   experiments on bark leaching for potassium, magnesium, and calcium. The
   parameterization is intended to impose plausibility constraints and not
   to test model predictions at a particular site, a single event, or an
   individual experiment. The outflow concentration is then analyzed as a
   function of the network complexity that includes asymmetry in the
   lengths or subpaths connecting network nodes. For a symmetric network,
   an effective `channel-flow' analogy may be used to represent solute
   concentration at the outflow. However, as the asymmetry increases in
   subpath lengths, the efficiency of the bark network at moving solutes
   diminishes for the same rainfall input onto the stem. The network
   representation featured here is by no means offering a `finality' to the
   stemflow mathematical representation. It must be viewed as an embryonic
   step that opens up the possibility of using modern advances in network
   theories to link rainfall properties to stemflow water and solute input
   from a variety of tree species with differing bark microrelief
   configurations into the soil. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Fenugreek is an important winter leafy vegetable in Pakistan
   with high nutritional values. Its seeds are used as spices and whole
   plant is used in many home remedies and medicine throughout the world.
   Its foliage and seed productivity is much low in the region. Plant
   growth regulators (PGRs) and vitamins (riboflavin) can be useful for the
   enhancement of plant productivity.
   Methods: Treatments of indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)) and riboflavin (50 mmol L-1 each) were applied as foliar spray
   after 14 days of sowing on fenugreek variety Kasuri Methi. Experiment
   was arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) with six
   replicates.
   Result: Result showed that GA(3) and IAA has significantly enhanced the
   root and shoot development, foliage growth and ions concentrations,
   peroxidase (POD) and catalases (CAT) activities. PGRs also increased the
   pod and seed yield of fenugreek. Riboflavin did not show any significant
   effect on fenugreek except increased the antioxidant activities at
   seedling stage. GA(3) was more effective as compared to IAA for the
   enhancement biomass production, yield and biochemical attributes of
   fenugreek. It was determined that IAA and GA(3) can be used to enhance
   the foliage biomass production and yield but GA(3) is superior over IAA
   in fenugreek. These outcomes can be useful for economic benefits with
   high production of this leafy vegetable.}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can cross the blood brain barrier, thus can
   be used as nanocarriers in brain drug delivery. However, the effect of
   bare and polyethylene glycol-modified (PEGylated) AuNPs on normal neural
   function has not been extensively investigated. In this study,
   bioelectrical properties of neuronal functions of male BALB/c mice were
   explored ex vivo and in vivo by using 5 nm bare AuNPs and PEGylated
   AuNPs. Electrophysiological properties of neurons from hippocampal CA1
   region sections were recorded by patch clamp method. Ex vivo, firing
   rate of action and membrane potentials in response to negative current
   stimuli significantly altered only after bare AuNP exposure compared to
   control (p < 0.05). After in vivo injections, anxiety levels of animals
   were similar. Amplitude of action potentials reduced only in bare AuNP
   group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, excitability of hippocampal neurons is
   increasing with bare AuNP exposure, and PEGylation might be more
   biocompatible for medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We evaluated the association between type 2 diabetes and gout by a
   retrospective cohort study.
   Methods: Data of 17,259 male and 18,318 female patients with type 2
   diabetes were retrieved for the 1998-2010 period. These patients were
   matched to a comparison group (n = 34,518 and n = 36,636, respectively)
   in a 1:2 ratio by age and region.
   Results: We found that patients with type 2 diabetes after adjustment
   for hyperlipidemia and hypertension had a lower risk of incident gout
   than the matched population (incidence rate ratio, men: 0.39 {[}95\% CI:
   0.36-0.42]; women: 0.78 {[}0.72-0.84]). Specifically, type 2 diabetes
   alone without hyperlipidemia and hypertension was associated with a
   reduced risk of incident gout in men (adjusted relative risk {[}RR]:
   0.29, 95\% CI: 0.22-0.39), but not in women (0.86, 95\% CI: 0.55-1.36).
   We found that insulin users with hyperlipidemia and hypertension
   associated with risk of incident gout and no sex-specific differences
   were noted (adjusted RR, men: 1.28 {[}95\% CI: 1.11-1.48]; women: 1.32
   {[}95\% CI: 1.14-1.53]). Specifically, insulin users alone without
   hyperlipidemia and hypertension were not statistically significantly
   associated with gout risk (P > .0954).
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that hyperlipidemia and
   hypertension modified the association between type 2 diabetes and gout.

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{An experimental campaign was initiated to determine the high-speed
   pullout behavior of deep-mounted carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   strips bonded with a flexible, visco-elasto-plastic adhesive to clay
   brick masonry. A total of 14 direct pull-tests were conducted. Strong
   correlations were found between both the pull-out strength/bonded length
   relation and the pull-out strength/loading rate relation. The governing
   failure mechanism was either cohesive failure combined with brick
   splitting, or CFRP rupture without significant damage to the masonry
   prism. From the strain gauge readings, multiple bond-slip correlations
   were constructed and eventually generalized and simplified to a global,
   multi-linear bond-slip relation. Using the global bond-slip law as part
   of a partial-interaction analysis resulted in a good fit with the
   experimental results. Finally, the results of this study were compared
   to previous direct pull-tests found in literature, showing that the
   application of a flexible adhesive results in higher interfacial
   fracture energy and higher debonding slip.}},

Abstract = {{When Boston entered its pandemic lockdown in early March, it forced the

   Far from seeing Plimoth as a minor backwater in the English settlement

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper reconsiders the contribution of Henry Ludwell Moore to
   dynamic economics through the use of harmonic analysis. We show that
   Moore's analysis is innovative in its use of the Fourier transformation
   for the identification of cycles with different periodicities. This
   enables Moore to identify cycles of longer length with more precision
   than would be the case for the standard methodology. We are able to
   replicate the main features of his results and confirm the existence of
   a rainfall cycle with a periodicity similar to that of the business
   cycle (eight years). However, we find that the evidence for a longer
   (thirty-three-year) rainfall cycle is weaker than Moore indicates. We
   also argue that a central theme of Moore's analysis-the relationship
   among rainfall, agricultural productivity, and the business cycle-marks
   an early precursor of the ``real business cycle{''} approach. George
   Stigler's (1962) dismissal of Moore's work on cycles as ``a complete
   failure{''} is therefore, in our opinion, unfair. Instead, we argue
   that, although his work is certainly flawed, it nevertheless deserves a
   place in both the history of business cycle theory and empirical
   economics.}},

Journal = {{INDIANA LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{This Article examines recent circuit-split-creating federal appeals
   courts' decisions interpreting and applying Title VII of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1964's prohibition of sex discrimination in unenvisaged
   cases presenting an issue not contemplated by the United States Congress
   when it enacted the statute: is anti-LGBTQ discrimination unlawful sex
   discrimination? Whether sexual-orientation discrimination constitutes
   sex discrimination has been answered in the affirmative by the United
   States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Hively v. Ivy Tech
   Community College of Indiana and the Second Circuit in Zarda v. Altitude
   Express, Inc., and in the negative by the Eleventh Circuit in Bostock v.
   Clayton County Board of Education. In EEOC v. R.G. \& G.R. Harris
   Funeral Homes, Inc., the Sixth Circuit held that a plaintiff could
   pursue her transgender-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination claim;
   thereafter, the Fifth Circuit's Wittmer v. Phillips 66 Company decision
   held that binding circuit precedent foreclosed such an action.
   This Article discusses the interpretive approaches chosen and applied by
   courts and individual judges in recognizing or rejecting Title VII
   anti-LGBTQ discrimination claims, with special reference to (1) the
   meaning of Title VIIs ``because of sex{''} prohibition, (2) the Supreme
   Court's and circuit courts' construction of the sex discrimination
   provision in the context of sex stereotyping and gender nonconformity
   discrimination as applied to the anti-LGBTQ discrimination question, and
   (3) associational discrimination theory. This Article concludes that
   judicial recognition of anti-LGBTQ claims best comports with Title VII
   `s sex discrimination ban as interpreted over the years by the Supreme
   Court and more recently in Hively, Zarda, and R.G. \& G.R. Funeral
   Homes. Is anti-LGBTQ discrimination unlawful sex discrimination? Yes.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Packed-bed thermal energy storage (TES) is a cost-effective storage
   option for high temperature applications. This study aims to accurately
   model the behavior of a packed-bed TES system during transient operation
   while maintaining low computation time. This is realized through the
   development of a novel 1D x 1D model accounting for intra-particle
   conduction - the first dimension representing the overall device in the
   axial direction, and the second dimension representing spherical storage
   particles in the radial direction. An experimental system was
   constructed to validate the simulation model. Temperatures at the system
   outlet and in the center of the storage bed were predicted within 3.75\%
   and 3.54\% of experimental results, respectively. The validated model
   was then used to predict the behavior of different materials suitable
   for large-scale applications, such as stone, concrete, and steel. The
   potential error due to applying the uniform temperature approximation
   was investigated on different Biot number configurations. A relative
   error greater than 55\% between surface and particle center temperatures
   was identified for a system with a Biot number of 3. The novel modeling
   methodology realized computation times similar to models not accounting
   for this phenomenon, an 87\% improvement upon previous work
   investigating similar methods, with prediction accuracy remaining
   unaffected.}},

   measurements obtained by two raters and by the FSST and TUG.
   Results: The FSST and TUG scores were strongly correlated (r=0.685,
   p=0.001). The FSST was able to distinguish between children by age
   groups (p=0.001). The ICC2.1 and ICC2.2 estimates were 0.86 and 0.81,
   respectively. For the assessments of two raters, the Bland-Altman plot
   showed that all values fell within 95\% limits of agreement. Bias was
   calculated as -0.12 +/- 0.50. The 96\% of the data points were within
   the +/- 1.96 SD of the mean difference for the FSST and TUG scores. Bias
   was calculated as 0.47 +/- 0.80.
   Conclusion: The FSST is a valid and reliable test to assess the dynamic
   balance of typically developed children. However, the FSST cannot be
   substituted for the TUG.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the degree of mold contamination
   and mycotoxin levels in commercially available green coffee products and
   dietary supplements with green coffee extract. The study included 34
   samples from green coffee products: raw beans (n = 16), ground coffee (n
   = 15) and instant coffee (n = 3), as well as 22 samples from dietary
   supplements in form of capsules (n = 19), tablets (n = 2) and sachets (n
   = 1). Total mold count was determined with spread-plate method.
   Anamorphic mold were identified based on their microscopic morphology
   and the type of sporulation. Concentrations of mycotoxins, ochratoxin A
   and citrinin, were quantified by means of HPLC-fluorescence detection.
   Molds, typically Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp., were found in
   94\% of green coffee beans, 100\% of ground and instant coffee samples,
   and 55\% of dietary supplement samples. None of the samples contained
   detectable levels of citrinin. Ochratoxin A (0.4 ng/g) was detected in
   only one sample of raw green coffee beans, but in up to 40\% and 67\% of
   ground and instant coffee samples, respectively. Mean concentrations of
   ochratoxin A in ground and instant coffee samples were 3.28 ng/g and
   4.09 ng/g, respectively, and maximum concentrations amounted to 6.65
   ng/g and 7.44 ng/g, respectively. Ochratoxin A (mean concentration 9.60
   ng/g, maximum level 31.4 ng/g) was also detected in up to 58\% of the
   supplement capsules, but in none of tablets and sachets.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic value of an ultrasound-guided
   subscapular local anesthetic and cortisone injection in a consecutive
   series of patients who underwent an arthroscopic superior medial
   scapuloplasty for snapping scapula syndrome (SSS) and had been
   refractory to conservative treatment. Methods: We undertook an
   arthroscopic superior medial scapuloplasty on patients with a clinical
   diagnosis of SSS who had failed a structured physiotherapy program and
   had either gained a good response or no to minimal response to
   preoperative ultrasound-guided subscapular local anesthetic and
   cortisone injection. The patients were assessed preoperatively and at
   final follow-up with the QuickDASH and Constant scores, and their pain
   was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Between January
   2009 and December 2016, 47 patients were included in the study, with a
   minimal follow-up of 2 years. There were 29 female and 18 male patients,
   and the mean age at the time of surgery was 27.4 years (range 15 to 61).
   Forty-two patients were available at final follow-up. There were 31
   patients in the good response group and 11 patients in the no to minimal
   response group. For all patients, the mean time to follow-up was 41.8
   months (range 24 to 108). There was a significant improvement after
   surgery in the mean QuickDASH score (from 39 to 20, P < .001) (minimal
   clinically important difference {[}MCID] 15.91) , Constant score (from
   57 to 87, P < .001) (MCID 10.4), and VAS (from 6 to 2, P < .001) (MCID
   3). For the good response group, there was a significant improvement
   after surgery in the mean QuickDASH score (from 38 to 18, P < .001)
   (MCID 15.91), the Constant score (from 57 to 89) (MCID 10.4), and the
   VAS (from 6 to 2, P < .001) (MCID 3). For the no to minimal response
   group, there was a significant improvement after surgery in the mean
   QuickDASH score (from 42 to 24, P < .01) (MCID 15.91), the Constant
   score (from 58 to 80, P < .002) (MCID 10.4), and the VAS (from 6 to 2, P
   < .01) (MCID 3). The difference in postoperative improvement of the
   QuickDASH and Constant scores between the good response and the no to
   minimal response groups was statistically significant (P < .05).
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that arthroscopic
   scapuloplasty can lead to a significant improvement in pain and function
   in all patients with a clinical diagnosis of snapping scapula syndrome
   refractory to conservative treatment. Patients who gained a good
   transient response to a preoperative ultrasound-guided subscapular
   cortisone injection obtained a significantly better recovery than those
   who did not. A preoperative ultrasound-guided subscapular cortisone
   injection appeared to be of prognostic value.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{A 2-dimensional numerical model of a room temperature operating Active
   Magnetic Regenerator (AMR) that comprises of a regenerator, hot and cold
   heat exchangers, heat transfer fluid is developed. The regenerator is
   made of a magnetocaloric material (MCM) which heats up upon applying a
   magnetic field, H, and cools down when the field is removed; thus,
   making it the most essential part of an AMR. The model takes
   experimentally measured ATad(H,T) and the Cp(H,T) data as input and
   provides quantitative performance metrics of the magnetic cooling
   system, such as ATspan and the cooling load, as output. With this model,
   it is possible to assess a wide range of MCMs in an AMR. 4 different
   MCMs were investigated using this model in terms of their ATspan and the
   cooling loads-LaFe10.96Co0.97Si1.07, MnFeP(1-x)As(x) and AlFe2B2 and Gd.
   During the screening of MCMs, all the important operating conditions of
   the device were fixed such as the fluid flow rate, ambient temperature,
   cycle duration, magnetic field strength. Our results indicate that Gd
   exhibits the maximum Tspan with respectable cooling load, while AlFe2B2
   generates the lowest Tspan. Even though LaFeCoSi compound did not
   perform as well as Gd, it could be the MCM choice for the realization of
   magnetic refrigeration on a global scale due to its much lower cost. (c)

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify the influence of the socioeconomic
   attributes and environmental contexts of citizens' residential areas on
   the access and use of green areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   results can aid policymaking and facilitate the safe and unrestricted
   use of green areas during the pandemic. The access and use of green
   areas were analyzed using a survey conducted after the official COVID-19
   emergency in Japan (16 April to 14 May, 2020). Visits to green areas
   during the pandemic have gained salience globally from multiple
   perspectives: health, planning, social justice, and equity. The results
   of this study demonstrated that socioeconomic factors influenced the
   frequency of visiting green areas. The factors further influenced the
   use of the three categories of green areas (parks, agricultural lands,
   and gardens). Environmental contexts, including the land use patterns in
   residential areas, also influenced the use of specific types of green
   areas. Thus, policies need to further facilitate visits to green areas
   by reflecting the socioeconomic attributes of residents and their
   households, including income, number of children, gender, and age,

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced
   plastic (CFRP) laminate with a punched hole were investigated. During
   the punching process, pressure was applied to the laminate through the
   upper and lower blank holders of a punching machine; the clearance
   between the punch and blank holders was set to be small to suppress
   damage in the CFRP laminates. Due to the dragging of plies encountered
   during punching, the surface of the punched hole was relatively uneven
   as compared to that of the drilled hole. However, the effect of the
   uneven surface created during the punching process was not as
   significant on the tensile and compressive strength of the open hole as
   compared to the manufacturing damages generated by drilling processes.
   The stress-number of cycles to failure curves for the open-hole
   tension-tension fatigue tests also showed comparable results between the
   punched- and drilled-hole specimens. These results indicate that there
   were no significant differences in the mechanical properties of CFRP
   laminates with a punched hole, and thus present the possibility of a
   highly productive hole-making process using the punching method.}},

Journal = {{DYES AND PIGMENTS}},

Abstract = {{A series of 2-(2-phenyl)benzotriazole derivatives having amino, N-methyl
   amino, and acetamido groups on the ortho position of the phenyl group
   were synthesized to elucidate the effects of amino/amido substitutions
   on the molecular structures and photophysical properties. 1H NMR spectra
   and DFT calculations of the present dyes revealed the formation of N-H
   center dot center dot center dot N intramolecular hydrogen bonds between
   benzotriazole and amino/amide groups in the ground state.
   Amino-functionalized dyes showed absorption bands that were assigned to
   HOMOLUMO transition with a partial charge-transfer feature. The dye with
   an acetoamido group in which the acidity of NH proton was increased by
   the effect of electron-withdrawing acetyl groups exhibited absorption
   bands attributable to intramolecular hydrogen-bonded ``closed{''}
   conformers in CHCl3 and non-hydrogen-bonded ``open{''} conformers in
   DMSO. In comparison to 2-phenylbenzotriazole, which had no acidic proton
   involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the present derivatives
   exhibited weak fluorescence emissions with quite low quantum yields,
   suggesting that non-radiative deactivation of ESIPT states also operated
   in the N-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonded
   2-phenylbenzotriazoles just as in O-H center dot center dot center dot N
   intramolecular hydrogen-bonded 2-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, which are
   known as UV absorbers. Taking a closer look at the fluorescence spectra,
   dyes with amino and N-methylamino groups showed faint but dual emissions
   from charge-transfer excited states in CHCl3 and blue-shifted single
   emission in DMSO. Fluorescence emissions of the acetamido-functionalized
   dye were unimodal in each solvent and stronger than those of
   amino-functionalized dyes. Thus, the fluorescence properties of these
   dyes depended on substitutions at amino groups. The luminescence of
   these derivatives was enhanced in the polymer matrix in which
   conformation changes and molecular motions were suppressed. Dye doped
   polymer films have absorption bands in the UV range (360-400 nm) and
   emitted at the visible region (450-510 nm), and thus could be used as
   organic materials for light conversion films that convert UV light into
   visible light.}},

Abstract = {{One of the intractable problems of Africa is socioeconomic development.
   It is a ``wicked problem{''} that has defied decades of tinkering and
   tweaking of economic policies and government interventions. Like many
   African governments that succeeded oppressive colonial governments, many
   religious organizations frequently promise their members the help of
   divine power to deliver development. African Pentecostalism, especially
   the prosperity variant, has been at the forefront of promising to make
   its members healthy and wealthy through divine means. How the theology
   of plenty and healing has practically improved the economic and
   therapeutic systems of Africa is a question of debate. Some scholars, in
   line with pentecostal self-representation, claim that Pentecostalism
   inspires development from below. This essay critiques this self-image of
   African Pentecostalism in the context of African economic indices and
   the raging and ravaging coronavirus disease pandemic. The COVID-19
   pandemic presents an important challenge but also an opportunity to test
   the doctrines and claims of pentecostal leaders. In the attempt to cater
   to leaders' economic self-interest, pentecostal responses to the
   pandemic have, however, been uncoordinated and have failed adequately to
   mobilize resources that serve its members and the larger society in
   their moment of needs.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir spot welding has a great impact on the joining process of
   thermoplastics. In this work, effects of varying rotational speed,
   plunge depth, and dwell time were investigated on polycarbonate sheets
   and a filler sheet was utilized to reduce the keyhole size of friction
   stir spot welded joints. The welding parameters were arranged according
   to Taguchi L-9 orthogonal design of experiments to determine the optimum
   levels of process parameters. Lap shear tests were performed to examine
   the mechanical properties. Using analysis of variance and signal to
   noise ratio, influences of each welding parameter on the lap joint shear
   load were evaluated. According to achieved results, tool rotational
   speed has the highest effect while plunge depth has minimum effect on
   the mechanical behavior of friction stir spot welded joints. Optimum
   process parameters were attained as 1000 min(-1) for rotational speed,
   10.5 mm of plunge depth, and 40 s of dwell time. Optimized process
   parameters showed 15 \% improvement compared to the initial welding
   parameters. Cross-sectional appearances of welded samples which play an
   important role in determining lap joint shear load were analyzed by
   morphological and visual comparisons. Failure modes of the fractured
   samples for lowest, moderate and highest lap joint shear loads were also

Abstract = {{As electric vehicles (EVs) are currently under-utilised, the features of
   deploying EVs as distributed energy resources (DERs), based on an EV as
   a service (EVaaS) framework, are exploited and a resource allocation
   scheme is proposed for optimum association of dispersed EVs with
   critical load for demand fulfilment in microgrids. The proposed approach
   is based on a combined economic emission (CEE) optimisation model where
   both energy costs and carbon emissions are taken into account. The CEE
   optimisation problem is then formulated as a bi-objective optimisation
   problem, considering a number of practical constraints, such as energy
   demand, cost budget, emission limit and charging station limit. Carbon
   price is introduced to convert the bi-objective problem into a single
   objective function. The authors included EV battery degradation cost to
   ensure EV owners are not worse off after EVaaS participation. The
   feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated in simulation studies.
   The approach has been extended to evaluate the trade-off between EVaaS
   and conventional DERs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of
   the proposed resource allocation scheme.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{743-754}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Body size evolution is generally framed by the benefits of being large,
   while costs are largely overlooked. An important putative cost of being
   large is the need to extend development periods, which should increase
   exposure to predation and potentially select against larger size. In
   birds, this selection pressure can be important because predation is the
   main source of offspring mortality and predators should more readily
   detect the larger nests associated with larger body sizes. Here, we show
   for diverse passerine birds across the world that counter to
   expectations, larger species suffer lower daily nest predation rates
   than smaller species. This pattern is consistent despite latitudinal
   variation in predation and does not seem to reflect a tendency of larger
   species to use more protected nests or less exposed nest locations.
   Evidence instead suggests that larger species attack a wider array of
   predator sizes, which could reduce predation rates in nests of
   large-bodied species. Regardless of the mechanism, the lower daily nest
   predation rates of larger species yield slightly lower predation rates
   over the entire development period compared with smaller species. These
   results highlight the importance of behavior as a mechanism to alter
   selection pressures and have implications for body size evolution.}},

   performed for data from 1981 to 2018 at 00 UTC for five main isobaric
   surfaces (MISs): 850, 700, 500, 300 and 200 hPa and for the tropopause.
   It was found that the tropospheric temperature variability is highest in
   the cold months of the year and lowest in summer. Annual temperature
   variability in the upper troposphere is less than in the lower.
   Temperature trends for the MISs from 850 to 300 hPa for the year and
   summer are positive and almost everywhere statistically significant at a
   significance level of .05. For a year, they average from about 0.2
   degrees C to 0.5 degrees C/decade. In summer, they are slightly greater
   and are 0.4-0.5 degrees C. On the MIS of 200 hPa over Poland, however,
   there are negative thermal trends, both in the year and in summer. They
   are approximately -0.1 degrees C/decade. In winter, the trends are much
   smaller than in the summer or for the year. In the lower troposphere
   they are weak and positive, while in the upper troposphere they are weak
   and negative. Negative tendencies in the thermal tropopause over Poland
   were found. For the year and seasons, this trend ranges from -0.2 to
   -0.3 degrees C/decade. The obtained results regarding the temperature of
   the troposphere and tropopause over Poland correspond with the results
   of earlier studies from Europe and the around world. They confirm the
   warming of the lower and cooling of the upper troposphere with the
   tropopause, which has been taking place in the last few decades.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Andes are characterized by the early emergence of complex
   societies and a chequered yet continuous cultural tradition. However, at
   least for certain points of time in the cultural development, the
   overall cohesiveness of this `culture area' has been called into
   question, favoring an alternative perspective that emphasizes the
   existence of several relatively independent nuclei of development on the
   North Coast, the southern Peruvian Highlands and the Titicaca basin,
   with distinct cultural expressions and political organization. Here, we
   engage archaeological evidence and its interpretation with newly
   emerging perspectives from linguistics and genetics (modern and ancient
   DNA), including new targeted genetic analysis, to add fresh evidence to
   the question of the internal structure and cohesiveness of the ancient
   Central Andes as a culture area. The double cultural/biological approach
   points at a North vs. South structure bisecting the Central Andes that
   becomes appreciable similar to 2,000 years ago; however, as the evidence
   from all three disciplines indicates, too, the spheres have remained
   connected and hence maintained an overall cohesiveness. Our analysis
   suggests that demographic population structure precedes the constitution
   of distinct cultural domains, a pattern which is to be verified in other
   chronological transects in South America and at a global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Habib Baba (d.1847) is one of the important figures who left permanent
   marks on the people of Erzurum. Although he has wide reputation among
   the people, there is not enough information about his life and his Sufi
   aspect in sources. Although rumours and legends about him contain some
   information about his personality, they do not provide enough
   information about his life and his Sufi personality. For this reason, it
   is important to reveal new information about such an important person in
   terms of this study. In the article, some questions about Habib Baba
   will be answered in the light of archive documents, such as whether he
   is a sect sheikh, and if he is a sect sheikh, whether he has a dervish
   lodge in the Erzurum region, and whether he left someone instead of him
   or not. As a result of the examinations on documents of the presidency
   of the republic of Turkey state archives, it is learned that Habib Baba
   was a Qadiri order sheikh and he served as a sheikh in dervish lodge
   assigned to him in Erzurum, and he left a caliph named Ahmad Mushraf
   after him. In addition, new pieces of information were reached in the
   archive documents about Habib Baba's family, the allocation of his
   salary, the repair and providing food of his dervish lodge.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of ligninolytic enzymes from fermented wheat bran derived
   upon growth of Stereum ostrea under optimal conditions was carried out
   with 20 ml of six different solvents - acetate buffer, phosphate buffer,
   citrate buffer, lactate buffer, succinate buffer and distilled water. Of
   all the solvents tested, phosphate buffer appeared to be the appropriate
   buffer for optimum recovery of all the three enzymes. Optimization of
   different volumes of phosphate buffer reveals that 25m1 of solvent
   causes the maximum recovery of all the enzymes. Duration of soaking of
   fermented bran for recovery of enzymes was optimized by incubating
   fermented bran with solvent for different intervals - 30, 60 and 120
   minutes. Thirty minute duration was optimum for maximum recovery of
   laccase, MnP and LiP while high protein content was recovered after 2
   hours duration.
   Of the two leaching conditions - shaking and stationary considered in
   the study, shaking was more effective for recovery of enzymes and
   proteins. Experiments were further conducted to find out no. of washes
   required for complete recovery of enzymes from fermented bran. Results
   of these experiment indicated that the first two washes were sufficient
   to totally extract the enzyme and protein from the bran.}},

Title = {{Can Physiological and Psychological Factors Predict Dropout from Intense
   10-Day Winter Military Survival Training?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the military context, high levels of physiological and
   psychological stress together can compromise individual's ability to
   complete given duty or mission and increase dropout rates. The purpose
   of this study was to investigate if baseline physical fitness, body
   composition, hormonal and psychological factors could predict dropout
   from a 10-day intense winter military survival training. Methods: 69
   conscripts volunteered to participate in the study. Physical fitness
   (muscle strength and power, muscle endurance, and aerobic fitness), body
   composition and hormonal variables (BDNF, testosterone, cortisol, SHBG,
   DHEAS, IGF-1) together with self-reported psychological factors (short
   five personality, hardiness, sense of coherence, stress, depression)
   were assessed prior the survival training. Results: During the survival
   training, 20 conscripts (29\%) dropped out. Baseline aerobic fitness
   (hazard ratio, HR: 0.997, 95\% CI: 0.994-0.999, p = 0.006) and serum
   cortisol (HR: 1.0006, 95\% CI: 1.001-1.011, p = 0.017) predicted dropout
   in Cox regression model. Each 10 m increase in the 12 min running test
   decreased the risk for dropout by 3\%. Conclusion: Although most of the
   physiological and psychological variables at the baseline did not
   predict dropout during a short-term winter survival military training,
   baseline information of aerobic fitness and serum cortisol concentration
   may be useful to target support for individuals at higher potential risk
   for dropout.}},

Title = {{Sustainability Potential Evaluation of Concrete with Steel Slag
   Aggregates by the LCA Method}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability in the construction industry refers to all
   resource-efficient and environmentally responsible processes throughout
   the life cycle of a structure. Green buildings may incorporate reused,
   recycled, or recovered materials in their construction. Concrete is as
   an important building material. Due to the implementation of by-products
   and waste from various industries into its structure, concrete
   represents a significant sustainable material. Steel slag has great
   potential for its reuse in concrete production. Despite its volume
   changes over time, steel slag can be applied in concrete as a cement
   replacement (normally) or as a substitute for natural aggregates
   (rarely). This paper focused on an investigation of concrete with steel
   slag as a substitute of natural gravel aggregate. Testing physical and
   mechanical properties of nontraditional concrete with steel slag as a
   substitute for natural aggregates of 4/8 mm and 8/16 mm fractions
   confirmed the possibility of using slag as a partial replacement of
   natural aggregate. Several samples of concrete with steel slag achieved
   even better mechanical parameters (e.g., compressive strength, frost
   resistance) than samples with natural aggregate. Moreover, a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) was performed within the system boundaries
   cradle-to-gate. The LCA results showed that replacements of natural
   aggregates significantly affected the utilization rate of nonrenewable
   raw materials and reduced the overall negative impacts of concrete on
   the environment up to 7\%. The sustainability indicators (SUI), which
   considered the LCA data together with the technical parameters of
   concrete, were set to evaluate sustainability of the analyzed concretes.
   Based on the SUI results, replacing only one fraction of natural gravel
   aggregate in concrete was a more sustainable solution than replacing
   both fractions at once. These results confirmed the benefits of using

Abstract = {{Violence against children (VAC) is a pervasive and persistent injustice
   around the world. Thirty years after the adoption of the United Nations
   Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the right of children to be
   protected against all forms of violence is still routinely violated. It
   is only within the last twenty years that the scope of this problem has
   been studied; as many point out, understanding the scope of the problem
   through comprehensive data collection is necessary to improve child
   protection. Data collection and data quality have improved drastically
   over this time. The Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights
   recommends using comprehensive indicator systems that collect data on
   States Parties' structure- and process-related commitments to fulfil
   human rights, and on the outcomes of these commitments. However, most
   existing indicator sets on VAC fall short of this comprehensive
   approach, often focusing only on structural or outcome indicators. An
   international team of child rights experts is now developing
   GlobalChild, which will be an online platform consisting of
   comprehensive sets of structure-, process-, and outcome-related
   indicators for all 41 substantive rights of the CRC. This system will
   advance data collection, facilitate the monitoring function of the
   Committee on the Rights of the Child, and enable research on many rights
   of children, including their right to protection against violence. VAC
   is a complex problem, and protection against VAC is a right that is
   indivisible from other rights under the CRC. Therefore, a comprehensive
   and systematic approach is required to improve accountability to
   children around the world.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the results of an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement
   cosmological simulation in order to quantify the mass growth of galaxy
   clusters, exploring the differences between dark matter and baryons. We
   have determined the mass assembly histories (MAHs) of each of the mass
   components and computed several proxies for the instantaneous mass
   accretion rate (MAR). The mass growth of both components is clearly
   dominated by the contribution of major mergers, but high MARs can also
   occur during smooth accretion periods. We explored the correlations
   between MARs, merger events, and clusters' environments, finding the
   mean densities in 1 <= r/R-200m <= 1.5 to correlate strongly with
   Gamma(200m) in massive clusters that undergo major mergers through their
   MAH. From the study of the dark matter velocity profiles, we find a
   strong anticorrelation between the MAR proxies Gamma (200m) and
   alpha(200m). Last, we present a novel approach to study the angularly
   resolved distribution of gas accretion flows in simulations, which
   allows to extract and interpret the main contributions to the accretion
   picture and to assess systematic differences between the thermodynamical
   properties of each of these contributions using multipolar analysis. We
   have preliminarily applied the method to the best numerically resolved
   cluster in our simulation. Amongst the most remarkable results, we find
   that the gas infalling through the cosmic filaments has systematically
   lower entropy compared to the isotropic component, but we do not find a
   clear distinction in temperature.}},

Title = {{PORTEC-4a: international randomized trial of molecular profile-based
   adjuvant treatment for women with high-intermediate risk endometrial

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Vaginal brachytherapy is currently recommended as adjuvant treatment in
   patients with high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer to maximize
   local control and has only mild side effects and no or limited impact on
   quality of life. However, there is still considerable overtreatment and
   also some undertreatment, which may be reduced by tailoring adjuvant
   treatment to the patients' risk of recurrence based on molecular tumor
   characteristics.
   Primary objectives
   To compare the rates of vaginal recurrence in women with
   high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer, treated after surgery with
   molecular-integrated risk profile-based recommendations for either
   observation, vaginal brachytherapy or external pelvic beam radiotherapy
   or with standard adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy
   Study hypothesis
   Adjuvant treatment based on a molecular-integrated risk profile provides
   similar local control and recurrence-free survival as current standard
   adjuvant brachytherapy in patients with high-intermediate risk
   endometrial cancer, while sparing many patients the morbidity of
   adjuvant treatment and reducing healthcare costs.
   Trial design
   A multicenter, international phase III randomized trial (2:1) of
   molecular-integrated risk profile-based adjuvant treatment (experimental
   arm) or adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (standard arm).
   Major inclusion/exclusion criteria
   Women aged 18 years and over with a histological diagnosis of
   high-intermediate risk endometrioid endometrial cancer after total
   abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral
   salpingo-oophorectomy. High-intermediate risk factors are defined as:
   (i) International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA (with
   invasion) and grade 3; (ii) stage IB grade 1 or 2 with age >= 60 and/or
   lymph-vascular space invasion; (iii) stage IB, grade 3 without
   lymph-vascular space invasion; or (iv) stage II (microscopic and grade
   1).
   Endpoints
   The primary endpoint is vaginal recurrence. Secondary endpoints are
   recurrence-free and overall survival; pelvic and distant recurrence;
   5-year vaginal control (including treatment for relapse); adverse events
   and patient-reported symptoms and quality of life; and endometrial
   cancer-related healthcare costs.
   Sample size
   500 eligible and evaluable patients.
   Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results
   Estimated date for completing accrual will be late 2021. Estimated date
   for presentation of (first) results is expected in 2023.}},

Title = {{Sugar replacement with zwitterionic plasticizers like amino acids}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{109}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the potential of zwitterions like amino
   acids as alternative (bulking) sugar replacers. Commonly, polyols or
   oligosaccharides are taken as sugar placers, but they are perceived as
   less attractive due to laxative problems. The choice of amino acids as
   alternative sugar replacers is inspired by their presence in Natural
   Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) and compatible solutes, next to
   carbohydrates. In these compounds, hydrogen bonding plays an essential
   role similar to sugar (replacers) in food. Because of the novelty of the
   topic, we first discuss at length NADES as a potential source of
   alternative plasticizers/sugar replacers. Subsequently, we perform a
   detailed analysis of their thermodynamic properties, to investigate
   whether amino acids and related zwitterions indeed have the appropriate
   properties for sugar replacement.
   Our analysis shows that several zwitterions indeed have proper
   thermodynamic properties, which can make them good plasticizers and
   humectants. However, the use of several zwitterions can be restricted by
   their poor solubility, except for L-proline. Solubility problems can be
   circumvented by their use in mixtures of several sugar replacers, which
   enhances their solubility. The poor solubility makes it also difficult
   to characterize the glass transition temperatures of the pure solute
   T-g,T-g. Consequently, we have estimated them via extrapolation of the
   viscosity curves, which is shown to scale with T-g/T. We have taken T-g
   of the plasticizer solution as a measure of the hydrogen bond density,
   n(OH,eff).
   That measure is shown to explain the melting behaviour of biopolymers
   like egg white and starch in glycine and L-proline solutions, similar to
   sugar (replacers). However, our measurements of the biopolymer melting
   show indications of phase separation at high moisture contents for both
   amino acid solutions as for carbohydrate solutions. Overall, the amino
   acids and other compatible zwitterions have very similar thermodynamic
   behaviour as sugars and their carbohydrate-based replacers. In proper
   combinations with alternative plasticizers, the zwitterionic compatible
   solutes can well be used in sugar replacement strategies for foods.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid origin for a conservation listed taxon will influence its
   status and management options. Here, we investigate the genetic origins
   of a nationally endangered listed taxon-Eucalyptus paludicola-a tree
   that is restricted to the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island of
   South Australia. Since its description in 1995, there have been
   suggestions that this taxon may potentially be a stable hybrid species.
   Using a high throughput sequencing approach, we developed a panel of
   polymorphic loci that were screened across E. paludicola and its
   putative parental species E. cosmophylla and E. ovata. Bayesian
   clustering of the genotype data identified separate groups comprising E.
   ovata and E. cosmophylla while E. paludicola individuals were admixed
   between these two, consistent with a hybrid origin. Hybrid class
   assignment tests indicate that the majority of E. paludicola individuals
   (similar to 70\%) are F-1 hybrids with a low incidence of backcrossing.
   Most of the post-F-1 hybrids were associated with revegetation sites
   suggesting they may be maladapted and rarely reach maturity under
   natural conditions. These data support the hypothesis that E. paludicola
   is a transient hybrid entity rather than a distinct hybrid species. We
   briefly discuss the conservation implications of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this preregistered EEG study was to show how expectations
   about enhanced or impaired performance through transcranial stimulation
   affect feelings of agency and error processing. Using a single-blind
   experimental design, participants (N=57) were attached to a transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) device, and in different blocks, they
   were verbally instructed to expect enhanced or impaired cognitive
   performance, or no effects of the brain stimulation. In all cases, but
   unbeknownst to the participants, we used an inert sham tDCS protocol.
   Subsequently, we measured their response to errors on a cognitive
   control task. Our expectancy manipulation was successful: participants
   reported improved subjective performance in the enhancement compared
   with the impairment condition-even though objective performance was kept
   at a constant level across conditions. Participants reported the highest
   feelings of agency over their task performance in the control condition,
   and lowest feelings of agency in the impairment condition. The
   expectancy manipulation did not affect the error-related negativity
   (ERN) in association with incorrect responses. During the induction
   phase, expecting impaired versus enhanced performance increased frontal
   theta power, potentially reflecting a process of increased cognitive
   control allocation. Our findings show that verbally induced
   manipulations can affect subjective performance on a cognitive control
   task, but that stronger manipulations (e.g., through conditioning) are
   necessary to induce top-down effects on neural error processing.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes selection incentives for insurers in the Dutch
   basic health insurance market, which operates with community-rated
   premiums and sophisticated risk adjustment. Selection incentives result
   from the interplay of three market characteristics: possible actions by
   insurers, consumer response to these actions, and predictable variation
   in profitability of insurance contracts. After a qualitative analysis of
   the first two characteristics our primary objective is to identify the
   third. Using a combination of claims data (N= 16.8 million) and survey
   information (N= 387,195), we find substantial predictable variation in
   profitability. On average, people in good health are profitable, while
   those in poor health are unprofitable. We conclude that Dutch insurers
   indeed face selection incentives. A complete measure of selection
   incentives, however, captures the correlation between individual-level
   profitability and consumer response to insurer-actions. Obtaining
   insight in this correlation is an important direction for further
   research.}},

Journal = {{ANTIOXIDANTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The stress-inducible non-proteinogenic amino acid gamma-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA) is known to alleviate several (a)biotic stresses in plants.
   GABA forms an important link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism and
   has been proposed as a signalling molecule in plants. Here, we set out
   to establish GABA as a priming compound against Botrytis cinerea in
   Arabidopsis thaliana and how metabolism and reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) are influenced after GABA treatment and infection. We show that
   GABA already primes disease resistance at low concentrations (100 mu M),
   comparable to the well-characterized priming agent beta-Aminobutyric
   acid (BABA). Treatment with GABA reduced ROS burst in response to flg22
   (bacterial peptide derived from flagellum) and oligogalacturonides
   (OGs). Plants treated with GABA showed reduced H2O2 accumulation after
   infection due to increased activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase.
   Contrary to 100 mu M GABA treatments, 1 mM exogenous GABA induced
   endogenous GABA before and after infection. Strikingly, 1 mM GABA
   promoted total and active nitrate reductase activity whereas 100 mu M
   inhibited active nitrate reductase. Sucrose accumulated after GABA
   treatment, whereas glucose and fructose only accumulated in treated
   plants after infection. We propose that extracellular GABA signalling
   and endogenous metabolism can be separated at low exogenous
   concentrations.}},

Title = {{Demonstrating the need to simultaneously implement all water sensitive
   design methods for aquatic ecosystem health}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The practices commonly known as `Water Sensitive Design', or `Low Impact
   Urban Design and Development', provide a comprehensive package of
   practices, (building blocks), that respect and work with the natural
   water cycle and enhance biodiversity. Much previous research has
   focussed on determining the sustainability gains achieved by the
   implementation of a narrow range of closely related techniques, such as
   the installation of at source devices for stormwater retention and
   treatment. Other research has investigated the gains for the health of
   an ecosystem from the reduction of impervious surfaces, or from riparian
   revegetation, or from the clustering together of buildings.
   Relationships between these practices and techniques have been observed,
   but urban developers continue to implement practices such as these in
   isolation whereas it is suspected that the aquatic ecosystems need all
   of the practices and techniques to be implemented simultaneously.
   Without the synchrony of simultaneous implementation, degradation of the
   ecosystems may still occur and the real cause of it may be missed. The
   purpose of this research is to monitor, using a biotic index, the
   ecosystem responses of streams to the simultaneous implementation of as
   many as possible of these practices (the building blocks) at two
   different urban densities in paired sub-catchment studies within the
   Hauraki Gulf catchment of Auckland, New Zealand. Significant differences
   in the health of the ecosystems of the streams between some treatment
   and control sub catchments are observed at both densities. The failure
   to apply all the techniques (building block methods), or to apply them
   appropriately in some of the case study sub-catchments, demonstrates a
   consequent degradation of the ecosystems of the streams that is expected
   to have negative consequences, not only for local streams but for the
   marine receiving environment.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to contribute to rethinking the history of slavery in
   the Indian Ocean and Indonesian archipelago. Recent scholarship provides
   increasing indications that the slave trade in the Indian Ocean and
   Indonesian archipelago worlds might have been more extensive than
   previously thought. This not only challenges the dominant focus on
   Atlantic slavery but also urges scholars to reassess current
   perspectives on slavery in Southeast and South Asia. Reconstructing the
   role and size of the slave trade within the context of the empire of the
   Dutch East India Company in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
   this article provides indications for the importance of commodified
   forms of slavery. This challenges our understanding of forms of slavery
   and bondage in South and Southeast Asian context. Moving beyond the
   often-used conceptual model of ``open{''} and ``closed{''} systems of
   slavery, this article explores the Dutch case to argue for a renewal of
   our understanding of the variety forms of slavery and coercion by
   distinguishing between localizing and mobilizing systems. Proposing this
   distinction as a way forward in exploring the global history of slavery,
   the article indicates that these systems not only existed side by side
   but were closely intertwined and interacting with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Little is known about the effects on clinical practice of
   continuing education quality and safety curricula. The aim of this study
   is to gain insight into learning outcomes on the fourth level of the
   Kirkpatrick evaluation model for systematically deployed quality
   improvement projects performed by health care professionals during a
   Masters in Healthcare Quality and Safety in the Netherlands. Methods:
   The researchers reviewed 35 projects led by health care professionals in
   16 different hospitals to determine their scopes and effects. Afterward,
   professionals took an online survey to determine the extent of their
   project's sustainability and spread. Results: Improving health care
   safety was the most prevalent quality dimension (n = 11, 31\%). A
   positive change was measured by professionals for 64\% (n = 35) of the
   primary outcomes. Statistical significance was measured in 19 (35\%) of
   the outcomes, of which nine (47\%) were found to have a statistically
   significant effect. A minority of professionals (17\%) judged their
   project as sustained by the department, while some stated that the
   intervention (37\%) or the results of the project (11\%) had spread.
   Discussion: Although most projects indicated an improvement in their
   primary outcomes, only a few resulted in statistically significant
   changes. Teaching professionals in using evaluation methods that take
   into account the complex context where these projects are performed and
   teaching them leadership skills is needed to reduce the likelihood of
   unmeasured outcomes. Analyzing learning experiences of professionals in
   performing the project is important to see what they learned from
   performing quality improvement projects, providing experiences that may
   lead to sustainable effects in future projects.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the AlN additive on the microstructural features and
   consolidation behavior of the ZrB2-SiC system was studied. For this
   objective, different weight percentages of AlN were added to the ZrB2-30
   vol\% SiC ceramics, in which 4 wt\% phenolic resin was used as a binder.
   All specimens were hot-pressed at sintering circumstances of 1900
   degrees C under 10 MPa for a dwelling time of 120 min. The addition of
   AlN had a remarkable effect on the sintering behavior of ZrB2-SiC,
   attaining fully dense composite samples. Although the thermodynamic
   study suggested the formation and consumption of several compounds over
   the hot-pressing, only the peaks related to carbon was detected in the
   XRD patterns. The thermodynamic assessment also implied the generation
   of a liquid phase over the sintering as the main factor in boosting the
   sinterability of specimens. The microstructure of as-produced ceramics
   was also inspected using FESEM and HRTEM images. Such micrographs
   endorsed the beneficial role of liquid phase sintering mechanism in
   forming coherent and strong interfaces among the available phases.
   Fractographical evaluation manifested the transgranular type as the
   dominant fracture mode for all hot-pressed composites.}},

Title = {{The latency-associated transcript locus of herpes simplex virus 1 is a
   virulence determinant in human skin}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects and destroys the outer layer
   of skin cells, producing lesions known as cold sores. Although these
   lesions heal, the virus persists in the host for the lifetime and can
   reactivate to cause new lesions. This is possible because the virus
   enters the axons of neurones in the skin and moves to their cell bodies
   located in spinal or cranial nerve bundles called ganglia, where the
   virus becomes dormant (latent). The most abundant viral RNAs expressed
   during this state are the latency associated transcripts (LATs), which
   have been considered a hallmark of HSV-1 latency. Here, we studied HSV-1
   infection and spread in human skin. Unexpectedly, we found that the LAT
   locus is necessary for lesion formation in skin. HSV-1 viruses that were
   genetically mutated to delete the start of the locus could not spread in
   skin, whereas viruses with many other genetic mutations had this
   capacity. Our results suggest that an antiviral drug that inhibits
   transcripts from this region of the viral genome could block viral
   spread in skin, or a vaccine could possibly be produced by genetically
   modifying the virus at the LAT locus and by doing so, limit the virus'
   ability become latent in neurones.
   Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects skin and mucosal epithelial cells
   and then travels along axons to establish latency in the neurones of
   sensory ganglia. Although viral gene expression is restricted during
   latency, the latency-associated transcript (LAT) locus encodes many
   RNAs, including a 2 kb intron known as the hallmark of HSV-1 latency.
   Here, we studied HSV-1 infection and the role of the LAT locus in human
   skin xenografts in vivo and in cultured explants. We sequenced the
   genomes of our stock of HSV-1 strain 17syn(+) and seven derived viruses
   and found nonsynonymous mutations in many viral proteins that had no
   impact on skin infection. In contrast, deletions in the LAT locus
   severely impaired HSV-1 replication and lesion formation in skin.
   However, skin replication was not affected by impaired intron splicing.
   Moreover, although the LAT locus has been implicated in regulating gene
   expression in neurones, we observed only small changes in transcript
   levels that were unrelated to the growth defect in skin, suggesting that
   its functions in skin may be different from those in neurones. Thus,
   although the LAT locus was previously thought to be dispensable for
   lytic infection, we show that it is a determinant of HSV-1 virulence
   during lytic infection of human skin.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removal from leachate nanofiltration concentrate with high
   resistant organic matter content by persulfate (PS) oxidation in which
   zero-valent copper (ZVCu) and zero-valent iron (ZVI) are used as
   activators. Within the scope of the study, response surface methodology
   (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum operating conditions by which
   maximum COD removal efficiency would be obtained, and effects of
   independent variables (pH, PS concentration, dosage of ZVI and ZVCu,
   reaction time) on COD removal efficiency and their interaction with each
   other were determined. The degree of significance of each independent
   variable was determined by analysis of variance. Estimated COD removal
   efficiencies under optimum conditions determined by the model were found
   to be 36.48\% and 47.15\%, respectively, for ZVCu-activated PS (ZVCu/PS)
   and ZVI-activated PS (ZVI/PS) processes whereas experimental removal
   efficiencies were 34.29\% and 45.56\%, respectively, for ZVCu/PS and
   ZVI/PS processes. The results of the study indicated that ZVI and ZVCu
   activated PS oxidation is effective and economic for COD removal from
   leachate nanofiltration concentrate with the BOD5/COD ratio of 0.042,
   and RSM is a suitable method for the design and optimization of both

Title = {{Has Cost Benefit Analysis Improved Decisions in Colombia? Evidence from
   the Environmental Licensing Process}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{178}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Environmental cost benefit analysis, CBA, is often the preferred method
   for economists to assess policy changes which have environmental
   consequences. It is argued that CBA can help governments focus their
   resources to maximize the social returns of investments or projects. CBA
   is also viewed as a useful framework for organizing disparate
   information and subsequently improve the decision process. Despite the
   enthusiasm for the method, there have been few attempts outside
   developed countries to assess CBA's influence on decisions. In this
   article we used content analysis of official documents to analyse the
   role played by CBA in the Colombian environ-mental licensing process.
   Our results show that CBA's influence on the final decisions has been
   limited. The problem, we conclude, does not reside in CBA but in the
   process. Although there is a procedural requirement to do CBA, there is
   no requirement that the results must be considered in the
   decision-making. Since the problem lies in the process, not the
   instrument, we think that merely using a non-monetary assessment method
   instead of CBA, such as multicriteria analysis, will not lead to better
   decisions. This latter point is a discussion missing from the ecological
   economics literature that deserves more attention.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to infer the degree of relationship between the supply

   interpretation of interviews with drivers and people whose origin and
   destination were Historic Center of Cusco. From the results found, it
   appears that the supply exceeds the demand for parking lots, and this
   because the main motivation to go to the historic center is for work
   reasons, being more than 42\%; Furthermore, it was established that
   vehicular traffic in the streets surrounding the attraction poles
   exceeds the limit that their roads can withstand. Finally, from the
   relationship analysis, it was found that there is a significant

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the morphological
   (scanning electron microscopicy images), thermal (differential scanning
   calorimetry), and electrical (conductivity) properties and to carry out
   compositional analysis (Fourier-transform infrared) of produced nonwoven
   fibrous materials adapted in biomedical applications as scaffolds. The
   orientation of produced nanofilaments was also investigated because it
   is considered as one of the essential features of a perfect tissue
   scaffold. Viscosity and electrical conductivity of solutions, used in
   the manufacturing process, were also disassembled because these
   properties highly influence the morphological properties of produced
   nanofibers. The nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated via conventional
   electrospinning technique from biopolymer, synthetic polymer, and their
   blends. The chitosan (CS) was chosen as biopolymer and polyethylene
   oxide (PEO) of low molecular weight as synthetic polymer. Solutions from
   pure CS were unspinnable: beads instead of nanofibers were formed via
   spinning. The fabrication of pure PEO nanomats from solutions of 10
   wt\%, 15 wt\%, and 20 wt\% concentrations (in distilled water) turned
   out to be successful. The blending of composed CS solutions with PEO
   ones in ratios of 1:1 optimized the parameters of electrospinning
   process and provided the opportunity to fabricate CS/PEO blends
   nanofibers. The concentration of acetic acid (AA) used to dissolve CS
   finely spuninned the nanofibers from blended solutions and influenced
   the rate of crystallization of manufactured fiber mats. The
   concentration of PEO in solutions as well as viscosity of solutions also
   influenced the diameter and orientation of formed nanofibers. The
   beadless, highly oriented, and defect-free nanofibers from CS/PEO
   solutions with the highest concentration of PEO were successfully
   electrospinned. By varying the concentrations of AA and low molecular
   weight PEO, it is possible to fabricate beadless and highly oriented
   nanofiber scaffolds, which freely can found a place in medical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Quality management was born along with the development of the production
   of various products. The appearance in the twentieth century of serial
   and mass production in mechanical engineering, metallurgy and other
   industries required the development of specialized tools based on
   statistical methods-control charts, charts, histograms, etc. Specialized
   methods and tools of quality management appeared-FMEA, QFD, TPM, Kaizen,
   etc. The quality management methodology developed-TQM, lean
   manufacturing, 6 sigma, quality management systems. Currently, there is
   a large-scale digitalization of all types of activities, including
   quality management. Possible ways of development of existing and
   creation of new means and methods of quality management using digital
   technologies are shown.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean diet (MD) is regarded as a healthy eating pattern with
   beneficial effects both for the decrease of the risk for
   non-communicable diseases and also for body weight reduction. In the
   current manuscript, we propose an automated smartphone application which
   monitors and evaluates the user's adherence to MD using images of the
   food and drinks that they consume. We define a set of rules for
   automatic adherence estimation, which focuses on the main MD food
   groups. We use a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
   a graph convolutional network to detect the types of foods and
   quantities from the users' food images and the defined set of rules to
   evaluate the adherence to MD. Our experiments show that our system
   outperforms a basic CNN in terms of recognizing food items and
   estimating quantity and yields comparable results as experienced
   dietitians when it comes to overall MD adherence estimation. As the
   system is novel, these results are promising; however, there is room for
   improvement of the accuracy by gathering and training with more data and
   certain refinements can be performed such as re-defining the set of
   rules to also be able to be used for sub-groups of MD (e.g., vegetarian
   type of MD).}},

Abstract = {{Discussion forums have the potential for enabling knowledge construction
   during online interactions, especially when facilitated by a skilled
   e-moderator. Unfortunately, most e-moderators are not provided training
   for facilitating discussions, and hence may only summarise information
   and deliver factual knowledge without encouraging elaboration or
   reflection among the learners. Hence, this study focused on developing
   e-moderation skills in discussion forums by investigating the patterns
   of interactions among 24 students in an undergraduate course. This study
   employed one group pre-test and post-test experimental group design to
   measure student's interaction patterns after undergoing training for
   e-moderation. After moderating online discussion forums, a content
   analysis of the transcripts of the discourse in their forum was
   conducted to understand the nature of the interaction patterns and the
   quality of the discussions. The results revealed that training had
   contributed to a significant increase in domains of social interaction,
   sharing information, egocentric elaboration, allocentric elaboration,
   application and transfer, coordination, and reflection. The skillset in
   this study can be applied by e-moderators to effectively facilitate
   online learning for knowledge development. It is recommended that
   instructors in higher education institutions be equipped with skills to
   scaffold students in constructing knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the
   acute effects of red and infrared photobiomodulation (PBM) using a
   cluster device on biceps brachii muscle fatigue in young and healthy
   males.
   Background: Vigorous physical activity could lead to muscle fatigue,
   which compromises motor control and muscle strength and consequently
   impairs performance. The positive effects of PBM in reducing fatigue
   onset have been highlighted. However, the better wavelength with cluster
   devices is not yet established.
   Methods: A randomized double-blind session was used. Thirty-two young
   and healthy males were randomized into the control group (CG), red PBM
   group (RPG), and infrared PBM group (IPG). A PBM cluster device {[}7
   visible diodes (630 nm), 7 infrared diodes (850 nm), 100 mW/diode, 2
   W/cm(2) power density, 91 J/cm(2) energy density, 4 J per point, 28 J
   total energy, and 40 sec] was applied after muscle fatigue. Muscle
   fatigue was analyzed by surface electromyography (EMG) recorded from the
   long head of biceps brachii, blood lactate concentration, and evaluation
   of the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg Scale. The
   fatigue protocol consisted of a maximum voluntary isotonic contraction
   of elbow flexion-extension with 75\% of one-repetition maximum until
   exhaustion. The Borg Scale was applied before and at the end of the
   experiment to measure the RPE. The electromyography fatigue index
   (EMGFI) was calculated by windows of median frequency from EMG data.
   Results: EMGFI, blood lactate concentration, and RPE showed no
   intergroup statistical difference, except the EMGFI delta value that
   showed a difference between IPG and CG, with a greater value in the CG.
   However, intragroup comparisons showed that EMGFI decreased in the CG
   and RPE and lactate concentration increased significantly in all groups.
   Conclusions: There was no difference between red and infrared PBM in
   reduction of biceps brachii fatigue. However, the EMGFI delta value was
   greater in the IPG compared with the CG, suggesting that infrared can be
   more effective in reducing biceps brachii fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The management of locally advanced extremity soft tissue
   sarcomas, particularly in terms of a limb salvage strategy, represents a
   challenge, especially in recurrent tumors. In the context of a
   patient-tailored multimodal therapy, hyperthermic isolated limb
   perfusion (ILP) is a promising limb-saving treatment option. We report
   the outcome of patients with primarily irresectable and locally
   recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (STS) treated by ILP.
   Patients and methods: Data about patient demographics, clinical und
   histopathological characteristics, tumor response, morbidity and
   oncological outcome of all patients with STS, who underwent an ILP at
   our institution in a 10-year period, were retrospectively detected and
   analyzed.
   Results: The cohort comprised 30 patients. Two patients were treated
   with ILP for palliative tumor control, 13 patients because of a local
   recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (rSTS) and 15 patients because of
   primarily unresectable soft tissue sarcoma (puSTS). 25 of the 28
   patients with curative intention received surgery after ILP (11 pts with
   rSTS and 14 pts with puSTS). Histopathologically we observed complete
   response in 6 patients (24\%) and partial responses in 19 patients
   (76\%) with a significant better remission in patients with puSTS (p =
   0,043). Limb salvage rate was 75\%. Mean follow-up was 69 months
   {[}range 13-142 months]. Seven (7/11; 64\%) patients with rSTS and one
   (1/14; 7\%) patient with puSTS developed local recurrence after ILP and
   surgery, whereas eight (8/13; 62\%) rSTS patients and seven (7/15; 47\%)
   puSTS patients developed distant metastasis. During follow-up, eight
   patients (28.5\%) died of disease (5/13; 38\%) rSTS and 3/15 (20\%)
   puSTS. ILP in the group of previously irradiated sarcoma patients (n =
   13) resulted in a limb salvage rate of 69\% and was not associated in an
   increased risk for adverse events.
   Discussion: ILP for advanced extremity STS is a treatment option for
   both puSTS and rSTS resulting in good local control and should be
   considered in multimodal management. ILP is also a good option for
   patients after radiation history.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to analyse school failure and dropping out
   from an intersectional perspective. The qualitative research has been
   the methodological positioning assumed, with ad hoc information
   collection strategies and from which it has been possible to face the

   that is configured from the various systems of domination that play a
   key role in the concurrence of school failure and dropping out. The four
   domains of which it is composed are addressed: structural, disciplinary,
   interpersonal and hegemonic. It concludes with the evidence that
   intersectionality allows us to situate ourselves in the devices that
   define and cause inequalities and injustices, or on the contrary,
   provoke experiences and situations of privilege. Incorporating the
   intersectionality tool for the analysis of school failure and dropping
   out allows us to reinforce the idea that they are not neutral, static
   and immanent. Intersectionality, as a tool for critical analysis, it is
   our ally to fight for the rights of those who are excluded,

Abstract = {{The 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is one of the customary products
   of oxidized DNA. The purpose of this study was to compare salivary and
   plasma 8-OHdG concentrations in a group of chronic periodontitis
   patients to those measured in a group of patients with healthy
   periodontium, as well as to determine the impact of periodontal therapy
   on 8-OHdG concentrations in saliva and plasma in chronic periodontitis
   patients. The study sample comprised of 24 patients with chronic
   periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy individuals. Plaque index,
   gingival index, papilla bleeding index, probing depth and clinical
   attachment level were indices used to determine patient periodontal
   status. Salivary and plasma 8-OHdG concentrations were determined by
   ELISA method. The salivary 8-OHdG concentration was statistically
   significantly higher in the group of periodontitis patients compared to
   periodontally healthy subjects. After initial periodontal therapy, the
   8-OHdG concentration in saliva was significantly reduced in the
   periodontitis group (p=0.021). Differences in plasma 8-OHdG
   concentrations between the two groups did not reach statistical
   significance and no significant changes were noted in the periodontitis
   group following initial periodontal therapy. A higher salivary 8-OHdG
   concentration reflects increased oxidative stress caused by periodontal
   disease. Initial periodontal therapy may be helpful in reducing salivary
   8-OHdG concentrations in chronic periodontitis patients.}},

Abstract = {{The genomic proportion that two relatives share identically by
   descent-their genetic relatedness-can vary depending on the history of
   recombination and segregation in their pedigree. Previous calculations
   of the variance of genetic relatedness have defined genetic relatedness
   as the proportion of total genetic map length (cM) shared by relatives,
   and have neglected crossover interference and sex differences in
   recombination. Here, we consider genetic relatedness as the proportion
   of the total physical genome (bp) shared by relatives, and calculate its
   variance for general pedigree relationships, making no assumptions about
   the recombination process. For the relationships of
   grandparent-grandoffspring and siblings, the variance of genetic
   relatedness is a simple decreasing function of r over bar , the average
   proportion of locus pairs that recombine in meiosis. For general
   pedigree relationships, the variance of genetic relatedness is a
   function of metrics analogous to r over bar . Therefore, features of the
   aggregate recombination process that affect r over bar and analogs also
   affect variance in genetic relatedness. Such features include the number
   of chromosomes and heterogeneity in their size, the number of crossovers
   and their spatial organization along chromosomes, and sex differences in
   recombination. Our calculations help to explain several recent
   observations about variance in genetic relatedness, including that it is
   reduced by crossover interference (which is known to increase r over bar
   ). Our methods further allow us to calculate the neutral variance of
   ancestry among F(2)s in a hybrid cross, enabling precise statistical
   inference in F-2-based tests for various kinds of selection.}},

Title = {{Decreasing Trends in Heavy Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption in the
   United States, 2003 to 2016}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Although previous studies have documented declines in intake
   from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) in the United States, it is
   important to examine whether heavy SSB intake (>= 500 kcal/day) is
   decreasing in parallel. Examining the intake patterns of heavy SSB
   consumers is imperative because these individuals face the greatest
   health risks and thus may benefit the most from targeted policy and
   programmatic efforts to reduce intake.
   Objective To provide the most recent national estimates for trends in
   heavy SSB intake among children and adults in the United States between
   2003-2004 and 2015-2016, to examine whether these trends differ by
   sociodemographic characteristics, and to describe where SSB are acquired
   and consumed by the heaviest SSB consumers.
   Design Trend analyses of demographic and 24-hour dietary recall data in
   the 20032004 to 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey.
   Participants/setting Participants were 21,783 children (aged 2 to 19
   years) and 32,355 adults (aged >= 20 years).
   Main outcome measures Heavy SSB intake (>= 500 kcal/day).
   Statistical analysis Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to
   estimate the proportion of heavy SSB consumers, overall and by age
   group, race/ethnicity, sex, and income status (lower income = <130\%
   Federal Poverty Level). Proportions were used to summarize where SSB are
   most often acquired and consumed.
   Results Between 2003-2004 and 2015-2016, the prevalence of heavy SSB
   intake declined significantly among children (10.9\% to 3.3\%) and
   adults (12.7\% to 9.1\%). For children, these declines were observed
   across age group, sex, family income status, and most races/ethnicities.
   For adults, these significant declines were observed among 20- to
   39-year olds, most races/ethnicities, and higher-income adults. However,
   there was a significant increase in heavy SSB intake among adults aged
   >= 60 years and no significant change among 40- to 59-year olds and
   non-Mexican Hispanic adults. The majority of energy intake from SSB
   consumed by heavy SSB drinkers was from products acquired from stores
   and was consumed at home.
   Conclusions Heavy SSB intake is declining, but attention must be paid to
   certain subgroups with high intake for whom trends are not decreasing,
   particularly 40- to 59-year olds and non-Mexican Hispanic adults.}},

Abstract = {{The light optical aerosols counter (LOAC) instrument is an optical
   aerosol counter that allows atmospheric partides from 0.2 to 50 mu m to

   photodiodes and produces an electric pulse. Detecting these pulses and

Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystems have been degraded by multiple stressors. To
   mitigate the effects of multiple stressors on freshwater ecosystems, we
   must assess the current ecological condition of these systems, diagnose
   the cause of the environmental impact, and predict how they will respond
   to future changes in anthropogenic pressures. Most biomonitoring
   programs use metrics of community structure to quantify ecological
   condition; however, they do not assess the overall ecological integrity
   of an ecosystem, including ecosystem function. This series of papers
   explores how structural and functional aspects of stream ecosystems can
   respond to different stressors. The use of a combination of structural
   and functional measures increases the ability to assess degradation of
   stream ecosystem integrity. We suggest that future studies should focus
   on development of measures that integrate ecosystem structure and
   function, such as the identification and refinement of species traits
   that are clearly associated with important functional properties of
   species and whose responses to different anthropogenic pressures can aid
   in informing the specific management activities likely to be most
   effective in restoring degraded stream ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{32-37}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Because of the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), social
   comparisons take place at an unprecedented rate and scale. There is a
   growing concern that these online social comparisons negatively impact
   people's subjective well-being (SWB). In this paper, we review research
   on (a) the antecedents of social comparisons on SNSs, (b) the
   consequences of social comparisons on SNSs for SWB and, (c) social
   comparison as a mechanism explaining (mediator) or affecting (moderator)
   the relationship between SNSs and SWB. The occurrence of social
   comparisons on SNSs depends on who uses the SNS and on how the SNS is
   being used with passive use in particular resulting in increased levels
   of social comparison. Moreover, social comparison on SNSs may
   occasionally result in an increase in SWB but typically negative effects
   are found as people tend to engage in contrasting upward social
   comparisons. Finally, several studies show that social comparison is a
   key mechanism explaining the relationship between use of SNSs and SWB
   and that users with a tendency to engage in social comparison are
   especially likely to be negatively impacted by SNSs. The dynamic,
   cyclical processes that result from this pattern of findings are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, sugarcane molasses was explored as a sole source of

   concentration of the produced biosurfactant was found to be 80 mg/L. The
   produced biosurfactant was identified to be lipopeptide in nature and
   reduced the surface tension of water from 72.80 +/- 0.5 mN/m to 24.09

Journal = {{BMJ SUPPORTIVE \& PALLIATIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To evaluate: (1) to what extent family carers of people supported by
   specialised palliative care services felt they had been provided with
   information, support and aftercare and (2) how this varied by type of
   palliative care service, length of enrolment and characteristics of
   deceased.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional postal survey was conducted using a structured
   questionnaire with nine items on information, support and aftercare
   provided by specialised palliative care services to family carers.
   Flemish family carers of people who had made use of specialised
   palliative care services at home or in hospital were contacted.
   Results
   Of all primary family carers (response rate of 53.5\% resulting in
   n=1504), 77.7\% indicated they were asked frequently by professionals
   how they were feeling. Around 75\% indicated they had been informed
   about specific end-of-life topics and around 90\% felt sufficiently
   supported before and immediately after the death. Family carers of
   people who had died in a palliative care unit, compared with other types
   of specialised palliative care services, indicated having received more
   information, support and aftercare.
   Conclusions
   Family carers evaluate the professional assistance provided more
   positively when death occurred in a palliative care unit. Policy changes
   might be needed to reach the same level of care across all specialised
   palliative care services.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dynamics of an orbital siphon anchored to a
   rotating ellipsoidal asteroid. The siphon is a chain of tether-connected
   payload masses arranged vertically from the asteroid surface, envisaged
   for propellantless delivery of payloads (e.g., mined material) from the
   asteroid surface to a collecting spacecraft. If the structure is long
   enough, the centrifugal-induced force can overcome the gravitational
   force on the payloads, eventually allowing resource payloads to escape.
   By connecting new payloads at the bottom of this chain while removing
   upper payloads a net orbital siphon effect is established, which
   provides a net continuous flow of resources from the asteroid surface to
   a collecting spacecraft, attached at the top of the siphon. The dynamics
   of the siphon is investigated in detail by varying a set of relevant
   parameters, in particular, chain length, anchor location and asteroid
   shape. It is shown that the system exhibits oscillatory behaviour in the
   equatorial plane, with decreasing oscillation amplitude over time and
   that the longest equatorial end is the best anchor location to guarantee
   proper siphon operation while minimizing the chain length. Eventually, a
   method is proposed to exploit the equatorial Coriolis-induced
   oscillations of the siphon to transfer payload masses from the
   collecting spacecraft to the stable equilibrium points associated with
   the effective potential of the ellipsoidal asteroid, where a catcher
   would collect the material.}},

Title = {{Cytotoxic effect of filtering respiratory protective devices from the
   waste sorting industry: is in vitro toxicology useful for risk
   characterization?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of Filtering Respiratory Protective Devices (FRPD) is mandatory
   in Portugal to protect workers from the waste industry of harmful
   exposures. Deleterious health effects of exposure to bioburden via
   inhalation and/or ingestion include respiratory symptoms and
   nephrotoxicity. Between January and February 2019, 118 FRPD samples were
   collected in one waste sorting industry and characterized regarding
   microbial contamination and cytotoxicity, defined as cell metabolic
   activity, through the MTT colorimetric assay
   (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide).
   Cytotoxic effect was classified according to percentage of extinction
   values with respect to the control group, as follows: absent (>= 90);
   low (80\%-90\%, +); medium (60\%-79\%, ++); and high (below 60\%, +++).
   For 113 samples the MTT assay revealed a cytotoxic effect in A549 cells,
   of which 81 presented high cytotoxicity. In SK cells, a cytotoxic effect
   was observed in 56 samples, of which five displayed a high cytotoxic
   effect. Several moderate (p < 0.05) to strong (p < 0.01) correlations
   were found between higher bacterial and fungal counts both in interior
   layers (fungi and bacteria) and in exhalation valves (fungi) of FRPD
   samples and reduced cell metabolic activity of SK cells. On the basis of
   the obtained results for the cytotoxic effect of FRPD samples on two
   different cells lines, it was determined that A549 cells exhibited a
   cytotoxic effect for a higher number of FRPD, whereas the SK cells model
   correlated better with the other assessed parameters, namely, bacterial
   and fungal counts and conditions of FRPD use. Although the results are
   not conclusive on the most appropriate cell line to assess FRPD
   cytotoxicity, they reinforce the importance of in vitro toxicology in
   exposure assessments to determine the cytotoxicity of mixtures of
   contaminants, for better risk characterization and selection of
   appropriate risk management measures.}},

Abstract = {{In the calculation of wind effects on civil constructions, the pressure
   coefficients, which are usually obtained from specific standards or by
   tests of reduced models in wind tunnels, are essential, and these
   coefficients are commonly established from solid and undeformable
   models. For greenhouses covered with plastic film, due to the
   flexibility of this material, there are instantaneous modifications to
   the shape of the construction by the action of the wind. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the distribution of pressure coefficients on
   arched roof greenhouses displaced by the wind action transverse to the
   ridge. To achieve this goal, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models
   were used to obtain the pressure coefficients in greenhouses with ratios
   between height and span of 0.3 and 0.6. The change in the shape of the
   greenhouse due to the displacements imposed by the wind showed that
   there were no relevant variations in the pressure coefficients of the
   wall zones. However, the effects of shape displacement were very
   significant along the extension of the arch of the roof, with a large
   reduction in the pressure coefficients mainly in the vicinity of the
   ridge. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This essay shows bow a late sixteenth-century English polemic racialized
   Spaniards not only in terms of their perceived tincture of Moorish and
   Jewish blood but also in terms of their partly European Gothic
   otherness. Medieval and early modern Spanish chronicles created a
   positive pedigree from the figures of Tuba' and Magog from the Noachic
   Table of Nations in Genesis. For Spaniards, these figures represented a
   pure, original Spanish or Gothic ancestry variously used to underwrite
   the reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula, assert blood purity against
   anxieties of Jewish and Moorish miscegenation, and justify Spain's claim
   to colonial dominance in the sixteenth century. For its part, this
   English polemic fastened Spain's pedigree to a sinister version of Magog
   described in Ezekiel and Revelation to explain Spanish cruelty and to
   qualify English claims to Spanish possessions. This essay uncovers the
   broader racial contours of the Black Legend through an approach centered
   on critical race studies and intellectual history.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The current evidence collected consistent results about
   morphological and functional brain changes produced by psychological
   treatment. Exposure cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is currently the
   most effective psychological treatment for phobias.
   Aims. To explore the brain activation and self-reported changes in
   patients with specific phobias to small animals who underwent a CBT
   exposure program and to prove if the CBT program made phobic patients
   process feared stimuli similarly to non-phobic persons.
   Subjects and methods. The sample consisted of 32 adults, of which 16 (5
   males and 11 females; mean age: 38.08) had specific phobia to small
   animals and 16 (4 males and 12 females; mean age: 21.81) had no phobias.
   A univariate beforeand-after treatment design were used. In addition,
   the scores of the non-phobic group in self-reports and brain activity
   were compared with the post-treatment scores of the phobic group.
   Results. Data show significant changes in brain activity, and
   improvements in self-reported measures because of applying CBT to
   specific phobias. As a highlight, participants showed a greater
   activation in points of the precuneus after receiving CBT. Also, when
   compared with non-phobic participants, phobic patients still remain with
   both fear and defensive responses to phobic stimuli.
   Conclusions. The precuneus seems to be a regulator that reorganizes the
   processing of phobic stimuli. It can imply as CBT/exposure also active
   acceptance, self-awareness, and self-efficacy mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a retrospective comparison of low-dose (<= 80 mg per day)
   versus standard-dose (160 mg per day) enzalutamide in patients >= 75
   years old who had progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate
   cancer. At 1-year median follow-up, there were no significant
   differences in response rate, duration of response, or overall and
   prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival. Low-dose
   enzalutamide might emerge as an efficient therapy in late-elderly
   patients.
   Background: Enzalutamide, a major antiandrogen indicated for metastatic
   castration-resistant prostate cancer, has worrisome toxicities in aging
   patients. Dose reduction might limit toxicity, but potential loss of
   efficacy is a concern. We compare up-front low-dose versus standard-dose
   enzalutamide. Patients and Methods: Records of prostate cancer patients
   receiving enzalutamide were retrospectively retrieved. Selection
   criteria were: age >= 75, metastatic disease, surgical or medical
   castration, and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Data were
   excluded of those missing follow-up PSA values. Low-dose enzalutamide
   (<= 80 mg per day) was compared to standard dose (160 mg per day).
   Progression-free survival analyzed the time from start of enzalutamide
   to event, defined as >= 25\% and >= 2 ng/mL PSA increase above nadir, or
   death from any cause. Results: Fifty-nine patients were identified, of
   whom 16 received low-dose and 43 standard-dose therapy. Patients in the
   low-dose group were significantly old, with a median (range) age of 84.6
   (74.9-93.8) years; median (range) PSA at start of enzalutamide was 59.2
   (11.0-1058.3) ng/mL; 11 had bone metastases only, 2 metastatic lymph
   nodes only, and 3 bone and lymph node localizations. Pain score was >
   3/10 in 4 patients (27\%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
   performance status was >= 2 in 9 (56\%); 3 patients had received prior
   abiraterone and 3 bicalutamide. None received chemotherapy. PSA decrease
   of >= 50\% at 12 weeks was observed in 67\% patients (10/15), versus
   45.0\% with standard dose. Median (range) PSA at last followup was 1.6
   (0-599.3) ng/mL. Median progression-free survival was 11.2 months,
   versus 11.9 months for patients receiving the standard dose (P = .612).
   Conclusion: Low-dose enzalutamide in very old, symptomatic,
   poorperformance patients with metastatic disease was associated with
   high response rate and survival comparable to standard dose. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Does status have an independent effect on how countries relate to each
   other? While scholars long argued that status is a salient foreign
   policy driver, it has been challenging to establish a causal link
   between status and foreign policy outcomes. In this project, I use
   original survey data to evaluate the effect of status on foreign policy
   decision-making, in particular popular support for military
   intervention. In an online survey experiment, 3658 United States
   citizens were confronted with a hypothetical foreign policy scenario in
   which their country's status was threatened. The results show that the
   presence of a status threat increases support for military intervention,
   even in situations where national security interests are at stake and
   casualties are likely. I also find that government's unwillingness to
   use force to protect the country's status leads to decreased government
   approval. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that status is an
   important foreign policy driver and a source of domestic audience costs.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, 7075 aluminum-zinc alloy is strengthened with
   blends of ZrB2 particles using the stir casting technique. The
   reinforcements were added to the base alloy at weight percentages of 5,
   10, and 15. An attempt was made to establish a correlation among
   microstructure, physical, and mechanical properties such as density,
   hardness, strength, and electrical resistivity. A linear relationship
   between the concentration of reinforcement of ZrB2 and electrical
   resistivity was observed. When compared with the base alloy, the
   hardness and density of the composites were considerably improved. A
   significant difference was observed in the mechanical properties such as
   the ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, and yield stress. With
   the current processing sequence, the composite with 15 wt. \% exhibited
   an enhancement of about 34 \% in tensile strength compared to base
   alloy. The tensile tested fracture surface and XRD imaging comprised and
   gave the evidence for weak linkage of the phases, which lead to
   fracture. The evidence for the strength properties was revealed in the
   Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) observations. The microstructure
   and the interfacial binding of various phases in the specimens were
   observed in the high resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)

Title = {{Dimensionality Reduction for Smart IoT Sensors}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Smart IoT sensors are characterized by their ability to sense and
   process signals, producing high-level information that is usually sent
   wirelessly while minimising energy consumption and maximising
   communication efficiency. Systems are getting smarter, meaning that they
   are providing ever richer information from the same raw data. This
   increasing intelligence can occur at various levels, including in the
   sensor itself, at the edge, and in the cloud. As sending one byte of
   data is several orders of magnitude more energy-expensive than
   processing it, data must be handled as near as possible to its
   generation. Thus, the intelligence should be located in the sensor;
   nevertheless, it is not always possible to do so because real data is
   not always available for designing the algorithms or the hardware
   capacity is limited. Smart devices detecting data coming from inertial
   sensors are a good example of this. They generate hundreds of bytes per
   second (100 Hz, 12-bit sampling of a triaxial accelerometer) but useful
   information comes out in just a few bytes per minute (number of steps,
   type of activity, and so forth). We propose a lossy compression method
   to reduce the dimensionality of raw data from accelerometers,
   gyroscopes, and magnetometers, while maintaining a high quality of
   information in the reconstructed signal coming from an embedded device.
   The implemented method uses an adaptive vector-quantisation algorithm
   that represents the input data with a limited set of codewords. The
   adaptive process generates a codebook that evolves to become highly
   specific for the input data, while providing high compression rates. The
   codebook's reconstruction quality is measured with a peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 40 dB for a 12-bit representation.}},

Title = {{Lagrangian interpolation algorithm for PIV data}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new Lagrangian based interpolation scheme is proposed for recovering
   velocity field data from within masked regions in particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) experiments. As a first step, the mean field within
   the masked region is filled through an iterative convolution operation
   using an optimized kernel. Next, the Lagrangian interpolation scheme
   estimates velocity field data within the masked region using a weighted
   average of past and future snapshot data along a mean field streamline
   from outside of the masked region. The Lagrangian interpolation scheme
   is compared directly with a traditional bilinear interpolation approach
   for two datasets: the flow development over a circular cylinder within
   the laminar vortex shedding regime (ReD = 150) and turbulent vortex
   shedding regime (ReD = 3000). The results show that for both Reynolds
   numbers investigated, the Lagrangian approach provides up to a 5x
   improvement in average velocity reconstruction error. Application of the
   proposed interpolation scheme to the estimation of body forces was
   assessed. For both the momentum and impulse control volume approaches to
   estimate instantaneous forces, the Lagrangian interpolation scheme
   provides up to 10x improvement in the estimation of volume integral
   contributions to instantaneous drag and lift.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Urban Heat Island Intensity Estimation Methods Using
   Urbanized WRF in Berlin, Germany}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we present a meso-scale simulation of the urban
   microclimate in Berlin, Germany, using the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction platform. The objective
   of the study is to derive an accurate estimate of the near-surface urban
   heat island (UHI) intensity. The simulation is conducted over a two-week
   summer period. We compare different physical schemes, different urban
   canopy schemes and different methods for estimating the UHI intensity.
   The urban fraction of each urban category is derived using the
   Copernicus Impervious Density data and the Corine Land Cover data.
   High-resolution City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) data is used to
   estimate the building height densities required by the multi-layer urban
   canopy model (UCM). Within the single-layer UCM, we implement an
   anthropogenic heat profile based on the large scale urban consumption of
   energy (LUCY) model. The optimal model configuration combines the WRF
   Single Moment Five-Class (WSM5) microphysics scheme, the
   Bougeault-Lacarrere planetary boundary layer scheme, the eta similarity
   (Mellor-Yamada-Janjic) surface layer scheme, the Noah
   Multi-Parameterization land surface model, the Dudhia and Rapid
   Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) radiation schemes, and the multi-layer
   UCM (including the building energy model). Our simulated UHI intensity
   results agree well with measurements with a root mean squared error of
   0.86 K and a mean bias error of 0.20 K. After model validation, we
   proceed to compare several UHI intensity calculation methods, including
   the `ring rural reference' (RRR) method and the `virtual rural
   reference' (VRR) method. The VRR mthod is also known as the `urban
   increment' method. We suggest and argument that the VRR approach is
   superior.}},

Abstract = {{When a change of speaker in a Scripture text is not explicitly
   introduced by a speech orienter, Bible readers may feel the text is
   ``intrusive.{''} This article proposes a taxonomy for categorizing such
   intrusive voices in various passages of Scripture. The intrusion may be
   external (due to scribal activity) or internal (as written by the
   original author). Internal intrusions can be further classified as
   citations or unmarked conversational turns. Textual signals that a
   change of speaker has occurred in the original texts include a change in
   deictic reference (primarily pronominal) and change in semantic content.
   The article lists orthographic and linguistic devices that translators
   have used in existing Scripture translations to clarify that a change of
   speaker has occurred, and also examines several passages where it is not
   fully clear whether an intrusive voice is present or not.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   The unprecedented situation caused by the coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected endoscopic practice in
   regard to access, volume, and workflow. We aimed to assess the potential
   changes in the technical outcomes of endoscopic retrograde
   cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures carried out in patients with
   confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   Methods:
   We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective, matched
   case-control study of ERCP procedures carried out in patients with
   confirmed COVID-19. The main outcome was technical success of the
   procedure as assessed by the endoscopist, and the secondary outcome was
   the development of procedure-related adverse events. Each case was
   matched in a 1:4 ratio with controls extracted from each center's
   database in order to identify relevant changes in outcome measures
   compared with the pre-pandemic era.
   Results:
   Eighteen procedures performed in 16 COVID-19 patients {[}14 men, 65
   years (9-82)] and 67 controls were included in the final analysis.
   Technical success was achieved in 14/18 COVID-19 cases, which was
   significantly lower as compared with the control group (14/18 versus
   64/67, p = 0.034), with an endoscopic reintervention required in 9/18
   cases. However, the rate of procedure-related adverse events was low in
   both groups (1/18 versus 10/67, p = 0.44). On multivariable analysis,
   COVID-19 status remained the only risk factor for technical failure of
   the procedure {[}odds ratio of 19.9 (95\% confidence interval
   1.4-269.0)].
   Conclusions:
   The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the volume and practice of ERCP,
   resulting in lower technical success rates without significantly
   impacting patient safety. Prioritizing cases and following
   recommendations on safety measures can ensure good outcome with minimal
   risk in dedicated centers.}},

Abstract = {{By adding medical service centres (MSCs) to their range of services,
   hospitals can participate in the outpatient sector. The aim of the MSC
   guideline (2004) was to ensure high quality health care in rural areas.
   It is unknown if organizational or regional factors influence hospitals
   providing services via MSCs. Our analyses focus on the identification of
   factors that explain the operation of an MSC by hospitals. The data are
   based on the mandatory structured quality reports of German hospitals (n
   = 1,605). These organizational data (teaching status, size and
   ownership) are supplemented by settlement structure and contextual data
   (e.g., location, doctor density). We estimated a cross-sectional
   multilevel logistic regression model to identify determinants of
   hospitals operating MSCs.
   In 2017, 27\% of 1,605 hospitals had one or more MSCs. On an
   organizational level, for-profit ownership (-) and the number of beds
   (+) were significant determinants of providing MSCs. The analyses show
   that the interaction between settlement structure and ownership has an
   influence on the operation of an MSC. Organizational factors determine
   the provision of MSCs, with regional determinants playing a role as
   well. This indicates that hospital behaviour is difficult to predict and
   that individual factors shape both profit orientation and responsibility
   for sufficient health care in the region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Ivanhoe by Walter Scott in the Creative Perception of Ivan Turgenev.
   Article Two}},
Journal = {{TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{461}},
Pages = {{23-29}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Based on the story ``An Unhappy Girl{''} (1868), the article elaborates
   the issue of Ivan Turgenev's artistic perception of Ivanhoe (1819) by
   Walter Scott. It focuses research attention on the analysis of the
   dramatic situation of an unhappy love, which the Russian writer creates
   following the tradition of the English novelist. For Turgenev, ``An
   Unhappy Girl{''} was the second stage in making his creative dialogue
   with Walter Scott. In the story ``The Jew{''} (1840), the subject of
   artistic reflection is the images of a Jewish father and his daughter,
   placed in the conditions of a socio-historical and moral-psychological
   crisis. ``An Unhappy Girl{''} is dedicated to a tragedy of a different
   nature: the love of a Jewish girl Susanna and a young Russian nobleman
   Michel. This story echoes Rebecca's fate, an important element of which
   was an unrequited feeling for Ivanhoe. With the help of Scott's
   material, Turgenev lines up the drama of first love, the motif of Jewish
   origin, and the tragedy of death (suicide). From this line, the features
   and omens, images and events that form the epic fullness of Russian life
   (from the capital to the province and vice versa), the colouring of the
   national world in moral and philosophical categories develop in
   different directions. In the centre of the author's comprehension, there
   is a proud person suffering from humiliation and forced to submit to the
   circumstances of misfortune. In dialogue with Scott, Turgenev focuses on
   the moral and psychological basis of human agony. At the stage of
   planning the story, the writer conceived a parallel of the entire love
   story in general and the image of Susanna in particular with Ivanhoe.
   Initially, this parallel had the function of a structural element, as
   evidenced by the data of the draft autograph. In the first manuscript,
   Turgenev includes two direct references to Scott in the plot structure
   of the story. It is important that Turgenev firmly merges the connection
   of personal experience with the famous literary source through the
   consciousness of his young characters. Following the example of the
   English novelist, the Russian writer gradually and delicately reveals
   the sensual world of Susanna, showing the clash of opposing principles
   in it: on the one hand, the proud awareness of her dignity and the
   desire for happiness, and, on the other, the need (demand) for humility.
   For Rebecca, Scott finds a way out of the prevailing contradiction in
   full concentration on her own virtue. However, for Turgenev, such a path
   turns out to be impossible. The writer sees the outcome of Susanna's
   tragic fate only in her death, and herewith he emphasizes that even
   death is not able to remove the imprint of suffering.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Little is known about the results of young vascular
   neurosurgeons who perform only microsurgical clip reconstruction in the
   era since the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) or about
   the training and caseload required to equivocate the results of senior,
   more experienced colleagues. The aim of this study was to compare
   clinical outcomes of patients treated by young and senior vascular
   neurosurgeons at Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam,
   adjusting for case mix.
   METHODS: A partially prospective and partially retrospective database
   was used. Hierarchical mixed models with a random intercept for surgeon
   were used for confounder adjustment, and propensity score matching for
   complexity was used to create comparable groups.
   RESULTS: The study included 609 patients harboring 767 aneurysms. Most
   (86\%) of the aneurysms had at least 1 complexity characteristic, with
   the majority having 3 characteristics. The most often encountered
   complexity characteristics were the presence of a broad neck and the
   presence of branches emerging from the aneurysm. Use of temporary
   clipping and skull base approaches was significantly higher in the young
   vascular neurosurgeons group (P < 0.0001). The complexity score differed
   significantly between senior and young vascular neurosurgeons (P<
   0.001). After propensity score matching for complexity, multivariable
   logistic regression showed young vascular neurosurgeons to be
   significantly associated with better outcomes for ruptured aneurysms
   (propensity score weighted odds ratio 0.55 {[}95\% confidence interval
   0.35-0.88], P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a high-volume neurovascular center where both
   endovascular and microsurgical treatment options are available, young
   vascular neurosurgeons can be trained to achieve at least the same
   results as their senior colleagues despite increased complexity.}},

Abstract = {{While past studies on Airbnb pricing highlight the importance of room
   features, host characteristics and location factors, little has been
   investigated about whether these factors are the same across different
   property/room types, locations and seasons. To fill that gap, this paper
   presents a study about the drivers of Airbnb prices in Bristol using
   ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically-weighted regression
   (GWR) methods. The estimated models exhibit sharply different levels of
   goodness-of-fit, suggesting that the prices of different room types
   might not be explained by the same set of price factors. The results
   also uncover statistically significant differences between the price
   determinants of apartments and house listings and reveal spatial
   patterns in the price effects. These findings have implications for
   price setting and the assessment of competition. Future studies should
   account for potential differences across property/room types, as well as
   to consider the spatial variability of the estimated coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{We present a combined oxygen K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy and
   resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the bilayer
   ruthenate Ca3Ru2O7. Our RIXS experiments on Ca3Ru2O7 were carried out on
   the overlapping planar and interplanar oxygen resonances, which are
   distinguishable from the apical one. Comparison to equivalent oxygen
   K-edge spectra recorded on band-Mott insulating Ca2RuO4 is made. In
   contrast to Ca2RuO4 spectra, which contain excitations linked to Mott
   physics, Ca3Ru2O7 spectra feature only intra-t(2g) ones that do not
   directly involve the Coulomb energy scale. As found in Ca2RuO4, we
   resolve two intra-t(2g) excitations in Ca3Ru2O7. Moreover, the lowest
   lying excitation in Ca3Ru2O7 shows a significant dispersion, revealing a
   collective character different from what is observed in Ca2RuO4.
   Theoretical modeling supports the interpretation of this lowest energy
   excitation in Ca3Ru2O7 as a magnetic transverse mode with multiparticle
   character, whereas the corresponding excitation in Ca2RuO4 is assigned
   to combined longitudinal and transverse spin modes. These fundamental
   differences are discussed in terms of the inequivalent magnetic
   ground-state manifestations in Ca2RuO4 and Ca3Ru2O7.}},

Title = {{Metamodels Resulting from Two Different Geometry Morphing Approaches Are

Journal = {{APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Noise vibration and harshness (NVH) development often takes place in the
   later development phases. Shifting the optimization to the early digital
   development phase enables more parameters to participate in the
   optimization and leads to a more holistic development process. Digital
   NVH development often modifies system and component frequency response
   functions (FRFs) using finite element (FE) simulation. Currently, the
   often manual process of creating new FE models for modified designs
   makes a systematic evaluation of many designs difficult and
   time-consuming. In this paper, we take on these difficulties and use
   both a Direct Morphing approach and a Box Morphing approach to
   automatically adopt the first existing FE models to modified designs. We
   use the generated simulation results to fit metamodels describing the
   correlation between geometrical parameters and characteristic FRF
   values. These metamodels provide an easy and fast to use tool for
   designers to consider NVH demands. In a simulation example, we
   demonstrate the capabilities by modifying the kinematic hard points of a
   vehicle suspension and using them to modify the noise transfer
   sensitivity. We show that the metamodels can lead the digital design
   process to intuitively and specifically reduce characteristic component
   FRF values by changing the location of the component hard points.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important structural elements of a tokamak is a vacuum
   discharge chamber, which satisfies specific requirements concerning the
   induction method of plasma generation and, accordingly, the presence of
   alternating magnetic fields additionally acting on the chamber.
   Moreover, the chamber should not only be able to create and confine a
   current plasma but also be able to diagnose its parameters through
   appropriate pipes. The small spherical tokamak being created at MEPhI
   for both educational and research purposes has an extensive program of
   such studies; therefore, the discharge chamber should not only allow
   fast evacuation and withstand alternating magnetic fields but also be
   convenient for measuring its parameters, using various diagnostics, as
   well as allow quick replacement of internal elements and introduction of
   additional power into the chamber. The paper describes the design of the
   vacuum chamber of the MEPhIST-1 tokamak, which meets these requirements,
   and presents calculations to justify the choice of material and the
   thickness of the characteristic elements of the chamber, and also
   presents the test results of the finished chamber.}},

Abstract = {{The results of satellite wildfire monitoring and estimates for the

   2001 to 2019 are presented. The features of space monitoring used to
   assess the burned-out areas and the amounts of wildfire emissions are

   reveal that the total burned-out areas and the amounts of emissions of
   harmful gases and fine aerosols in Siberia were abnormally high in 2019.
   In 2019, 72.4 thousand km(2) of Siberia was affected by wildfires, which
   constituted 42\% of the area of wildfires that occurred this year
   throughout Russia. In 2019, the Irkutsk oblast suffered the most from
   wildfires in July (11.14 thousand km(2)) and August (7.24 thousand

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Beekeeping is an important part of the bioeconomy. Throughout its
   existence, it has been one of the fields of human endeavour that
   contributes to sustainability. It has significant benefits for society,
   both economically and environmentally. Most (90\%) of honeybees' benefit
   to humankind lies in their pollination capacity, and only 10\% lies in
   bee products (honey, propolis, wax, etc.). The research presented was
   carried out in the conditions of the Czech Republic in the first half of
   2020 through a questionnaire survey within a Google Form, which was
   aimed at beekeepers. The aim of this paper is, based on a questionnaire
   survey, to evaluate ecosystem services of beekeeping from the
   perspective of beekeepers, including the valuation of selected types of
   ecosystem services. The results show that in the Czech Republic, the
   most common reason for beekeeping is as a hobby (34.18\%). As expected,
   the demand for pollination is very low compared to other countries
   (11.6\%). From the point of view of the benefits of ecosystem services,
   the questionnaire survey showed that the most important benefit is the
   pollination of cultivated and other plants (54.7\%) and honeybee
   products (24.8\%). The value of all selected ecosystem services totals
   3,646,368 CZK. The results show that state support is needed, which
   should address the negative demographic development of beekeepers and
   thus ensure the production of ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Supply management programs for Canada's dairy and poultry sectors are
   intended to reduce price volatility and provide fair returns for
   producers. However, the reduced risk and higher returns for these
   producers may contribute to higher farmland values. This paper estimates
   the impact of supply management on farmland values in the Canadian
   province of Ontario using a hedonic approach based on over 25,000
   farmland sales. The results indicate that farmland values have been
   positively impacted by supply-managed livestock density. In addition, a
   recent policy change - a cap on the price of dairy quota - is found to
   further contribute to increased farmland values.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Guideline-concordant treatment (GCT) of lung cancer has been
   observed to vary across geographic regions over the years. However,
   there is little evidence as to what extent this variation is explained
   by differences in patients' clinical characteristics versus contextual
   factors, including socioeconomic inequalities.
   Methods: This study evaluated the independent effects of individual-and
   area-level risk factors on geographic and temporal variation in receipt
   of GCT among patients with lung cancer. Receipt of GCT was defined on
   the basis of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We
   used Bayesian spatial-temporal multilevel models to combine individual
   and areal predictors and outcomes while accounting for geographically
   structured and unstructured correlation and linear and nonlinear trends.
   Results: Our study included 4,854 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
   small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cases, reported to the Victorian Lung
   Cancer Registry between 2011 and 2018. Area-level data comprised
   socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness data at the local government
   area level in Victoria, Australia. Around 60.36\% of patients received
   GCT, and the rates varied across geographic areas over time. This
   variation was mainly associated with poor performance status, advanced
   clinical stages, NSCLC types, public hospital insurance, area-level
   deprivation, and comorbidities.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the need to address disparities in
   receipt of GCT among patients with lung cancer with poor performance
   status, NSCLC, advanced clinical stage, stage I-III SCLC, stage III
   NSCLC, public hospital insurance, and comorbidities, and living in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.
   Impact: Two-year mortality outcomes significantly improved with GCT.
   Interventions aimed at reducing these inequalities could help to improve
   lung cancer outcomes.}},

Title = {{Permeate Flux Control in SMBR System by Using Neural Network Internal
   Model Control}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a design of a data-driven-based neural network
   internal model control for a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) with
   hollow fiber for microfiltration. The experiment design is performed for
   measurement of physical parameters from an actuator input (permeate pump
   voltage), which gives the information (outputs) of permeate flux and
   trans-membrane pressure (TMP). The palm oil mill effluent is used as an
   influent preparation to depict fouling phenomenon in the membrane
   filtration process. From the experiment, membrane fouling potential is
   observed from flux decline pattern, with a rapid increment of TMP (above
   200 mbar). Membrane fouling is a complex process and the available
   models in literature are not designed for control system (filtration
   performance). Therefore, this work proposes an aeration fouling control
   strategy to measure the filtration performance. The artificial neural
   networks (Feed-Forward Neural Network-FFNN, Radial Basis Function Neural
   Network-RBFNN and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural
   Network-NARXNN) are used to model dynamic behaviour of flux and TMP. In
   this case, only flux is used in closed loop control application, whereby
   the TMP effect is used for monitoring. The simulation results show that
   reliable prediction of membrane fouling potential is obtained. It can be
   observed that almost all the artificial neural network (ANN) models have
   similar shape with the actual data set, with the highest accuracy of
   more than 90\% for both RBFNN and NARXN. The RBFNN is preferable due to
   simple structure of the network. In the control system, the RBFNN IMC
   depicts the highest closed loop performance with only 3.75 s (settling
   time) for setpoint changes when compared with other controllers. In
   addition, it showed fast performance in disturbance rejection with less
   overshoot. In conclusion, among the different neural network tested
   configurations the one based on radial basis function provides the best
   performance with respect to prediction as well as control performance.}},

Abstract = {{The number of companies in Indonesia that have participated in
   environmental-related activities continues to grow. Some of these
   companies have also engaged and implemented an assessment program called
   Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating (PROPER). This
   assessment program was initially launched by the Indonesian Ministry of
   Environment in 1995 to measure and rate the environmental performance of
   companies in Indonesia. They have also administered an environmental
   management system as part of their environmental protection initiatives.
   However, the level of environmental disclosure by these companies is
   still low. This may occur due to the current situation in which the
   companies are not obliged to incorporate environmental disclosures on
   their annual reports. For those companies that disclose their
   environmental performance, there is also no apparent reason on why they
   have done that. This research aims to examine the effect of
   environmental performance, company financial performance, and company
   characteristics on environmental disclosure. The population used in this
   research comprised of all registered non-fmancial companies in the
   Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2014-2016. The sample was selected using a
   purposive sampling method to obtain 36 sample companies and analyzed
   through multiple regression analysis. Results show that the
   environmental performance variable, which is described by PROPER ratings
   and environmental management systems, and company size variable, both
   affect the extent of environmental disclosures. However, the financial
   performance variable, which is described by companies' profitability and
   leverage, and the number of board commissioners variable, both do not
   significantly affect the extent of environmental disclosures.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions to discovered deceit have important consequences politically,

   tolerance of deceit. By it, observers of lies intuitively put themselves
   in the position of the liar. From that perspective, their tolerance,
   ranging from condemnation to acceptance, is determined by how much the
   social norms of reciprocity and social responsibility are perceived to
   be upheld or violated overall. Tolerance encourages identification with
   the liar. Condemnation fosters dis-identification. To test the SNM, 116
   participants recounted lies they told and were told to them they felt
   were justified and others they regretted/condemned. The social impact of
   the deceit, the obligation for honesty, and other relevant constructs
   were assessed for each. Analyses support the model. We illustrate the
   SNM's applied value for understanding public reaction to the lying of

   experience with personal suffering are both necessary and helpful in
   dealing sensitively and empathically with patients' distress. If a

   enriching experiences for his/her therapeutic efforts. At present, there
   are next to no instances of therapists reflecting on their experience of
   suffering from this viewpoint. The author reports a number of
   observations made after confirmation of, and during treatment for, a
   breast-cancer condition. Salient features of personal relations in the
   professional and private context and the analyst's self-experience are
   discussed in terms of their conflictual, and hence productive and
   enriching, aspects. The article closes with thoughts on the questions
   why knowledge of one's own vulnerability is so often neglected in
   psychoanalytic theory and by analytic institutions, and why there has
   been such scant appreciation for its potential worth.}},

Title = {{Exogenous Ketones as Therapeutic Signaling Molecules in High-Stress
   Occupations: Implications for Mitigating Oxidative Stress and
   Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Future Research}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION AND METABOLIC INSIGHTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-stress occupations (ie, firefighters, military personnel, police
   officers, etc.) are often plagued by cardiometabolic diseases induced by
   exposure to chronic stressors. Interrupted sleep cycles, poor dietary
   patterns, lack of physical activity, and smoke exposure along with
   simultaneous psychological stressors promote chronic low-grade
   inflammation and excessive oxidative stress. Collectively, these data
   suggest that practical interventions which might mitigate the underlying
   pathologies of these cardiometabolic diseases are warranted. Ketones,
   specifically R-beta HB, modulates intracellular signaling cascades such
   as the cellular redox ratios of NAD(+)/NADH, the activity of NAD
   dependent deacetylases SIRT1 and SIRT3, and promotes a robust
   mitochondrial environment which favors reductions in oxidative stress
   and inflammation. To date, the literature examining R-beta HB as a
   signaling metabolite has mostly been performed from endogenous R-beta HB
   production achieved through nutritional ketosis or cell culture and
   mouse models using exogenous R-beta HB. To the authors knowledge, only 1
   study has attempted to report on the effects of exogenous ketones and
   the mitigation of oxidative stress/inflammation. Therefore, the scope of
   this review is to detail the mechanisms of R-beta HB as a signaling
   metabolite and the role that exogenous ketones might play in mitigating
   diseases in individuals serving in high-stress occupations.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to give a mathematical analysis of
   heat and mass transfer in a boundary layer flow of Casson fluid over an
   inclined stretching cylinder in the presence of magnetic nanoparticles.
   The effects of Casson parameter, curvature of the cylinder, angle of
   inclination, Buoyancy force, external magnetic field, thermal radiation,
   Joule heating, viscous dissipation, heat source and chemical reaction
   are taken into account. Appropriate transformations are incorporated to
   convert the governing partial differential equations and the boundary
   conditions suitable for computation. The elegant optimal homotopy
   analysis method is used to obtain analytic approximations for the
   resulting system of nonlinear differential equations. The features of
   flow characteristics such as velocity, temperature and concentration
   profiles in response to the variations of the emerging parameters are
   simulated and examined in detail. Extensive analysis is also made to
   explore the influences of relevant constraints on the rates of momentum,
   heat and mass transfer near the surface of the cylinder. Among the many
   outputs of the study, it is found that increasing the non-Newtonian
   Casson parameter can slowdown the flow velocity and enhance the
   temperature and concentration profiles. It is also revealed that
   significant enhancement of wall friction and mass transfer rate can be
   achieved by increasing the curvature of the cylinder. Further, the
   analytic approximations obtained by implementing the optimal homotopy
   analysis method to the present model are in close agreements with
   previous studies under common assumptions.}},

Title = {{U-234, U-238, Ra-226, Ra-228 and K-40 concentrations in feed coal and
   its combustion products during technological processes in the Upper
   Silesian Industrial Region, Poland}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hard coal is the predominant energy source in Poland. The unavoidable
   consequence of coal combustion is the production of huge amounts of ash
   which can be concentrated in radionuclides. The ashes from coal
   combustion are utilized or stored and may affect the quality of the
   environment. Therefore, the estimation of radionuclides in hard coal and
   by-products is of crucial importance. The analyzed samples included
   ashes produced in ash furnaces, power plants and individual home
   furnaces operating in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region, Southern
   Poland, during the hard coal burning. This paper presents radioactivity
   concentrations of Ra-228, (226) Ra and K-40 in hard coal, bottom and fly
   ash samples from Polish coal-fired power plants obtained during various
   technological coal combustion processes and generated in individual
   domestic furnaces, determined using the HPGe gamma spectrometry
   technique. The measurements of U-234,U-238 concentrations were performed
   after sample preparation using alpha-particle spectrometer. The
   concentrations of the obtained radionuclides differ greatly in the fly
   and bottom ash samples. The lowest concentrations of Ra-226, Ra-228,
   U-234, U-238 were observed in bottom ashes from the co-firing of hard
   coal and biomass in a fluidized-bed furnace, whereas the highest
   concentrations of Ra-226 (163 +/- 6 Bq/kg), Ra-228 (100 +/- 2 Bq/kg)
   isotopes were found in the ashes from individual household furnaces.
   This means that both the feed coal type and combustion techniques have a
   direct impact on the concentration of radionuclides in ash. Hard coal
   silt samples may be enriched in radionuclides and the radioactive
   equilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238 even in the case of coal is not
   always achieved. The concentrations of the analyzed isotopes in ashes
   are 5-7-fold higher than in feed coal. Given that combustion by-products
   are utilized as construction products, it should be noted that for some
   ash samples, the radiological hazard indices approach or exceed the
   maximum permitted levels. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SLEEP AND BREATHING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1759-1765}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is a widely used tool which
   has been validated as a measure of sleepiness. However, the scores
   within individual patients referred for clinical sleep services vary
   considerably which may limit the clinical use of the ESS. We sought to
   determine the test-retest reliability of the ESS if scores were
   classified as either normal or sleepy. Methods We measured the ESS in
   patients presenting to our sleep center at a clinical visit and again
   when a sleep study was done. Demographic and clinical information was
   extracted from the electronic medical record. Results Average ESS scores
   were similar on 2 administrations, mean (SD) of 9.8 (5.4) and 10.2
   (6.2). Bland-Altman analysis showed upper and lower limits of agreement
   of 7.5 and - 6.7, respectively. No demographic or clinical variables
   were identified which contributed to the intra-individual variability.
   Of the patients who presented with an initial ESS < 11, 80\% had a
   second ESS < 11. Of the patients who presented with an initial ESS >=
   11, 89\% had a second ESS >= 11. Cohen's kappa for the two
   administrations of the ESS was 0.67 (95\% CI of 0.51-0.83). Using
   previously published reports, we calculated Cohen's kappa for
   polysomnographic determination of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with
   values ranging from 0.26 to 0.69. Conclusions Individual ESS scores
   varied considerably within individual patients, but with classification
   into either normal or sleepy, the test-retest reliability was
   substantial and in line with other clinical measures including
   polysomnographic determination of the AHI.}},

Title = {{Lowering the impact of food insecurity in African American adults with
   type 2 diabetes mellitus (LIFT-DM) - Study protocol for a randomized
   controlled trial}},
Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is strong evidence that disparities in the burden of
   diabetes exist by both race and poverty. Food insecurity, or an
   inability to or limitation in accessing nutritionally adequate food, is
   an important modifiable social determinant of health, particularly in
   adults with chronic disease. African Americans are more likely to be
   diagnosed with diabetes and more likely than whites to be food insecure.
   Methods: We describe a 4-year ongoing randomized controlled trial, which
   will test the separate and combined efficacy of monthly food vouchers
   and monthly food stock boxes layered upon diabetes education in
   improving glycemic control in low income, food insecure, African
   Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a 2 x 2 factorial design.
   Three hundred African American adults with clinical diagnosis of
   diabetes and HbA1c >= 8\% will be randomized into one of four groups: 1)
   diabetes education alone; 2) diabetes education plus food vouchers; 3)
   diabetes education plus stock boxes; and 4) diabetes education plus
   combined food vouchers and stock boxes. Our primary hypothesis is: among
   low-income, food insecure, African Americans with type 2 diabetes, those
   receiving diabetes education enhanced with food supplementation (food
   vouchers alone, stock boxes alone, or combination) will have
   significantly greater reduction in HbA1c at 12 months compared to those
   receiving diabetes education only.
   Discussion: Results from this study will yield valuable insight
   currently lacking on how best to design and deliver diabetes
   interventions to low-income, food insecure, African Americans with
   diabetes that takes into account both clinical and social determinants
   of health.}},

   characteristics associated with worse reactions to the initiation of
   imaginal exposure in PTSD}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{135}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This study examines whether imaginal exposure leads to
   symptom exacerbation, systematically comparing individuals who received
   prolonged exposure (PE) to those who received pharmacotherapy. The study
   also examined whether common clinical features increase the likelihood
   of symptom exacerbation.
   Method: In 151 men and women with PTSD, we examined rates of reliable
   exacerbation of PTSD and depression symptoms after initiation of
   imaginal exposure and compared it to those receiving sertraline. We also
   examined relationships between exacerbation, treatment outcome, dropout,
   imaginal distress, and specific clinical features, including
   co-occurring MDD, multiple co-occurring disorders, childhood sexual
   abuse as target trauma, and a history of childhood physical or sexual
   abuse.
   Results: Symptom exacerbation was not more common in PE compared to
   sertraline, not associated with higher dropout, or predictive of worse
   outcome. Those with co-occurring depression or multiple disorders, a
   target trauma of child sexual abuse, or a history of child abuse
   reported functionally equivalent peak distress at onset of imaginal as
   those without these characteristics. These factors did not lead to more
   exacerbation or worse adherence.
   Conclusion: Exacerbation was not specific to PE and patients with and
   without symptom worsening showed comparable treatment gains, suggesting
   symptom exacerbation may reflect a common clinical process.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are biopolymers that perform diverse cellular functions.
   Microtubule behavior regulation occurs in part through
   post-translational modification of both the alpha- and beta-subunits of
   tubulin. One class of modifications is the heterogeneous addition of
   glycine and/or glutamate residues to the disordered C-terminal tails
   (CTTs) of tubulin. Because of their prevalence in stable, high-stress
   cellular structures such as cilia, we sought to determine if these
   modifications alter microtubules' intrinsic stiffness. Here, we describe
   the purification and characterization of differentially modified pools
   of tubulin from Tetrahymena thermophila. We found that
   post-translational modifications do affect microtubule stiffness but do
   not affect the number of protofilaments incorporated into microtubules.
   We measured the spin dynamics of nuclei in the CTT backbone by NMR
   spectroscopy to explore the mechanism of this change. Our results show
   that the alpha-tubulin CTT does not protrude out from the microtubule
   surface, as is commonly depicted in models, but instead interacts with
   the dimer's surface. This suggests that the interactions of the
   alpha-tubulin CTT with the tubulin body contributes to the stiffness of
   the assembled microtubule, thus providing insight into the mechanism by
   which polyglycylation and polyglutamylation can alter microtubule
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) of power electronic converters has
   obtained much attention in many applications and especially in electric
   motor control. As the control loop is closed by predicting the future
   plant behavior by means of a mathematical model, disturbances and
   uncertainties are important aspects when using any MPC strategy. The
   plant model may be inaccurate due to plenty of reasons, such as
   parameter mismatches or the inverter nonlinearity. If these disturbances
   are not properly addressed during the MPC design process, the control
   performance is deteriorated. Hence, a suitable disturbance observer
   (DOB) is required to compensate for model inaccuracies. This
   contribution is comparing different lumped-DOB designs in the context of
   a continuous-control set MPC for induction motor current control. As a
   baseline for comparison, a field-oriented proportional-integral
   (PI)-type regulator is utilized which does not require a DOB due to its
   integral feedback.Comprehensive experimental results prove the necessity
   of a proper DOB; however, it is also shown that the overall transient
   and steady-state control improvement due to MPC has to be bought at a
   high price since the computational burden is at least doubled compared
   to the PI-baseline.}},

Journal = {{PARTICUOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{63-71}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Characterisations of instantaneous mixing behaviours in fluidised beds
   with binary mixtures has many challenges. We studied the instantaneous
   mixing characteristics of binary mixtures in a 2-D quasi gas-solid
   fluidised bed using a capacitance probe method. This method enabled the
   quantitative assessment of instantaneous mixing behaviours, including
   mixing index, rate, and time. Three kinds of binary mixtures of similar
   size but different density were used for the transient and steady
   fluidisation experiments in a bubbling fluidised bed. The mixing curves
   of initially segregated binary mixtures were acquired, and the
   instantaneous characteristics for the entire process were analysed. An
   equation was proposed to describe the mixing process and predict the
   mixing degree over time. By comparing experiments with different working
   conditions, the effects of superficial gas velocity and density ratio on
   the mixing in the centre and at the wall of the fluidised bed were
   addressed. During the stable fluidisation stage, the axial concentration
   profiles of the mixtures were obtained, and the mechanisms of mixing
   were discussed. Results showed that the mixing level increased
   logarithmically with time and eventually reached a relatively stable
   value. Increasing the superficial gas velocity and reducing the density
   ratio promoted mixing and reduced mixing time. High superficial gas
   velocities tended to mix the mixtures well and quickly, regardless of
   the density ratio of the two components. (C) 2020 Chinese Society of

Abstract = {{To solve the problem that dredging prediction systems provide inaccurate
   productivity predictions and rely heavily on mud concentration data.
   This paper presents a data mining method to accurately predict dredger
   productivity by using model-stacked generalization in the absence of mud
   concentration data. First, eliminate abnormal construction data, and
   l(2) norm normalization and log smooth transformation are then performed
   on the data. Second, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient method is
   used to extract features. Five machine learning models, namely, Lasso,
   Elastic net (ENet), Gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme
   gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine
   (LightGBM), were introduced to predict dredger productivity. Based on
   these five models, a stacked generalization model was applied. The
   results show that the goodness of fit R-2 of the stacked generalization
   model for productivity prediction is 0.9281, which is higher than the
   accuracy of the other algorithms investigated, and the optimization
   effect is obvious.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of Zhundong coal has encountered severe ash-related
   problems principally due to high-alkali feature. However, the evaluation
   of fouling tendency and correlations of chemical properties of Zhundong
   coals based on a large database has been seldom performed. The present
   work aimed reveal the correlations of chemical properties, distributions
   of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) and iron, and the fouling
   propensity of Zhundong high-alkali coals based on datasets of >250
   samples. The fuel ratio of the majority (similar to 95\%) of Zhundong
   coals lay in the range of 1.0-2.45. A quantified cor-relation between
   fuel ratio and volatile matter content was obtained. The ash composition
   of Zhundong coal gathered in a small area of the ternary diagram of
   Fe2O3-alkali metal-alkaline earth metal oxide components. The principal
   sodium of water-soluble form in Zhundong coals varied notably from 45\%
   95\%, more than half of the potassium was insoluble form, the majority
   (similar to 90\%) of alkaline earth metals were in forms of ammonium
   acetate-soluble and HCl-soluble, and similar to 67\% of iron was
   HCl-soluble form. The quantitative correlations based on plentiful
   datasets could improve the comprehension of correlations among the coal
   chemical properties, fouling behaviors and its reaction activity. (C)

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the era of big data, longer time series fault signals will not only
   be easy to copy and store, but also reduce the labor cost of manual
   labeling, which can better meet the needs of industrial big data. Aiming
   to effectively extract the key classification information from a longer
   time series of bearing vibration signals and achieve high diagnostic
   accuracy under noise and different load conditions. The one-dimensional
   adaptive long sequence convolutional network (ALSCN) is proposed. ALSCN
   can better extract features directly from high-dimensional original
   signals without manually extracting features and relying on expert
   knowledge. By adding two improved multi-scale modules, ALSCN can not
   only extract important features efficiently from noise signals, but also
   alleviate the problem of losing key information due to continuous
   down-sampling. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is
   constructed to automatically find the best combination of
   hyperparameters in ALSCN. Based on two bearing data sets, the model is
   compared with traditional model such as SVM and deep learning models
   such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) et al. The results prove
   that ALSCN has a higher diagnostic accuracy rate on 5120-dimensional
   sequences under -5 signal to noise ratio (SNR) with better
   generalization.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring of esterase (CES) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity
   in living cells has great potential for rapid diagnosis of malignant
   tumors. At present, using one bioluminescence (BL) probe to
   simultaneously detect (or image) these two enzymes' activity in tumors
   has not been reported. Herein, a bioluminescence ``turn-on{''} probe
   AcAH-Luc (6-acetamidohex-anoic acid-D-luciferin) was rationally designed
   for simultaneously imaging CES and HDAC activity with excellent
   sensitivity and selectivity. AcAH-Luc was successfully applied in vitro
   to selectively detect CES and HDAC6, a subtype of HDAC, at a linear
   concentration range of 0-100 and 0-120 nM with limits of detection
   (LODs) of 0.495 and 1.14 nM, respectively. In vivo results indicated
   that about 1/2 and 1/3 of the ``turn-on{''} BL signal of AcAH-Luc was
   contributed by CES and HDAC activity in the tumors, respectively. We
   envision that AcAH-Luc might be applied to simultaneously measure (and
   image) CES and HDAC activity in the clinic for assisting with the
   precise diagnosis of malignant tumors in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{The poor antiwear properties of Ti-6Al-4V have restricted its
   applications as biomedical materials. In this work, microgrooves with
   different groove width and graphene oxide (GO) coating were constructed
   on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V by laser processing and chemical assembly,
   respectively. The effects of microgroove width on the anticorrosion and
   biotribological properties of GOs-coated Ti-6Al-4V alloys were
   systematically investigated. The results indicate that the GOs-coated
   sample with 45 mu m groove width (Ti-45-GO) can effectively improve the
   anticorrosion of Ti-6Al-4V, due to the surface microstructure
   homogenization from Ti-45 substrate and the shielding effect of GO
   coatings. Furthermore, the Ti-45-GO sample exhibits excellent antiwear
   properties, owing to the capture of wear debris of microgrooves and the
   high strength and resilience from GO coatings.}},

Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper mainly analyzes the current situation of e-commerce in
   domestic SMEs and points out that there are limited initial investment
   and difficulty in financing in China's SMEs; e-commerce control is not
   scientific; e-commerce personnel of SMEs are not of high quality, in the
   case of improper setting of the e-commerce sector and shortage of
   talents, rigid management model, and outdated management concepts. By
   using the loss function and the value chain management theory of the
   deep learning in the stationary wavelet domain residual learning model,
   the e-commerce model of SMEs is newly constructed, and the e-commerce
   department as the core department of the enterprise is proposed. By
   training the optimal parameters of the deep residual network and
   comparing the results with other models, the method of this paper has a
   good effect against the sample. The original loss function based on the
   residual learning model deep learning is modified to solve the original
   model fuzzy problem, which improves the effect and has good robustness.
   Finally, based on the wavelet residual depth residual evaluation method,
   this paper evaluates the application effect of this model and proposes
   relevant suggestions for improving this model, including rationalizing
   and perfecting the external value chain coordination mechanism,
   establishing the e-commerce value chain sharing center, and promoting
   integration of e-commerce business, strengthening measures and
   recommendations in various aspects of e-commerce information
   construction. At last, taking the business activities of a company as an
   example, applying the theory described in this paper to specific
   practice proves the feasibility and practical value of the theory.}},

Abstract = {{Special vehicles called transporters are used to deliver heavy blocks in
   the shipyard. With the development and application of information and
   communication technology in shipyards, the real-time positioning and
   ship blocks online scheduling system for transporters are being
   developed. The real-time path planning of transporters is important for
   maintaining the overall production schedule of ship blocks. Because of
   the large volume and heavy weight of ship blocks, there may be some
   problems, such as high energy consumption, block deformation and other
   security issues, when transporters loading a block make a turn. So,
   fewer turns of the transporters are also important to make a block
   transportation schedule. The minimum driving distance and fewer turns
   are considered simultaneously for transporter real-time path planning in
   this paper. A hybrid model considering the number of turns and the
   optimal path of the transporter is constructed. Moreover, the optimal
   scheduling model, considering path missing, is also discussed. Several
   shortest path algorithms are analyzed, which show that the Dijkstra
   algorithm is the best way to solve this model. From the attained
   simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed model and algorithm
   have the ability to effectively solve real-time path planning for the
   ship block transportation in shipyards.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid and accurate method for detection of virus (SARS-CoV-2)-specific
   antibodies is important to contain the 2019 coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) outbreak, which is still urgently needed. Here, we develop a
   colorimetric-fluorescent dual-mode lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)
   biosensor for rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection of
   SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG in human serum using spike (S)
   protein-conjugated SiO2@Au@QD nanobeads (NBs) as labels. The assay only
   needs 1 mu L of the serum sample, can be completed within 15 min, and is
   100 times more sensitive than the colloidal gold-based LFIA. Two
   detection modes of our biosensor are available: the colorimetric mode
   for rapid screening of the patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection
   without any special instrument and the fluorescent mode for sensitive
   and quantitative analyses to determine the concentrations of specific
   IgM/IgG in human serum and detect the infection early and precisely. We
   validated the proposed method using 16 positive serum samples from

Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model, called HT1, is presented for one-dimensional (1D)
   heat transfer in saturated incompressible layered soil with effective
   porosity and steady fluid flow. The model uses a series-parallel
   approach for heat transfer and accounts for advection, conduction, and
   thermal mechanical dispersion assuming local thermal equilibrium between
   solid and fluid phases. The key to HT1 is the definition of separate
   columns for the solid matrix and mobile pore fluid. The solid matrix
   column includes the solid phase and immobile pore fluid and consists of
   fixed elements. The mobile pore fluid column uses Lagrangian
   element-tracking to follow the fluid motion, which reduces numerical
   dispersion and simplifies heat transfer to that of dispersive flux
   between contiguous elements. Development of the HT1 model is first
   presented, followed by verification checks using available analytical
   and numerical solutions. Simulation results for several numeric examples
   are used to demonstrate model performance and the effects of various
   parameters, including effective porosity and multiple soil layers, on
   heat transfer behavior for saturated incompressible soil. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{This study aims to estimate the average effect size of the relationship
   between self-efficacy and language proficiency and to examine factors
   that moderate the relationship. A meta analysis of the 493 effect sizes
   for the relationship between language learners' self-efficacy beliefs
   and their language proficiency from 74 published journal articles, book
   chapters, and dissertations revealed an average of small to medium
   effect size. The use of hierarchical linear models indicated 76.7\% of
   the variance between the published works, suggesting that the effect
   size varies across studies. Effect sizes reported in studies with East
   Asian students were larger than those reported in studies with students
   in Western culture. Parameter estimates of fixed effects noted that the
   effect sizes reported from zero order correlations inflated the effect
   size without consideration of the language, culture, grade-level, sample
   size, and data analysis procedures. This study contributes to the
   literature by summarizing studies from the last two decades in a

   square-wave modulation}},
Journal = {{METROLOGIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The quantum Fisher information (QFI) plays a key role in quantum
   metrological scenarios, and can be enhanced by certain entanglement
   protocols. In this work, we focus on the maximal mean QFI forLqubits,
   and study how a dynamical decoupling scheme rescues the
   entanglement-assisted QFI, which would be rapidly damaged by decoherence
   without such a scheme. We found that the square-wave modulation for the
   transition frequency of the qubit can be settled in a recursive transfer
   matrix form thus both periodic and random pulse sequences can be
   investigated exactly by assuming that the spectral density of the
   reservoir is Lorentzian. Considering the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
   state as an initial state ofLqubits imbedded in the independent damping
   channels, the use of additional square-wave pulse sequences allows the
   Heisenberg scaling to be restored for parameterestimation precision. How
   to optimize the pulse parameters with certain pulse energies should be
   carefully treated. The analyzability of the modulated damping dynamics
   may provide a potential start point for defeating decoherence in quantum
   information processing.}},

Title = {{Characterization of initial and subsequent yield behaviors of
   closed-cell aluminum foams under multiaxial loadings}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{As one of widely-used multi-functional materials, metallic foams are
   often subjected to multiaxial stress states in practical applications;
   in which the yield behaviors under different stress states need to be
   better characterized. However, it is difficult to conduct multiaxial
   mechanical tests on foam materials, especially under arbitrarily
   proportional triaxial loadings. In this study, numerical modeling of the
   yield properties of aluminum (Al) foam is performed based upon 3D
   image-based models. Real structural models of the Al foam are
   reconstructed using microscopic X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT)
   technique for multiaxial characterization computationally. Numerical
   simulation reveals that plastic collapse and fracture of cell-walls
   first occur in a relatively weak zone under prescribed uni/tri-axial
   loadings, whereas happen in the central section under biaxial loadings.
   An initial yield criterion is defined based upon energy dissipation. A
   constant stress proportion coefficient can be obtained under the
   stress-controlled triaxial proportional loading and its effectiveness is
   also validated by comparing the stress-strain responses with those under
   velocity-controlled uniaxial and hydrostatic compressive loading. It is
   found that the initial yield points of foam specimens can be obtained in
   different stress states in the von Misesmean stress space. The
   normalized yield surface is approximately independent of relative
   density and can be well fitted to a parabolic or an elliptic function.
   Comparisons between the numerical yield surface and three typical
   theoretical yield criteria suggest that the Deshpande and Fleck's
   criterion provides more precise predictions than Gibson and Miller yield
   criteria when a proper plastic Poisson's ratio is adopted. Furthermore,
   it is shown that the early stage yield surface of metallic foams can be
   evolved in a geometrically self-similar manner.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1795-1808}},

Abstract = {{Research has shown that deep neural networks contain significant
   redundancy, and thus that high classification accuracy can be achieved
   even when weights and activations are quantized down to binary values.
   Network binarization on FPGAs greatly increases area efficiency by
   replacing resource-hungry multipliers with lightweight XNOR gates.
   However, an FPGA's fundamental building block, the K-LUT, is capable of
   implementing far more than an XNOR: it can perform any K-input Boolean
   operation. Inspired by this observation, we propose LUTNet, an
   end-to-end hardware-software framework for the construction of
   area-efficient FPGA-based neural network accelerators using the native
   LUTs as inference operators. We describe the realization of both
   unrolled and tiled LUTNet architectures, with the latter facilitating
   smaller, less power-hungry deployment over the former while sacrificing
   area and energy efficiency along with throughput. For both varieties, we
   demonstrate that the exploitation of LUT flexibility allows for far
   heavier pruning than possible in prior works, resulting in significant
   area savings while achieving comparable accuracy. Against the
   state-of-the-art binarized neural network implementation, we achieve up
   to twice the area efficiency for several standard network models when
   inferencing popular datasets. We also demonstrate that even greater
   energy efficiency improvements are obtainable.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The new coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly resulted in a
   pandemic. We report the characteristics of patients with severe or
   critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   infection in Wuhan city, China, and the risk factors related to
   infection severity and death.
   Methods: We extracted the demographic and clinical data of 7283 patients
   with severe COVID-19 infection from designated Wuhan hospitals as of 25
   February 2020. Factors associated with COVID-19 critical illness and
   mortality were analysed using logistic- and Cox-regression analyses.
   Results: We studied 6269 patients with severe COVID-19 illness and 1014
   critically ill patients. The median (IQR) age was 64 (53-71) years;
   51.2\% were male, 38.9\% were retirees and 7.4\% had self-reported
   histories of chronic disease. Up to the end of the study, 1180 patients
   (16.2\%) recovered and were discharged, 649 (8.9\%) died and the
   remainder were still receiving treatment. The number of daily confirmed
   critical cases peaked between 23 January and 1 February 2020. Patients
   with advanced age {[}odds ratio (OR), 1.03; 95\% confidence intervals
   (Cis), 1.03-1.04], male sex (OR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.33-1.86) and
   pre-existing diabetes (OR, 2.11), hypertension (OR, 2.72),
   cardiovascular disease (OR, 2.15) or respiratory disease (OR, 3.50) were
   more likely to be critically ill. Compared with those who recovered and
   were discharged, patients who died were older {[}hazard ratio (HR),
   1.04; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.05], more likely to be male (HR, 1.74; 95\% CI,
   1.44-2.11) and more likely to have hypertension (HR, 5.58),
   cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.83) or diabetes (HR, 1.67).
   Conclusion: Advanced age, male sex and a history of chronic disease were
   associated with COVID-19 critical illness and death. Identifying these
   risk factors could help in the clinical monitoring of susceptible

Abstract = {{Coal ash melting characteristics has a direct impact on the smooth
   operation of entrained gasifier. Mineral conversion of coal ash is very
   significant to be investigated, because the mineral can affect the
   melting temperature and viscosity under high temperature conditions. In
   this paper, the effects of different Al2O3/CaO on the mineral
   conversion, melting temperature and viscosity of Ningdong coal ash are
   studied by the combination of experiment and simulation. The trend of
   melting temperature decreases firstly and rises with increasing
   Al2O3/CaO. The ash melting point reached to the lowest when the ratio is
   123. XRD and Factsage software are used to analyze crystallization
   behavior of samples. The results show that the content of anorthite,
   albite and corundum increases and subsequently decreases, while the
   content of mullite decreases firstly and then rises with increasing
   Al2O3/CaO. High content with CaO can contribute to form albite and
   anorthite of low-melting. Besides, high content with Al2O3 can tend to
   produce mullite of high-melting. The results of experimental and
   simulation arc basically the same, which lays a foundation for the
   melting characteristics of Ningdong coal ash and can provide technical
   support for the smooth operation of the entrained-gasifier. (C) 2020 The

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Glycerol-assisted one-step instant catapult steam explosion (ICSE) was
   studied for corn stover pretreatment. Glycerol addition reduced lignin
   content from similar to 32 \% to similar to 24 \% in pretreated solid
   residues with a stover/glycerol ratio from 1:0.0 to 1:2.0. Glycerol
   addition might help to reduce the formation of pseudo-lignin with the
   reduction of the total lignin recovered in pretreated solid residue from
   114 \% (possibly because of pseudo-lignin contribution) to 81 \%.
   Furthermore, atomic forced microscopy analysis showed that glycerol
   addition improved surface roughness of pretreated corn stover. Moreover,
   it was proposed that glycerol-assisted ICSE likely led to the reactions
   of glycerol with lignin and lignin-derivatives through
   alpha-etherification and gamma-esterification, preserving lignin
   internal beta-O-4 linkages and preventing lignin condensation. Finally,
   enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover pretreated by glycerol-assisted ICSE
   at a stover/glycerol ratio of 1:1 led to a glucan digestibility in solid
   residues of 98.4 \% and a glucose yield of 79.3 \%, which were 27.9 \%
   and 44.7 \% higher than those without glycerol addition, respectively.}},

Title = {{Investigation of Damage Reduction When Dry-Drilling Aramid
   Fiber-Reinforced Plastics Based on a Three-Point Step Drill}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aramid fiber-reinforced plastic (AFRP) is widely used in bullet-proof
   and armor structures, and is difficult to drill because of the
   high-toughness aramid fibers with ductile fracturing-differently from
   carbon fiber. Therefore, drilling quality cannot be ensured by the
   drilling used for carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, and frequently,
   delamination and burrs occur in the drilling process. This article first
   established a two-dimensional cutting model for analyzing the fiber
   deformation and material interface cracking. According to the model,
   reducing the thrust force and the radial force of the edge on the fibers
   is an effective way to reduce the fiber deformation, and a three-point
   step drill is proposed further. Comparative experiments were carried out
   among twist drilling, candle core drilling and three-point step drilling
   under three drilling parameters. The results show that the three-point
   step drill changed the traditional cutting behavior on the drill-exit
   material into a compound process. Finally, the AFRP was cut effectively
   with the novel drill with a small thrust force, and the delamination and
   ``burrs area{''} were reduced through different drilling parameters. In
   summary, the three-point step drill can drill the AFRP without
   delamination and burrs with 0.02 mm/rev, which provides a new solution
   of cost-effective production for AFRP manufacturers.}},

Title = {{Implementation and Utilization of a ``Pink Card{''} Walk-In Screening
   Mammography Program Integrated With Physician Visits}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation and
   utilization of the Pink Card program, which links a physician-delivered
   reminder that a woman is due for screening mammography (SM) during an
   office visit with the opportunity to undergo walkin screening.
   Methods: In 2016, the authors' community-based breast imaging center
   provided physicians from three primary care and obstetrics and
   gynecology practices located in the same outpatient facility business
   card-sized Pink Cards to offer women due for SM during office visits.
   The card includes a reminder that screening is due and can be used to
   obtain SM on a walk-in basis. The primary outcome measure was the
   proportion of women who used Pink Cards among all screened women over 2
   years. Independent predictors of Pink Card utilization were evaluated
   using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Among 3,688 women who underwent SM, Pink Cards were used by
   19.9\% (733 of 3,688). Compared with women with prescheduled screening
   visits, Pink Card users were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio {[}OR],
   1.37; P = .032), Black (OR, 2.05; P = .002), and Medicaid insured (OR,
   1.71; P = .013) and less likely to use English as their primary language
   (OR, 2.75; P = .003). Additionally, Pink Card users were less likely to
   be up to date for biennial SM compared with women with prescheduled
   visits (31.9\% {[}234 of 733] versus 66.6\% {[}1,968 of 2,955], P <
   .001).
   Conclusions: The Pink Card walk-in SM program can improve screening
   access, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities and Medicaidinsured
   patients. Expansion of this program may help reduce disparities and
   increase engagement in breast cancer screening.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In a two-period game, Player 1 produces zero-day exploits for immediate
   deployment or stockpiles for future deployment. In Period 2, Player 1
   produces zero-day exploits for immediate deployment, supplemented by
   stockpiled zero-day exploits from Period 1. Player 2 defends in both
   periods. The article illuminates how players strike balances between how
   to exert efforts in the two periods, depending on asset valuations,
   asset growth, time discounting, and contest intensities, and when it is
   worthwhile for Player 1 to stockpile. Eighteen parameter values are
   altered to illustrate sensitivity. Player 1 stockpiles when its unit
   effort cost of developing zero-day capabilities is lower in Period 1
   than in Period 2, in which case it may accept negative expected utility
   in Period 1 and when its zero-day appreciation factor of stockpiled
   zero-day exploits from Period 1 to Period 2 increases above one. When
   the contest intensity in Period 2 increases, the players compete more
   fiercely with each other in both periods, but the players only compete
   more fiercely in Period 1 if the contest intensity in Period 1
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene has been widely applied in advanced electronic
   devices due to low dielectric loss and high thermal stability.
   Nevertheless, its low thermal conductivity can't satisfy heat diffusion
   demand under the situation of high-frequency and high-speed signal
   transmission. The PTFE-based composites filled with hybrid fillers of
   Li3Mg2NbO6 ceramic particles and hexagonal boron nitride sheets modified
   by phenyltrimethoxysilane were fabricated. Surface modification enhanced
   the interface compatibility between PTFE and fillers, thus obtaining
   tight microstructure and better dielectric properties for the
   composites. The dielectric properties, thermal conductivity, coefficient
   of thermal expansion and flexure strength of the composites were
   researched systematically. When the composites were filled with 40 vol\%
   BN sheets and 10 vol\% Li3Mg2NbO6 particles, the high through-plane
   thermal conductivity of 3.3 W.m(-1).K-1 was obtained, which was 1220\%
   higher than pure PTFE. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of 3.9,
   extremely low dielectric loss of 3.3 x 10(-4) at 9.5 GHz and low
   coefficient of thermal expansion of 35 ppm/degrees C were also achieved.
   PTFE-based composites with high through-plane thermal conductivity and
   extremely low dielectric loss show huge potential for microwave

Title = {{A novel color calibration method of multi-spectral camera based on
   normalized RGB color model}},
Journal = {{RESULTS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{True-color image of Mars is important for mineral analysis. The working
   light source of the Mars exploration multi-spectral camera is different
   from the laboratory calibration light source, so that the commonly used
   RGB calibration method has a large color difference in correcting the
   on-orbit images. After analyzing the influence of light source lightness
   and relative spectral distribution on the camera output values, their
   influences are considered separately in the calibration. A new color
   calibration method in the luminance-independent chromaticity space is
   proposed. The RGB color components of multi-spectral camera are
   normalized and converted to chromaticity values, and the polynomial
   calibration model in chromaticity space is compared with the RGB method.
   The experimental results showed that the average value of CIE DE2000
   color differences after color calibration was 4.32, which was 0.96 less
   than that of RGB method. When the calibration matrix was used to correct
   the outdoor scene images, the corrected color difference gain because of
   the change of imaging light source was reduced by 0.54 compared to the
   RGB method. The color calibration method and the calibration data in
   this paper provide theoretical support for the color correction of the
   Mars multi-spectral camera on-orbit images.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to the Neumann problem of a stationary
   Lotka-Volterra model with diffusion and advection. In the model it is
   assumed that one population growth rate is described by weak Allee
   effect. We first obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring the
   existence of nonconstant solutions by using the Leray-Schauder degree
   theory. And then we study a limiting system (with nonlocal constraint)
   which stems from the original model as diffusion and advection of one of
   the species tend to infinity. Finally, we classify the global
   bifurcation structure of nonconstant solutions of the simplified 1D
   case. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OM4 Fiber}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effective modal bandwidth (EMB) limit for the multi-mode (MM) VCSEL
   on transmitting data rate over distance in OM4 fiber is commonly
   referenced to be within 4700 MHz{*}km. However, this limit may not be
   valid for the VCSELs with reduced-mode (RM) or single-mode (SM) emission
   spectrum for data transmission. In this work, we investigate the EMB
   limit of OM4 fiber through characterizing three types of 850 nm
   oxide-VCSELs, namely, MM, RM and SM. Each type of VCSEL is tested to the
   highest error-free NRZ data rate over transmitting distance up to 1 km.
   The MM VCSEL demonstrates 50 Gb/s (100 m) and 26 Gb/s (300 m) that are
   within EMB limit. In contrast, the RM and SM VCSELs demonstrate speed
   distance product beyond the OM4 EMB limit. The SM VCSEL delivers record
   speed-distance of 44 Gb/s (500 m), and 36 Gb/s (1 km) at 25 degrees C
   without the use of equalization. These results suggest the SM
   VCSEL-based MMF link can transmit much higher data rate over extended
   distance up to 2 km in data centers.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a novel soluble and antibacterial polymer,
   O-xanthonyl-chitosan (CTMC-Xan), was synthesized successfully by
   grafting 1,3-dihydroxy-xanthone (Xan) to the side chains of
   O-carboxymethyl-N, N, N-trimethyl chitosan (CTMC). The chemical
   structure and physical properties of the polymer were analyzed by H-1
   NMR, FT-IR spectra, UV spectra and XRD. The results showed that Xan
   could covalently bond with the carboxyl groups of CTMC by esterification
   at a grafting ratio of 9.1\%. XRD patterns indicated that CTMC-Xan does
   not exhibit crystallization. The solubility tests showed that CTMC-Xan
   was completely dissolved and stable in neutral solution but unstable in
   acid or basic conditions. Moreover, it was found that the antibacterial
   activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus
   (S. aureus) of CTMC-Xan was much stronger than that of Xan and CTMC, and
   the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 125 mu g.mL(-1). Due to
   the enhanced solubility and antibacterial activity, CTMC-Xan could
   potentially serve as a desirable biomaterial for food and pharmaceutical
   applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Negative thermal expansion driven by acoustic phonon modes in
   rhombohedral Zn2GeO4}},
Journal = {{RESULTS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Negative thermal expansion (NTE) of materials is an intriguing
   phenomenon challenging the concept of traditional lattice dynamics and
   of importance for a variety of applications. Herein, we investigate the
   mechanism of NTE in the phenacite structure Zn2GeO4 using
   first-principles calculations with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA).
   It is shown that in contrast to the NTE driven by the low energy
   optical-phonon modes in most open-framework oxides, the NTE in Zn2GeO4
   is dominated by the lowest-frequency acoustic phonon modes which possess
   large negative Gruneisen parameters. Due to the three coordination
   nature of oxygen in the phenacite structure, the lateral vibration of
   oxygen is largely inhibited. The Raman and infrared spectra are measured
   to provide further proof for the rationality of the theoretical
   calculation. It is predicted and experimentally demonstrated that
   elemental doping has a negligible effect on the thermal expansion
   property in the structure because it is dictated by the long wavelength
   acoustic phonons which should be insensitive to local defects. This work
   provides an understanding on the NTE in the phenacite structure and may
   prompt the search for new NTE materials with similar structures.}},

Abstract = {{Premix membrane emulsification is a quick and efficient method to
   prepare emulsion. Pre-emulsion was prepared by dissolving
   2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) and
   cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) in ethyl acetate, and the mixture was
   added to an aqueous solution containing a surfactant. Then, the droplet
   uniform emulsion through the transmembrane was formed. The composites
   with the core-shell structure were obtained after evaporating the
   solvent. The results displayed that the morphological structure of CL-20
   based composite could change from the dumbbell-shaped structure to
   spherical structure with an increase in the CAB content. Based on the
   impact sensitivity and thermal properties, the composite enhanced the
   safety. Meanwhile, a remarkable enhancement in the decomposition peak
   temperature (T-p0) and the critical temperature of the explosion (T-b)
   at a relatively low content of CAB (3 wt.\%, 5 wt.\% and 10 wt.\%) was
   also noted. This approach provides a faster way for the design and
   preparation of polymer composites.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   To investigate if toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/nuclear factor-kappa B
   (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways mediated crush injury induced acute
   kidney injury (AKI) in rats, and if TAK-242 (a specific inhibitor of
   TLR4) attenuates the injury through inhibiting the signaling pathways.
   Methods:
   This study was divided into two parts: (1) Establish the crush injury
   model: 50 rats were randomly divided into control group and four crush
   injury groups (n = 10/group). Crush injury groups were given 3kg
   pressure for eight hours and were sacrificed at the time points of 0h,
   6h, 12h, and 24h after relieving pressure. And (2) Select the most
   obvious injury group (12h group) for drug intervention group. Thirty
   rats were randomly divided into control group, 12h group, and
   12h+TAK-242 group (n = 10/group). Two parts detection were as follows:
   pathological changes of kidney tissues were observed in Haematoxylin and
   Eosin (HE) staining. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
   myoglobin (Mb), and blood potassium were examined by automatic
   biochemical analysis instrument. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA). The TLR4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), TLR4, and P65
   were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western
   blot, immunohistochemistry staining.
   Results:
   Compared with the control group, kidney tissues were damaged in crush
   injury groups, and most obvious in the 12h group. The level of serum
   creatinine, BUN, Mb, blood potassium, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TLR4mRNA were
   increased in the crush injury groups and significantly increased in the
   12h group (P <.05). The TLR4 and P65 were significantly increased in the
   12h group (P <.05). Compared with the 12h group, kidney tissue damage
   was significantly reduced in the TAK-242 group (P <.05). The level of
   serum creatinine, BUN, Mb, blood potassium, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TLR4mRNA,
   TLR4, and P65 in the TAK-242 group were significantly reduced (P <.05).
   Conclusion:
   The present findings conclude that TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathways
   mediated crush injury induced AKI in rats, and TAK-242 attenuates the
   injury through inhibiting the signaling pathways.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and facile one-pot method, named high-temperature high-energy
   mechanical force (HTHEMF), was successfully used to synthesize the
   Fe2P/LiFePO4/C composites. In this method, the combination of the
   high-energy mechanical force with the high-temperature not only
   simplified the synthesis process, but also reduced the temperature and
   time of the calcinations process. The temperature and time were 600
   degrees C and 10 h, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electrochemical performance tests were
   employed to analyze the properties of the samples. The results suggested
   that Fe2P phase has a favorable effect on improving the electrochemical
   performance of the LiFePO4 material, such as high-rate capacity, low
   polarization phenomena and stable cycling performance. The composites
   delivered higher discharge capacities at different discharge rates, and
   it provided the first discharge capacities of 155 mA h g(-1) about 7.6\%
   more than which of the LiFePO4/C composites at 0.1 C. It indicated that
   the one-pot HTHEMF method is promising approaches to obtain the
   Fe2P/LiFePO4/C composites with good properties.}},

Abstract = {{Local fractional calculus has gained wide attention in the field of
   circuit design. In this paper, we propose the zero-input response(ZIR)
   of fractal RC circuit modeled by local fractional derivative(LFD) for
   the first time. With help of the law of switch and the Kirchhoff Voltage
   Laws, the transient local fractional ordinary differential equation is
   established, and the corresponding exact solution behavior defined on
   Cantor sets is presented. What we found especially interesting was that
   the fractal RC becomes the ordinary one in the particular case kappa =
   1. The results obtained in this paper reveal that the local fractional
   calculus is a powerful tool to analyze the fractal circuit systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Damage to cell membranes, the outermost protection layer, is fatal to
   cells. However, precisely monitoring and in situ reporting cell membrane
   damage is not trivial. Herein, we present a molecular rotor probe,
   TPAE2, which can effectively bind to DNA and
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in solution. Due to the
   light-up imaging characteristics of the molecular rotor, TPAE2 offers
   ultrafast and wash-free staining of plasma membrane with 160-fold
   fluorescence ``turn-on{''} and excellent photostability. Once the
   membrane is damaged, TPAE2 can light-up the nucleus as a signal
   reporter. The cascade imaging of the cell membrane and nucleus using
   TPAE2 enabled real-time tracking of the whole process of cell apoptosis.
   What's more, under irradiation, TPAE2 stained on the cell membrane could
   penetrate cells rapidly and selectively stain the nucleus,
   self-reporting the cancer cell ablation process. This is the first
   example that a single molecule with multiple functions can light up the
   nucleus as an indication of cell membrane damage. The
   membrane-to-nucleus translocation strategy opens up a new avenue for the
   design of membrane damage diagnosis probes for biomedical applications.}},

   from high-iron red mud}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-iron red mud presents a problem due to its alkalinity which leads
   to significant risks to the environment. In order to realize the
   harmless and large-scale utilization of high-iron red mud, the smelting
   reduction experiments were carried out to investigate the reaction
   mechanism for extraction iron from high-iron red mud. FactSage 6.4
   software was used to conduct thermodynamic analysis of the carbon
   thermal reduction system. The results showed that the direct reduction
   with carbon involved a process of Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 -> FeO -> Fe, in which
   the theoretical required molar ratio of C/O (oxygen in Fe2O3) was 1:1.
   The maximum degree of iron extraction was 92.8\% with anthracite as
   reductant and 88.8\% without anthracite smelting at 1500 degrees C for
   30 min in a graphite crucible. XRD was conducted to analyze the mineral
   phase of the samples and slags. The results showed that the minerals
   contained in high-iron red mud were hematite, quartz, rutile, and sodium
   aluminosilicate hydrate. The blank sample was consisted of hematite,
   nepheline quartz, and the reduced slag without quenching consisted of
   perovskite and gehlenite, indicating that the reaction processes
   occurred from sodium aluminosilicate hydrate to nepheline and then
   occurred from nepheline to gehlenite in slagging process. The overall
   smelting reduction process was described as three mass transfer steps
   and three chemical reaction steps. These results provide useful
   information for large-scale and harmless utilization of high-iron red
   mud.}},

Abstract = {{Urban heat islands (UHIs) are caused by a multitude of changes induced
   by urbanization. However, the relative importance of biophysical and
   atmospheric factors in controlling the UHI intensity remains elusive. In
   this study, we quantify the magnitude of surface UHIs (SUHIs), or
   surface urban cool islands (SUCIs), and elucidate their biophysical and
   atmospheric drivers on the basis of observational data collected from
   one urban site and two rural grassland sites in and near the city of
   Nanjing, China. Results show that during the daytime a strong SUCI
   effect is observed when the short grassland site is used as the
   reference site whereas a moderate SUHI effect is observed when the tall
   grassland is used as the reference site. We find that the former is
   mostly caused by the lower aerodynamic resistance for convective heat
   transfer at the urban site and the latter is primarily caused by the
   higher surface resistance for evapotranspiration at the urban site. At
   night, SUHIs are observed when either the short or the tall grassland
   site is used as the reference site and are predominantly caused by the
   stronger release of heat storage at the urban site. In general, the
   magnitude of SUHI is much weaker, and even becomes SUCI during daytime,
   with the short grassland site being the reference site because of its
   larger aerodynamic resistance. The study highlights that the magnitude
   of SUHIs and SUCIs is mostly controlled by urban-rural differences of
   biophysical factors, with urban-rural differences of atmospheric
   conditions playing a minor role.}},

   control of phase is realized by appropriately arranging rectangular
   apertures in a gold film. By carving a periodic array of grooves on one
   side of the rectangle apertures, Bragg reflection increases the
   intensity of SPPs propagated to the other side, enabling directional and
   efficient excitation.}},

Abstract = {{The Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode material with excellent

   depress Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing degree and extend c axis of the cathode
   material structure. Simultaneously, the formed spinel phase could
   improve cycling stability and provide 3D Li+ diffusion channels. The
   modified materials showed the increased discharge capacity, improved
   capacity retention and the suppressed electrochemical impedance. And the
   interface stability between the cathode material and electrolyte was
   greatly improved. The improvement can be assigned to the more ordered
   crystal structure and the moderate spinel structure.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{697-702}},

Abstract = {{The structure-property relationship of diarylethene (DAE)-derivative
   molecular isomers, which involve ring-closed and ring-open forms, is
   investigated by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism
   combined with density functional theory. Molecular junctions are formed
   by the isomers connecting to Au(111) electrodes through flanked pyridine
   groups. The difference in electronic structures caused by different
   geometry structures for the two isomers, particularly the interatomic
   alternative single bond and double bond of the ring-closed molecule,
   contributes to the vastly different low-bias conductance values. The
   lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the isomers is the main
   channel for electron transport. In addition, more electrons transferred
   to the ring-closed molecular junction in the equilibrium condition,
   thereby decreasing the LUMO energy to near the Fermi energy, which may
   contribute to a larger conductance value at the Fermi level. Our
   findings are helpful for understanding the mechanism of low-bias
   conductance and are conducive to the design of high-performance
   molecular switching based on diarylethene or diarylethene-derivative
   molecules.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel method for loading phosphorus nanoparticles

   The combination of phosphorus and carbon in the form of C-O-P has better
   stability. The product obtained a stable capacity of 463 mAh/g at 0.04
   A/g. There was still a reversible capacity of 270 mAh/g after continuous
   operation for 6 months at a high current density of 1 A/g, and the
   capacity retention rate was 96.7\%. The excellent cyclic stability is
   due to new methods of phosphorus deposition. It can reach 10 times the
   running time of the same type of battery, which provides a new idea for
   preparing phosphor-doped electrode materials. Assembled into a potassium

Title = {{The Balance Strategy between Structural Safety and Sensing Accuracy
   Inspired by Slit-Based Mechanical Sensilla}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In engineering, cracks are typically regarded as defects due to enormous
   stress amplification at tip of the crack. Conversely, scorpion
   ingeniously utilizes the ``risky{''} near-tip stress field of a
   crack-shaped slit to accurately detect weak vibration signal without
   causing catastrophic crack propagation from the slit tip. The present
   paper focuses on the balance strategy between structural safety and
   sensing accuracy of slit-based mechanical sensilla. We performed a
   detailed structural and mechanical property study of tissue around the
   slit wake utilizing a complementary combination of various experimental
   methods. The results indicate that there is a special thin surface
   membrane covering the slit wake and the elastic moduli of the membrane
   and exoskeleton are 0.562 GPa and 5.829 GPa, respectively. In addition,
   the ratio of bending stiffness between exoskeleton and membrane tissue
   is about 8 x 10(4). The theoretical and simulation analysis show that
   the surface membrane-with appropriate elastic modulus and bending
   stiffness-can achieve different forms of deformation with the change of
   slit width for protecting the mechanosensory structure without
   sacrificing the sensing accuracy. This finding offers a crucial
   theoretical basis for the further design of bionic mechanical sensors
   based on the near-tip stress field of artificial cracks.}},

Title = {{From Female Daoist Rationality to Kundao Practice Daoism beyond Weber's

Abstract = {{By presenting Cao Wenyi (1039-1119), a female Daoist in the Song
   dynasty, and Kundao Academy , a training center for female Daoists in
   contemporary China, this essay challenges Max Weber's description of
   Daoism. This analysis criticizes two aspects of Weber's basic position
   on Daoism, namely, his claims that it is irrational and egoistical. The
   essay argues that Weber's account of ``magical and irrational{''}
   features in Daoism is due to a deep-seated philosophical framework that
   fails to appreciate Daoism's relational rationality, which takes one
   part in relation to many other parts, as shown in Cao's work. Weber's
   inadequate treatment of Daoism leads him not only to ignore or dismiss
   the roles of female Daoists in Chinese society but also to describe
   Daoism as egoistical and lacking in social functions. The investigation
   of Kundao Academy reveals a living reality in which female Daoists have
   a deep and immediate commitment and goal to serve the community. The
   study of past and present female Daoist voices invites us to rethink the
   very notions of man/male/masculinity and woman/female/femininity and
   offers a path for investigating relationships between the hegemonic
   power of social structures and female subjective agency through the
   interface of classical texts and contemporary contexts.}},

   that metabolized xylose. Strain FrootZen increased the caffeine content
   significantly and strain Prelude showed the opposite trend, both at a

   relatively stable. Biodiva and FrootZen significantly improved
   polyphenols content and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity of
   fermented teas. Some endogenous volatiles such as ketones, lactones and
   aldehydes decreased to lower or undetected levels, but one of the key
   tea aroma compounds methyl salicylate increased by 34-fold and 100-fold

Abstract = {{A design for a truss mechanism of a secondary mirror based on robotics
   is proposed. This design would allow for the construction of larger
   vehicle-mobile telescopes. As the new truss mechanism combines the
   original support structure and adjustment mechanism, the problems in
   designing new structures needs to be overcome. In this paper, the basic
   form of the truss mechanism is determined by finite element method, and
   the number of limbs meeting the requirements of resonance frequencies
   and stiffness is obtained. Degrees-of-freedom of the new truss mechanism
   is calculated by motion space based on geometry algebra and screw
   theory, It can provide more accurate and specific results compared with
   the G-K formula. The optimal structure is calculated to meet the
   requirement in degrees-of-freedom with the minimum possible limbs and
   kinematic pairs. After the form and the value of joints are determined,
   the deformations are calculated by stiffness evaluation index. Wavefront
   aberrations simulated with Zernike polynomials are used to verify the
   structure.}},

Title = {{Design and implementation of a linear array laser emitting optical
   system based on diffractive principles}},
Journal = {{OPTIK}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{224}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the design and implementation of a linear array
   laser emitting optical system based on diffractive optical elements. The
   system offered relatively good energy efficiency and beam uniformity, as
   well as a simpler structure than conventional line laser illumination
   systems. Based on the diffractive model, a hybrid local-global search
   algorithm was proposed to solve for the structural parameters of the
   diffractive element. This method is simple to describe and flexible upon
   implementation. It also offers high efficiency. Using this method, a
   diffractive optical element was designed to generate 13 1.06 mu m laser
   beams. The theoretical diffractive efficiency approached 80 \% and the
   inter-beam non-uniformity was less than 20 \%. The diffractive element
   was fabricated via photolithography and a corresponding optical system
   was built to verify its performance. Experimental measurements showed
   that the total diffractive efficiency of the 13 beams was 70.83 \% and
   their non-uniformity was 11.96 \%. These results approach those
   calculated theoretically, and thus verify the correctness and
   effectiveness of the system.}},

   properties in single-stage partial nitritation-anammox system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The stability of single partial nitritation and anammox (SPNA) granular
   system at different nitrogen loads was evaluated in two laboratory-scale
   continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) reactors (R1with lower influent
   ammonium concentration, R2 with higher concentration). The effects of
   different transient substrate shock (50 mg N/L and 100 mg N/L) on the
   bacteria population structure, nitrogen removal and granular sludge
   properties of the system were studied. Results showed that R1 had a
   better resilience, and the average removal efficiencies of TN and
   ammonium can recover to 66.5 \% and 73.9 \% after two shocks, while
   nitrogen performance of R2 deteriorated. The inhibition of free nitrous
   acid (FNA) to functional bacteria was the key factor influencing reactor
   performance. When FNA concentration exceeded 2 mu g/L, FNA/MLVSS > 1.5
   mu g/g VSS, the inhibition was irreversible. Moreover, excessive
   substrate shock changed extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   production and composition, which led to granules disintegration. The
   formation and disintegration mechanism of SPNA micro-granules were also
   investigated.}},

Title = {{Advanced triboelectric nanogenerator with multi-mode energy harvesting
   and anti-impact properties for smart glove and wearable e-textile}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Environmental hazardous stimuli including strong electromagnetic field
   and impact force were always harmful to human beings. Developing
   functional triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with universally
   harvesting various energy and anti-impact effect may be an effective
   strategy to collect energy as well as protect human beings from danger.
   Thus, a miniaturized all-in-one TENG with high structural durability,
   anti-impact and multi-mode harvesting energy from compression, swaying
   and magnetic field was developed by assembling shear thickening fluid
   (STF) and magneto-sensitive films. TENG yielded maximum power density of
   27.05 mW/m(2) with the voltage of 10.40 V at 10 M Omega under
   compression. It also sensed and collected tiny STF flowing energy under
   non contact mode. Besides, high magnetic-sensitive effect endowed TENG
   with magnetic dependent programmable shapes which enabled it to harvest
   non-contact rubbing/deformation energy. More importantly, the device
   with STF exhibited high anti-impact properties which could resist and
   dissipate harsh collision force from 1390 N to 409 N, demonstrating
   excellent safeguarding properties for TENG and human wearers. This
   versatile device also showed reliable sensing properties to various
   external magnetic field, human motions, contacted materials and impact
   forces. In addition, a wearable TENG-based smart glove as a self-powered
   functional sensor presented the ability of precisely mapping finger
   joints. Finally, newly-designed Kevlar/TENG-based e-textile arrays with
   95\% impact-force dissipating and multi-fields display performance was
   proposed. Thus, this work opened a new perspective for the development
   of functional TENGs as wearable electronic devices in universally energy
   scavenging and safeguarding areas.}},

Abstract = {{Background Myocardial bridging (MB) is commonly treated in patients with
   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, whether and how MB should be
   treated in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)
   who underwent septal myectomy remain unclear.
   Methods A total of 823 adults with HOCM who underwent septal myectomy at
   the Fuwai Hospital from 2011 to 2017 were retrospectively studied.
   Results Overall, 31 events occurred: 24 patients died and 7 had nonfatal
   myocardial infarction (MI). The 3-year cumulative event-free survival of
   all-cause death (97.9\% vs. 100\% vs. 100\% vs. 98.4\%, p = .89) and
   cardiovascular death (98.3\% vs. 100\% vs. 100\% vs. 98.4\%, p = .63)
   were similar among the four groups (non-MB, coronary artery bypass
   grafting {[}CABG], unroofing, untreated, respectively). However, the
   3-year cumulative event-free survival of nonfatal MI (100\% vs. 97.5\%
   vs. 98.0\% vs. 89.9\%, p < .001) and combined endpoints (97.9\% vs.
   97.5\% vs. 98.0\% vs. 88.4\%, p = .02) were significantly lowest in
   untreated MB (non-MB, CABG, unroofing, untreated, respectively). Cox
   regression analysis indicated that untreated MB was a significant
   independent predictor of combined endpoints (hazard ratio: 4.06, 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.60-10.32, p < .001). Moreover, 49 patients
   underwent coronary artery computed tomography 1 year after surgery. The
   patency rate of the saphenous vein graft was significantly higher than
   that of the left internal mammary artery (13.3\% vs. 84.2\%, p < .001).
   No MB was detected in the unroofing group.
   Conclusions Surgical MB treatment could be beneficial and performed
   safely during septal myectomy. Myocardial unroofing is the recommended
   treatment for MB, and unroofing when technically possible may be
   preferable for long-term outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of the global economy, the automatic recognition
   of financial bills becomes the primary way to reduce the burden of the
   traditional manual approach for bill recognition and classification.
   However, most automatic recognition methods cannot effectively recognize
   the handwritten characters on financial bills, especially when the bills
   come from different financial companies. To solve the problem, this
   paper fully explores the bill system in banks and the operations of bill
   number recognition, and then develops a hybrid classifier based on deep
   convolutional neural network (DCNN) and support vector machine (SVM),
   with the aim to recognize the handwritten numbers on financial bills in
   different domains. The DCNN with different channels was adopted to
   effectively mine the local handwritten numbers on financial bills from
   varied sources. Then, the extracted information was fed to the SVM to
   realize accurate classification of numbers. Our method makes full use of
   the distribution difference between information in different fields, and
   adapts to different fields based on the parameter sharing mechanism.
   Experimental results show that our method can recognize the handwritten
   numbers on financial bills more accurately (>3\%) than benchmark
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the terrain classifications of polarimetric synthetic
   aperture radar (PolSAR) images are studied. A novel semi-supervised
   method based on improved Tri-training combined with a neighborhood
   minimum spanning tree (NMST) is proposed. Several strategies are
   included in the method: 1) a high-dimensional vector of polarimetric
   features that are obtained from the coherency matrix and diverse target
   decompositions is constructed; 2) this vector is divided into three
   subvectors and each subvector consists of one-third of the polarimetric
   features, randomly selected. The three subvectors are used to separately
   train the three different base classifiers in the Tri-training algorithm
   to increase the diversity of classification; and 3) a help-training
   sample selection with the improved NMST that uses both the coherency
   matrix and the spatial information is adopted to select highly reliable
   unlabeled samples to increase the training sets. Thus, the proposed
   method can effectively take advantage of unlabeled samples to improve
   the classification. Experimental results show that with a small number
   of labeled samples, the proposed method achieves a much better
   performance than existing classification methods.}},

Abstract = {{Wutaishan (WTS) Station on Wutai Mountain (2208 m a.s.l.), which is also
   known as the ``North China Roof,{''} in Shanxi Province, is surrounded
   by lush forest vegetation and situated far (30 km) from industrial
   emission sources. This study filtered online observation data of the
   atmospheric CO2 (G2301; Picarro) at WTS Station from March 2017 till
   February 2018 using both robust extraction of the baseline signal
   (REBS), and meteorological data (MET) in order to obtain the average
   background concentration, which is representative of the region (Shanxi
   Province and the surrounding areas). The background concentration of CO2
   averaged (410.9 +/- 6.4) x 10(-6) (mole ratio, the same below), and the
   daily variation ranged from 2.4 x 10(-6) to 4.8 x 10(-6), which is
   relatively low, across the four seasons. The concentration and the
   surface wind speed displayed negative correlations during spring and
   winter, with R being -0.44 and -0.46, respectively. Analyzing the
   backward trajectories, we concluded that wind from the SE-S-SW sector
   noticeably increased the local CO2 concentration by transporting from
   high altitudes (i.e., high air masses) or along the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, machine learning is gradually becoming an
   essential approach for the investigation of heterogeneous catalysis. As
   one of the important catalysts, binary alloys have attracted extensive
   attention for the screening of bifunctional catalysts. Here we present a
   holistic framework for machine learning approach to rapidly predict
   adsorption energies on the surfaces of metals and binary alloys. We
   evaluate different machine-learning methods to understand their
   applicability to the problem and combine a tree-ensemble method with a
   compressed-sensing method to construct decision trees for about 60000
   adsorption data. Compared to linear scaling relations, our approach
   enables to make more accurate predictions lowering predictive
   root-mean-square error by a factor of two and more general to predict
   adsorption energies of various adsorbates on thousands of binary alloys
   surfaces, thus paving the way for the discovery of novel bimetallic

Abstract = {{Background Bleeding is a common and frequently devastating complication
   in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is critical to evaluate in the
   current era of ACS management involving invasive strategies and potent
   anti-thrombotics. Risk models remain under-utilised in this setting but
   may guide the choice and duration of therapy. We compared their
   performances for predicting bleeding in ACS patients in this
   meta-analysis.
   Methods Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane and Scopus were searched for relevant
   articles from 1980 to 31 December 2017 assessing external validation of
   risk scores for bleeding after ACS. Two (2) authors independently
   reviewed the searched studies for eligibility, followed by pooled
   analyses using random effects models.
   Results Amongst 1,843 articles searched, 73 full-texts were reviewed and
   17 studies totalling 18,155 patients were included for analysis.
   C-statistics (95\% confidence interval) for predicting in-hospital major
   bleeding by risk model were Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable
   angina patients Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early implementation of
   the ACC/AHA guidelines (CRUSADE) 0.714 (0.659-0.779), Acute
   Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage strategY (ACUITY) 0.711
   (0.626-0.797), Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes
   Network (ACTION) 0.767 (0.737-0.797), Global Registry of Acute Coronary
   Events (GRACE) 0.689 (0.473-0.905) and HAS-BLED 0.636 (0.460-0.812).
   CRUSADE also predicted bleeding during medium-term follow-up c=0.704
   (0.644-0.765). It performed better for radial versus femoral access
   (c=0.826 and 0.734), invasive versus non-invasive strategy (c=0.752 and
   0.625) and similarly for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and
   non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (c=0.791 and 0.760).
   Heterogeneities of studies and paucity of studies assessing risk scores
   beyond CRUSADE were important limitations.
   Conclusions Acute coronary syndrome-specific bleeding scores had
   moderate discrimination for bleeding, while the GRACE and HAS-BLED
   scores could not. The ACTION score had the highest pooled c-statistic,
   while the CRUSADE score was the most widely studied, and also performed
   better for invasive strategy and radial access subgroups.}},

   the start of the first year and then harvested twice a year for 2, 5,8,
   10 and 20 years (wheat field, CK) in the semiarid Loess Plateau. In
   general, soil water storage tended to drop from the second to eighth
   year and then tended to increase in the tenth and twentieth years,
   displaying a V-shaped curve. Compared with CK, soil organic carbon (SOC)
   under alfalfa was significantly improved at the second year. It started
   to decrease to the lowest level at the eighth year, and then recovered
   to increasing at the tenth and twentieth years. Interestingly, soil C/N
   ratio, microbial biomass carbon, easily oxidizable organic carbon, and
   high fraction organic carbon followed a similar trend as SOC did,
   falling to lows in the eighth year, that is, 8.28 and 18.1 mg kg(-1) and
   1.91 and 10.2 g kg(,)(-1) respectively. Notably, light fraction organic
   carbon and particulate organic carbon increased up to their highest
   values in the eighth year (1.78 and 2.81 g kg(-1)). Moreover, soil
   NH4+-N, NO3--N, and microbial biomass nitrogen fell, following a similar
   dynamic as SOC. It can be argued that soil C and N sequestration be were
   weakened in successive planting years due to enhanced mineralization
   rates of C and N pools. The possible mechanism causing such phenomenon
   is also discussed. Multi-year planting of alfalfa reduced the soil C and
   N stocks; therefore, alfalfa fields should be replanted in successive
   years only for an optimum number of years of planting.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of YH2 on densification, microstructure, and thermal
   conductivity of Si3N4 ceramics were investigated by adjusting the amount
   of YH2 in the range of 0-4 wt\% using a two-step sintering method.
   Native SiO2 was eliminated, and Y2O3 was in situ formed by a metal
   hydride reduction reaction, resulting in various Y2O3/SiO2 ratios. Full
   densification of YH2-doped samples could be achieved after sintering at
   1900 degrees C for 4 h. The Y2O3/SiO2 ratio had a significant influence
   on the composition of crystalline secondary phases. Besides, the
   increased Y2O3/SiO2 ratio is conducive not only to the grain growth but
   also to the reduction of activity of SiO2 in the liquid phase, resulting
   in enlarged purified grains, reduced volume fraction of intergranular
   phases and increased Si3N4 -Si3N4 contiguity. Ultimately, the thermal
   conductivity increased by 29 \% from 95.3 to 123.0 W m(-1 )K(-1) after
   sintering at 1900 degrees C for 12 h by the substitution of Y2O3 with

Abstract = {{A new optimization method of ghost imaging by combining multiple speckle
   patterns was proposed. Firstly, the multiple speckle patterns irradiated
   on the target object are sorted to reduce the difference between
   adjacent speckle patterns in the order of smallest to largest in the
   value of the bucket detector. Secondly, the adjacent speckle patterns
   are combined to create a new speckle pattern, and the corresponding
   values of the bucket detector are modulated to a new bucket detector
   value. This process enables effectively reduce the redundancy and number
   of data to be associated. Finally,using three different correlation
   calculation rules to reconstruct of the target object. Numerical
   simulation results show that for the grayscale image, the proposed
   method with 4 000 measurements has a higher peak value than traditional
   ghost imaging, differential ghost imaging, and positive-negative ghost
   imaging under uncombined and modulated case. The peak signal-to-noise
   ratio/contrast has been improved by 21.7\%/27.3\%, 8.3\%/17.8\% and
   14.7\%/25.7\%, respectively. Through the numerical simulation and result
   analysis of 20 target images, it is found that 90\%/85\% and 50\%/55\%
   of peak signal-to-noise ratio/contrast enhancement rates are above 15\%
   and 30\% respectively, and it shows that the proposed method has good
   universality and popularization value.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose is to investigate the crystal structure and magnetic
   properties of MgFe2O4 ferrites with divalent Co2+ cations substitute in
   CoxMg1-xFe2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0) successfully synthesized
   using standard ceramic technology. The crystal structure, valence state
   distribution, functional groups, ion occupancy rate and magnetic
   properties were systematically investigated, revealing that the changes
   in magnetic properties are closely related to the microstructure. All
   samples were characterized by XRD as a pure spinel structure with space
   group Fd-3m. The intrinsic coercivity (H-c), saturation magnetization
   (M-s) and core loss (P-cv) performance of Co2+ ions doped MgFe2O4
   ferrites were significantly optimized under the appropriate doping
   level. H-c and M-s continuously strengthen in the range of 0 <= x <= 1
   at 300 K, where the maximum saturation magnetization (M-s) reaches 102.0
   emu/g and the maximum intrinsic coercive force reaches 253.9 Oe.
   Besides, compared with x = 1, the sample obtained the lowest core loss
   and comparatively high magnetic susceptibility at x = 0.8.
   Simultaneously, the saturation magnetization and coercivity at 300 K are
   76.5 emu/g and 184.7 Oe, respectively. Comprehensive experimental
   results show that the sample possesses a wider range of application when
   the doping amount x = 0.8.}},

Abstract = {{Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains the most challenging breast
   cancer subtype to treat because there are no targeted therapies.
   Currently, chemotherapy is the only clinical option for TNBC despite
   development of resistance. New therapeutic agents with unique mechanisms
   of action are urgently needed; therefore, this study investigated the
   potential anti-TNBC effects of budlein A methylacrylate (BAM), a natural
   sesquiterpene lactone isolated from plants of the Helianthus genus. We
   discovered that BAM selectively suppressed and induced apoptosis TNBC
   cell growth versus other breast cancer or normal mammary epithelial
   cells. Mechanistically, BAM co-inhibited inhibitor of nuclear factor
   kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) kinase subunit beta (IKK beta) and
   exportin-1 (XPO-1; chromosome region maintenance 1, CRM1), which are two
   dysregulated onco-related proteins in TNBC cells, by covalently
   modifying key functional cysteine residues (Cys(179) of IKK beta,
   Cys(528) of XPO-1). Dual inhibition led to the stabilization and nuclear
   retention of I kappa B alpha, impairment of NF-kappa B transcriptional
   activity, and consequent induction of TNBC cell apoptosis. In
   conclusion, this study provides evidence that co-inhibition of IKK beta
   and XPO1 by BAM was effective against TNBC, demonstrating it as a
   representative new generation inhibitor with potential for TNBC
   treatment.}},

Title = {{Optimal operation and subsidies/penalties strategies of a multi-period
   hybrid system with uncertain return under cap-and-trade policy}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As environmental regulations become more stringent worldwide,
   remanufacturing is attracting growing attention because of its economic
   and environmental opportunities and many issues related to operational
   management have been extensively studied in recent years. Most of the
   existing literature considered largely consistent carbon regulations
   over the entire planning horizon and assumed that all of the returns are
   remanufacturable. In practice, carbon regulations may vary at the
   different stages and whether cores can be remanufactured depends on the
   quality. In this paper, based on the dual mechanisms of cap-and-trade
   and subsidies/penalties, we investigate an acquisition and
   manufacturing/remanufacturing problem with stochastic return of cores
   and random yield rate, while taking into consideration the
   distinguishing carbon trading prices over manufacturing and
   remanufacturing periods as well as product shortages. First, we consider
   four frequently used probability distribution functions of the core
   quality level in a multi-period hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing
   system to confirm the broader adaptability of the model to a general
   continuous quality distribution. Second, we propose a general carbon
   emissions cost function to show the effect of the quality variability on
   carbon emissions during remanufacturing. Third, the core quality level
   suitable for corporate recycling and the reasonable quotas of
   subsidies/penalties for different quality levels are determined
   simultaneously based on the model. Finally, numerical experiments are
   carried out using the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm to illustrate the validity and application
   of the model and then analyze the sensitivity of the relevant
   parameters. For all tested instances, important findings obtained
   include: (1) The increase in the carbon price of manufactured items is
   more advantageous than the decrease in the carbon price of
   remanufactured products in reducing carbon emissions and increasing
   total profits. (2) For quality level of cores, subsidies in the range of
   0.2-0.4 and penalties in the range of 0.4-0.56 can simultaneously
   improve the recovery rate and promote remanufacturing in our
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{As a typical application of indirect-time-of-flight (ToF) technology,
   photonic mixer device (PMD) solid-state array Lidar has gained rapid
   development in recent years. With the advantages of high resolution,
   frame rate and accuracy, the equipment is widely used in target
   recognition, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), industrial
   inspection, etc. The PMD Lidar is vulnerable to several factors such as
   ambient light, temperature and the target feature. To eliminate the
   impact of such factors, a proper calibration is needed. However, the
   conventional calibration methods need to change several distances in
   large areas, which result in low efficiency and low accuracy. To address
   the problems, this paper presents an improved calibration method based
   on electrical analog delay. The method firstly eliminates the lens
   distortion using a self-adaptive interpolation algorithm, meanwhile it
   calibrates the grayscale image using an integral time simulating based
   method. Then, the grayscale image is used to estimate the parameters of
   ambient light compensation in depth calibration. Finally, by combining
   four types of compensation, the method effectively improves the
   performance of depth calibration. Through several experiments, the
   proposed method is more adaptive to multiscenes with targets of
   different reflectivities, which significantly improves the ranging
   accuracy and adaptability of PMD Lidar.}},

Abstract = {{Background The correlation between cardiovascular risk scoring systems
   and the severity of coronary artery diseases (CAD) is not clear. The
   present research aimed to evaluate the Multi-Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis (MESA) risk score and Framingham risk score (FRS), using
   the Gensini score (GS) system as reference, so as to determine which
   model is better for the prediction of CAD severity. Methods This
   research was a single-center and cross-sectional observational study. In
   total, 1423 patients were included in our study. Three different groups
   were formed according to GS: 0 < GS <= 22 (low GS group, n = 484); 22 <
   GS <= 42 (intermediate GS group, n = 468); GS > 42 (high GS group, n =
   471). Logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out to
   explore the relationship between the risk score models and the GS. The
   performance of the risk models was determined by receiver operating
   characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results The MESA risk score and the
   FRS both had a statistically significant power for the prediction of CAD
   severity (MESA area under curve: 0.630; FRS area under curve: 0.613).
   Furthermore, the MESA had a better performance in predicting the
   severity (p < 0.05) of CAD compared with the FRS. In the subgroup
   analysis, the MESA showed a better performance in the male (p < 0.05),
   diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05), and smoking subgroups (p < 0.05) compared
   with the FRS. Conclusion The MESA and FRS predicted the severity of CAD
   in the Chinese population of this study. Moreover, the MESA had a better
   performance than the FRS model in predicting the severity of CAD in the
   overall population as well as in the male, smoking, diabetes, and
   non-diabetes subgroups.}},

   Condition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes a general framework for topology-finding or topology
   optimization of tensegrity structures. The existing topology-finding
   formulation of tensegrity structures based on mixed-integer linear
   programming (MILP) was improved and transformed into a formulation based
   on mixed-integer semidefinite programming (MISDP) which considers the
   global stability condition of tensegrity. We illustrated and analyzed
   two undesirable phenomena, loss of prestress stability and loss of
   integrity, caused by the missing global stability condition in previous
   MILP-based approaches. A branch-and-bound algorithm combined with a
   primal-dual interior-point algorithm is employed to solve the proposed
   MISDP model. Some numerical examples illustrated the improvements and
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed approach
   successfully can avoid the two undesirable phenomena and ensure the
   global stability of the found tensegrity structures. By using different
   stability conditions in the topology-finding process, the proposed
   approach can find general stable tensegrity structures and superstable
   tensegrity structures. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002843. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{Food allergy has risen as a worldwide food safety concern due to the
   increasing prevalence over the last decades. It's in urgent need to
   develop straight yet sensitive detection methods for food allergens to
   help people avoid the potential risks imposed by food allergy. Here, we
   developed a dual-mode aptasensor that gave both colorimetric and
   fluorescent readouts in response to parvalbumin (PV), a major allergen
   in fish. The aptasensor was constructed by hybridizing the aptamer
   modified gold nanoparticles (AuNP-APT), the complementary short chain
   modified gold nanoparticles (AuNP-CS1) and the fluorescent dye-labeled
   complementary short chain (FAM-CS2). The presence of PV led to
   disassembly of the aptasensor through competitive interaction between
   APT and PV, which resulted in a change in the solution color of the
   AuNPs and a recovery of the once quenched fluorescence signals of
   FAM-CS2. The aptasensor exhibited a colorimetric response in the PV
   concentration range of 2.5-20 mu g/mL and a linear fluorescent response
   in the PV concentration range of 2.38-40 mu g/mL. Moreover, the
   aptasensor showed encouraging specificity, precision, accuracy as well
   as efficiency in real fish sample detection, which held great potential
   in recognition and analysis of food allergens.}},

Abstract = {{The degree-day method is widely used to determine energy consumption but
   cannot be directly applied to poultry buildings without improvements in
   its accuracy. This study was designed to optimize the degree-day
   calculation and proposes a solar-air degree-day method, which can be
   used to calculate the cooling and heating degree-days and the annual
   cooling and heating loads under different climate conditions for poultry
   buildings. In this paper, the solar-air degree-day method was proposed,
   which considers the effects of solar radiation with different wall
   orientations and surface colors. Five Chinese cities, Harbin, Beijing,
   Chongqing, Kunming and Guangzhou, were selected to represent different
   climate zones to determine the solar-air degree-days. The heating and
   cooling energy requirements for different climates were compared by DeST
   (Designer's Simulation Toolkit) simulation and the solar-air degree-day
   method. Approaches to decrease energy consumption were developed. The
   results showed that the maximum relative error was less than 10\%, and
   the new method was not significantly different from the DeST simulation
   (P> 0.05). The accuracy of calculating energy requirements was improved
   by the solar-air degree-day method in the different climate zones.
   Orientation and surface color effects on energy consumption need to be
   considered, and external walls of different orientations should have
   different surface colors.}},

Journal = {{ISA TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{360-369}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Correlated representation learning has found wide usage in process
   monitoring. However, slow and normal changes frequently occur in
   practical production processes, which may lead to model mismatch and
   degrade monitoring performance. Therefore, updating the monitoring model
   online and involving recently processed data information are important.
   This study proposes a recursive correlated representation learning
   (RCRL) incorporating an approach for online model updating for adaptive
   monitoring of slowly varying processes. First, an initial canonical
   correlation analysis-based monitoring model is established using
   historical process data. Second, an online model updating criterion is
   developed, and updating procedures are provided to reflect online data
   information and update monitoring model in a timely manner. Then,
   monitoring statistics are established and decision making logic is
   established to identify process status. The fitness of the monitoring
   scheme is increased because the online process information is considered
   to update the model. The proposed RCRL-based monitoring scheme is
   applied on a numerical example and a lab-scale distillation process. The
   effectiveness and superiority of the RCRL approach are verified. (C)

Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands have been gradually developed by aquaculture and other
   anthropogenic infrastructure, reducing the habitat for water birds. The
   traditional operation of shallow-pond milkfish (Chanos chanos)
   aquaculture in Taiwan may provide a model for aquaculture production
   that operates in harmony with overwintering water birds. The goal of
   this study was to test whether experimental water drawdown of
   aquaculture ponds, following the seasonal, traditional milkfish
   aquaculture, can create resource pulses that attract water birds in
   Tainan City in southern Taiwan. This experiment tested four types of
   aquaculture with potential for application: wild fish, no-feed tilapia,
   milkfish, and tilapia with feed. Ponds were surveyed every other day for
   water depth and water birds at least 37 times in four winters after
   water drawdown. In general, drawdown ponds created resource pulses that
   attracted higher feeding bird densities and numbers of species than
   control ponds in all aquaculture types. Milkfish ponds often had higher
   water birds in each year. Deep waders were sometimes the most abundant
   guild in the control, whereas shorebirds, shallow and deep waders were
   often higher in the drawdown treatment. Bird densities and numbers of
   species were correlated with water level, benthic biomass and water Chl
   a, but not with tilapia biomass. Species, such as Black-faced Spoonbills
   (Platalea minor), responded to water levels with the exception of Little
   Egrets (Egretta garzetta). The operation of seasonal, traditional
   shallow-pond milkfish aquaculture is suitable for foraging of water
   birds during the winter migratory bird season.}},

Abstract = {{Background Epsins, a family of evolutionarily conserved membrane
   proteins, play an essential role in endocytosis and signaling in
   podocytes.
   Methods Podocyte-specific Epn1, Epn2, Epn3 triple-knockout mice were
   generated to examine downstream regulation of serum response factor
   (SRF) by cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42).
   Results Podocyte-specific loss of epsins resulted in increased
   albuminuria and foot process effacement. Primary podocytes isolated
   fromthese knockoutmice exhibited abnormalities in cell adhesion and
   spreading, whichmay be attributed to reduced activation of cell division
   control protein Cdc42 and SRF, resulting in diminished beta(1) integrin
   expression. In addition, podocyte-specific loss of Srf resulted in
   severe albuminuria and foot process effacement, and defects in cell
   adhesion and spreading, along with decreased b1 integrin expression.
   Conclusions Epsins play an indispensable role in maintaining properly
   functioning podocytes through the regulation of Cdc42 and SRF-dependent
   b1 integrin expression.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{In the fields of biocomputing and biomolecular, DNA molecules are
   applicable to be regarded as data of logical computing platform that
   uses elaborate logic gates to perform a variety of tasks. Graphene oxide
   (GO) is a type of novel nanomaterial, which brings new research focus to
   materials science and biosensors due to its special selectivity and
   excellent quenching ability. G-quadruplex as a unique DNA structure
   stimulates the intelligent application of DNA assembly on the strength
   of its exceptional binding activity. In this paper, we report a
   universal logic device assisted with GO and G-quadruplex under an
   enzyme-free condition. Integrated with the quenching ability of GO to
   the TAMRA (fluorophore, Carboxytetramethylrhodamine) and the enhancement
   of fluorescence intensity produced by the peculiar binding of
   G-quadruplex to the NMM (N-methylmesoporphyrin IX), a series of basic
   binary logic gates (AND. OR. INHIBIT. XOR) have been designed and
   verified through biological experiments. Given the modularity and
   programmability of this strategy, two advanced logic gates (half adder
   and half subtractor) were realized on the basis of the same work
   platform. The fluorescence signals generated from different input
   combinations possessed satisfactory results, which provided proof of
   feasibility. We believe that the proposed universal logical platform
   that operates at the nanoscale is expected to be utilized for future
   applications in molecular computing as well as disease diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an one-dimensional magnetized plasma photonic

   the transmission matrix method (TMM) to study the terahertz band
   comb-like multichannel filtering properties, which is different from the

   the transmission matrix of the model, third, we find the numerical
   relationship between the number of Fibonacci sequences and the number of
   channels. Higher relative refractive index improves the filter
   performance of comb-like channels. The effect of the length of each
   layer on the number of channels and the frequency of adjacent comb-like
   channels is different from that of traditional periodic multichannel
   filters. The detuning of magnetic field can increase the number of
   filtering channels, and different incident angles have different

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), voltage
   regulation in active distribution networks (ADNs) has been facing a
   great challenge. This paper derives an asynchronous distributed voltage
   control strategy based on the partial primal-dual gradient algorithm,
   where both active and reactive power of DERs are considered. Different
   types of asynchrony due to imperfect communication or other practical
   limits, such as random time delays and non-identical
   sampling/computation rates, are fitted into a unified analytic
   framework. The proposed asynchronous algorithm is then converted into a
   fixed-point problem by leveraging the operator splitting method, which
   leads to the convergence proof. Moreover, an online implementation
   method is introduced to make the controller adjustable to time-varying
   environments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out on a
   rudimentary 8-bus and the IEEE-123 bus system to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Asynchrony widely exists in microgrids (MGs), such as nonidentical
   sampling rates and communication delays, which challenges the MG
   control. This article addresses the asynchronous distributed power
   control problem of hybrid microgrids, considering different kinds of
   asynchrony, such as nonidentical sampling rates, and random time delays.
   To this end, we first formulate the economic dispatch problem of MGs,
   and devise a synchronous algorithm. Then, we analyze the impact of
   asynchrony, and propose an asynchronous iteration algorithm based on the
   synchronous version. By introducing a random clock at each iteration,
   different types of asynchrony are fitted into a unified framework, where
   the asynchronous algorithm is converted into a fixed-point iteration
   problem with a nonexpansive operator, leading to a convergence proof. We
   further provide an upper bound estimation of the time delay. Moreover,
   the real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in both ac and dc
   MGs is introduced. By measuring the frequency/voltage, the controller is
   simplified by reducing one order, and adapting to the fast varying load
   demand. Finally, simulations on a benchmark MG, and experiments are
   utilized to verify the effectiveness, and advantages of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the evolution law of temperature fields in a
   large-scale laboratory Underground Coal Gasification reactions using
   Ulanqab lignite under actual conditions. The results show that in the
   cultivation stage of oxidation zone, the main direction of the
   temperature field expansion is consistent with the crack direction of
   the coal seam. In the gasification stabilization stage, the main
   direction of the temperature field expansion is along the channel. The
   temperature of the coal seam and the overlying rock mass at its
   interface with the furnace directly above the gasification channel is
   equivalent to that of the coal seam temperature, and this temperature is
   much greater than the temperatures observed near both side walls of the
   gasification channel at the interface. However, temperatures
   perpendicular to the axis of the gasification channel are similar at a
   vertical distance of 40 cm away from the interface. The temperature
   distributions indicate that the transmission of heat through the
   overlying rock mass is more rapid in the vertical direction than in the
   horizontal direction. Moreover, some degree of thermal dispersion is
   observed in the vertical direction near the outlet. The thermal
   dispersion coefficient is 0.72 and dispersion angle gamma is 78.7
   degrees. (C) 2020 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress and apoptosis of trophoblasts are involved in

   vitro. We found that both TNF-alpha expression and the apoptotic index
   were higher in placentas from preeclamptic women than in normal
   placentas. TNF-alpha enhanced oxidative stress and increased the number
   of TUNEL-positive nuclei, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the cleaved
   caspase-3/caspase-3 ratio while decreasing cell viability in primary
   human trophoblast cells. TNF-alpha promoted cell migration and invasion.
   PDTC, a selective NF-kappa B inhibitor, significantly blunted
   TNF-alpha-induced effects. ACh treatment attenuated oxidative stress and
   apoptosis while further promoting migration and invasion of
   TNF-alpha-treated primary trophoblast cells. The effects of ACh could be
   reversed by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. Overall, our
   findings indicate that ACh significantly ameliorates TNF-alpha-induced
   oxidative stress and apoptosis of human primary trophoblast cells via
   muscarinic receptors. This is the first time that the improvement of
   vagal activity served as a therapeutic strategy for PE-like
   trophoblasts, suggesting its potential value in clinical practice.
   Summary Sentence: TNF-alpha is increased in the placentas from
   preeclamptic women and acetylcholine significantly ameliorates
   TNF-alpha-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of human primary
   trophoblast cells via muscarinic receptors.

Abstract = {{Study objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
   impacts operating room (OR) management in regions with high prevalence
   (e.g., > 1.0\% of asymptomatic patients testing positive). Cases with
   aerosol producing procedures are isolated to a few ORs, initial phase I
   recovery of those patients is in the ORs, and multimodal environmental
   decontamination applied. We quantified the potential increase in
   productivity from also resequencing these cases among those 2 or 3 ORs.
   Design: Computer simulation provided sample sizes requiring > 100 years
   experimentally. Resequencing was limited to changes in the start times
   of surgeons' lists of cases.
   Setting: Ambulatory surgery center or hospital outpatient department.
   Main results: With case resequencing applied before and on the day of
   surgery, there were 5.6\% and 5.5\% more cases per OR per day for the 2
   ORs and 3 ORs, respectively, both standard errors (SE) < 0.1\%.
   Resequencing cases among ORs to start cases earlier permitted increases
   in the hours into which cases could be scheduled from 10.5 to 11.0 h,
   while assuring > 90\% probability of each OR finishing within the
   prespecified 12-h shift. Thus, the additional cases were all scheduled
   before the day of surgery. The greater allocated time also resulted in
   less overutilized time, a mean of 4.2 min per OR per day for 2 ORs (SE
   0.5) and 6.3 min per OR per day for 3 ORs (SE 0.4). The benefit could be
   achieved while limiting application of resequencing to days when the OR
   with the fewest estimated hours of cases has <= 8 h.
   Conclusions: Some ambulatory surgery ORs have unusually long OR times
   and/or room cleanup times (e.g., infection control efforts because of
   the pandemic). Resequencing cases before and on the day of surgery
   should be considered, because moving 1 or 2 cases occasionally has
   little to no cost with substantive benefit.}},

Volume = {{159}},

Abstract = {{Objective. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is lethal mainly due
   to extensive metastasis. Cancer cell stem-like properties are
   responsible for HGSOC metastasis. LGR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is
   involved in the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal and activity in
   some human organs.
   Methods. TCGA and CCLE databases were interrogated for gene mRNA in
   ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Gain and loss of functions of
   LGR4, ELF3, FZD5 and WNT7B were performed to identify their roles in
   ovarian cancer cell epithelial phenotype and stem-like properties. In
   vivo experiments were performed to observe the effect of LGR4 on ovarian
   cancer cell growth and peritoneal seeding. The binding of ELF3 to LGR4
   gene promoter was investigated by dual-luciferase reporter assays and
   ChIP.
   Results. LGR4 was shown to be overexpressed in HGSOCs and maintain the
   epithelial phenotype of HGSOC cells. LGR4 knockdown suppressed POU5F1,
   SOX2, PROM1 (CD133) and ALDH1A2 expression. Furthermore, LGR4 knockdown
   reduced CD133(+) and ALDH(+) subpopulations and impaired tumorisphere
   formation. To the contrary, LGR4 overexpression enhanced POU5F1 and SOX2
   expression and tumorisphere formation capacity. LGR4 knockdown inhibited
   HGSOC cell growth and peritoneal seeding in xenograft models.
   Mechanistically, LGR4 and ELF3, an epithelium-specific transcription
   factor, formed a reciprocal regulatory loop, which was positively
   modulated by WNT7B/FZD5 ligand-receptor pair. Consistently, knockdown of
   ELF3, WNT7B, and FZD5, respectively, disrupted HGSOC cell epithelial
   phenotype and stem-like properties.
   Conclusion. Together, these data demonstrate that WNT7B/FZD5-LGR4/ELF3
   axis maintains HGSOC cell epithelial phenotype and stem-like traits;
   targeting this axis may prevent HGSOC metastasis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Exosomes represent secretory membranous vesicles used for the
   information exchange between cells and organ-to-organ communication.
   Exosome crosstalk mechanisms are involved in the regulation of several
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated pathophysiological
   intestinal processes such as barrier function, immune responses, and
   intestinal flora. Functional biomolecules, mainly noncoding RNAs
   (ncRNAs), are believed to be transmitted between the mammalian cells via
   exosomes that likely play important roles in cell-to-cell communication,
   both locally and systemically. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in
   exosomes have generated substantial interest because of their critical
   roles in multiple pathophysiological processes. In addition, exosomal
   miRNAs are implicated in the gut health. MiRNAs are selectively and
   actively loaded into the exosomes and then transferred to the target
   recipient cell where they manipulate cell function through
   posttranscriptional silencing of target genes. Intriguingly, miRNA
   profile of exosomes differs from their cellular counterparts suggesting
   an active sorting and packaging mechanism of exosomal miRNAs. Even more
   exciting is the involvement of posttranscriptional modifications in the
   specific loading of miRNAs into exosomes, but the underlying mechanisms
   of how these modifications direct ncRNA sorting have not been
   established. This review gives a brief overview of the status of
   exosomes and exosomal miRNAs in IBD and also discusses potential
   mechanisms of exosomal miRNA sorting and delivering.}},

Abstract = {{Older adults with hearing loss have greater difficulty recognizing
   target speech in multi-talker environments than young adults with normal
   hearing, especially when target and masker speech streams are
   perceptually similar. A difference in fundamental frequency (f0) contour
   depth is an effective stream segregation cue for young adults with
   normal hearing. This study examined whether older adults with varying
   degrees of sensorineural hearing loss are able to utilize differences in
   target/masker f0 contour depth to improve speech recognition in
   multi-talker listening. Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were
   measured for speech mixtures composed of target/masker streams with
   flat, normal, and exaggerated speaking styles, in which f0 contour depth
   systematically varied. Computational modeling estimated differences in
   energetic masking across listening conditions. Young adults had lower
   SRTs than older adults; a result that was partially explained by
   differences in audibility predicted by the model. However, audibility
   differences did not explain why young adults experienced a benefit from
   mismatched target/masker f0 contour depth, while in most conditions,
   older adults did not. Reduced ability to use segregation cues
   (differences in target/masker f0 contour depth), and deficits grouping
   speech with variable f0 contours likely contribute to difficulties
   experienced by older adults in challenging acoustic environments.}},

Abstract = {{A 56-year-old Japanese woman with a history of palmoplantar pustulosis
   was admitted for examination due to left femur pain. Radiography and
   computed tomography showed thickening of the bone on the outer portion
   of the left femur. Bone scintigraphy of the left femur showed intense
   radioactive uptake. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with SAPHO
   syndrome. Bone histomorphometric analysis of the left femur showed
   cancellous bone with thickened cortical bone. Whilst normal bone shows
   cancellous bone with double labeling (normal turn over), and cortical
   bone with no labeling (low turn over, adynamic state), this case
   presented with both cancellous and cortical bone with marked double
   labeling (indicating high turn over), abundant osteoid and woven bone.
   Immunohistological analysis showed that cells lining the bone surface
   consisted of osteoblasts and were positive for alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP). Few to little of these cells were positive for tartrate-resistant
   acid phosphatase (TRAP)-5B, cathepsin K and matrix metallopeptidase 9
   (MMP-9). These results indicate that, in this case study, excessive
   production of osteoblasts contributed to hyperostosis of the left femur,
   with abundant osteoid and woven bone. This type of bone formation in
   SAPHO syndrome is not lamellar bone seen in normal bone, but rather
   fragile and mechanically weak bone, resulting in bone pain. Doxycycline
   may be a therapeutic option for bone pain in this patient.}},

Title = {{Reducing efforts of software engineering systematic literature reviews
   updates using text classification}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are frequently used to
   synthesize evidence in Software Engineering (SE), however replicating
   and keeping SLRs up-to-date is a major challenge. The activity of
   studies selection in SLR is labor intensive due to the large number of
   studies that must be analyzed. Different approaches have been
   investigated to support SLR processes, such as: Visual Text Mining or
   Text Classification. But acquiring the initial dataset is time-consuming
   and labor intensive.
   Objective: In this work, we proposed and evaluated the use of Text
   Classification to support the studies selection activity of new
   evidences to update SLRs in SE.
   Method: We applied Text Classification techniques to investigate how
   effective and how much effort could be spared during the studies
   selection phase of an SLR update. Considering the SLRs update scenario,
   the studies analyzed in the primary SLR could be used as a classified
   dataset to train Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. We conducted an
   experiment with 8 Software Engineering SLRs. In the experiments, we
   investigated the use of multiple preprocessing and feature extraction
   tasks such as tokenization, stop words removal, word lemmatization,
   TF-IDF (Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency) with Decision Tree
   and Support Vector Machines as classification algorithms. Furthermore,
   we configured the classifier activation threshold for maximizing Recall,
   hence reducing the number of Missed selected studies.
   Results: The techniques accuracies were measured and the results
   achieved on average a F-Score of 0.92 and 62\% of exclusion rate when
   varying the activation threshold of the classifiers, with a 4\% average
   number of Missed selected studies. Both the Exclusion rate and number of
   Missed selected studies were significantly different when compared to
   classifier which did not use the configuration of the activation
   threshold.
   Conclusion: The results showed the potential of the techniques in
   reducing the effort required of SLRs updates.}},

Abstract = {{Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are common following renal
   transplantation and may have long-lasting effects. HCMV can be measured
   directly by viral DNA or indirectly via host immune responses.
   HCMV-encoded microRNA (miRNA) may alter the pathobiology of HCMV
   infections and contribute to the progression of HCMV disease.
   HCMV-encoded miRNAs can be detected in blood but have not been sought in
   saliva. We investigated saliva samples from 32 renal transplant
   recipients (RTR) and 12 seropositive healthy controls for whom
   immunological data was available. Five HCMV-encoded miRNAs
   (miR-UL112-5p, miR-US5-2-3p, miR-UL36, miR-US25-2-3p and miR-UL22A) were
   sought using primer probe assays. HCMV miRNA species were detected in
   saliva from 15 RTR and 3 healthy controls, with miR-US5-2-3p most
   commonly detected. The presence of HCMV miRNAs associated with increased
   T-cell responses to HCMV IE-1 in RTR, suggesting a link with frequent
   reactivations of HCMV.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored health-care workers' perception of patients' suicide

   conducted with 32 health-care workers from a general hospital in Klang
   Valley, Malaysia. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed
   using the interpretative phenomenological analysis. The health-care
   workers were found to have four types of perceptions: to end life, not
   to end life, ambivalence about intention, and an evolving understanding
   of intention. Factors leading to their perceptions of patients' suicide
   intention were patient demographics, health status, severity of
   ideation/attempt, suicide method, history of treatment, moral character,
   communication of suicide intention, affective/cognitive status,
   availability of social support, and health-care workers' limited
   knowledge of patients' condition/situation. Insufficient knowledge and
   negative attitudes toward suicidal patients led to risk minimization and
   empathic failure, although most health-care workers used the correct
   parameters in determining suicide intention.}},

Abstract = {{Africa, the second largest continent in the world, has achieved
   remarkable economic and political results through exploration and
   positive development. Ecological security comprehensively reflects the
   health and integrity of an ecosystem, and it is broadly defined as the
   security state of a complex artificial ecosystem composed of natural,
   economic and social factors. Ecological security determines the
   potential for sustainable development in Africa, especially with its
   rapidly developing economies. However, there is a lack of information on
   the ecological security state of the continent as a whole. In this
   study, we constructed an evaluation system based on a
   pressure-state-response model and evaluated the ecological security
   state of all 54 African countries. The results showed that, at the
   national level, the ecological security state of the countries in Africa
   differed, as did their spatial and temporal variations from 1995 to
   2016. In general, African countries showed relatively good ecological
   security. The years 2007 and 2001 were the worst and best years,
   respectively, in terms of ecological security during the study period.
   At the regional level, North Africa and West Africa had the best and
   worst ecological security, respectively.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ketamine abusing is associated with ulcerative cystitis, but the
   mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the existence
   of ketamine-induced symptom in a rat model and evaluate the underlining
   mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats were chosen and randomly divided into 12
   groups (n = 8), such as the control group, low dose of ketamine (10
   mg/kg/day), middle dose of ketamine (30 mg/kg/day) and high dose of
   ketamine (50 mg/kg/day) groups. The experimental groups were
   administrated ketamine i.p. daily, whereas the control groups were
   administrated with saline. After 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment, the
   bladder tissues were collected. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and
   a transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were
   used to evaluate the bladder epithelium pathology and urothelial
   apoptosis, respectively. The protein expression levels of LC3, p62,
   Beclin1 were assessed by Western blotting. HE staining results of the
   experimental rats showed the bladder tissue denudation of the urothelial
   epithelium with edema and congestion compared with the control groups.
   TUNEL staining showed a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells
   in experimental groups than in the control groups. The protein LC3 and
   Beclin1 had significantly higher levels compared with control groups.
   The protein p62 had lower levels compared with control groups. The
   expression levels correlated with contraction of ketamine and treatment
   time. HE staining, TUNEL staining and Western blot results showed
   dose-dependent, time-dependent autophage in ketamine-treated rats. All
   the results suggested that autophagy proteins might be involved in
   inflammatory response in rats.}},

Title = {{May omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation help reduce severe
   complications in Covid-19 patients?}},
Journal = {{BIOCHIMIE}},

Pages = {{275-280}},

Abstract = {{In around 10\% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, coronavirus disease-2019
   (Covid-19) symptoms are complicated with a severe lung damage called
   Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is often lethal. ARDS
   is mainly associated with an uncontrolled overproduction of immune cells
   and cytokines, called ``cytokine storm syndrome{''}; it appears 7-15
   days following the onset of symptoms, leading to systemic inflammation
   and multiple organ failure. Because they are well-known metabolic
   precursors of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), omega-3
   long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LC-PUFAs) could help
   improve the resolution of the inflammatory balance, limiting therefore
   the level and duration of the critical inflammatory period. Omega-3
   LC-PUFAs may also interact at different stages of the viral infection,
   notably on the virus entry and replication. In the absence of
   demonstrated treatment and while waiting for vaccine possibility, the
   use of omega-3 LC-PUFAs deserve therefore to be considered, based on
   previous clinical studies suggesting that omega-3 supplementation could
   improve clinical outcomes of critically ill patients at the acute phase
   of ARDS. In this context, it is crucial to remind that the omega-3 PUFA
   dietary intake levels in Western countries remains largely below the
   current recommendations, considering both the omega-3 precursor
   alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and long chain derivatives such as
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An optimized
   omega-3 PUFAs status could be helpful to prevent infectious diseases,
   including Covid-19. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de

Abstract = {{Serum sodium concentration is the main regulator of the intracellular
   and extracellular fluid volume. Mild changes are clinically irrelevant,
   but severe alterations and a rapid development of dysnatraemia may have
   serious consequences. Hyponatraemia is more common than hypernatraemia.
   The most common cause of hyponatremia is an excess of free water. To
   maintain osmolar equilibration, fluid moves from the extracellular to
   the intracellular space and cerebral oedema may occur. Hypernatremia is
   usually caused by a loss of free water and can cause neuronal
   dehydration. While acute dysnatraemia can be corrected rapidly, chronic
   dysnatraemia has to be corrected slowly and carefully due to the body's
   adaptive mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated cardiac involvement of COVID-19 is an infrequent presentation,
   and myocardial infarction is even less common. We report a 30-year-old
   man presenting with retrosternal pain of insidious onset whose intensity
   increases suddenly. On admission, the patient had tachycardia and an EKG
   showed a 1 mm ST-elevation and diffuse PQ segment depression. Troponin
   was 26.9 ng/ml (normal value {[}NV] < 0.03), inflammatory parameters
   were elevated, and SARS-CoV 2 PCR was positive. He was hospitalized with
   the diagnosis of myopericarditis secondary to SARS-CoV 2. He progressed
   favorably without pain during the hospital stay and with decreasing
   troponin values. A Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was
   compatible with an infero-lateral transmural infarction. A coronary
   angiography showed a distal occlusion of the circumflex artery.
   Consequently, anticoagulation and double platelet anti-aggregation were
   started. The patient evolved favorably, with a decreasing troponin curve

Title = {{Power density based fatigue load spectrum editing for accelerated
   durability testing for tractor front axles}},
Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{73-88}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The fatigue load spectrum is one of the most important parts in
   accelerated durability testing of agricultural machinery; however, the
   traditional editing approach just focuses on influence of load amplitude
   on mechanical components, which is not suitable for the agricultural
   machinery, the loads of which are broad in frequency bandwidth and time
   varying in stress amplitude. Therefore, considering the comprehensive
   influence of load amplitude and frequency on the fatigue life of
   materials, a power-density-based fatigue load spectrum editing (PD-LSD)
   approach for accelerated durability testing is proposed ensuring that
   fatigue load spectrum for accelerated durability testing of tractor
   components can reproduce operation load characteristics of components.
   The concept of power density is introduced, and a fatigue analysis
   method based on power density and short time Fourier transform (STFT) is
   discussed. For the approach of this study, STFT and stress-life (S-N)
   curve were used to derive accumulative power density (AccPD) of the load
   signal. The AccPD identified and extracted high fatigue damage segments
   of original load signal and obtained reduced accelerated load spectrum
   of components. Based on the load signal of the 88-kW tractor front axle,
   this approach and the time damage editing approach were applied to edit
   the load signal. The results show that, the accelerated load Signal I
   based on the PD-LSD approach with a shorter length of time contained
   almost same damage of the original load signal, and the statistical
   parameters (mean value, root mean square and kurtosis coefficient) and
   the signal amplitude domain of the accelerated load Signal I were more
   consistent with the original load signal, which verifies the
   acceleration, accuracy and effectiveness of the approach. This research
   supports fatigue testing and durability analysis for a key component of
   agricultural machinery. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of
   cancer-related mortality. The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain
   (BET) inhibitors suppresses the gene expressions of various oncogenes
   and shows a good efficacy in the preclinical CRC models. We investigate
   the mechanism of action of BET inhibitors in CRC.
   Methods: The effect of BET inhibitor (JQ1) on the HGF-MET signaling was
   assessed by qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining in CRC
   and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The effect of JQ1 on the CAFs
   was investigated using the primary CAFs derived from CRC tissues and
   induced-CAFs derived from isolating foreskin fibroblasts. The effect of
   JQ1 on the gene expression profile of CAFs was explored by RNA-sequence,
   qPCR and bioinformatic analysis.
   Results: JQ1 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of MET in CRC cells
   and downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of HGF in both CRC cells
   and CAFs. JQ1 attenuated the pro-migratory activity of CAFs through
   downregulation of HGF expression in CAFs. Meanwhile, JQ1 also reduced
   the ability of contracting collagen gels, decreased the cell
   proliferation, induced G1 arrest and repressed the pro-inflammatory gene
   expressions in CAFs. MYC expression was suppressed by JQ1 in CAFs.
   Knockdown of MYC induced G1 arrest in CAFs.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of BET
   inhibition on the HGF-MET signaling and the pro-tumor activity of CAFs,
   revealing a new mechanism by which BET inhibition suppresses CRC
   progression.}},

Title = {{Evaluating if an Advance Care Planning Intervention Promotes
   Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders by Facilitating Accurate Prognostic Awareness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1658-U61}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Issuing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders has seldom been an
   outcome in randomized clinical trials of advance care planning (ACP)
   interventions. The aim of this study was to examine whether an ACP
   intervention facilitating accurate prognostic awareness (PA) for
   patients with advanced cancer was associated with earlier use of DNR
   orders. Patients and Methods: Participants (n=460) were randomly
   assigned 1:1 to the experimental and control arms, with 392 deceased
   participants constituting the final sample of this secondary analysis
   study. Participants in the intervention and control arms had each
   received an intervention tailored to their readiness for ACP/prognostic
   information and symptom-management education, respectively.
   Effectiveness in promoting a DNR order by facilitating accurate PA was
   determined by intention-to-treat analysis using multivariate logistic
   regression with hierarchical linear modeling. Results: At enrollment in
   the ACP intervention and before death, 9 (4.6\%) and 8 (4.1\%)
   participants and 168 (85.7\%) and 164 (83.7\%) participants in the
   experimental and control arms, respectively, had issued a DNR order,
   without significant between-arm differences. However, participants in
   the experimental arm with accurate PA were significantly more likely
   than participants in the control arm without accurate PA to have issued
   a DNR order before death (adjusted odds ratio, 2.264; 95\% CI,
   1.036-4.951; P=.041). Specifically, participants in the experimental arm
   who first reported accurate PA 31 to 90 days before death were
   significantly more likely than their counterparts in the control arm who
   reported accurate PA to have issued a DNR order in the next wave of
   assessment (adjusted odds ratio, 13.365; 95\% CI, 1.989-89.786; P=.008).
   Both arms issued DNR orders close to death (median, 5-6 days before
   death). Conclusions: Our ACP intervention did not promote the overall
   presence of a DNR order. However, our intervention facilitated the
   issuance of NDR orders before death among patients with accurate PA,
   especially those who reported accurate PA 31 to 90 days before death,
   but it did not facilitate the issuance of DNR orders earlier than their
   counterparts in the control arm.}},

Title = {{Rapid golden-angle diffusion-weighted propeller MRI for simultaneous
   assessment of ADC and IVIM}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Golden-angle single-shot PROPLLER (GA-SS-PROP) is proposed to
   accelerate the PROPELLER acquisition for distortion-free
   diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging. Acceleration is achieved by acquiring
   one-shot per b-value and several b-values can be acquired along a
   diffusion direction, where the DW signal follows a bi-exponential decay
   (i.e. IVIM). Sparse reconstruction is used to reconstruct full
   resolution DW images. Consequently, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
   map and IVIM maps (i.e., perfusion fraction (f) and the perfusion-free
   diffusion coefficient (D)) are obtained simultaneously. The performance
   of GA-SS-PROP was demonstrated with simulation and human experiments.
   Methods: A realistic numerical phantom of high-quality diffusion images
   of the brain was developed. The error of the reconstructed DW images and
   quantitative maps were compared to the ground truth. The pulse sequence
   was developed to acquire human brain data. For comparison, fully sampled
   PROPELLER and conventional single-shot echo planar imaging (SS-EPI)
   acquisitions were performed.
   Results: GA-SS-PROP was 5 times faster than conventional PROPELLER
   acquisition with comparable image quality. The simulation demonstrated
   that sparse reconstruction is effective in restoring contrast and
   resolution. The human experiments demonstrated that GA-SS-PROP achieved
   superior image fidelity compared to SS-EPI for the same acquisition time
   and same in-plane resolution (1 x 1 mm(2)).
   Conclusion: GA-SS-PROP offers fast, high-resolution and distortion-free
   DW images. The generated quantitative maps (f, D and ADC) can provide
   valuable information on tissue perfusion and diffusion properties
   simultaneously, which are desirable in many applications, especially in
   oncology. As a turbo spin-echo based technique, it can be applied in
   most challenging regions where SS-EPI is problematic.}},

   to Column Removal Scenarios}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A simple yet effective method for dynamic assessment of building
   structures subject to a sudden column removal is presented. An
   equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) dynamic model to predict the
   realistic dynamic response of the structure after column removal is
   proposed. This model considers nonzero initial conditions that are
   likely to occur under blast loading and structural damping, which can
   significantly affect the dynamic performance under large deformations.
   Based on the proposed method, dynamic response of a structure subject to
   a specific dynamic loading released from column removal is analytically
   solved. Four sets of physical tests of structures subject to column
   removal, including quasi-static tests and the corresponding multiple
   free-fall dynamic tests, are employed to verify the proposed assessment
   method. In addition, the classical pseudostatic assessment is conducted
   for the test series and compared with the present method. Results
   obtained from the verification study demonstrate the accuracy and
   effectiveness of the proposed simplified dynamic assessment. In
   addition, the proposed equivalent SDOF method is simple and can be
   easily implemented with a spreadsheet by practicing engineers. This
   advantage allows the proposed method to be employed as a routine design
   procedure for predicting the dynamic performance of structures subject
   to column removal. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002833. (c) 2020

Title = {{Low PTEN expression and overexpression of phosphorylated Akt(Ser473) and

Abstract = {{The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway serves an essential role in various
   cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, cell motility,
   angiogenesis and cell metabolism. Loss of PTEN expression and
   hyperactivation of Akt can result in tumorigenesis. Previous studies
   observed expression of the Akt protein and absence of the PTEN protein
   in bladder cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues. The aim of
   the present study was to evaluate the expression status and prognostic
   value of PTEN and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in Taiwanese patients
   with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Archival formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from 65 UTUC cases were stained via
   immunohistochemistry for PTEN, phosphorylated (p)Akt serine (Ser)(473)
   and pAkt threonine (Thr)(308). The expression levels of each protein
   were significantly correlated with clinicopathological parameters. PTEN,
   pAkt(Ser473) and pAkt(Thr308) protein expression levels were higher in
   adjacent normal tissues compared with those in tumor tissues.
   Cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression levels were lower in high-stage
   tumors compared with those in low-stage tumors, and nuclear and
   cytoplasmic pAkt(Thr308) protein expression levels were higher in
   high-grade tumors compared with those in low-grade tumors. Univariate
   analysis showed that high pathological tumor stage (pT2-4) {[}P=0.01;
   hazard ratio (HR)=3.40; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.34-8.60],
   metastatic status (P=0.003; HR=3.55, 95\% CI, 1.55-8.11), low
   cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression levels (P=0.016; HR=3.14; 95\% CI,
   1.24-7.95) and high cytoplasmic pAkt(Ser473) protein expression levels
   (P=0.019, HR=2.71, 95\% CI, 1.18-6.21) were predictive of poor overall
   survival. However, only metastatic status (P=0.031; HR=2.73; 95\% CI,
   1.10-6.78), low cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression levels (P=0.017;
   HR=3.29; 95\% CI, 1.24-8.73) and high cytoplasmic pAkt(Ser473) protein
   expression levels (P=0.027; HR=2.64; 95\% CI, 1.12-6.23) remained
   significant in the multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
   showed that high T stage, metastasis, low expression levels of
   cytoplasmic PTEN protein and high expression levels of cytoplasmic
   pAkt(Ser473) protein were significantly associated with poor survival
   (P=0.006, 0.001, 0.011 and 0.014, respectively). Co-expression of
   PTENlow/pAkt(Ser473/high) and pAkt(Thr308/high) phenotypes was
   associated with a less favorable overall survival (P=0.001). Overall,
   the present findings demonstrated that low expression levels of PTEN and
   high expression levels of pAkt(Ser473) and pAkt(Thr308) were predictors
   for poor overall survival in patients with UTUC.}},

   nm thin ZnO films sputtered on fused silica substrates. By a combination
   of two pulsed ns-laser beams with different photon energies - one below

   ablation of the film devoid of any substrate damage is demonstrated.
   Compared to single beam ablation, we reduce the amount of debris and
   thermal defects at the surface at comparable laser energy conditions. To
   quantify the impact of this dual beam set-up on ablation quality and
   efficiency, several parameters like pulse delay, laser wavelength, and
   pulse fluence were varied. These results establish the basis for the
   proposed novel direct sub diffraction writing method of semiconductors

Title = {{Fertility is a key predictor of the double burden of malnutrition among
   women of child-bearing age in sub-Saharan Africa}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background The ongoing nutrition transition in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
   is exhibiting spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability leading to
   different forms of malnutrition burden across SSA, with some regions
   exhibiting the double burden of malnutrition. This study aimed to
   develop a predictive understanding of the malnutrition burden among
   women of child-bearing age.
   Methods Data from 34 SSA countries were acquired from the Demographic
   and Health Survey, World Bank, and Swiss Federal Institute of
   Technology. The SSA countries were classified into malnutrition classes
   based on their national prevalence of underweight, overweight, and
   obesity using a 10\% threshold. Next, random forest analysis was used to
   examine the association between country-level demographic variables and
   the national prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity. Finally,
   random forest analysis and multinomial logistic regression models were
   utilized to investigate the association between individual-level social
   and demographic variables and Body Mass Index (BMI) categories of
   underweight, normal weight, and combined overweight and obesity.
   Results Four malnutrition classes were identified: Class A had 5
   countries with >= 10\% of the women underweight; Class B had 11
   countries with 1.0\% each of underweight and overweight; Class C1 had 7
   countries with >= 10\% overweight; and Class C2 had 11 countries with >=
   10\% obesity. At the country-level, fertility rate predicted
   underweight, overweight and obesity prevalence, but economic indicators
   were also important, including the gross domestic product per capita - a
   measure of economic opportunity that predicted both overweight and
   obesity prevalence, and the GINI coefficient - a measure of economic
   inequality that predicted both underweight and overweight prevalence. At
   the individual-level, parity was a risk factor for underweight in
   underweight burdened countries and a risk factor for overweight/obesity
   in overweight/obesity burdened countries, whereas age and wealth were
   protective factors for underweight but risk factors for
   overweight/obesity.
   Conclusions Beyond the effect of economic indicators, this study
   revealed the important role of fertility rate and parity, which may
   represent risk factors for both underweight and combined overweight and
   obesity among women of child-bearing age. Health professionals should
   consider combining reproductive health services with nutritional
   programs when addressing the challenge of malnutrition in SSA.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the electro-mechanical behavior of automotive high
   voltage busbars under combined electrical load with varying indenter
   geometry and environmental conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As high voltage systems for electrified vehicles and their electronic
   components exhibit hazardous potential during abuse situations, their
   development needs special consideration. Battery busbars, representing
   current carrying components, pose a special threat in the event of a
   vehicle crash. While the behavior of Li-Ion cells under different crash
   loads has already been investigated, there is no detailed knowledge
   about the electromechanical behavior of busbars during crash situations.
   Therefore, this paper focuses on combining mechanical and electrical
   loads on thermoplastic-insulated battery busbars. The conducted
   experimental work includes mechanical penetration of the insulation with
   various indenter geometries. Simultaneously, a high electrical potential
   was applied between the indenter and the conducting copper of the
   busbar. To detect the failure of the busbar, which is considered an
   electrical short circuit, insulation resistance was measured.
   Furthermore, the investigation includes the influence of humidity and
   lower voltage on the electro-mechanical behavior to simulate operating
   conditions. The results of this paper contribute to current knowledge in
   meeting the challenges that arise in developing safe vehicle batteries.
   The critical load limits and failure behavior can be used to improve the
   prediction accuracy of hazardous situations for the development and
   design process of high voltage battery systems.}},

Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{194}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an analysis of the actual change in brightness of
   comet 2I/Borisov. The calculations take into account total scattering
   cross-sections coming from ice, dust particles, and their combinations.
   It was assumed that dust particles are so-called silicate agglomerates
   which consist of single monomers. We analyze the actual outburst of the
   interstellar comet 2I/Borisov in terms of mass loss. This parameter
   (mass ejected) is one of the main factors determining the amplitude of
   the comet's brightness jump. A numerical model was developed and used to
   analyze the loss of mass ejected during the cometary outburst
   2I/Borisov. The calculations presented in this paper are related to the
   actual outburst of comet 2I/Borisov which was observed in March 2020
   with a change in brightness Delta m = -0.7 magnitude. The ratio of the
   mass of thrown dust to the mass of ejected ice, which determines the
   observed change in brightness, was also determined. In the case of water
   ice controlled sublimation, the ratio is between 9.51 and 8.16. However,
   in the case of the sublimation of carbon monoxide, this parameter takes
   values from 7.47 to 3.07. The values of these mass ratios are
   significantly related to the eta(t(1)) parameter.}},

Abstract = {{We search for observational signatures of magnetic helicity in data from
   all-sky radio polarization surveys of the Milky Way Galaxy. Such a
   detection would help confirm the dynamo origin of the field and may
   provide new observational constraints for its shape. We compare our
   observational results to simulated observations for both a simple
   helical field, and for a more complex field that comes from a solution
   to the dynamo equation. Our simulated observations show that the
   large-scale helicity of a magnetic field is reflected in the large-scale
   structure of the fractional polarization derived from the observed
   synchrotron radiation and Faraday depth of the diffuse Galactic
   synchrotron emission. Comparing the models with the observations
   provides evidence for the presence of a quadrupolar magnetic field with
   a vertical component that is pointing away from the observer in both
   hemispheres of the Milky Way Galaxy. Since there is no reason to believe
   that the Galactic magnetic field is unusual when compared to other
   galaxies, this result provides further support for the dynamo origin of
   large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the implications of research which takes a
   collectivised approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans+ (LGBT+)
   ageing and which engages in Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) in

   address commonalities but often fail to address internal diversity, i.e.
   the differences between and among older LGBT+ people. This article
   explores six key problems associated with collectivised research: (1)
   Homogenising language and phrases; (2) Uneven numerical representation
   of sub-groups; (3) Thematic over-representation of sexuality; (4)
   Non-intersectional analyses; (5) Thematic under-representation of
   gender; and (6) Inaccurate reporting of data. Research which does not
   differentiate between `older LGBT+' sub-populations, can provide
   policy-makers and practitioners with inaccurate and/or misleading
   information, resulting in services which meet the needs of some, but not
   all, older LGBT+ people. This article discusses how research can become

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common postoperative arrhythmia and
   can cause increased length of stay, costs, morbidity, and mortality.
   Little information exists about postoperative AF after major head and
   neck surgery, but it is thought to occur more frequently than after
   surgery at other extra-thoracic sites. A retrospective cohort study was
   implemented, including patients who had undergone major head and neck
   surgery and who had follow-up records covering a minimum of 60 days
   postoperative. The main outcome was the incidence of new onset
   postoperative AF after major head and neck surgery; secondary outcomes
   were the incidence of any AF, the role of cardiology, predictors of AF
   postoperatively, and clinical outcomes. A total 337 patients were
   included. Twenty-four patients experienced AF postoperatively (7.1\%),
   of whom 12 (3.6\%) had new onset AF. New onset AF was associated with
   advanced age of >= 65 years (odds ratio 11.6, P = 0.027) and having a
   laryngectomy (odds ratio 9.9, P = 0.003). Postoperative AF following
   major head and neck surgery is not a rare phenomenon and can be
   associated with considerable morbidity and costs due to the need for
   intensive care, specialty consultations, additional testing and
   laboratory studies, and cardiology follow-up.}},

Title = {{Oral commensal bacteria differentially modulate epithelial cell death}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Epithelial cell death is an important innate mechanism at
   mucosal surfaces, which enables the elimination of pathogens and
   modulates immunoinflammatory responses. Based on the antimicrobial and
   anti-inflammatory properties of cell death, we hypothesized that oral
   epithelial cell (OECs) death is differentially modulated by oral
   bacteria.
   Material and Methods: We evaluated the effect of oral commensals
   Streptococcus gordonii (Sg), Streptococcus sanguinis (Ss), and
   Veillonella parvula (Vp), and pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg),
   Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) on OEC
   death. Apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow cytometry using
   FITC Annexin-V and Propidium Iodide staining. Caspase-3/7 and caspase-1
   activities were determined as markers of apoptosis and pyroptosis,
   respectively. IL-1 beta and IL-8 protein levels were determined in
   supernatants by ELISA.
   Results: Significant increases in apoptosis and necrosis were induced by
   Sg and Ss. Pg also induced apoptosis, although at a substantially lower
   level than the commensals. Vp, Tf, and Fn showed negligible effects on
   cell viability. These results were consistent with Sg, Ss, and Pg
   activating caspase-3/7. Only Ss significantly increased the levels of
   activated caspase-1, which correlated to IL-1 beta over-expression.
   Conclusions: OEC death processes were differentially induced by oral
   commensal and pathogenic bacteria, with Sg and Ss being more
   pro-apoptotic and pro-pyroptotic than pathogenic bacteria. Oral
   commensal-induced cell death may be a physiological mechanism to manage
   the extent of bacterial colonization of the outer layers of mucosal
   epithelial surfaces. Dysbiosis-related reduction or elimination of
   pro-apoptotic oral bacterial species could contribute to the risk for
   persistent inflammation and tissue destruction.}},

Abstract = {{Resource regimes in postsocialist Laos have been dominated by foreign
   actors in ways that frequently dovetail with the prerogatives of
   multilateral investment and the work of nongovernmental development
   organizations. A common theme among these diverse actors is that the Lao
   government regularly delegates certain kinds of governing activity to
   these foreign actors, resulting in specific territories over which
   foreign organizations can frequently play a dominating role, albeit in
   highly diverse and idiosyncratic ways. Following on Ong's concept of
   graduated sovereignty, I term these governance regimes sustainability
   enclaves, noting that they frequently revolve around resource
   extraction, and that ``sustainability{''} broadly construed
   characterizes contestation over how development should take place.
   Sustainability enclaves are the outcome of a postsocialist policy of
   cautious openness toward foreign actors. They involve specific but
   heterogeneous governance regimes that can and frequently do overlap.
   They often have important effects on the dilemmas of everyday life for
   those who live within their domain, while they also characterize the
   practicalities of state management of foreign organizations operating in
   the country.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the conduct and regulation of intimacy during the COVID-19
   crisis in the Republic of Ireland has uncovered the legacy of Catholic
   nationalism in Irish capitalism. Many commentators analysed the
   increased welfarism and community service provision as the suspension of
   Irish neoliberalism. In fact, the Irish COVID-19 response is shaped by a
   longer tradition of political and economic approaches that have their
   genesis in the revolutionary Catholic state following independence from
   Britain. Based on ethnography of community development practices in a
   rural Irish region, the article describes how Catholic nationalist
   influences are present in the collection of institutions involved in the
   Community Response and its approach to spatial organisation. The
   governance of the response also sheds light on a lack of intimacy
   between citizen and state that is not only the product of neoliberal
   structural adjustments but is uniquely characteristic of the Catholic
   ethos that influences Irish capitalism.}},

Title = {{Do Health Professionals Sufficiently Address Patients' Disposition
   Toward Changing Their Nutritional and Physical Activity Habits? Findings
   from a Pilot Study among People with Type 2 Diabetes in Northern Italy}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to evaluate the disposition of individuals with
   type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) toward changing their nutritional and
   physical activity habits and associated factors-particularly their
   perceptions about interacting and communicating with four health
   professions. Working with a local patients' association, we invited 364
   individuals with DM2, all at least 18 years old, to complete a
   paper-based survey with questions addressing their experiences of
   interacting and communicating with general practitioners, nurses,
   dieticians and diabetologists and about their readiness to change
   targeted habits, their health literacy and their clinical status. Of the
   109 questionnaires collected, 100 were eligible for descriptive and
   inferential statistical analysis. Regarding nutritional habits, the
   highest percentage of participants were at the maintenance stage (26\%),
   whereas regarding physical activity habits the highest percentage of
   participants were at the preparation stage (31\%). Significant
   differences between the habits emerged for four of the five stages and
   for two psychological processes. The precontemplation stage was most
   associated with communication-related variables, whereas the maintenance
   stage was associated with higher health literacy for both habits, and
   waist-to-height ratio was associated with several stages of change and
   psychological processes for physical activity habits. Considering
   aggregated stages (i.e., active or passive stage), significant
   differences were observed for all psychological processes except
   readiness to change nutritional habits. Logistic regression analysis
   revealed associations of the active stage with higher self-efficacy and
   lower discrepancy processes for both habits. Nutritional habits were
   associated with normal HbA1c values and physical activity habits with
   high cholesterol. Understanding the combination of the stages of change
   and how they relate to psychological processes can afford meaningful
   insights into the potential internal and external communication skills
   of health professions and should be examined as possible elements for a
   patient evaluation model.}},

Title = {{Tolerability and effectiveness of every-other-day atorvastatin compared

Abstract = {{Despite limited evidence, non-daily dosing of statins is recommended for
   managing muscle symptoms associated with statin therapy. We assessed the
   tolerability and effectiveness of every-other-day atorvastatin compared
   to daily atorvastatin in patients having muscle symptoms associated with
   atorvastatin therapy. A parallel-group, outcome-assessment-blinded,
   randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Colombo South
   Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. Patients with muscle pain, tenderness or
   cramps alone or in combination for >= 2 weeks while on daily
   atorvastatin for >= 1 month, with no alternative cause, were recruited.
   Patient's regular atorvastatin dose was given every-other-day to those
   in intervention group (IG) and daily to those in control group (CG).
   Primary outcomes were assessed at 24 weeks and included composite of
   myalgia and myositis, LDL-cholesterol level and percentage reduction of
   LDL-cholesterol from baseline. Number recruited was 49 to IG
   (women:79.6\%; mean-age:60.6 +/- 8.7years) and 52 to CG (women:73.1\%;
   mean-age:61.7 +/- 9.8years). Mean atorvastatin dose per day was 8.6 mg
   (SD = 4 mg) and 17.6 mg (SD = 8.4 mg) in IG and CG, respectively.
   Composite of myalgia and myositis at 24 weeks was 79.6\% in IG and
   69.2\% in CG (OR = 1.7, 95\% CI 0.7-4.3; p = 0.234). IG failed to show
   noninferiority for mean LDL-cholesterol (difference:0.31 mmol/L; upper
   limit 97.5\% CI:0.61 mmol/L; p for noninferiority = 0.989) and for mean
   percentage reduction of LDL-cholesterol from baseline
   (difference:3.13\%; upper limit 97.5\% CI:15.5\%; p for noninferiority =
   0.718). At 24 weeks, mean creatine kinase and discomfort due to muscle
   symptoms (assessed with Visual Analogue Scale) were not different
   between the two groups. Findings of this study do not favor
   every-other-day atorvastatin as an option for managing patients with
   muscle symptoms associated with atorvastatin therapy.}},

Abstract = {{T-shaped Deep Cement Mixed (DCM) columns are recently proposed as an
   alternative for conventional DCM columns with large area replacement
   ratios (ARR) over the entire depth. They alleviate the requirement of a
   Load Transfer Platform (LTP) used in conventional DCM column supported
   embankments to reduce the differential settlements and have the capacity
   to reduce the ARR significantly compared to conventional DCM columns.
   T-shaped DCM columns also improve the consolidation performance and
   reduce overall deformations, compared to embankments with conventional
   DCM columns. Therefore T-shaped columns are gaining popularity as an
   efficient alternative for conventional DCM columns in embankment
   construction. However, the performance of T-shaped DCM column-supported
   embankments has not been investigated in detail. Hence, in this study,
   the suitability of T-shaped DCM columns, geosynthetic layers and DCM
   column walls underneath side slopes of highway embankments in reducing
   deformations was investigated. The performance of different geosynthetic
   reinforcement configurations was compared in terms of column efficacy,
   consolidation performance and deformations in the ground. Although DCM
   column walls are generally considered as efficient in reducing lateral
   deformations, results show that T-shaped DCM columns are the most
   efficient in reducing both lateral deformations and settlements. Also,
   the results show that geosynthetic reinforcement is efficient only when
   used with conventional DCM columns with uniform cross sections but not
   with T-shaped DCM columns.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB) involves sequences of responding
   with little variability and no obvious function. RRB is diagnostic for
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a significant feature in several
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite its clinical importance,
   relatively little is known about how RRB is mediated by broader neural
   circuits. In this study, we employed ultra-high field (17.6 Tesla)
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the C58/J mouse model of RRB.
   We determined alterations in brain morphology and connectivity of C58/J
   mice and their relationship to repetitive motor behavior using
   structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to the
   genetically similar C57BL/6 control mouse strain, C58/J mice showed
   evidence of structural alterations in basal ganglia and cerebellar
   networks. In particular, C58/J mice exhibited reduced volumes of key
   cortical and basal ganglia regions that have been implicated in
   repetitive behavior, including motor cortex, striatum, globus pallidus,
   and subthalamic nucleus, as well as volume differences in the
   cerebellum. Moreover, DTI revealed differences in fractional anisotropy
   and axial diffusivity in cerebellar white matter of C58/J mice.
   Importantly, we found that RRB exhibited by C58/J mice was correlated
   with volume of the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and crus II of the
   cerebellum. These regions are key nodes in circuits connecting the basal
   ganglia and cerebellum and our findings implicate their role in RRB,
   particularly the indirect pathway.}},

Title = {{Calibration of Fiber Orientation Simulations for LFT-A New Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Short fiber reinforced thermoplastics (SFT) are extensively used due to
   their excellent mechanical properties and low processing costs. Long
   fiber reinforced thermoplastics (LFT) show an even more interesting
   property profile and are increasingly used for structural parts.
   However, their processing by injection molding is not as simple as for
   SFT, and their anisotropic properties resulting from the fiber
   microstructure (fiber orientation, length, and concentration) pose a
   challenge with regard to the engineering design process. To reliably
   predict the structural mechanical properties of fiber reinforced
   thermoplastics by means of micromechanical models, it is also necessary
   to reliable predict the fiber microstructure. Therefore, it is crucial
   to calibrate the underlying prediction models, such as the fiber
   orientation model, within the process simulation. In general, these
   models may be adjusted manually, but this is usually ineffective and
   time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, a new calibration method was
   developed to automatically calibrate the fiber orientation model
   parameters of the injection molding simulation by means of optimization
   methods. This optimization routine is based on experimentally determined
   fiber orientation distributions and leads to optimized parameters for
   the fiber orientation prediction model within a few minutes. To better
   understand the influence of the model parameters, different versions of
   the fiber orientation model, as well as process and material influences
   on the resulting fiber orientation distribution, were investigated.
   Finally, the developed approach to calibrate the fiber orientation model
   was compared with a classical approach, a direct optimization of the
   whole process simulation. Thereby, the new optimization approach shows a
   calculation time reduced by the factor 15 with comparable error
   variance.}},

   Results: Four scuba divers had episodes of impaired consciousness when
   at shallow depths (8-18 m) underwater. The descriptions of the episodes
   were very similar. Three had histories of recurrent episodes of

Abstract = {{First year is a delicate time for students. Many have little idea what
   to expect of university, and their sense of identity as tertiary
   students is fragile. A diagnostic assessment early in first semester may
   reassure students that they have chosen the right path. However, some
   academics, particularly in engineering, argue that this early assessment
   should be very demanding - so tough, in fact, that some students fail -
   in order to alert students to the hard work required to pass the course.
   This study uses a mixed methods design (weekly surveys and in-depth
   interviews) to explore the effects of a purposefully tough early
   assessment on first year engineering students at an Australian
   university. We find that, across the cohort, the high failure rate was
   not associated with a significant slump or spike in motivation. Although
   some students were initially dismayed by their results, most went on to
   address their study with resilience, and appreciated the ``kick up the
   bum{''}, as they described it.}},

   Perspectives From Water Isotopes}},
Journal = {{PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) is home to the warmest sea surface
   temperatures in the world oceans, favoring strong tropospheric
   convection and heavy rainfall. The mechanisms controlling long-term
   change in the region's hydroclimate are still uncertain. Here, we
   present a 450,000-year record of precipitation delta D from southern
   Sumatra that records a consistent pattern of glacial isotopic enrichment
   and interglacial depletion. We synthesize existing paleo-indicators of
   precipitation delta D and delta O-18 in the IPWP and compare results
   with water isotope-enabled climate simulations of the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM). The simulations show glacial isotopic enrichment over the
   eastern Indian Ocean extending into the southern IPWP and isotopic
   depletion over Southeast Asia, the west Pacific, and Australia. The
   pattern of simulated LGM isotopic change agrees generally well with our
   proxy synthesis. We conclude that reorganization of regional circulation
   under glacial conditions controls precipitation isotope variability in
   the IPWP: Low-level tropospheric convergence dominates the signal in the
   north/east, whereas divergence controls the response in the south/west.
   Additional sensitivity simulations suggest that the LGM ice sheets and
   the associated lowering in sea level, rather than decreased greenhouse
   gases, are responsible for the distinctive spatial pattern in glacial
   changes of precipitation isotopes and hydroclimate across the IPWP.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an innovative method of metal forming of hollow
   flanged elements. In this process, flanges are formed using a movable
   sleeve, which moves in the opposite direction to the punch. The movement
   of the sleeve causes a closed impression to open, due to which the
   flange is also formed in a semi-free impression. The tube billets were
   made of the 42CrMo4 grade steel deformed under the cold metal forming
   conditions. The calculations were conducted using the finite elements
   method in Deform-2D/3D. Various technological parameters of the process
   were analysed, among others the diameter of the flange and the initial
   height of the impression of the movable sleeve. On the basis of the
   obtained results, the limiting phenomena of the process were determined
   and the influence of the analysed technological parameters on these
   phenomena were presented.}},

Abstract = {{Institutions driving fundamental research at the cutting edge such as
   for example from the Max Planck Society (MPS) took steps to optimize
   data management and stewardship to be able to address new scientific
   questions. In this paper we selected three institutes from the MPS from
   the areas of humanities, environmental sciences and natural sciences as
   examples to indicate the efforts to integrate large amounts of data from
   collaborators worldwide to create a data space that is ready to be
   exploited to get new insights based on data intensive science methods.
   For this integration the typical challenges of fragmentation, bad
   quality and also social differences had to be overcome. In all three
   cases, well-managed repositories that are driven by the scientific needs
   and harmonization principles that have been agreed upon in the community
   were the core pillars. It is not surprising that these principles are
   very much aligned with what have now become the FAIR principles. The
   FAIR principles confirm the correctness of earlier decisions and their
   clear formulation identified the gaps which the projects need to
   address.}},

Abstract = {{Concurrent loss-of-function mutations in STK11 and KEAP1 in lung
   adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are associated with aggressive tumor growth,
   resistance to available therapies, and early death. We investigated the
   effects of coordinate STK11 and KEAP1 loss by comparing co-mutant with
   single mutant and wild-type isogenic counterparts in multiple LUAD
   models. STK11/KEAP1 co-mutation results in significantly elevated
   expression of ferroptosis-protective genes, including SCD and
   AKR1C1/2/3, and resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis.
   CRISPR screening further nominates SCD (SCD1) as selectively essential
   in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of
   SCD1 confirms the essentiality of this gene and augments the effects of
   ferroptosis induction by erastin and RSL3. Together these data identify
   SCD1 as a selective vulnerability and a promising candidate for targeted
   drug development in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: South American camelids have become popular with an
   increasing number of breeders in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The
   aim of the present online survey was to gain information concerning
   housing and management of South American camelids, particularly during
   pregnancy and parturition.
   Material and methods: A link to the online survey was sent via email to
   8 breeder associations in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The
   questionnaire included a total of 24 closed or open questions. The
   period for participation was May to October 2019.
   Results: A total of 92 breeders participated and 64 answered all
   questions. The survey revealed that South American camelids were mainly
   used for breeding (87 \%) and production of fibre (74 \%). The median
   flock size was 27 animals, mainly females. Most breeders (74 \%)
   acquired their knowledge on South American camelids via personal
   contacts and advanced training courses. The majority (57 \%) mated their
   females with an own sire that is kept separately. Using teaser males was
   the most popular pregnancy test (91 \%), often combined with other
   techniques, especially ultrasonography. In most mares (88 \%) duration
   of pregnancy was in the normal range of 335-360 days. Repeated problems
   with loss of pregnancy were reported by 76 \% of breeders for less than
   5 \% of their mares. Postpartum problems occurred sporadically, e. g.
   lack of milk or mastitis (each < 5 \%). Problems with the cria at
   parturition within the last 3 years were reported by > 50 \% of the
   breeders, but reported reasons for dystocia showed no clear focus. The
   majority of the participants (69 \%) were satisfied with the veterinary
   care in general and in the fields of pregnancy and obstetrics.
   Conclusion: The results of this survey provide new insights into the
   management practices of South American camelids breeders in Austria,
   Germany and Switzerland. Further studies could compare these practices
   with those in countries where breeding of South American camelids
   possesses a longer tradition and different commercial backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of
   Lactobacillus sakei (L. sakei) ADM14 administration in a high-fat
   diet-induced obese mouse model and the resulting changes in the
   intestinal microbiota. Prior to in vivo testing, L. sakei ADM14 was
   shown to inhibit adipogenesis through in vitro test and genetic
   analysis. Subsequently, mice were orally administered 0.85\% saline
   supplemented or not with L. sakei ADM14 to high-fat diet group and
   normal diet group daily. The results showed that administration of L.
   sakei ADM14 reduced weight gain, epididymal fat expansion, and total
   blood cholesterol and glucose levels, and significantly decreased
   expression of lipid-related genes in the epididymal fat pad.
   Administration of L. sakei ADM14 showed improvement in terms of energy
   harvesting while restoring the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and
   also increased the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa such as
   Bacteroides faecichinchillae and Alistipes, which are abundant in
   non-obese people. L. sakei ADM14 affected the modulation of gut
   microbiota, altered the strain profile of short-chain fatty acid
   production in the cecum and enhanced the stimulation of butyrate
   production. Overall, L. sakei ADM14 showed potential as a therapeutic
   probiotic supplement for metabolic disorders, confirming the positive
   changes of in vivo indicators and controlling gut microbiota in a
   high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the writings of Kuang Qizhao and other Chinese
   self-strengtheners suggests that their emphasis on promoting education
   before democracy and continuing to endorse classical Confucianism were
   not signs of a retrograde kind of conservatism, but an entirely rational
   decision based on the actual experiences of late Qing observers of 19th
   Century American democracy. Observing the U.S. Congress's passage of the
   Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Chinese officials observed the real
   dangers of demagogue led populism without an educated, moral citizenry
   and the apparent importance of Christianity to creating the moral
   foundation for an effective modern society. For Kuang, Confucianism was
   equivalent to Christianity to establish that moral basis, and not a
   conservative desire to preserve the old social order. Kuang would pass
   on his thoughts to some of China's most important reformers and
   officials on his return home, suggesting he and the officials he
   associated with had a more realistic and sophisticated understanding of
   American society and democracy than is currently assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer augmentation by swirling impinging jets delivered through
   twisted tetra-lobed nozzles (T-LT) is reported. Impinging jets delivered
   through a circular nozzle (CT: non-swirling jet) and a tetra-lobed
   nozzle (LT: non-swirling jet) were also tested for comparison.
   Experimental results showed that Nusselt numbers of impinging jets
   delivered through all nozzles were increased with Re and decreasing
   L/D-h. At a given jet Reynolds number (Re) and a jet-to-plate spacing
   (L/D-h), the impinging jets delivered through the twisted tetra-lobed
   nozzles and tetra-lobed nozzle yielded superior heat transfer to that
   delivered by a circular nozzle. For the jets delivered through the
   twisted tetra-lobed nozzles, the stagnation Nusselt number (Nu) was
   decreased while the radial heat transfer distribution was improved with
   decreasing twist ratios of the nozzle. For the investigated range, the
   jet delivered through the twisted tetra-lobed nozzle with twist ratio of
   4.0 yielded a maximal average Nusselt number. Furthermore, the twisted
   tetra-lobed nozzles (T-LT) with twist ratios of y/D-h = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0
   and 5.0 generate higher heat transfer rates than those of the circular
   nozzle (CT: non-swirling jet) by around 27.7\%, 25.0\%, 21.6\% and
   19.3\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial fragmentation occurs during the apoptosis. Dynamin-related
   protein 1 (Drp1) acts as an important component in mitochondrial fission
   machinery and can regulate various biological processes including
   apoptosis, cell cycle, and proliferation. The present study demonstrates
   that dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics plays a pivotal role in
   cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting the mitochondrial fission with
   the specific inhibitor (Mdivi-1) did not affect apoptotic cell death in
   low concentrations (<10 mu M). Interestingly, mdivi-1 enhanced
   cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells.
   Particularly in the presence of mdivi-1, several human cancer cell
   lines, including renal carcinoma cell line Caki-1, became vulnerable to
   cisplatin by demonstrating the traits of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis.
   Combined treatment induced downregulation of c-FLIP expression
   transcriptionally, and ectopic expression of c-FLIP attenuated combined
   treatment-induced apoptotic cell death with mdivi-1 plus cisplatin.
   Collectively, our data provide evidence that mdivi-1 might be a
   cisplatin sensitizer.}},

Abstract = {{In 2015, the Pritzker School of Medicine experienced increasing student
   interest in the changing sociopolitical landscape of the United States
   and the interaction of these events with student and patient identity.
   To address this interest, an Identity and Inclusion Steering Committee
   was formed and formally charged with ``providing ongoing direction for
   programs and/or curricula at Pritzker that support an inclusive learning
   environment and promote respectful and effective communication with
   diverse patients and colleagues around issues of identity.{''} The
   authors describe this committee's structure and steps taken by the
   committee to create an inclusive community of students at Pritzker
   characterized by learning through civil discourse. Initiatives were
   guided by a strategy of continuous quality improvement consisting of
   regular iterative evaluation, ongoing school-wide engagement, and
   responsiveness to issues and concerns as they emerged. Data collected
   over the committee's 4-year existence demonstrate significant
   improvement in students' sense of inclusion and respect for different
   perspectives on issues related to identity, such as access to health
   care, racialized medicine, safe spaces, and nursing labor strikes. The
   authors discuss several principles that support the development of an
   inclusive community of students as well as challenges to the
   implementation of such programming. They conclude that a strategy of
   continuous quality improvement guided by values of social justice,
   tolerance, and civil discourse can build community inclusion and enhance
   medical training for the care of diverse patient populations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{From previous investigations it has been shown that there exists
   healthy-appearing articular cartilage that contains collagen fibril
   network destructuring. It is hypothesised that such sub-micron scale
   destructuring not only presents an increased vulnerability to tissue
   scale damage following impact loading, but an increase in cell death as
   well.
   Cartilage-on-bone blocks from 12 patellae, six healthy (G0) and the
   other six with sub-micron fibrillar destructuring (G1), were obtained
   and subject to 2.3 J impact loading. Two sets of sub-samples were
   obtained for each block tested. One set was used to examine for the
   live/dead cell response using calcein-AM and propidium iodide staining,
   imaged with confocal microscopy. The tissue microstructural matrix was
   imaged from the other matched set, unstained and in its fully hydrated
   state, using differential interference contrast optical light
   mi-croscopy. High speed imaging of the impact was used to calculate the
   velocity changes or coefficient of restitution (COR) and used as a proxy
   of energy that the tissue absorbed. A previously defined tissue matrix
   damage score was used to quantify the extent of fracturing and cracking
   in the matrix. The cell death (PCD) was counted and presented as a
   percentage against all cells live plus dead.
   The energy absorbed was 36.5\% higher in G1 than in G0 (p = 0.034).
   However, the damage score and PCD of samples in the G1 group was much
   larger than the G0 group, similar to 300\% and 161\% respectively.
   Microscopy showed that cell death is associated to both matrix
   compaction and further fibrillar destructuring from the ECM to the
   territorial matrix regions of the chondron.
   Following impact loading, cartilage tissue that appears normal but
   contains sub-micron fibrillar matrix destructuring responds with
   significantly increased cell death.}},

   has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous
   studies.
   Objective: We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized
   controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment,
   dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size.
   To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant
   mental health and well-being.
   Methods: Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support
   (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a
   feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with
   people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme
   immediately (intervention group {[}IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list
   (wait-list control group {[}WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
   Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety,
   mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online
   questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram.
   Results: All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from
   MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data
   collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the
   IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data
   collection was completed by the end of August 2020.
   Conclusions: This feasibility study will provide data to inform the
   design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the
   digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands
   of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers
   during these unprecedented times.}},

Title = {{The landscape of kinase domain duplication in Chinese lung cancer
   patients}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Kinase domain duplication (KDD) is a special type of large
   genomic rearrangement (LGR), occurring in the kinase domain of protein
   kinase genes. KDD of some lung cancer driver genes, such as EGFR-KDD,
   has been identified and implicated to be oncogenic in non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aims to interrogate the spectrum
   of KDD occurring on classic driver genes in Chinese lung cancer patients
   without the presence of classic lung cancer driver mutations.
   Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 10,525 Chinese lung cancer patients
   who met the following inclusion criteria; (I) do not carry classic lung
   cancer driver mutations in any of the 8 driver genes and (II) tyrosine
   kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naive. Capture-based targeted sequencing was
   performed on tissue or plasma samples. LGR and KDD were identified by
   using in-house analysis scripts. The prevalence and distribution of LGR
   and KDD in our cohort were analyzed.
   Results: The median age of the cohort was 64 years with 68.7\% being
   male. Among all patients, 23.2\% and 51.8\% were diagnosed with stage
   III and IV disease respectively. We identified 43 cases (0.41\%)
   harboring LGR in one of the driver genes
   (EGFR/ERBB2/ALK/RET/ROS1/MET/BRAF), with 24 (0.23\%) patients harboring
   KDD. Of the patients harboring KDD, a majority (n=19) harbored canonical
   EGFR-KDD involving exons 18-25, whilst one patient harbored duplications
   of EGFR exons 18-26. There were three MET-KDD patients; in two, the
   alteration occurred in exons 15-21 and in one, the alteration occurred
   in exons 3-21. One patient harbored RET-KDD involving exons 12-18. KDD
   showed a comparable prevalence in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung
   squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (0.33\% vs. 0.11\%, P=0.118). Nineteen
   non-KDD LGRs, spanning six genes including EGFR (n=6), MET (n=3), ALK
   (n=4), ROS1 (n=2), ERBB2 (n=2) and BRAF (n=2), were found, each
   occurring in one patient. The prevalence of LGR in LUADs and LUSCs was
   comparable (0.55\% vs. 0.38\%, P=0.452).
   Conclusions: We observed a prevalence of 0.41\% and 0.23\% for LGR and
   KDD, respectively. Twenty-four different LGR alterations, including 5
   KDDs and 19 non-KDD LGRs, were observed. KDDs mainly occurred in EGFR
   involving exons 18-25 and non-KDD LGRs were distributed more randomly.
   The prevalence of LGR/KDD in LUSCs and LUADs was comparable.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly growing distributed renewable networks make an increasing demand
   for various types of power converters to feed different loads. Power
   converters with constant power load (CPL) are one typical configuration
   that can degrade the stability of the power conversion system due to the
   negative impedance characteristic. This article presents a nonlinear
   analysis method using the developed complete-cycle solution matrix
   method by transforming the original linear time-variant system into a
   summation of segmented linear time-invariant systems. Thus, the
   stability of the nonlinear system can be studied using a series of the
   corresponding state transition matrix and saltation matrix. As this
   derived matrix contains all the comprehensive information relating to
   the systems stability, the influence of the CPL to systems
   fast-timescale stability in both continuous conduction mode and the
   discontinuous conduction mode can be fully investigated and analyzed.
   The phenomena of the fast-timescale instability around switching
   frequency for power converters with a CPL are observed and investigated
   numerically. Finally, experimental results have proven the analysis and
   verified the effectiveness of the developed method.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the small-signal stability of voltage-controlled
   modular multilevel converters (MMCs) feeding linear ac systems. By using
   the harmonic state-space (HSS) modeling method, the ac-side impedance
   matrices (IMs) of the MMC with the open-loop and closed-loop voltage
   control are derived and their relationship is also explicitly given. It
   is revealed that the ac voltage regulator has the same effect on the
   centered diagonal element of the IM of the MMC as that of two-level
   voltage-source converters (VSCs). Moreover, when the MMC is feeding
   linear ac loads, the return-ratio matrix of the cascaded system has an
   eigenvalue that is equal to the ratio between the centered diagonal
   element of the IM of the MMC and the load impedance, which,
   consequently, facilitates the stability evaluation by checking that
   single-input single-output impedance ratio as a necessary condition.
   These findings also provide physical insights into the subsynchronous
   oscillation (SSO) of the voltage-controlled MMC with the
   proportional-resonant (PR) regulator, and a
   proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) regulator is further introduced to
   mitigate the SSO. Finally, time-domain simulations verify the
   effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{With its potential versatility and reliability, the space-air-ground
   integrated vehicular network (SAGVN) is envisioned as a promising
   solution to deliver quality vehicular services anywhere at any time.
   This article proposes a software defined framework for SAGVN to achieve

   applications and research challenges in resource management are
   identified. Then we propose a hybrid and hierarchical SAGVN control
   architecture to balance the trade-off between system status acquisition
   and signaling overhead in different scenarios. Considering the dynamic
   networking environment with multi-dimensional resources and diverse
   services, it is challenging to make optimal resource management
   decisions in real time; thus, artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   engineering solutions are investigated to facilitate efficient network
   slicing, mobility management, and cooperative content caching and
   delivery. A trace-driven case study is presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed SAGVN framework with AI-based methods in
   increasing the SAGVN throughput performance.}},

Abstract = {{It is more practical and efficient to deploy sensors in critical areas
   rather than common areas to ensure indoor positioning accuracy and
   reduce deployment cost. This study focused on the sensor placement
   optimization for critical-grid coverage problem with two objectives:
   accuracy and cost. After reviewing some related works, this article
   proposed a multi-objective optimization model for critical-grid coverage
   problem of indoor positioning considering k-coverage problem as well as
   the topological rationality of sensor distribution. Then, NSGA-II
   algorithm was used to solve the optimizing model of sensor placement. At
   last, the simulation experiment and real environment validation were
   conducted for proposed method. The results showed that the optimized
   schemes obtain a lower error (1.13, 1.21 m) and a higher reduction of
   sensor deployment cost than the uniform deployment scheme (1.44 m). As a
   conclusion, the proposed method could reduce the cost of sensor
   deployment while ensuring the accuracy of indoor positioning for
   critical areas. It also provides a new direction for improving the
   accuracy of indoor positioning.}},

Abstract = {{Homeobox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is a long non-coding RNA
   associated with a number of fibrosis-related diseases. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the specific role of HOTAIR in the development
   of endometrial fibrosis and to identify the molecular mechanisms
   underlying this process. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of
   HOTAIR in samples of intrauterine adhesion (IUA) tissue and in
   endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) that had been treated with transforming
   growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Additionally, we transfected ESCs
   with either overexpression plasmid (pcDNA-HOTAIR) or silencing construct
   (si-HOTAIR) and then treated these cells with TGF-beta 1. We then
   performed RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, along with cell
   proliferation and apoptosis assays, to investigate the effects of HOTAIR
   on the transdifferentiation of ESCs into myofibroblasts. The results
   showed that the expression levels of HOTAIR were significantly elevated
   in IUA tissue and in ESCs that had been treated with TGF-beta 1. The
   overexpression of HOTAIR had a pro-fibrotic effect on ESCs, while the
   silencing of HOTAIR exerted an anti-fibrotic effect. Most importantly,
   the protein expression levels of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 were significantly
   upregulated in TGF-beta 1-treated ESCs transfected with pcDNA-HOTAIR and
   were downregulated after transfection with si-HOTAIR constructs. These
   data indicate that HOTAIR promotes endometrial fibrosis by activating
   the TGF-beta 1/Smad signaling pathway, suggesting that the inhibition of
   HOTAIR may represent a promising therapeutic option for suppressing
   endometrial fibrosis.}},

   array with oxide semiconductor channel access transistor in 3-D stack,
   achieved uniform memory characteristics of 1T1R cells at each layer, and
   demonstrated basic functionality of XNOR operation as in-memory
   computing for binary neural network (BNN) artificial intelligence (AI)
   applications. The integrated TiN/Ti/HfO2/Ti stack RRAM shows high on/off
   ratio with stable retention and endurance properties. The indium gallium
   zinc oxide (IGZO) channel field-effect transistor (FET) works as an
   access transistor, which realized the low-temperature process, high
   mobility, and high drive current for RRAM. With the peripheral circuit,
   we demonstrate the XNOR operation using a pair of 1T1R cells. The impact
   of RRAM bit error rate on neural network is also investigated, which
   indicates the property of error-resilience in BNN. The 3-D neural
   network built by this architecture has high potential to enable
   area-efficient, low-power, and low-latency computing.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, wood vinegar from cotton straw pyrolysis was chosen as a
   passivating agent in order to investigate the effect of its
   physico-chemical properties on the solid products of cattle manure
   during composting. The experimental results showed that the compost
   entered a high-temperature period two days earlier than a control
   sample, with an increase of more than seven days in the duration of the
   high temperature period after cotton straw vinegar treatment. The effect
   of exchangeable passivation on the heavy metal Cu increased
   significantly with the increase in the proportion of wood vinegar
   solution. The best passivation effect on Cu was 32.28\%, at a wood
   vinegar concentration of 0.65\% (v/v). This value was 18.88\% higher
   than without wood vinegar addition. The passivation effect on the heavy
   metal Zn was inhibited at about 0.5\% (v/v) wood vinegar. At a
   concentration of 0.65\% wood vinegar, the maximum passivation reached
   26.29\%. We conclude that cotton straw wood vinegar improved the
   temperature rise, high temperature duration and heavy metal passivation
   effect on cattle manure composting.}},

Title = {{Analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in endangered
   Populus wulianensis based on 18 newly developed EST-SSR markers}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Populus wulianensis is an endangered tree species endemic to Shandong
   Province, China. Genetic diversity assessments represent the basis and a
   prerequisite for protecting endangered species. In our study, a total of
   116 individuals of P. wulianensis from 4 extant populations (3 wild
   populations and 1 artificial population that covered the entire
   geographic distribution of the species) were analyzed using 18 expressed
   sequence tag simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers to assess their
   genetic diversity and population structure. The 18 EST-SSR markers had
   high levels of polymorphisms (PIC = 0.698), and 202 alleles were
   amplified. The present study revealed high genetic diversity at the
   population level (Na = 4.847, NR = 3.000, HS = 0.624, HE = 0.611, I
   =1.114, and PPL = 98.6\%) and the species level (HT = 0.741). Private
   alleles were detected in all four populations (including the artificial
   population JYS). Negative inbreeding coefficients (FIS<0) indicated that
   the populations of P. wulianensis produced too many heterozygotes due to
   outbreeding and that there might be a risk of outbreeding depression.
   The AMOVA results showed that 19.05\% and 80.95\% of the total variation
   occurred among and within populations, respectively. Obvious genetic
   differentiation between populations (FST = 0.191) and a high level of
   gene flow (Nm = 2.566) were detected, indicating that gene flow is not
   the main cause of genetic differentiation among populations. The results
   of UPGMA cluster analysis, PCoA and structure analysis (DK = 4) showed
   that the 4 populations were clustered into four groups and suggested
   that the natural population ZHS gave rise to the artificial population
   JYS. The genetic bottleneck analysis results suggested that three
   populations (ZHS, JXS and JYS) recently experienced bottleneck events.
   These genetic results are of great significance for scientifically
   formulating conservation strategies for endangered P. wulianensis. (C)

   Theory and Experimental Evidence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new anti-doping policy. In a conditional pension
   scheme, athletes have to pay a fraction of their proceeds from sports
   into a fund from which they can draw only well after their careers and
   if they have never been caught doping. Theoretically, this fund has two
   important advantages over conventional anti-doping policies such as bans
   and fines. It does not lose its deterrence effect when athletes approach
   the end of their careers (unlike bans), and it can deal with the
   widespread problem that drug cheats are often only found out much later
   when the detection technology has caught up with doping practices. We
   theoretically compare this new scheme with traditional anti-doping
   measures. Since empirical tests in the field are infeasible, we run
   laboratory experiments to compare the effectiveness of fines, bans and
   conditional pension funds.}},

Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the system and conversion of cellulose allomorphs,
   cellulose III nanocrystals (CNC-III) were used to investigate the
   crystalline stability of cellulose III in the hydrothermal condition and
   a lower concentrated NaOH-water system. It was shown that H2O or alkali
   played an important role in the process of polymorphic transformation.
   The CNC-III allomorph turned back to cellulose I with an extremely low
   crystallinity (similar to 4.18 \%) during hydrothermal process at 90-95
   degrees C, or cellulose II when the temperature excessed boiling point
   (>= 100 degrees C). Furthermore, CNC-III could be rapidly dissolved in
   an aqueous NaOH (similar to 7 wt.\%) without a precooled treatment to
   obtain its stable solution. Afterwards, cellulose II with a steady
   average crystallite size (similar to 34) was acquired after the
   regeneration process via dialysis with distilled water. The polymorphic
   transformation was also analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state
   C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR).}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have prepared peptide-functionalized metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) as signal-amplifying tags for the detection of
   secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). Furthermore,
   enzyme-MOF nanocomposites are fabricated via a coprecipitation strategy
   between horse radish pemxidase (HRP) and ZIF-90, where ZIF-90 is used as
   a protective support for HRP immobilization. Meanwhile, the peptide
   sequence has been designed as SPARC-binding peptide, which imparts
   biorecognition functionality to HRP@ZIF-90 for performing a colorimetric
   sensor. Therefore, during the test, HRP molecules can be quickly
   released from nanocomposites by acidic condition to catalyze chmmogenic
   reaction, enabling the ultrasensitive detection of SPARC with a low
   detection limit of 30 fg/mL. Moreover, the content of SPARC in colon
   cancer tissues with different degrees of differentiation can be
   determined with this sensor, demonstrating that the expression of SPARC
   is closely related to the occurrence, invasion and metastasis of human
   colon cancer. These results may show the potential applications of this
   biosensor in SPARC fundamental research as well as clinical diagnosis in
   the future.}},

   Crowd Sourcing Spatiotemporal Data}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid development of LBSs (location-based services) in recent
   years, researchers have increasingly taken an interest in trying to make
   travel routes more practicable and individualized. Despite the fact that
   many studies have been conducted on routes using LBS data, the specific
   routes are deficient in dynamic scalability and the correlations between
   environmental constraints and personal choices have not been
   investigated. This paper proposes an improved HMM-based (hidden Markov
   model) method for planning personalized routes with crowd sourcing
   spatiotemporal data. It tries to integrate the dynamic public
   preferences, the individual interests and the physical road network
   space in the same spatiotemporal framework, ensuring that reasonable
   routes will be generated. A novel dual-layer mapping structure has been
   proposed to bridge the gap from brief individual preferences to specific
   entries of POIs (points-of-interest) inside realistic road networks. A
   case study on Changsha city has proven that the proposed method can not
   only flexibly plan people's travel routes under different spatiotemporal
   backgrounds but also is close to people's natural selection by the
   perception of the group.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative chemical vapor sublimation and deposition (CVSD) process
   was shown to produce nanoscale anisotropic hybrid materials. Taking
   advantage of controlled thermodynamic properties and the mass transfer
   of molecules, this process allowed for water vapor sublimation from an
   iced template/substrate and stagewise vapor deposition of
   poly-p-xylylene onto the sublimating ice substrate. In this study, the
   use of sensitive soybean agglutinin (SBA) protein tubes was demonstrated
   as an example to prepare the anisotropic hybrid material based on the
   CVSD process. The rationale of a timing parameter, Delta t, was
   controlled to program the sublimation of the SBA-ice templates and the
   deposition of poly-p-xylylene during the CVSD process. As a result of
   this control, a stripping stage occurred, during which SBA tubes were
   exposed on the particle surface, and a subsequent encapsulation stage
   enabled the transformation of the ice templates into a nanometer-sized
   anisotropic hybrid material of poly-p-xylylene as the matrix with
   encapsulated SBA tubes. The timing parameter Delta t and the controlled
   stripping and encapsulating stages during CVSD represent a
   straightforward and intriguing mechanism stemming from physical
   chemistry fundamentals for the fabrication of hybrid materials from
   sensitive molecules and with predetermined sizes and asymmetrical
   shapes. A simulation analysis showed consistency with the experimental
   results and controllability of the timing mechanism with predictable
   particle sizes.}},

Title = {{Potential of gut microbiome for detection of autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro developmental disorder
   characterized by a series of abnormal social behaviors. The increasing
   prevalence of ASD has led to the discovery of a correlation with the
   intestinal microbiome in many studies. In our research, we evaluated 297
   subjects, including 169 individuals with ASD and 128 neurotypical
   subjects, from the Sequence Read Archive database. We conducted a series
   of analyses, including alpha-diversity, phylogenetic profiles, and
   functional profiles, to explore the correlation between the gut
   microbiome and ASD. The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated
   that ASD and neurotypical subjects could be divided based on the
   unweighted UniFrac distance. The genera Prevotella, Roseburia,
   Ruminococcus, Megasphaera, and Catenibacterium might be biomarkers of
   ASD after linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) evaluation
   and Random Forest analysis, respectively. The functional analysis found
   six significant pathways between ASD and neurotypical subjects,
   including oxidative phosphorylation, nucleotide excision repair,
   peptidoglycan biosynthesis, photosynthesis, photosynthesis proteins, and
   two-component system. Based on these alterations of the intestinal
   microbiome in ASD subjects, we developed four machine learning models:
   random forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), kernelized support
   vector machines with the RBF kernel (SVMs), and Decision trees (DT).
   Notably, the RF model after RF selection was superior, with an F1 score
   of 0.74 and area under the curve of 0.827(0.004), suggesting the
   reliability and generalizability of predictive model. Besides, the
   validation performance of RF model after RF selection could be
   0.75(0.01) on external cohort collected by our laboratory. Our study
   advances the understanding of human gut microbiome in ASD that designing
   and evaluating microbially based interventions of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of spatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) was
   conceived over 100 years ago, first in the form of GRID, which has been
   applied to clinical practice since its early inception and continued to
   the present even with markedly improved instrumentation in radiation
   therapy. LATTICE radiation therapy (LRT) was introduced in 2010 as a
   conceptual 3D extension of GRID therapy with several uniquely different
   features. Since 2014, when the first patient was treated, over 150
   patients with bulky tumors worldwide have received LRT. Through a brief
   review of the basic principles and the analysis of the collective
   clinical experience, a set of technical recommendations and guidelines
   are proposed for the clinical implementation of LRT. It is to be
   recognized that the current clinical practice of SFRT (GRID or LRT) is
   still largely based on the heuristic principles. With advancements in
   basic biological research and the anticipated clinical trials to
   systemically assess the efficacy and risk, progressively robust
   optimizations of the technical parameters are essential for the broader
   application of SFRT in clinical practice. (C) 2020 by Radiation Research

Abstract = {{The endogenous rutin-degrading enzymes (RDEs) in Tartary buckwheat (TB)
   considerably limit the development of TB functional foods. In this
   study, three thermal treatments, including superheated steam(SS),
   saturated steam(ST), and far-infrared drying (FID), were used to
   inactivate RDEs in TB. Results showed that SS and ST could efficiently
   inactivate RDEs, whereas FID could not. The extractable rutin contents
   in TB were increased by 52.3\% and 12.3\% by SS and ST, respectively,
   with 90 s of treatment time. Furthermore, the properties of phenolics
   and starch were used to evaluate the influence of thermal inactivation
   on TB. Results showed that the soluble phenolic compounds contents in TB
   were significantly improved (p < 0.05) by SS. The bound phenolic
   compounds contentswere decreased after SS and ST treatments. The change
   in antioxidant propertieswas consistent with that of phenolics and
   flavonoids. Besides, the starch in SS- and ST-treated TB achenes had
   higher relative crystallinity, setback, transition temperatures, rapidly
   digestible starch, and slowly digestible starch contents, but a lower
   ratio of 1047 cm(-1)/1022 cm(-1), peak viscosity, breakdown,
   gelatinization enthalpy, and resistant starch contents, than native TB
   starch. In conclusion, SS was a better method for the inactivation of
   RDEs than ST. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is considered a
   potential approach for promoting tissue regeneration. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of Matrix Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) on bone
   marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and its mechanism. Our results
   showed that knockdown of MMP-1 impeded scratch closure, attenuated
   proliferation, inhibited ALP activity, ALP denser staining and
   mineralization in vitro, and decreased expression of RUNX2, OSX, OPN and
   OCN in BMSCs, while 20 ng/mL recombinant human MMP-1 protein (rhMMP-1)
   significantly accelerated scratch closure, enhanced proliferation, ALP
   activity, ALP denser staining and mineralization in vitro, and increased
   expression of RUNX2, OSX, OPN and OCN. In addition, knockdown of MMP-1
   inhibited the expression of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase
   (p-JNK) and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases
   (p-ERK), while 20 ng/mL rhMMP-1 increased the expression of p-JNK and
   p-ERK in BMSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
   and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) by their inhibitor
   SP600125 and PD98059 dramatically blocked MMP-1-enhanced ALP activity
   and mineralization in BMSCs. Our results revealed that MMP-1 could
   accelerate the osteogenic differentiation potentials of BMSCs via the
   JNK and ERK pathway, providing the mechanism underlying MSC biology and
   identifying a potential target for improving bone tissue regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic performances of activated alumina and its supported alkali
   metal carbonate catalysts for the reaction of thiophenol with dimethyl
   carbonate to prepare thioanisole (PhSMe) were investigated on a fixed
   bed reactor under the condition of atmospheric pressure. The properties
   of activated alumina and its loading alkali metal carbonate catalysts
   were characterized via IR, BET and XRD. The effect of loading amount of
   alkali metal carbonate, calcination temperature, reaction temperature
   and liquid volume hourly space velocity (LVHSV) of reactants on the
   catalytic performances of the catalysts was also examined. The yield of
   PhSMe was 93.5\% when activated alumina was used as catalyst alone at
   120 degrees C, however, the catalytic activities of the catalysts after
   loading 5-15 wt\% K2CO3 were greatly improved, and the yield of PhSMe
   was 99-100\%. Compared to activated alumina, the catalytic performances
   of catalysts after loading different alkali metal carbonate are greatly
   improved. The improvement of catalytic performance can be attributed to
   that carbonate may occupy the Lewis acid sites of the activated alumina
   surface, making it easier for the catalyst to activate thiophenol, thus
   giving benzenethiolate a stronger nucleophilic attack ability. The
   results of FTIR analysis show that the characteristic peaks of carbonate
   are blue shifted, also indicating that carbonate reacted with the
   surface of activated alumina. The Lewis basic site on the surface of the
   activated alumina is believed to play a crucial role.}},

Title = {{Detecting substrate glycans of fucosyltransferases with

Journal = {{GLYCOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{970-980}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Like sialylation, fucose usually locates at the nonreducing ends of
   various glycans on glycoproteins and constitutes important glycan
   epitopes. Detecting the substrate glycans of fucosyltransferases is
   important for understanding how these glycan epitopes are regulated in
   response to different growth conditions and external stimuli. Here we
   report the detection of these glycans on glycoproteins as well as in
   their free forms via enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated
   fucose using FUT2, FUT6, FUT7, FUT8 and FUT9. Specifically, we describe
   the detection of the substrate glycans of these enzymes on fetal bovine
   fetuin, recombinant H1N1 viral neuraminidase and therapeutic antibodies.
   The detected glycans include complex and high-mannose N-glycans. By
   establishing a series of precursors for the synthesis of Lewis X and
   sialyl Lewis X structures, we not only provide convenient
   electrophoresis methods for studying glycosylation but also demonstrate
   the substrate specificities and some kinetic features of these enzymes.
   Our results support the notion that fucosyltransferases are key targets
   for regulating the synthesis of Lewis X and sialyl Lewis X structures.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured catalysts based on porous aluminum oxide (PAO) and some
   3d metals, such as: nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum, have been obtained
   by anodic oxidation and impregnation. The synthesis of porous aluminum
   oxide with a highly ordered pore structure with pore sizes of 50 nm and
   a thickness of 50 mu m is carried out by the method of two-stage anodic
   oxidation. The catalysts are obtained by impregnation of 3d metals into
   nanosized pores of aluminum oxide. The obtained catalysts based on
   nickel and porous Al2O3 are studied by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM-EDX). The results of SEM-EDX analysis shows that a spongy structure
   with filament sizes of 100 nanometers containing particles of 3d metals
   formed on the surface of the aluminum oxide matrix. The results are
   presented on the activity of nickel and heterogenic cobalt and
   molybdenum nanoparticles in the reaction of hydrogenation of hexene to
   hexane. The results show that the yield temperature of the hexane is
   decreased and the yield of hexane is observed at 200 degrees C with
   Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, and a similar yield of hexane mass is achieved at
   temperatures higher than 250 degrees C with Co-Mo/Al(2)O(3 )and

   fraction correlates with the critical cooling rate, which is a widely

   guide for searching and screening for good glass formers.}},

Abstract = {{The safety psychology of marine pilots affects their operational
   pilotage behaviour. This paper aims to analyze how social cognition
   (i.e. attitude and perception) and personality traits (i.e. risk
   tolerance) of marine pilots affect their safety behaviour through
   Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Primary sample data is obtained by a
   survey from the pilots of the Shanghai port, with total of 306 collected
   results. The results indicate the safety behaviour of marine pilots
   concerning that 1) the hazardous attitude has a significant positive
   effect; 2) risk tolerance has an indirect influence; and 3) risk
   perception has both direct and indirect impacts. Based on this finding,
   the managerial implications for pilotage safety include that 1) the
   reduction of the level of hazardous attitude of marine pilots can
   improve the safety behaviour of marine pilots, 2) the level of risk
   perception can increase through psychological training and safety
   education, which is beneficial to comprise the possible effect of
   increased ability by pilot skill training on risk tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the factors associated with table tennis performance may
   provide training information for competitive athletes and guide the
   general population for active participation. The purpose was to compare
   the joint, racket, and ball kinematics between the shakehand and penhold
   grips in table tennis forehand and backhand strokes when returning
   topspin and backspin balls in advanced male players. Nine penhold-grip
   players and 18 matched shakehand-grip players performed forehand and
   backhand strokes when returning topspin and backspin balls using their
   habitual grip styles, while the kinematics of the trunk, upper
   extremities, racket, and ball were collected. Racket angles were
   calculated as the relative motion of the racket to the forearm. For the
   forehand strokes, no significant differences were observed for ball or
   racket velocities between the two grips. The shakehand grip tended to
   demonstrate greater shoulder external rotation angles compared to the
   penhold grip. The shakehand grip resulted in racket flexion angular
   velocity compared to racket extension velocity for the penhold grip. For
   the backhand strokes, greater ball and racket velocities were observed
   for the shakehand grip. The shakehand grip generally demonstrated
   decreased final trunk left rotation angles, increased trunk right
   rotation angular velocities, decreased final shoulder abduction angles,
   increased shoulder adduction angular velocities, and increased forearm
   supination angular velocities. The two grips demonstrated similar peak
   racket and ball velocities but different shoulder rotation range of
   motion and racket motion in forehand strokes. The penhold grips resulted
   in decreased peak racket and ball velocities in backhand strokes, likely
   due to its decreased shoulder, elbow, and forearm motion and less
   aligned longitudinal axes between the racket and forearm. These findings
   may help understand the dominance of the shakehand grip over the penhold
   grip in elite athletes and provide information for grip selection,
   technique improvements, and exercise training.}},

Title = {{Extended pi-conjugated N-containing heteroaromatic hexacarboxylate
   organic anode for high performance rechargeable batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{303-311}},

Abstract = {{Organic electrode materials are desirable for green and sustainable
   Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their light-weight, low cost, abundance
   and multi-electron transfer reactions during battery operation. However,
   the successful utilization of organic electrodes is hindered by their
   poor electrical conductivity and low cyclic stability. Herein, a facile
   synthesis of pi-conjugated N-containing heteroaromatic hexacarboxylate
   (Li-6-HAT) compound and its electrochemical performance as an anode
   material in LIBs is reported. The as-synthesized Li-6-HAT electrode
   renders an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1126.3 mAh g(-1) at the current
   density of 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, pi-conjugated N-containing
   heteroaromatic center provide excellent reversibility of (de)lithiation
   process, resulting in excellent capacity retention. Furthermore, a
   combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in-situ
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) characterization reveal that the pi-conjugated
   nitrogen and carboxyl oxygen act as electrochemically active sites
   during the charge/discharge process. The current work provides novel
   insights into the charge storage mechanism of organic electrodes and
   opens up avenues for further development and utilization of organic
   electrodes in Li-ion batteries. (c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian

   based on data fusion}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{113-124}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To improve the operating performance of a heat pump system, experimental
   data obtained from a solar integrated air source heat pump (SIASHP)
   water heater system were analysed in detail. With the information
   integration and decision-making abilities of data fusion, the
   all-weather operation strategies of the system were newly proposed.
   These new strategies comprehensively considered the solar radiation
   intensity, air temperature, energy dissipation, and COP. According to
   the relative magnitudes of the solar radiation intensity and air
   temperature, the system performed reasonably in different modes,
   ensuring its efficient operation under all weather conditions. Then, the
   annual costs of the system in five cities located in regions with
   various solar radiation intensities were analysed and compared. It was
   concluded that the maximum savings achieved by the system were \$86.5/yr
   and \$225.3 per year compared with gas and electric water heaters,
   respectively, indicating the system is cost-efficient and promising.
   Furthermore, the operating performance of the switched mode was
   optimized based on a regression algorithm. When the solar radiation
   intensity was poor and the temperature of heated water rose to 34
   degrees C, the air source evaporator was switched to a solar evaporator.
   In addition, the COP of the system was 3.023, equal to 97\% of the COP
   of a solar energy heat pump (SHEP) water heater with a sufficient solar
   radiation intensity. Therefore, the optimized scheme can compensate for
   the inefficient operating conditions under a weak solar radiation.}},

Abstract = {{The shelter location is very important for evacuation planning in
   natural disasters, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have demonstrated
   their effectiveness in solving this challenging problem. However, few
   EAs have been reported focusing on the shelter location problem under
   uncertainty of road networks due to the expensive cost of calculating
   the evacuation distance for individual evaluation. To address this
   issue, in this article, we propose a clustering-based surrogate-assisted
   multiobjective EA, termed AR-MOEA+SA, in the framework of a recently
   developed EA AR-MOEA. In AR-MOEA+SA, a surrogate model, the radial basis
   function (RBF), is adopted to approximately calculate the evacuation
   distance under uncertainty of road networks. Due to the fact that there
   often exist a large number of communities needing to be considered in
   shelter location, a clustering strategy is suggested to convert the
   surrogate of high-dimensional problem into the one of low-dimensional
   problem in the proposed AR-MOEA+SA for efficiently building the RBF
   network. A population initialization strategy is also suggested in
   AR-MOEA+SA to enhance the quality of training data in the early stages
   of evolution. Experimental results on a variety of test instances
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AR-MOEA+SA over the original
   version of AR-MOEA in terms of both computational efficiency and
   solution quality.}},

Title = {{Perovskite quantum dot solar cells: Mapping interfacial energetics for
   improving charge separation}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal halide perovskite nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) show
   similar defect tolerance as thin film perovskite materials with added
   nanoscale phenomena. Perovskite QD solar cells have demonstrated
   efficiencies of 16.6\%, greater than that of any other QD material
   system. While the efficiency lags behind the best thin-film perovskite
   devices, these solar cells could have advantages over the thin-film
   versions in terms of processability, phase stability, and high
   open-circuit voltages. However, some operating principles behind
   perovskite quantum dot device stacks and the associated electric field
   properties are still unknown. Here, we characterize the junction
   structure within perovskite QD solar cells, by exposing functioning
   cross-sections and using nanometer-scale Kelvin probe force microscopy
   to offer insight into the selection and performance of charge selective
   contacts. We also evaluated various solar cell device architectures with
   different selective contacts to isolate the role of each junction in
   device performance. We show that in high-performance n-i-p
   architectures, both electronand hole-transport layer (HTL) interfaces
   possess a strong electric field, but in the case of the inverted p-i-n
   architecture, we find that high interfacial recombination at the HTL/QD
   junction is responsible for subpar device performance. Perovskite QD and
   thin film materials can synergistically be combined to offer more design
   flexibility in PV devices, and here we demonstrate that the interface
   between perovskite thin films and QDs are relatively benign and amenable
   for synergistic device design.}},

   interference of extreme noise by discarding the extremes of the
   neighborhood. Then, the probability that the pixel is noise is
   calculated according to the actual situation, adaptive filtering is
   implemented to enhance the algorithm's universal applicability. It
   finally converts the threshold space to an angle space from 0 degrees to
   90 degrees, and the threshold search range is compressed to improve its
   efficiency. As the gesture is close to the background and the boundary
   is blurred, this paper combines the global and local Otsu's method to
   segment the gesture images based on the angle space. On the one hand, it
   uses the global Otsu's method to obtain the global threshold t(1). On
   the other hand, it uses the local Otsu's method to obtain the local
   threshold t(2), and segments gesture images based on t(2). Experimental
   results show that the proposed method is effective and can accurately
   segment gesture images with different noises.}},

Abstract = {{Zeroing neural network (ZNN) is a powerful tool to address the
   mathematical and optimization problems broadly arisen in the science and
   engineering areas. The convergence and robustness are always co-pursued
   in ZNN. However, there exists no related work on the ZNN for
   time-dependent nonlinear minimization that achieves simultaneously
   limited-time convergence and inherently noise suppression. In this
   article, for the purpose of satisfying such two requirements, a
   limited-time robust neural network (LTRNN) is devised and presented to
   solve time-dependent nonlinear minimization under various external
   disturbances. Different from the previous ZNN model for this problem
   either with limited-time convergence or with noise suppression, the
   proposed LTRNN model simultaneously possesses such two characteristics.
   Besides, rigorous theoretical analyses are given to prove the superior
   performance of the LTRNN model when adopted to solve time-dependent
   nonlinear minimization under external disturbances. Comparative results
   also substantiate the effectiveness and advantages of LTRNN via solving
   a time-dependent nonlinear minimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{A reasonable combination of asymmetric foundation failure and whole
   slope failure is essential to solve the problem of the ultimate bearing
   capacity of a rigid strip footing near a soil slope. Based on a
   bilaterally admissible failure mechanism put forward to meet the
   requirement of the combination, a closed-form analytical solution to the
   ultimate bearing capacity is obtained in light of the upper-bound
   theorem of kinematical limit analysis. The proposed method can
   quantitatively illustrate that the failure mode of the footing-on-slope
   system varies from the slope side to the non-slope side with the
   increase in the horizontal distance ratio of the footing from the slope
   edge over the width of the footing. For some typical examples, the
   results calculated using the proposed method are in good agreement with
   those obtained using other analytical and numerical methods or
   laboratory model tests. The influences of the shear strength parameters
   of the soil and safety factor of the slope on the bearing capacity are
   also discussed in the examples.}},

Abstract = {{Sharing economy is a new paradigm based on technical means to improve
   the efficiency of the use of idle resources. The integration of various
   elements and resource allocation mechanism has become an important
   measure to improve efficiency and enhance service. Block chaining has
   the characteristics of no central control system, and can automatically
   execute intelligent contracts. The block chain operation has become the
   most widely used method in economic development, because of the great
   change of block chain technique to traditional transaction means and
   economic model. In recent years, with the emergence of the shared
   economic model Airbnb and Uber, there are still many problems in the
   process of its development, especially the problem of customer
   information security, which seriously hinders the development of the
   shared economic model. Block chain operation can solve this problem
   well, so block chain operation promotes the creation of shared economy
   mode. This paper mainly discusses the problem of customer information
   security of shared economy based on regional chain technology. First,
   the relationship between regional chain technology and shared economy is
   analysed. Secondly, the security problems facing customer information in
   the shared economy are discussed. Finally, some strategies and

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Enabling adaptivity on a uniform Cartesian grid is challenging due to
   its highly structured grid cells and axis-aligned grid lines. In this
   paper, we propose a new grid structure - the adaptive staggered-tilted
   (AST) grid - to conduct adaptive fluid simulations on a regular
   discretization. The key mechanics underpinning our new grid structure is
   to allow the emergence of a new set of tilted grid cells from the nodal
   positions on a background uniform grid. The original axis-aligned cells,
   in conjunction with the populated axis-tilted cells, jointly function as
   the geometric primitives to enable adaptivity on a regular spatial
   discretization. By controlling the states of the tilted cells both
   temporally and spatially, we can dynamically evolve the adaptive
   discretizations on an Eulerian domain. Our grid structure preserves
   almost all the computational merits of a uniform Cartesian grid,
   including the cache-coherent data layout, the easiness for
   parallelization, and the existence of high-performance numerical
   solvers. Further, our grid structure can be integrated into other
   adaptive grid structures, such as an Octree or a sparsely populated
   grid, to accommodate the T-junction-free hierarchy. We demonstrate the
   efficacy of our AST grid by showing examples of large-scale
   incompressible flow simulation in domains with irregular boundaries.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   A meta-analysis was performed for a comparison of outcomes between
   video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy for
   congenital lung malformations (CLM).
   Methods:
   Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane
   Library were searched systematically for literature aimed mainly at
   reporting the therapeutic effects for CLM administrated by VATS and
   thoracotomy.
   Results:
   A total of 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included,
   involving 2896 subjects. VATS was associated with fewer complications
   {[}odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.69], less
   use of epidural anesthesia (OR, 0.08; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.23), shorter
   length of hospital stay {[}standard mean difference (SMD) -0.98; 95\%
   CI, -1.4 to -0.55] and chest drainage (SMD, -0.43; 95\% CI, -0.7 to
   -0.17), as compared with thoracotomy. However, thoracotomy showed
   superiority in reduced operative time (SMD, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.84).
   Pearson analysis (Pearson r = 0.85, 95\% CI, 0.28 to 0.98, p = 0.01) and
   linear regression (R square 0.73) confirmed a positive correlation
   between percentage of symptomatic cases and conversion in patients using
   VATS.
   Conclusion:
   VATS is associated with fewer complications, less use of epidural
   anesthesia, shorter length of stay and length of chest drainage, but
   longer operative time, as compared with thoracotomy. Symptomatic
   patients with CLM using VATS may be prone to conversion to thoracotomy.

Abstract = {{Daidzein (DAI) is a kind of natural isoflavonic phytoestrogen with
   estrogenic activity. However, little is known about its influence on
   early fetal growth in mammalian animals. The current study aimed to
   explore the characteristics of amniotic fluid exposure to dietary DAI
   using H-1 NMR-based metabolomics and biochemical analysis. Here, we
   found that DAI supplementation at a dose of 200 mg kg(-1) significantly
   enhanced the number of viable embryos at the early gestation stage (P <
   0.05). DAI significantly elevated the concentrations of estrogen (E) and
   insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in the amniotic fluid (P < 0.05).
   Moreover, DAI tended to increase the concentration of progesterone, but
   decrease the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in
   the amniotic fluid (0.05 < P < 0.10). Interestingly, the activity of
   glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was higher in the DAI group than in the
   CON group (P < 0.05). An H-1 NMR-based metabolomics analysis identified
   and quantified more than 30 compounds in the amniotic fluid, and some
   critical metabolites such as arginine, creatine, and citrate were found
   to be significantly elevated upon DAI supplementation (P < 0.05).
   Importantly, the metabolic pathways involved in arginine and proline
   metabolisms were found to be significantly affected by DAI.
   Collectively, dietary DAI may improve embryo survival by improving
   hormones, antioxidant capacity, and metabolic profiles in the maternal
   amniotic fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7/HAUSP) is known to regulate multiple

   gain/loss functional assays in vivo and in vitro demonstrated the role
   of USP7 in promoting PTC cell proliferation. Furthermore, we showed that
   there was a negative correlation between USP7 and the CDK inhibitor
   p57(KIP2) expression in PTC tissues and that USP7 facilitated PTC cell
   proliferation by inhibiting p57(KIP2). Mechanistically, USP7 inhibited
   p57(KIP2) expression by modulating TBX3, directly binding to TBX3, and
   decreasing its ubiquitination and degradation. Our findings demonstrated
   that USP7 played a critical oncogenic role in PTC tumorigenesis,
   suggesting that USP7 might act as a prognostic and therapeutic target
   for PTC progression.}},

Title = {{Monitoring Spatiotemporal Evolution of Urban Heat Island Effect and Its

Abstract = {{Monitoring the relationship between the urban heat island (UHI) effect
   and land use/land cover (LULC) is of great significance in land use
   planning to adapt to climate change. However, the dynamic response of
   the UHI effect to LULC change over space and time has not been deeply
   studied. In this study, a transfer matrix method was carried out to
   monitor the class-to-class transitions between different LULC types, as
   well as those between different NLST (normalized land surface
   temperature) levels over space and time. The spatiotemporal correlation
   and dynamic coupling between UHI variation and LULC change from 1987 to
   2016 were simulated based on multi-temporal remote sensing data in
   Wuhan, China. The results showed that high temperature (level V) and
   sub-high temperature (level IV) were mainly concentrated in construction
   land, while the majority of low temperature (level I) was distributed in
   water bodies. During the study period, the most notable changes were the
   rapid increase in construction land, as well as the continuous shrinkage
   of farmland and water bodies. The inward transfer of construction land
   was mainly from farmland and water bodies, with the transferred area of
   218.3 km(2) (69.2\%) and 78.9 km(2) (25.0\%). These transitions were
   mainly responsible for the thermal deterioration in the study area. The
   transition of farmland to construction land contributed the most (66.3\%
   and 81.6\%) to thermal deterioration in the original medium temperature
   area (level III). The transition of water bodies to construction land
   was the main driving force in rapidly upgrading NLST level I into level
   IV (55.8\%) and level V (58.6\%). These findings provided detailed
   information for decision support in optimizing land use structure to
   fight against the thermal deterioration caused by urbanization.}},

Title = {{Daphnetin suppresses experimental abdominal aortic aneurysms in mice via
   inhibition of aortic mural inflammation}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a devastating event that
   can be prevented by inhibiting the growth of small aneurysms.
   Therapeutic strategies targeting certain events that promote the
   development of AAA must be developed, in order to alter the course of
   AAA. Chronic inflammation of the aortic mural is a major characteristic
   of AAA and is related to AAA formation, development and rupture.
   Daphnetin (DAP) is a coumarin derivative with anti-inflammatory
   properties that is extracted from Daphne odora var. However, the effect
   of DAP on AAA development remains unclear. The present study
   investigated the effect of DAP on the formation and development of
   experimental AAAs and its potential underlying mechanisms. A mice AAA
   model was established by intra-aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic
   elastase (PPE), and mice were intraperitoneally injected with DAP
   immediately after PPE infusion. The maximum diameter of the abdominal
   aorta was measured by ultrasound system, and aortic mural changes were
   investigated by Elastica van Gieson (EVG) staining and
   immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that DAP
   significantly suppressed PPE-induced AAA formation and attenuated the
   depletion of aortic medial elastin and smooth muscle cells in the media
   of the aorta. Furthermore, the density of mural macrophages, T cells and
   B cells were significantly attenuated in DAP-treated AAA mice. In
   addition, treatment with DAP resulted in a significant reduction in
   mural neovessels. These findings indicated that DAP may limit the
   formation and progression of experimental aneurysms by inhibiting mural
   inflammation and angiogenesis. These data confirmed the translational
   potential of DAP inclinical AAA inhibition strategies.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of employing the restarting process to evaluate the
   self-starting ability for hypersonic inlets}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accurate evaluation of hypersonic inlet self-starting performance is
   very crucial for the stable and efficient operation of scramjet engines.
   However, few ground hypersonic wind tunnels could provide a continuously
   and slowly accelerating free stream conditions to directly validate the
   self-starting ability of hypersonic inlets so far. Some experimental
   restarting approaches have been explored to evaluate the self-starting
   performance of hypersonic inlets. To clarify the feasibility of such
   approaches, the selfstarting process and the restarting process caused
   by withdrawing plug at the exit of a two-dimensional hypersonic inlet
   were studied using unsteady numerical simulation in this paper. The
   results show that, even though the freestream Mach number (5.54) of the
   restarting process is lower than the selfstarting Mach number (5.715),
   the hypersonic inlet can finally rebuild the started flow field owing to
   the significantly higher moving speed downstream across the inlet
   internal contraction section caused by the big buzz. Hence, the
   additional unsteady effect should be suppressed as far as possible
   during the initial pre-blockage process in the restarting experiment
   applied to evaluate the self-starting performance of hypersonic inlets.

Abstract = {{It has been a hot topic in the academic circle that how we understand
   the issue on Christ versus Caesar determines how we deal with the
   conflict between theocracy and kingship. This article holds the view
   that the prototype of the issue on Christ versus Caesar derives from the
   specific narrative in the Gospel of Matthew, which not only forms the
   basis but also determines the direction for the development of
   politico-religious relationship in Christian history. Moreover, this
   article argues that the transcendental connotation of (sic) in the
   literary structure of Matthew 16:13-20 biblically demonstrates an idea
   that the heavenly theocracy exceeds over the earthly kingship by the
   suffering of Christ. In addition, using the method of detailed reading
   of the biblical text, the article indicates how the religious chosen
   people not only comply with the governance from the earthly kingship but
   also fulfill the duties as citizens, which is revealed by an elaborate
   interpretation of the connotations of both (sic) and (sic). It is the
   perpetual tension between the theocracy and kingship that shapes an
   opposite even cooperative relationship for the era of the need for the
   Christian history.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium-chloride cotransporters KCC1 to KCC4 mediate the coupled
   export of potassium and chloride across the plasma membrane and play
   important roles in cell volume regulation, auditory system function, and
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine-mediated inhibitory
   neurotransmission. Here, we present 2.9- to 3.6-angstrom resolution
   structures of full-length human KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4. All three KCCs
   adopt a similar overall architecture, a domain-swap dimeric assembly,
   and an inward-facing conformation. The structural and functional studies
   reveal that one unexpected N-terminal peptide binds at the cytosolic
   facing cavity and locks KCC2 and KCC4 at an autoinhibition state. The
   C-terminal domain (CTD) directly interacts with the N-terminal
   inhibitory peptide, and the relative motions between the CTD and the
   transmembrane domain (TMD) suggest that CTD regulates KCCs' activities
   by adjusting the autoinhibitory effect. These structures provide the
   first glimpse of full-length structures of KCCs and an autoinhibition
   mechanism among the amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporter

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Spinal schwannoma is a common benign tumor. However, the
   high recurrence rate and incidence of surgical complications are
   unsolved problems.
   OBJECTIVE: To propose a morphological classification of spinal
   schwannoma based on tumor-membrane relationships to increase the gross
   total resection (GTR) rate and to decrease the incidence of surgical
   complications.
   METHODS: Histological techniques were used to study 7 adult cadavers.
   Following picrosirius staining, the membranes around the nerve root were
   observed under a microscope. Data from 101 patients with spinal
   schwannoma were also collected for clinical analysis.
   RESULTS: The sleeve around the spinal nerve root consisted of dura and
   arachnoid tissues. The space between them gradually narrowed and fused
   at the proximal pole of the nerve root ganglion. Spinal schwannomas were
   divided into 4 types based on membranous structure: intrapial (type I),
   subarachnoidal (type II), intra- and extradural (type Ill), and
   extradural growth (type IV). Types II and III were further subdivided
   into 2 subtypes. GTR was achieved in all patients (100\%), with no tumor
   recurrence during follow-up. Overall functional status significantly
   improved postoperatively. A total of 59 patients (92\%) showed
   improvement or significant improvement postoperatively. There was no
   difference in surgical outcomes among the tumor classifications (P =
   .618). No intraoperative vertebral artery injuries or postoperative
   cerebrospinal fluid fistula occurred.
   CONCLUSION: Spinal schwannoma classification based on a membranous
   hierarchy provides an intuitive platform for preoperative planning and
   intraoperative safety. This classification scheme may help surgeons
   better define surgical goals and anticipate or even avoid complications
   from resection.}},

Abstract = {{To avoid spectrum crunch and improve spectrum efficiency, the use of
   unlicensed spectra and the introduction of D2D communication will be
   areas of focus in communication development. However, in the existing
   unlicensed spectrum coexistence mechanism, different ways of
   communication are seen as hindering each other. In this paper, we
   deliberate the coexistence of a D2D-enabled LTE network with Wi-Fi under
   an unlicensed band. Unlike previous coexistence mechanisms, we allow
   cochannel transmission, and our goal is to make full use of the
   advantages of D2D proximity communication and achieve fairness in
   co-channel transmission. First, we modeled the coexistence network and
   derived the expressions coverage probability of all types of receivers.
   Based on the analytical model and simulation results, we prove that D2D
   communication can be exploited to achieve fairness requirements in
   co-channel transmission over the unlicensed band. We rephrase the
   fairness schedule problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization
   problem for D2D density and transmit power, and we use an Ortho-MADS
   algorithm to solve it. The simulation results show that the proposed
   scheme can use D2D communication to improve the fairness of the system.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Small scale energy storage systems (ESSs) can serve as buffers for
   integrating renewable energy resources into the main grid. Their
   available energy can be aggregated to provide ancillary services for
   power systems. This paper considers a load frequency control (LFC)
   scheme with energy storage aggregator comprises of ESSs. To coordinate
   the behaviors of ESSs for LFC support, a discrete prescribed time
   consensus control is proposed which ensures that the ESSs can reach
   consensus within the prescribed settling time. To improve the tracking
   precision, an optimal leader set is selected with submodular
   optimization. In the meantime, an event triggered communication (ETC)
   protocol is proposed to reduce the unnecessary information sharing among
   ESSs. The ETC protocol is naturally Zeno free with the defined sampling
   instants. Case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method, and the performance of the proposed method is
   superior than conventional and state-of-art methods with comparative
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at learning to score the figure skating sports videos.
   To address this task, we propose a deep architecture that includes two

   average length of 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Each video is annotated by
   two scores of nine different referees, i.e., Total Element Score(TES)
   and Total Program Component Score (PCS). Our proposed model is validated
   on FisV and MIT-skate datasets. The experimental results show the

Abstract = {{The transmission error of cable-driven sheaves (CDS) used in space
   docking locks directly affects the synchronous docking of two
   spacecraft, which is guaranteed mainly by the preload applied to their
   serial cables. But it is difficult controlled precisely because of the
   complicated cable deformation and operating conditions. The synchronous
   testing efficiency of the docking locks is inevitably influenced,
   correspondingly. This paper proposes a prediction model for the
   transmission error of CDS based on their cable deformation. In this
   model, the deformations of non- and free sectional cables are both
   modified on finite element analysis, which are respectively derived from
   classical Capstan equation and Hooke's law for them without considering
   the effects of the friction coefficient between wire strands. Based on
   the proposed model, the relationships between the transmission error and
   dominating factors are analyzed. Then the preload compensation for
   transmission error is obtained at the engaging and locking angles of the
   docking locks, respectively. Experiments validate the model. This can
   provide a valuable reference in controlling the transmission error of
   CDS and improving the assembly efficiency of docking locks.}},

   root-dwelling community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi}},
Journal = {{FUNGAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The growth and yield of crops are severely threatened by drought stress.
   As the symbiotic partners of plants, the function of the symbiotic
   interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) and
   endophytic fungi on host drought resistance is still unclear. Through
   high-throughput sequencing of peanuts cultivated in a natural soil
   environment with different soil water conditions, our study showed that
   the inoculation of an endophytic fungus not only reassembled the
   root-dwelling AM fungal community by driving the colonization of
   Gigaspora, but also enhanced peanut drought resistance under drought
   stress. Co-inoculation experiments revealed that the synergetic
   interaction between the endophytic fungus and the AM fungi promoted the
   ecological service of the extraradical hyphae of Gigaspora margarita. In
   addition, both endophytic fungal exudates and root exudates failed to
   differentially affect the pre-symbiotic growth of different AM fungi.
   Overall, our study enabled us to better understand the ecological
   importance of the tripartite symbiosis between endophytic fungi, AM
   fungi and the host. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological

   large sample of 33,893 massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate
   redshifts (1 < z < 1.5). We choose the longest wavelength available in
   the Hyper-Supreme-Cam (HSC) deep survey, the Y band and i - Y color, to
   select the 4000 angstrom Balmer jump in passive galaxies to the highest
   redshift possible within the survey. With the rich multiwavelength data
   in the HSC deep fields, we then confirm that the selected galaxies are
   in the targeted redshift range of 1 < z < 1.5, lie in the passive region
   of the UVJ diagram, and have high stellar masses at log(M-{*}/M-circle
   dot) > 10.5, with a median of log(M-{*}/M-circle dot) = 11.0. A small
   fraction of our galaxies is also covered by the HST CANDELS.
   Morphological analysis in the observed H band shows that the majority of
   this subsample are early-type galaxies. As massive early-type galaxies
   trace the high-density regions in the large-scale structure in the
   universe, our study provides a quick and simple way to obtain a
   statistically significant sample of massive galaxies in a relatively
   narrow redshift range. Our sample is 7-20x larger at the massive end
   (log(M-{*}/M-circle dot) > 10.5) than any existing samples obtained in
   previous surveys. This is a pioneer study, and the technique introduced
   here can be applied to a future wide-field survey to study large-scale
   structure and to identify high-density regions and clusters.}},

Abstract = {{The high-temperature hydrothermal (HTH) stability is always a key factor
   that affects the NH3-SCR performance and limits the industrial
   applications of Cu/SAPO-34. Herein, two Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts with
   different grain sizes are HTH aged to investigate the role of the grain
   size of Cu/SAPO-34 in holding the structure stability of catalysts and
   the relationships between the grain size and deNO(x) performance over
   Cu/SAPO-34 during the HTH treatment. Characterization results
   illustrates that the relationship between the grain size and the
   stability of SAPO framework and the content of isolated Cu2+ ions.
   During the HTH treatment, CuO species more easily transfer to isolated
   Cu2+ species via migrating into the framework from the external surface
   of SAPO-34 for the larger-sized catalyst rather than the smaller-sized
   one. The re-distribution of Cu2+ in the larger-sized catalyst prevents
   Si-O(H)-Al from H2O attacking during HTH treatment. Therefore, the
   larger-sized Cu/SAPO-34 maintains stronger structural stability and
   higher deNO(x) activity than smaller-sized one after HTH treatment. This
   work provides a new strategy for design of high-temperature hydrothermal
   stabilized Cu/SAPO-34 for eliminating NOx emitted from diesel engines.}},

Title = {{Experimental study on crack features of steel fiber reinforced concrete

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies crack features of steel fiber reinforced concrete
   (SFRC) tunnel segments subjected to eccentric compression. An experiment
   is conducted in which 56 SFRC beam specimens of different steel fiber
   type and dosage are cast and loaded. Both qualitive observation and
   quantitative analysis are made to shed light on crack features of SFRC
   beams which are demonstrated by crack patterns, the development of crack
   width and length as well as the energy absorbed during the cracking
   process. Based on the cracking features of SFRC tunnel segment under
   eccentric compression obtained in this paper, an improved design method
   applicable to the SFRC tunnel segment is proposed. The results show
   that: (1) Two different crack patterns would occur for SFRC beams under
   compressive loads of different eccentricity, which is different from
   that of reinforced concrete (RC) beams, and the two patterns differ in
   how cracks gradually develop. (2) SFRC beam specimens are safer when
   subjected to compressive loads of small eccentricity. Dramix 5D SFRC
   tunnel segments are more suitable for loads of smaller eccentricity (0.1
   m) since it exhibits better anti-cracking capacity in that scenario. (3)
   The Boltzmann fitting formula can properly reflect the development of
   crack length with the increase of the crack width. (4) Using the
   obtained experimental results, the rationality of the improved design
   method is well verified.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Thyroid nodules are a common thyroid disorder. The aim of
   the present study was to observe the application value of ultrasonic
   shear wave elastography (SWE) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in
   the differential diagnosis of patients with benign and malignant thyroid
   lesions.
   Methods: Eighty-two patients with thyroid nodules (96 thyroid nodules)
   at our hospital were enrolled. All patients underwent ultrasonic SWE and
   CEUS examination. With surgical pathology as the gold standard, the
   Young's modulus, CEUS imaging features, and quantitative parameters were
   compared between the benign and malignant groups. The diagnostic
   efficiency of SWE, CEUS, and their combination was analyzed by
   receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC).
   Results: The average of the Young's modulus in the malignant group was
   significantly higher than that of the benign group (P<0.05). There were
   significant differences in the CEUS images of nodules between the benign
   and malignant groups in terms of boundary conditions, morphology,
   perfusion intensity, homogeneous enhancement, and perfusion defects
   (P<0.05), while there were no significant difference in initial increase
   time, peak intensity, time to peak, and area under the curve (P>0.05).
   The curve sharpness in the benign group was significantly lower than
   that of the malignant group (P<0.05). ROC analysis found that the
   diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of SWE, CEUS, and their
   combination were 90.1\% and 81.6\%, 67.8\% and 75.4\%, and 97.3\% and
   71.5\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Compared with CEUS, the sensitivity and specificity of SWE
   were relatively higher in the differential diagnosis of benign and
   malignant thyroid lesions, and a combination of both can improve the
   diagnostic sensitivity of SWE alone to a certain extent.}},

   relationship between a borrower's education level and the interest rate,
   loan amount, and loan maturity based on more than 10,000 transactions
   from Renrendai.com. Controlling for a variety of other factors, we find
   on average that an individual with a higher education level obtains a

Title = {{A comprehensive analysis of microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for
   asthma}},
Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   It is unclear whether microRNAs could be a potential diagnostic
   biomarker for asthma or not. The objective of this study is to figure
   out the diagnostic value of microRNAs in asthma.
   Methods:
   Literature retrieval, screening of publications, specific data
   extraction, and quality evaluation were conducted according to the
   standard criteria. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the
   diagnostic value of microRNA for asthma, including the combined
   sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), the area under the curve (AUC),
   positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and
   diagnostic odds ratio (DOR).
   Results:
   A total of 72 studies, containing 4143 cases and 2188 controls, were
   included for this comprehensive analysis. None of the included
   publications were rated low in quality. We summarized that, compared
   with controls, more than 100 miRNAs were reported differently expressed
   in asthma, although the expression trends were inconsistent. Besides,
   there were five studies among these 72 articles that applied the
   diagnostic evaluation of microRNAs in asthma. We found that the pooled
   Sen, Spe, and AUC for the combination of miR-185-5p, miR-155, let-7a,
   miR-21, miR-320a, miR-1246, miR-144-5p, and miR-1165-3p in asthma were
   0.87 (95\%CI: 0.72-0.95), 0.84 (95\%CI: 0.74-0.91), and 0.93 (95\%CI:
   0.89-0.94) individually, and the PLR, NLR, and DOR were 5.5 (95\%CI:
   3.1-9.7), 0.15 (95\%CI: 0.07-0.36), and 35 (95\%CI: 10-127) in asthma,
   respectively. In terms of subgroup analyses, we found that the Sen for
   these combination miRNAs from serum was higher than that in plasma,
   while the Spe in plasma worked better than that in serum. Furthermore,
   compared with children, the combination of above miRNAs from adults had
   higher Spe and similar Sen.
   Conclusions:
   From our analysis, the combination of miR-185-5p, miR-155, let-7a,
   miR-21, miR-320a, miR-1246, miR-144-5p, and miR-1165-3p from peripheral
   blood could potentially act as a diagnostic biomarker for asthma.

Title = {{Dry Deposition of PM2.5 Nitrate in a Forest according to Vertical
   Profile Measurements}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The atmospheric nitrogen compounds can serve as a nutrient; however, its
   excess deposition has harmful effects on terrestrial ecosystems due to
   acidification and eutrophication. There are still large uncertainties
   concerning the dry deposition process of PM2.5 nitrate in forests, even
   though this process affects the accuracy of chemical transport model
   simulations. To better understand this process, we conducted vertical
   profile measurements of inorganic ions in PM2.5 and SO2 above and within
   a forest canopy in the Field Museum Tamakyuryo site in suburban Tokyo
   with a particular focus on the processes observed under both daytime and
   nighttime and both leafy and leafless conditions. We performed two
   observations during leafy periods (July 21 -August 1, 2015, and
   September 27 -October 11, 2016) and one observation during a leafless
   period (February 23-29, 2016). To obtain daytime and nighttime vertical
   profiles, we set filter holders at 4 or 5 heights on an observation
   tower in the forest and changed the filters for each daytime and
   nighttime. For the PM2.5, the vertical gradients of NO(3)concentration
   were larger than those of SO42- during both the daytime and nighttime
   for all observational periods, particularly during the leafy periods. In
   addition, the decreasing rate of NO(3)in the PM2.5 within the canopy was
   larger than that of SO2 for some observational periods. In the daytime,
   the air temperature was higher near the canopy surface during the leafy
   period and near the ground surface during the leafless period. As also
   suggested by past studies, the large gradients of NO(3)in the PM2.5
   during the leafy period were likely caused by the volatilization of
   NH4NO3 near the deposition surfaces due to the higher temperature in the
   daytime and the lower concentration of HNO3 caused by its fast removal
   during both the daytime and nighttime.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is a polymer material that has high
   ductility, good biocompatibility and excellent abrasion resistance.
   These properties open a pathway to manufacturing functional TPU parts
   for applications in various fields such as aerospace engineering,
   medical devices and sports equipment. This study aims to investigate the
   mechanical properties of additively manufactured TPU material affected
   by three different processing parameters, including build orientation,
   mix ratio of the new and reused powders and post-processing. A series of
   material tests are conducted on TPU dumb-bell specimens. It is found
   that the mix ratio of the new powder is the most critical factor in
   improving the mechanical properties of the printed TPU parts. Compared
   to reused powder, new powder has better particle quality and thermal
   properties. Besides, build orientation is also a very important factor.
   TPU parts printed in flat and on-edge orientations show better tensile
   strength and deformability than those printed in upright orientation. In
   addition, post-processing is found to significantly enhance the
   deformability of TPU parts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{505-514}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Porcine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is currently inefficient,
   as 1-3.95\% of reconstructed embryos survive to term; inadequate or
   erroneous epigenetic reprogramming of the specialized donor somatic
   nucleus could be a primary reason. Therefore, a locus-specific analysis
   of DNA methylation dynamics in embryogenesis and the DNA methylation
   status of gametes and donor cells used for SCNT were conducted in the
   following developmentally important gene loci: POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, H19,
   IGF2, IGF2R, XIST; and the retrotransposon LINE-1. There were
   significant epigenetic differences between the gametes and the somatic
   donor cells. Three gamete-specific differentially methylated regions
   (DMRs) in POU5F1, XIST, and LINE-1 were identified. A delayed
   demethylation process at POU5F1 and LINE-1 loci occurred after three
   successive cleavages, compared to the in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos.
   Although cloned embryos could undergo de-methylation and re-methylation
   dynamics at the DMRs of imprinted genes (H19, IGF2R, and XIST), the
   re-methylation process was compromised, unlike in fertilized embryos.
   LINE-1 loci are widely dispersed across the whole genome, and LINE-1 DMR
   might be a potential porcine nuclear reprogramming epi-marker. Data from
   observations in our present and previous studies, and two published
   articles were pooled to produce a schematic diagram of locus-specific,
   DNA methylation dynamics of cloned and IVF embryos during porcine early
   embryogenesis. This also indicated aberrant DNA methylation
   reprogramming events, including inadequate DNA demethylation and
   insufficient re-methylation in cloned embryos. Further research should
   focus on mechanisms underlying demethylation during the early cleavage
   of embryos and de novo DNA methylation at the blastocyst stage.}},

Title = {{Harvesting vibration energy to piezo-catalytically generate hydrogen
   through Bi2WO6 layered-perovskite}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vibration energy sources are nearly ubiquitous in our daily life, for
   instance, walking, automobile engine, heartbeat, noise, etc., occurring
   almost whenever and wherever possible. It would be an interesting and
   exciting breakthrough in the field of energy, if all these energies
   could be gathered and utilized. Piezoelectric materials make it
   possible, which can convert vibration energy into electric energy by
   inducing positive and negative electric charges. Up to now, there has
   rarely reported on hydrogen generation by piezoelectric materials
   utilizing vibration energy. Here, an efficient piezo-catalytic hydrogen
   generation in the layered-perovskite bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6)
   nanoplates is carried out through harvesting vibration energy. The yield
   of hydrogen can achieve 1147.8 mu mol g(-1) after 6 h vibration with the
   rate of hydrogen generation of 191.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The conduction
   band level of H+/H-2 is more positive than the minimum of conduction
   band of Bi2WO6 nanoplates, enabling the reduction of water to generate
   hydrogen. Converting vibration energy into useful clean hydrogen energy
   can not only make use of waste energy, but also be expected to solve the
   problem of energy shortage, which is potential in developing the clean
   hydrogen energy in future.}},

Abstract = {{The task of image-text matching refers to measuring the visual-semantic
   similarity between an image and a sentence. Recently, the fine-grained
   matching methods that explore the local alignment between the image
   regions and the sentence words have shown advance in inferring the
   image-text correspondence by aggregating pairwise region-word
   similarity. However, the local alignment is hard to achieve as some
   important image regions may be inaccurately detected or even missing.
   Meanwhile, some words with high-level semantics cannot be strictly
   corresponding to a single-image region. To tackle these problems, we
   address the importance of exploiting the global semantic consistence
   between image regions and sentence words as complementary for the local
   alignment. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid matching approach
   named Cross-modal Attention with Semantic Consistency (CASC) for
   image-text matching. The proposed CASC is a joint framework that
   performs cross-modal attention for local alignment and multilabel
   prediction for global semantic consistence. It directly extracts
   semantic labels from available sentence corpus without additional labor
   cost, which further provides a global similarity constraint for the
   aggregated region-word similarity obtained by the local alignment.
   Extensive experiments on Flickr30k and Microsoft COCO (MSCOCO) data sets
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CASC on preserving global
   semantic consistence along with the local alignment and further show its
   superior image-text matching performance compared with more than 15
   state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
   formula, has long been used for the treatment of common metabolic
   diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the main
   limitation of its wider application is ingredient complexity of this
   formula. Thus, it is critically important to identify the major active
   ingredients of GQD and to illustrate mecha-nisms underlying its action.
   Here, we compared the effects of GQD and berberine, a hypothetical key
   active pharmaceutical ingredient of GQD, on a diabetic rat model by
   comprehensive analyses of gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids,
   proinflammatory cytokines, and ileum transcriptomics. Our results show
   that berberine and GQD had similar effects on lowering blood glucose
   levels, modulating gut microbiota, inducing ileal gene expression, as
   well as relieving systemic and local inflammation. As expected, both
   berberine and GQD treatment significantly altered the overall gut
   microbiota structure and enriched many butyrate-producing bacteria,
   including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, thereby attenuating intestinal
   inflammation and lowering glucose. Levels of short-chain fatty acids in
   rat feces were also significantly elevated after treatment with
   berberine or GQD. Moreover, concentration of serum proinflammatory
   cytokines and expression of immune-related genes, including Nfkb1,
   Stat1, and Ifnrg1, in pancreatic islets were significantly reduced after
   treatment. Our study demonstrates that the main effects of GQD can be
   attributed to berberine via modulating gut microbiota. The strategy
   employed would facilitate further standardization and widespread
   application of TCM in many diseases.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{217}},

Abstract = {{Long-term extreme load effects are one of the primary concerns in the
   design of civil and offshore structures. Such load effects can be
   evaluated using the accurate but computationally demanding full
   long-term method or the more efficient but approximate first-order and
   second-order reliability methods. Monte Carlo based methods enhanced
   with machine learning algorithms offer efficient alternatives to the
   traditional methods. Therefore, artificial neural networks and support
   vector machines are used as surrogate models for the limit state
   function to speed up the prediction of long-term extreme load effects. A
   three-span suspension bridge with two floating pylons under combined
   wind and wave actions is used as a case study. The cumulative density
   functions of the long-term extreme values corresponding to a bending
   moment value due to vertical deflections at the critical position of the
   girder are calculated. It is then shown that the artificial neural
   network and support vector machine-based approaches require less
   computational effort and yield more accurate results than the first- and
   second-order reliability methods.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Double-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (DP-LIBS) has been
   demonstrated to enable efficient elemental analysis of bulk water. Its
   applications are based on the fundamental understanding of the
   characteristics of the secondary plasma. However, due to the poor
   stability of the secondary breakdown, the inherent formation and
   evolution processes of the secondary plasma within the first laser
   formed bubble (LFB) remain unknown. By post focusing the second laser
   beam at the rear boundary of the first LFB (post-focus arrangement), the
   generated secondary plasma can provide a stable system for understanding
   its spatiotemporal behaviors. Based on this post-focus arrangement, the
   secondary plasma was characterized by using temporally resolved
   spectroscopy, monochromatic fast imaging and shadowgraph techniques. It
   was shown that the emission of underwater DP-LIBS presented transient
   increments within 1 mu s. Such a distinctive temporal behavior was
   closely related to the back and forth movement of the secondary plasma
   within the first LFB, due to its spatial confinement effect.
   Species-specific imaging studies reveal that the interactions between
   the secondary plasma and the surrounding water vapor can give rise to
   the dissociation of water molecules, as well as the excitation of
   hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Meanwhile, the molecular emissions (CaOH)
   appeared only after 2 mu s, but lasted for 32 mu s, suggesting a slower
   plasma relaxation within the first LFB. Further shadowgraphic
   investigations highlight the quasi-static, low-pressure environment of
   the first LFB, which can reduce energy losses and enhance optical
   radiation from the secondary plasma.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic and optical properties of Ni-doped Bi4O5I2 systems were
   investigated via first-principle calculations. For the pristine Bi4O5I2,
   the band gap was calculated to be 2.17 eV, which was close to the
   experimental report. When the concentration of Ni increased, the band
   gap obviously decreased, which was ascribed to the introduction of Ni 3d
   doping states in the forbidden band gap. Based on the dielectric
   function analysis, the variations of the optical properties mainly took
   place in the visible light range, and the additional peak in the visible
   light range originated from the electron transition between the Ni 3d
   and Bi 6p states. Accordingly, the light absorption in the visible light
   range obviously increased, which was favorable for photocatalytic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo-mimic silkworm infection models with Mycobacterium avium and
   Mycobacterium intracellulare were newly established to evaluate the
   therapeutic effects of anti-M. avium complex (MAC) antibiotics.
   Silkworms raised at 37 degrees C died within 72 hours of an injection of
   M. avium or M. intracellulare (2.5 x 10(7) colony-forming unit
   (CFU)/larva.g) into the hemolymph. Clinical anti-mycobacterial
   (tuberculosis) antibiotics were evaluated under these conditions.
   Clarithromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin
   exerted therapeutic effects in a dose-dependent manner, which was
   consistent with those in the mouse model. Furthermore, three effective
   actinomycete culture broths were selected in the screening program of
   our microbial broth library using the silkworm model, and four active
   metabolites, ohmyungsamycins A and B (1 and 2), chartreusin (3), and
   griseoviridin (4), were identified. Among these compounds, 1 showed the
   lowest 50\% effective dose (ED50) value (8.5 mu g/larva.g), while 3 had
   the best ED50/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio (7.4). These
   results indicate that silkworm models are a useful tool for identifying
   anti-MAC antibiotics candidates with veritable therapeutic effects.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the discrimination between the sonochemical and the

   min sonication. Alongside this, the precipitated solution stirred for 2
   h at 700 rpm. The functional effects of these prepared materials have
   examined in the electrochemical determination of acebutolol (ACE). The
   high intense shock waves are successfully crystalized the PrWNP in the
   reaction mixture and produced the mixed phases of monoclinic and
   orthorhombic Pr-2(WO4)(3). However, the magnetic stirring process has
   failed to make such crystallinity. The obtained PrWNP is characterized
   by systematic investigations with spectroscopic techniques.
   Sonochemically furnished PrWNP is exhibited the high crystalline
   nanocube whereas stirring method has furnished the amorphous non-uniform
   distribution. Both PrWNP have examined in the electrochemical

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Video retrieval has been widely used in many applications such as video
   surveillance, object detection. Recently, the security of video
   retrieval systems has attracted much attention of researchers. However,
   the most of the previous works focus on secure image search, which
   usually utilize homomorphic encryption (HE) or order-preserving
   encryption (OPE) to achieve privacy-preserving. Specially, few works pay
   attention to secure video retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel
   secure video retrieval (SVR, for simplicity) scheme by utilizing
   comparable encryption with a vector extending mechanism. The distance
   between images could be presented as range query. Security analysis
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme can preserve the privacy of data.
   The experimental results show that the ciphertext search results are
   consistent with the plaintext form. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Image fusion expands the space-time scope of the detection target by
   making full use of the information complementarity between images, which

   images. It decomposes images into the base layer and the detail layer.
   The saliency map is obtained based on adaptive fractional saliency
   detection of the IR image. This map is beneficial to fuse the base layer
   and highlights the saliency information significantly. Then, the detail
   layer is fused by classical choose-max. The experiments indicate that
   the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in
   extracting the target and preserving background information of the IR

Abstract = {{This paper presents a set of laboratory experiments wherein participants
   are exposed to simulated terrorist attacks that allow us to examine the
   effect of emotions on decision making. The first objective is to attempt
   to understand how individuals in this environment allocate resources
   between private insurance and public good expenditures aimed at reducing
   the likelihood of these attacks. The second is to develop a methodology
   to test proposals to deal with the public response to terrorism (e.g.,
   new ways of communicating terrorism risk levels) in the laboratory at a
   lower cost than either field-based experimental studies or
   implementation without prior testing. We simulate a terrorist attack by
   imposing a financial cost on participants and by inducing negative
   emotions with distressing video images that incorporate very loud,
   unexpected explosions to create a startle response. We find that
   participants who respond with fear increase their support for both
   public measures and private insurance in response to the threat, while
   participants who respond with anger reduce their support for both. Our
   findings suggest that people purchase private insurance to address
   emotional as well as financial concerns, even though private insurance
   primarily addresses the financial loss as opposed to the negative
   emotions associated with the simulated attacks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A maternal high-fat diet (HFD) has been shown to exert deleterious
   effects on fetal programming by impairing embryo growth, and exerts a
   long-term effect on the health of offspring. The present study aimed to
   evaluate the effect of a maternal HFD on the ovaries of offspring from
   the perspective of oxidative stress. Female C57BL/6J mice were randomly
   assigned to four groups fed various HFDs during the preconception (4
   weeks) and gestation-lactation periods. Offspring were fed a normal diet
   after weaning, and serum and ovaries were collected at 10 weeks of age.
   The developmental status of follicles was observed using hematoxylin and
   eosin staining. The serum oxidative stress levels and insulin resistance
   were detected using ELISA test kits. The expression of phosphorylated
   form of H2AX histone variant (gamma H2AX), forkhead box protein O3a
   (FOXO3a), Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim)and insulin-like growth factor
   (IGF)-1 in ovarian tissue was analyzed using reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyses to further
   explore the pathogenic mechanism. Prenatal exposure to a maternal HFD
   resulted in a reduced number of primordial and preantral follicles in
   the ovaries of offspring. Exposure to an HFD in the preconception period
   exerted a greater effect on the offspring compared with exposure to an
   HFD in the gestation-lactation period. A reduction in fat intake during
   the preconception, gestation and lactation periods significantly reduced
   the associated adverse outcomes. The expression of genes (FOXO3a, IGF-1,
   gamma H2AX and Bim) involved in oxidative stress showed a decreasing
   trend (high-fat/high-fat>high-fat/control>control/high-fat
   >control/control) in the ovaries of offspring. Overall, HFD exposure
   during the preconception period exerted a greater effect on offspring
   compared with HFD exposure during the gestation-lactation period. The
   long-term effect on follicular growth and development may be associated
   with increased oxidative stress and the activation of the
   insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Piston Wind Induced by Braking Train in a Tunnel}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is critical to discover the behavior of piston wind induced by a
   braking train in a tunnel, but there is little research on the
   theoretical derivation for piston wind behavior. Predicting piston wind
   behavior as an unsteady airflow by a theoretical formula is hard work
   due to the complexity of train running states and airflow fields.
   Herein, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the behavior of
   piston wind as an unsteady airflow, considering the variation of wind
   direction in the annular area. In general, the theoretical model is
   validated by experiments. However, experimental studies about piston
   wind are scarce. In this study, we simulated the emergent braking
   process of a train to validate the mathematical model by establishing a
   1/50 scaled experimental configuration. The piston wind data tested in
   the experiment have good agreement with the results calculated by
   theoretical formulas. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the effect
   parameters of piston wind (i.e., tunnel length, train length, train
   speed and blockage ratio) was conducted. The theoretical formulas
   derived in this paper are applicable to similar train running conditions
   in railway tunnels or subway tunnels.}},

Title = {{The micro-niche of exoelectrogens influences bioelectricity generation
   in bioelectrochemical systems}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) employ exoelectrogens to degrade
   organic matter, and produce value-added products, such as
   bioelectricity, methane, acetate and hydrogen. Based on the advantages
   of energy saving and resource recovery, BES is expected to play an
   important role in sustainable wastewater treatment in the future.
   Although considerable progress has been made in the past two decades,
   the commercialization of BES still needs to overcome many technical
   challenges to reduce costs and increase electricity output. A
   comprehensive understanding of the working mechanism of exoelectrogens
   rooted in the defined micro-niche that covers interactions with
   electrolytes, electrodes and other microorganisms, is the premise of
   solving the problem. To provide theoretical guidance for BES performance
   optimization, this review summarized the defined micro-niche of
   exoelectrogens in BES, including the overall set environmental
   conditions of BES and the local microenvironment of electroactive
   biofilms (EABs). With the expansion of EAB, the microenvironment of EAB
   slightly shifts in pH gradient, metabolic activity, electron transfer
   pathways and synergetic growth with other microorganisms. Exoelectrogens
   in different niche have different contributions to current, and this can
   be adjusted by optimization of substrate, electrode material, electrode
   potential, etc. In summary, an efficient and stable microniche is the
   key to ensure that BES continues to produce bioelectricity and remove
   pollutants, providing guidance for BES design and operation in the
   future.}},

   state-of-the-art one-stop handbook}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Energy storage system (ESS) has been expected to be a viable solution
   which can provide diverse benefits to different power system
   stakeholders, including generation side, transmission network (TN),
   distribution network (DN) and off-grid microgrid. Prudent ESS allocation
   in power grids determines satisfactory performance of ESS applications.
   Optimal sizing and placement of ESS are crucial for power quality
   improvement of DN and transmission system protection setting. To solve
   this issue, considerable researches have been done either in modelling
   or algorithms. However, various options and complex characteristics in
   different sub-systems make it difficult to appraise a specific method
   for an ESS application, while the existing reviews only focus on ESS
   applications in DN. This paper provides a critical one-stop handbook
   related to one hundred and four methods in six categories covering all
   kinds of networks and tailored applications. Meanwhile, a systematic
   methodology is presented with an extensive latest literature review,
   including ESS selection, evaluation criteria, modelling and solution
   methods. Particularly, different technical requirements and modelling
   methods of different sub-systems are outlined. Besides, pros and cons of
   optimization methods are thoroughly analysed and compared to reveal
   state-of-the-art studies. Finally, key points in optimal ESS sizing and
   placement are concluded along with recommendations for future research.}},

Abstract = {{The paper was to find out effects of cerebral motor excitability and
   hand dexterity used to 1 Hz low frequency repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with hand manual therapy (HMT) on
   dominant hand difference in chronic stroke patients. 16 stroke patients
   were classified into the dominant hand HMT with r TMS group (DHMT+rTMSG)
   and non-dominant hand HMT with rTMS group (NDHMT+rTMSG), and 1 Hz
   low-frequency rTMS with HMT was performed. Motor evoked potentials
   (MEPs) amplitude, latency and box and block test (BBT) were used to
   confirm cerebral motor activity and hand dexterity. In DHMT+rTMSG, MEPs
   amplitude, latency and BBT showed significant differences. In
   NDITMT+rTMSG, MEPs amplitude, latency only showing significant
   difference. In the comparison between groups, MEPs amplitude, latency
   showed significant difference. Therefore, the 1 Hz low frequency rTMS
   combined with HMT according to the dominant hand difference is
   considered to be an n approach applied in the recovery of hand function

Title = {{Constructing mainstay-body structure in heterocyclic aramid fiber to
   simultaneously improve tensile strength and toughness}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{High-performance polymer fibers have broad applications in composites
   due to high strength and excellent toughness. However, the enhancement
   in tensile strength often results in a decrease in elongation at break,
   and simultaneous increase of strength and toughness is still challenging
   for aramid fiber. Herein, an effective method based on relaxation time
   theory is proposed to simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and
   elongation at break for heterocyclic aramid fiber. Ultra-high molecular
   weight heterocyclic aramid (HMPBIA) was added in the heterocyclic aramid
   (PBIA) spinning dope to prepare fibers. The structure evolution of fiber
   is studied in detail combining with experiment and simulation. Results
   of Molecular Dynamics simulations prove that HMPBIA acts as a role of
   mainstay by maintaining straight chain conformation in highly oriented
   fibers. This unique mainstay-body structure weaken slippage between
   molecular chains when the fiber is subject to tension. Further
   characterizations by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) confirm the formation of mainstay-body
   structure in the fiber, which improves tensile strength and elongation
   at break by 17.7\% and 16.7\%, respectively.}},

Title = {{FINDING EVIDENCE OF GREEN LEASING IN UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT-LEASED
   PROPERTIES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-72}},

Abstract = {{Although the term ``green leasing{''} is not yet well defined, its
   primary purpose is clear. With an aim to create a collaborative
   environment through legal provisions between a building owner and a
   tenant, green leasing may ultimately help resolve the energy paradox in
   tenanted properties. Issues surrounding split-incentives are driven by a
   mismatch between owners' capital expenditures on improving building
   energy efficiency and an uncertainty of tenant or occupant behavior that
   might affect a building's energy consumption. Though some countries have
   started to develop guidelines promoting the adoption of green leasing,
   especially in government buildings and commercial real estate,
   implementation has not been overly successful globally. This study has
   two focuses, the first of which is to compare green leasing guidelines
   from various countries and to suggest six comprehensive categories of
   green leasing components: management relationships, information sharing,
   certificates, legal stipulations, financial factors, and operation. The
   second core area of research places government-tenanted properties'
   lease agreement contracts. The goal is to find any evidence in a legal
   condition between a building owner and a tenant, in this case federal
   government, to improve building energy efficiency with less
   environmental impact in the United States. The findings of the study
   indicated 41 out of 400 leases had green clauses. Three out of six
   categories proposed in this study were found in the U.S.
   government-tenanted properties, while the other three types were not
   shown. The findings of this study also suggest categories of green
   leasing clauses can contribute to defining green leasing and provide
   empirical evidence of green leasing in government-tenanted properties.
   Ultimately, this study produces arguments for possible reasoning behind
   the employment of some green lease categories but the lack of use of
   others, specifically in the U.S. office market and government-tenanted
   buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Fresh cow manure was chosen as a material to carry out anaerobic
   digestion experiments at different temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 37
   degrees C). First-order hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion kinetic
   models were separately fitted to the experimental data. The results
   showed that the linear fitting R2 values for the first-order hydrolysis
   model were greater than 0.90, indicating that the first-order hydrolysis
   model agreed well with the cow manure anaerobic digestion processes at
   different temperatures. The low-temperature hydrolysis rate constants k
   were smaller than zero, and smaller k values appeared at lower
   temperatures, indicating that the activity of hydrolytic microorganisms
   was inhibited at low temperatures, and the hydrolysis rates decreased.
   The (lnym+ lnk) values at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C were 0.7062, 1.0922,
   and 1.5705, respectively, indicating that the elevation of temperature
   gradually improved methane production performance. At medium
   temperatures, this value reached 2.5341 and was ca. 68.10\% higher than
   that at 25 degrees C. The Gompertz and logistic equations were adopted
   for the nonlinear fitting of the relationship between cumulative methane
   output and time at different temperatures, and all the R-2 values
   exceeded 0.99. Except the group at 15 degrees C agreeing with the
   logistic equation, the other three groups followed the Gompertz
   equation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, in vivo animal experiments with 12 nude mice bearing
   breast-cancer-patient-tissue-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors were
   performed aiming to verify the imaging capability of a novel
   miniaturized fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) endoscope, in
   combination with targeted nanoparticle-near-infrared (NIR) dye
   conjugates. Tumor-bearing mice were divided into two groups by
   systematic injection with urokinase plasminogen activator
   receptor-targeted (n = 7) and nontargeted (n = 5) imaging nanoprobes as
   a contrast agent, respectively. Each mouse was imaged at 6, 24, and 48 h
   following the injection of nanoprobes using the FMT endoscope. The
   results show that systemic delivery of targeted nanoprobes produced a
   4-fold enhancement in fluorescence signals from tumors, compared with
   tumors that received nontargeted nanoprobes. This study indicates that
   our miniaturized FMT endoscope, coupled with the targeted
   nanoparticle-NIR dye conjugates as a contrast agent, has high
   sensitivity and specificity, and thus great potential to be used for
   image-guided detection and removal of a primary tumor and local
   metastatic tumors during surgery.}},

   Segmentation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The perception system has become a topic of great importance for
   autonomous vehicles, as high accuracy and real-time performance can
   ensure safety in complex urban scenarios. Clustering is a fundamental
   step for parsing point cloud due to the extensive input data (over
   100,000 points) of a wide variety of complex objects. It is still
   challenging to achieve high precision real-time performance with limited
   vehicle-mounted computing resources, which need to balance the accuracy
   and processing time. We propose a method based on a Two-Layer-Graph
   (TLG) structure, which can be applied in a real autonomous vehicle under
   urban scenarios. TLG can describe the point clouds hierarchically, we
   use a range graph to represent point clouds and a set graph for point
   cloud sets, which reduce both processing time and memory consumption. In
   the range graph, Euclidean distance and the angle of the sensor position
   with two adjacent vectors (calculated from continuing points to
   different direction) are used as the segmentation standard, which use
   the local concave features to distinguish different objects close to
   each other. In the set graph, we use the start and end position to
   express the whole set of continuous points concisely, and an improved
   Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm is designed to update categories of
   point cloud sets between different channels. This method is evaluated on
   real vehicles and major datasets. The results show that TLG succeeds in
   providing a real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame), and a
   high segmentation accuracy rate (93.64\%) for traffic objects in the
   road of urban scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesizing a CT image from an available MR image has recently emerged
   as a key goal in radiotherapy treatment planning for cancer patients.
   CycleGANs have achieved promising results on unsupervised MR-to-CT image
   synthesis; however, because they have no direct constraints between
   input and synthetic images, cycleGANs do not guarantee structural
   consistency between these two images. This means that anatomical
   geometry can be shifted in the synthetic CT images, clearly a highly
   undesirable outcome in the given application. In this paper, we propose
   a structure-constrained cycleGAN for unsupervised MR-to-CT synthesis by
   defining an extra structure-consistency loss based on the modality
   independent neighborhood descriptor. We also utilize a spectral
   normalization technique to stabilize the training process and a
   self-attention module to model the long-range spatial dependencies in
   the synthetic images. Results on unpaired brain and abdomen MR-to-CT
   image synthesis show that our method produces better synthetic CT images
   in both accuracy and visual quality as compared to other unsupervised
   synthesis methods. We also show that an approximate affine
   pre-registration for unpaired training data can improve synthesis
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Electric trains typically travel across the railway networks in an
   inter-provincial, inter-city and intra-city manner. The electric train
   generally serves as a load/source in tractive/brake mode, through which
   power networks and railway networks are closely coupled and mutually
   influenced. Based on the operational mode of rail trains and the
   characteristics of their load power, this paper proposes a coordinated
   optimal decision-making method of demand response for controllable load
   of rail trains and energy storage systems. First, a coordinated approach
   of dynamically adjusting the load of the controllable rail train in
   considering the driving comfort and energy storage battery is designed.
   Secondly, under the time conditions that satisfy the train's operational
   diagram, the functional relationship between the train speed and the
   load power is presented. Based on this, in considering the constraints
   of the train's arrival time, driving speed, motor power, and driving
   comfort, the capacity of energy storage batteries and other constraints,
   an optimization model for demand response in managing the traction power
   supply system under a two-part price and time-of-use (TOU) price is
   proposed. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption costs of
   rail transit trains, and optimize the speed trajectory of rail trains,
   the load power of traction system, and the output of energy storage
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The traveling salesman problem (TSP) plays an important role in the
   field of transportation and logistics. While most studies focus on
   developing algorithms to find the shortest path and explore the average
   length of the shortest paths, the degree to which the shortest path
   deviates from its mean has not been studied. The study of deviation is
   important because it has implications for travel time reliability.
   Previous studies have used various indicators to measure this deviation,
   mainly including standard deviation, quantiles, and buffer time index
   (BTI). Therefore, this study aims to develop an empirical model to
   estimate the standard deviation, quantiles, and BTI for the optimal TSP
   tour. Experiments are performed to find the shortest path connecting N
   customers, which are generated randomly in a specified service area,
   using a genetic algorithm. The service area is a rectangle with ratio of
   length to width ranging from 1:1 to 8:1. Two types of lengths are
   considered: Euclidean and Manhattan. The number of customers considered
   ranges from 10 to 100 with intervals of 10. In the experimental design,
   the customers are generated randomly 500 times. The quartiles and
   standard deviations of the 500 shortest paths are recorded. The BTI is
   also calculated. Regression models are developed to estimate quartiles,
   standard deviation, and BTI using number of customers and parameters of
   service area as predictive variables. The models perform well on the
   testing data set. The constructed models can be used to estimate the
   standard deviation and reliability of travel time.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods for the edge extraction of optical pupils in optical
   scanning holographic systems were proposed, and the holographic
   information of objects was obtained based on double pupil heterodyne
   detection. First, LG beam-axis cone lens pupil and aperture filter were
   used as two pupils to form a composite light field, which was able to
   scan the object to extract edge information. Second, when the aperture
   filter was unchanged, the other pupil used a power amplitude-type pupil
   with function distribution and edge information extraction. Computer
   simulation experiments show that the edge extraction qualities of the
   two pupils described in this paper are improved in comparison with the
   use of a ring pupil, and digital image processing is not required, which
   simplifies the experimental steps.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion is one of the most severe global environmental problems,
   and soil erosion surveys are the scientific basis for planning soil
   conservation and ecological development. To improve soil erosion
   sampling survey methods and accurately and rapidly estimate the actual
   rates of soil erosion, a Pan-Third Pole region was taken as an example
   to study a methodology of soil erosion sampling survey based on
   high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. The sampling units were
   designed using a stratified variable probability systematic sampling
   method. The spatiotemporal characteristics of soil erosion and
   conservation were taken into account, and finer-resolution freely
   available and accessible images in Google Earth were used. Through the
   visual interpretation of the free high-resolution remote sensing images,
   detailed information on land use and soil conservation measures was
   obtained. Then, combined with the regional soil erosion factor data
   products, such as rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility
   factor (K), and slope length and steepness factor (LS), the soil loss
   rates of some sampling units were calculated. The results show that,
   based on these high-resolution remote sensing images, the land use and
   soil conservation measures of the sampling units can be quickly and
   accurately extracted. The interpretation accuracy in 4 typical cross
   sections was more than 80\%, and sampling accuracy, described by
   histogram similarity in 11 large sampling sites, show that the landuse
   of sampling uints can represent the structural characteristics of
   regional land use. Based on the interpretation of data from the sample
   survey and the regional soil erosion factor data products, the
   calculation of the soil erosion rate can be completed quickly. The
   calculation results can reflect the actual conditions of soil erosion
   better than the potential soil erosion rates calculated by using the
   coarse-resolution remote sensing method. (C) 2020 International Research

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{One puzzling phenomenon in glass physics is the so-called `shadow glass
   transition' which is an anomalous heat-absorbing process below the real
   glass transition and influences glass properties. However, it has yet to
   be entirely characterized, let alone fundamentally understood.
   Conventional calorimetry detects it in limited heating rates. Here, with
   the chip-based fast scanning calorimetry, we study the dynamics of the
   shadow glass transition over four orders of magnitude in heating rates
   for 24 different hyper-quenched metallic glasses. We present evidence
   that the shadow glass transition correlates with the secondary (beta)
   relaxation: (i) The shadow glass transition and the beta relaxation
   follow the same temperature-time dependence, and both merge with the
   primary relaxation at high temperature. (ii) The shadow glass transition
   is more obvious in glasses with pronounced beta relaxation, and vice
   versa; their magnitudes are proportional to each other. Our findings
   suggest that the shadow glass transition signals the thermodynamics of
   beta relaxation in hyper-quenched metallic glasses.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The utility of social media in oral and maxillofacial surgery
   (OMS) residency programs has never been investigated, despite the
   increasing popularity of such platforms in academic medicine. As a
   specialty that strives for constant innovation, it is important for OMS
   programs to participate in the emerging concept of incorporating social
   media into medical and surgical education. Therefore, this study aimed
   to evaluate the use of Instagram in OMS residency programs in the United
   States.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of Instagram search data was performed.
   The Instagram accounts of OMS residency programs were searched, and
   their metrics were retrieved from June 1 to June 5, 2020. Factors
   correlated with the total number of followers were identified. The use
   of Instagram in OMS residency programs was compared with that in other
   related dental and surgical residency programs.
   Results: Only 17 (18.7\%) of 91 OMS residency programs had an Instagram
   account. The number of programs with Instagram accounts exhibited linear
   growth (R-2 = 0.98) since December 2018. The median number of followers
   was 326 (range, 94 to 2,152), and the median number of posts was 9
   (range, 2 to 40). The number of Instagram followers was positively
   correlated with the number of accounts followed, the number of total
   posts, and the number of educational posts, and it was negatively
   correlated with the Instagram engagement rate. Instagram presence did
   not differ among residency programs for orthodontics (18.2\%),
   periodontics (5.5\%), and OMS (P = .067). However, Instagram presence in
   OMS residency programs was significantly lower than that in plastic
   surgery (74.7\%; P < .001) and otolaryngology residency programs
   (35.0\%; P = .011).
   Conclusions: Instagram use in OMS residency programs is growing but is
   significantly lower than that in related surgical fields. This may
   represent a missed opportunity for promoting collaboration and
   efficiently delivering useful information to trainees. (C) 2020 American

Abstract = {{Background: The use of robotic systems for thyroidectomy has increased
   as it enables more diverse approaches than the conventional open method.
   The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of Transoral
   Robotic Thyroidectomy (TORT) and Bilateral Axillo-Breast
   Approach-Robotic Thyroidectomy (BABA-RT).
   Methods: This study was designed as a retrospective study. The included
   patients who underwent surgery by BABA-RT or TORT approach in our
   facility between 2008 and 2018. All surgeries were performed by one
   surgeon. Total thyroidectomy with central node dissection (CND) was
   performed only if tumors were >4 cm and had extrathyroidal extension,
   clinically apparent lymph node or distant metastases. In all other
   cases, lobectomy +/- CND was performed.
   Results: The group treated with TORT comprised 248 patients and the
   group that underwent BABA-RT had 316 patients. The number of retrieved
   lymph node (LN) was higher in the TORT group (4.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 4.2 +/-
   4.9; P=0.01). There were no significant differences between the TORT and
   BABA-RT groups in concerns to the location of the tumor. Postoperative
   hospital stay was also shorter in the TORT group when compared with the
   BABA-RT group (2.8 +/- 0.90 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.97 days, P=0.012). Operative
   time was significantly shorter in the TORT group (204.11 +/- 40.19 vs.
   243.78 +/- 57.16 min, P<0.01)
   Conclusions: When comparing a total of 248 patients treated with TORT
   versus 316 with BABA-RT. TORT not only has advantages in better cosmetic
   outcomes with minimized postoperative scars, but also shows comparable,
   or even superior, surgical outcomes with shorter operation time than the
   BABA-RT procedure.}},

Abstract = {{We report the unique phase behavior and structural transitions in thin
   films of a distorted network (DNW) nanostructure, which is an
   equilibrium phase contained in the bulk of a nearly-symmetric deuterated
   polystyrene-block-poly (methyl methacrylate), dPS-b-PMMA, block
   copolymer. The DNW is due to a broad dispersity for the PMMA block.
   Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, neutron reflectometry,
   atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques
   were used to characterize thermally-annealed dPS-b-PMMA ultrathin films
   with neutral boundaries at both the free surface and substrate
   interface. Brief thermal annealing imposed on the ultrathin films leads
   to perpendicular lamellae (L-perpendicular to). Upon increasing the
   duration of thermal annealing, the dPS-b-PMMA ultrathin films exhibit
   thickness dependence of phase transition kinetics and different
   irreversible routes of phase transition. As a result, the protracted
   thermal annealing of the thin films of various thicknesses produces
   either hexagonal arrays of perpendicular PMMA cylinders
   (HEX-C-perpendicular to) or disordered PMMA nanostructures (DIS). The
   phase transition routes and kinetics in ultrathin films suggest various
   possibilities to obtain diverse nanoscale patterns via thin film
   self-assembly.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the flow and heat
   transfer of a double fractional Maxwell fluid with a second order slip
   model. The fractional governing equations are solved numerically by
   using the finite difference method. By comparing the analytical
   solutions of special boundary conditions, the validity of the present
   numerical method is examined. The effects of the two slip parameters and
   the fractional parameters on the velocity and temperature distribution
   are presented graphically and discussed. The results reveal that the
   fractional Maxwell fluid exhibits a stronger viscosity or elasticity for
   different fractional parameters, and the oscillation phenomenon will
   gradually decrease as expected with an increase in slip parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, anthocyanins were successfully acylated with lauric acid
   using Novozym 435 lipase, and the corresponding products were confirmed
   to have higher stability. As novel synthetic compounds, their
   toxicological safety has not been evaluated. Therefore, acute, subacute
   and subchronic toxicities of anthocyanin-lauric acid derivatives (ALDs)
   were investigated while their antioxidant activities were also evaluated
   in vitro. The acute toxicity results showed that the 50\% lethal dose
   (LD50) of ALDs in mice was >10 g kg(-1). Subsequently, the subacute
   toxicity test was conducted by oral administration of ALDs at doses of
   0.63, 1.25 and 2.50 g kg(-1) for 28 days. No adverse effect of ALDs on
   body weight, food/water intake, organ coefficient and histology was
   observed. Though there were some fluctuations in AST and ALT, the tested
   biochemical parameters were maintained within the normal ranges. The
   subchronic toxicity test results demonstrated that less than 0.60 g of
   ALDs per kg BW intake did not affect mortality, body weight, food/water
   intake, gross pathology, histology, hematology and serum biochemistry.
   Furthermore, cyanidin-3-(6 `'-dodecanoyl)-glucoside, the main component
   of ALDs, had a beneficial reducing power and a strong DPPH, ABTS(+), and
   O2- scavenging activity. This study provides an imperative reference to
   the safety of ALDs, suggesting their application as novel colorants or
   antioxidants in food and therapeutics.}},

Title = {{Extracting Family History of Patients From Clinical Narratives:
   Exploring an End-to-End Solution With Deep Learning Models}},
Journal = {{JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients' family history (FH) is a critical risk factor
   associated with numerous diseases. However, FH information is not well
   captured in the structured database but often documented in clinical
   narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to
   extract patients' FH from clinical narratives. In 2019, the National NLP
   Clinical Challenge (n2c2) organized shared tasks to solicit NLP methods
   for FH information extraction.
   Objective: This study presents our end-to-end FH extraction system
   developed during the 2019 n2c2 open shared task as well as the new
   transformer-based models that we developed after the challenge. We seek
   to develop a machine learning-based solution for FH information
   extraction without task-specific rules created by hand.
   Methods: We developed deep learning-based systems for FH concept
   extraction and relation identification. We explored deep learning models
   including long short-term memory-conditional random fields and
   bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as well
   as developed ensemble models using a majority voting strategy. To
   further optimize performance, we systematically compared 3 different
   strategies to use BERT output representations for relation
   identification.
   Results: Our system was among the top-ranked systems (3 out of 21) in
   the challenge. Our best system achieved micro-averaged F1 scores of
   0.7944 and 0.6544 for concept extraction and relation identification,
   respectively. After challenge, we further explored new transformer-based
   models and improved the performances of both subtasks to 0.8249 and
   0.6775, respectively. For relation identification, our system achieved a
   performance comparable to the best system (0.6810) reported in the
   challenge.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing deep
   learning methods to extract FH information from clinical narratives.}},

Abstract = {{The vehicle scanning method (VSM), an indirect approach for bridge
   measurement, has attracted intensive attention since it was proposed. By
   this method, a moving test vehicle is employed to detect the
   ``mechanical{''} properties of the bridge, e.g. frequencies, mode
   shapes, damages, etc., utilizing the interaction between the two
   substructures. Compared with the conventional direct approach that
   requires quite a few sensors and data loggers to be fitted on the
   bridge, the advantage of the VSM is obvious: mobility, economy, and
   efficiency. As for railways, the broader vehicle-based techniques have
   long been used to detect the ``geometrical{''} properties of the track,
   such as track profiles and rail conditions. Relatively little use has
   been made of the interaction between the moving vehicle/train and the
   track/bridge. This paper is a state-of-the-art report of the VSM's
   applications to highway bridges and the vehicle-based techniques to
   railway tracks. It starts with a summary of the pioneering works by Yang
   and co-workers on the VSM. Then, the applications of the techniques to
   highway bridges and railway tracks will be separately reviewed.
   Conclusions will be made, along with future research directions, at the
   end of the paper.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites templated by sodium alginate
   toward enhanced catalytic activity for esterification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{292}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchical zeolites containing secondary mesopores exhibit excellent
   catalytic performance in the liquid phase reaction due to their low
   diffusion resistance. In this study, hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite
   (ZSM-5-SA) has been successfully prepared via sodium alginate (SA) as
   macro- and mesoporous template. ZSM-5-SA possessed larger particle size
   and enhanced crystallinity owing to SA shortening the nucleation period
   of zeolite crystals. The introduction of SA also promotes Al atoms to
   enter ZSM-5 zeolite, where the particle size and Al content gradually
   increase with increasing SA concentration. Compared to conventional
   ZSM-5 zeolite, ZSM-5-SA possesses higher catalytic activity toward the
   esterification of acetic acid with n-butyl alcohol due to the

Abstract = {{Facing the increasingly severe energy and environmental problems,
   platooning of multiple vehicles has great potential for sustainability
   of intelligent transportation systems. This study develops a novel
   hierarchical ECACC strategy with energy-saving achievements by
   conducting the ecological velocity trajectory planning of the leading
   vehicle based on dynamic programming and car-following driving of the
   rest of the vehicles in the platoon based on combined
   feedforward-feedback control. The main purpose is to reduce the energy
   consumption of multiple vehicles in intelligent transportation systems
   with consideration of trip time and car-following performance. The
   optimal velocity planning uses an innovative integrated longitudinal and
   lateral vehicle dynamics approach where both the lateral stability and
   energy efficiency in continuous curved roads are guaranteed at the same
   time. The results show that the proposed ECACC in energy-optimal mode
   can reduce energy consumption by up to 38.1\% compared to conventional
   energy-optimal fixed speed cruising. Moreover, the connected automated
   vehicle platoon presents better car-following performance with string
   stability as opposed to the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control based on
   feedback control and model predictive control. The results indicate the
   great potential of the proposed ECACC strategy to further improve the
   sustainability of intelligent transportation systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier

   from the laboratory and a large shallow lake}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microcystis development in most temperate lakes shows an annual cycle
   that is mainly triggered by water temperature and includes four stages.
   This study aims to identify the optimum growth temperature and the
   temperature thresholds for recruitment and overwintering in Microcystis
   in Lake Taihu, based on field data and experiments at the cellular and
   genetic level on Microcystis under a simulated temperature condition.
   The field investigation showed that the cyanobacterial biomass began to
   increase at 11-15 degrees C in spring, reached a peak at 20-30 degrees C
   and remained at a low level after the water temperature declined below 6
   degrees C. The simulation experiment found that the recovery of gene
   expression, photosynthesis and growth in Microcystis cells occurred at
   11-14 degrees C and increased to an appreciable level after the
   temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. Microcystis cells stopped growing and
   maintained low photosynthetic activity and gene expression when the
   temperature declined to 10 degrees C or lower. These results suggest
   that Microcystis in Lake Taihu begin recruitment at 11-14 degrees C in
   spring and grow vigorously at 20-30 degrees C, then overwinter at 10
   degrees C or lower in winter. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{567-585}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper starts with the social and moral implications of wall in
   history and in the contemporary world, to usher in the early Confucian
   discourse on wall and gate. The Confucian discourse implies that walls
   either actual, virtual or symbolic are there to defend and/or to
   separate, while gates enable the managed access to and opening-up the
   self-imposed insularity or moderate the self-centred exclusiveness that
   walls imply. By way of reinterpretation and reconstruction, we will
   extract from a variety of Confucian discussions the ethical awareness
   that however strongly built, walls must be associated with gates, and
   that the wall and the gate are therefore locked in mutuality to make
   possible the reality of interconnectedness between the inside and the
   outside and between the self and the other. It will be argued that by
   using ethical virtues as tools to moderate separation and exclusiveness,
   Confucian discourses highlight the dynamics of the self-other
   relationship, and establishes an ethics that may well be still
   applicable to contemporary situations and can be drawn upon to help
   dissolve the tension between the values of populist self-centrism and
   those of globalist interconnectedness.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the protective effects of quercetin on peripheral
   neurotoxicity caused by vincristine, which is used effectively in the
   treatment of various types of cancers, were investigated by using
   different techniques. In the study, for 12 days, male Sprague Dawley
   rats were given 25 and 50 mg/kg doses of quercetin orally and were
   administered a 0.1 mg/kg dose of vincristine (a total cumulative dose of
   1.2 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 min later. The protein levels of nuclear
   factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
   NAD(P) H quinone dehydrogenase-1 (NQO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) were measured with
   ELISA; the immunopositivity of 8-hydroxy-2 `-deoxyguanosine (8- OHdG)
   and caspase 3 were determined with immunohistochemistry; the mRNA
   transcript levels of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase
   (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1),
   activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), glucose-regulated protein 78
   (GRP78), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2),
   caspase 3, protein kinase B1/2 (Akt-1/2), and forkhead box transcription
   factor, class O1 (FOXO1) were determined with RT-PCR. The reduction of
   Nrf2 levels and HO-1 and NQO1 activities in the sciatic nerve tissue,
   the increase in the levels of 8- OHdG, and the increase in the levels of
   GFAP and NF-kappa B caused by vincristine was observed to cause
   oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, and
   inflammation, respectively. Additionally, vincristine was determined to
   cause ER stress and apoptosis by increasing PERK, IRE1, ATF-6, and GRP78
   and caspase 3 and Bax expressions and by decreasing Bcl-2 expressions.
   Vincristine causing Akt inhibition also shows that it prevents neuronal
   survival. However, quercetin was determined to relieve oxidative stress,
   oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, inflammation, ER stress, and
   apoptosis caused by vincristine and enable Akt activation. These results
   show that in rats, quercetin may have a protective effect against
   peripheral neurotoxicity caused by vincristine.}},

Abstract = {{Associations of dwarf galaxies are loose systems composed exclusively of
   dwarf galaxies. These systems were identified in the Local Volume for
   the first time more than 30 yr ago. We study these systems in the
   cosmological framework of the Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM)
   model. We consider the Small MultiDark Planck simulation and populate
   its dark matter haloes by applying the semi-analytic model of galaxy
   formation SAG. We identify galaxy systems using a friends-of-friends
   algorithm with a linking length equal to b = 0.4Mpc h(-1) to reproduce
   the size of dwarf galaxy associations detected in the Local Volume. Our
   samples of dwarf systems are built up removing those systems that have
   one or more galaxies with stellar mass larger than a maximum threshold
   M-max. We analyse three different samples defined by
   log(10)(M-max{[}M-circle dot h(-1)]) = 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5. On average,
   our systems have typical sizes of similar to 0.2Mpc h(-1), velocity
   dispersion of similar to 30km s(-1), and estimated total mass of similar
   to 10(11)M(circle dot) h(-1). Such large typical sizes suggest that
   individual members of a given dwarf association reside in different dark
   matter haloes and are generally not substructures of any other halo.
   Indeed, in more than 90 per cent of our dwarf systems their individual
   members inhabit different dark matter haloes, while only in the
   remaining 10 per cent members do reside in the same halo. Our results
   indicate that the Lambda CDM model can naturally reproduce the existence
   and properties of dwarf galaxies' associations without much difficulty.}},

Abstract = {{This empirical study attempts to examine the effect of environmental
   orientation (EO) on environmental performance (EP). Mediating role of
   green business strategies (GBS) in this relationship is also tested.
   Furthermore, the moderating role of top management environmental
   awareness (TMEA) in the relationship between EO and GBS is also
   analyzed. Simple random sampling technique was used for data collection
   purposes. Data was collected from managers of 126 manufacturing
   industries of Pakistan. These industries include pharmaceutical
   instruments, office machinery, furniture and fixtures, electrical
   equipment, and automobile accessories. Correlation, linear regression
   and structural equation modeling techniques were used for data analysis.
   Findings revealed a direct effect of EO on GBS and EP. In addition, the
   results confirm that GBS positively mediate between EO and EP. It also
   founds that TMEA strengthens the direct effect of EO on GBS. Although
   the empirical evidence is reasonably established that EO has a
   substantial contribution for EP, however, in the existing studies, there
   is a lack of discussion on the links between EO, development of GBP and
   improvement of EP in the context of manufacturing industries of the
   developing countries like Pakistan. The results of the study suggest
   that organizations are required to put more attention towards
   stakeholders' requirements and strategies that ensure the protection of
   the natural environment. Hence, EO in term of internal orientation and
   external orientation are pertinent to formulate GBS in order to improve
   EP in a more appropriate way. The data for the study was collected from
   manufacturing businesses; therefore, the result of the current study may
   not be generalizable to all industries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Study designObservational.ObjectivesTo report on the rate of major
   complications following spinal fusion and instrumentation to treat
   spinal deformity in patients with cerebral palsy (CP).Summary of
   background dataUnderstanding the risk of major complications following
   the surgical treatment of spine deformities in patients with CP is
   critical.MethodsA prospectively collected, multicenter database of
   patients with CP who had surgical correction of their spinal deformity
   (scoliosis or kyphosis) was reviewed for all major complications.
   Patients with >= 2 year follow-up or who died <= 2 years of surgery were
   included. A complication was defined as major if it resulted in
   reoperation, re-admission to the hospital, prolongation of the hospital
   stay, was considered life-threatening, or resulted in residual
   disability. Overall complication and revision rates were calculated for
   the perioperative (Peri-op; occurring <= 90 days postoperative) and
   delayed postoperative (Delayed;>90 days) time periods.ResultsTwo hundred
   and fifty-seven patients met inclusion. Seventy-eight (30\%) patients
   had a major complication, 18 (7\%) had>1. There were 92 (36\%) major
   complications; 64 (24.9\%) occurred Peri-op. The most common Peri-op
   complications were wound (n=16, 6.2\%) and pulmonary issues (n=28,
   10.9\%), specifically deep infections (n=12, 4.7\%) and prolonged
   ventilator support (n=21, 8.2\%). Delayed complications (n=28, 10.9\%)
   were primarily deep infections (n=8, 3.1\%) and instrumentation-related
   (n=6, 2.3\%). There were 42 additional surgeries for an overall
   unplanned return to the operating room rate of 16\% (Peri-op: 8.6\%,
   Delayed: 7.8\%). Thirty-six (14.0\%) reoperations were spine related
   surgeries (wound or instrumentation-related). Eleven (4.3\%) patients
   died between 3 months to 5.6 years postoperatively; 4 occurred <= 1 year
   of surgery. Two deaths were directly related to the spinal deformity
   surgery.ConclusionSpinal deformity surgery in CP patients with greater

Abstract = {{Introduction: Fasting has certain effects on metabolic and
   anthropometric parameters in diabetic patients. It is therefore,
   necessary for patients to receive proper instructions about their
   physical activities, eating habits, blood glucose monitoring and
   medications.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fasting on
   metabolic and anthropometric indices in type II diabetic patients.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study was
   performed during Ramadan 2018. The study population consisted of 40 type
   II diabetic patients (33 females and 7 males) who wished to fast. They
   started to follow given instructions on their physical activity, eating
   habits, blood glucose monitoring, and medications before Ramadan.
   Anthropometric variables were measured pre and post-Ramadan. Fasting
   Blood Glucose (FBG), Glucose 2 Hour Postprandial (2h PPG), glycosylated
   haemoglobin (HbA1C), and the lipids profile were assessed before and
   after Ramadan. FPG and 2h PPG were also evaluated on the fifteenth day
   of Ramadan. Data were presented as mean +/- SD. Paired t-test was
   employed and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
   significant.
   Results: After completion of the study, anthropometric variables of
   patients, including weight (74.9 +/- 12.7 vs. 73. 0 +/- 13.1 Kg,
   p<0.001), BMI (29.9 +/- 5.2 vs. 29.0 +/- 5.1 Kg/m(2), p=0.042), waist
   circumference (106.2 +/- 11.8 vs. 105.3 +/- 11.6 cm, p<0.001), conicity
   index (9.94 +/- 0.96 vs 9.80 +/- 0.99, p=0.085), systolic blood pressure
   (118.5 +/- 10.6 vs. 113.8 +/- 9.4 mmHg, p=0.018), Diastolic blood
   pressure (72.0 +/- 7.9 vs. 68.3 +/- 7.0 mmHg, p=0.02) and FPG (125.1 +/-
   27.4 vs. 105.2 +/- 21.4 mg/dL, p<0.001) decreased significantly.
   However, serum triglyceride increased significantly (127.5 +/- 45.5 vs.
   166.5 +/- 53.5 mg/dL, p<0.001) after fasting compared to pre-Ramadan
   measurements. Changes in other variables were not statistically
   significant.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that fasting had
   beneficial effect on fasting blood glucose level and anthropometric
   parameters in type II diabetic patients.}},

   Holistic Relocation of Historical Buildings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Architectural assets, regarded as the common heritage of the whole of
   humanity, can be passed onto following generations without losing their
   structural integrity and authentic architectural characteristics by
   means of conservation and preservation activities. Although the
   historical, aesthetic, and authenticity values of architectural heritage
   come into greater prominence than many other criteria, and require
   preservation in the locations they were originally constructed in, some
   factors make this impossible. Where there is no other choice, relocation
   of historical buildings to a new location is today accepted as one of
   the preservation methods. Owing to their nonlinear material properties,
   the relocation of historical buildings that are constructed with a brick
   or stone masonry system creates a serious risk as regards to their
   structural integrity. The process is planned and the optimum method of
   relocation is specified according to the geometric and material
   properties of the historical buildings. This study examined the
   structural integrity problems that may occur due to possible human- or
   nature-caused geometrical irregularities during relocation. Numerical
   models and analysis obtained by the finite element method are used in
   order to determine the possible results of these unexpected cases within
   the scope of the proposed relocation scenario. The inspiration for the
   numerical models and relocation scenario was drawn from an endangered
   monument: ``Orta Kapi{''} (the Middle Door) in Hasankeyf, which will be
   flooded soon due to an ongoing dam construction project. Findings of
   this study could help the planning of relocation methods that can enable
   more suitable executions of architectural heritage preservation by
   relocation. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   the sample surface. This paper presents a new ECT method for subsurface
   defect detection and quantification. Eddy currents with continuously
   varying frequency in a selected frequency band is induced in the
   conductive sample by using a chirp modulated excitation scheme. The
   frequency band of the chirp waveform is chosen so that the penetration
   depth of eddy current in the selected frequency band covers the
   thickness of the sample under test. The presence of a defect will
   disturb the distribution of the induced eddy currents. This disturbance
   is measured in terms of a varying magnetic field using an array of
   tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors. A C-scan image is obtained by
   linearly scanning the specimen. The footprint of the defect is
   calculated using spatial features of the C-scan image while the depth of
   the defect is estimated by analyzing the frequency characteristics of
   the measured chirp signal. A three-dimensional estimate of the
   dimensions of any subsurface defect can be obtained using the empirical
   procedure. The operating principle of this method is studied with a
   finite element method (FEM) model and then validated experimentally with
   a prototype array probe consisting of 180 TMR sensors. Thanks to its
   high sensitivity, the TMR sensors are suitable for measuring the weak
   low frequency magnetic field signal caused by a deep defect. The spacing
   between each two adjacent sensors is as small as 0.5 mm providing a
   magnetic field image with fine spatial resolution, which is beneficial
   for defect quantification. An aluminum sample with embedded defects was
   tested using the prototype probe. It is seen that the proposed scheme
   utilizing spatial and frequency domain features is capable of
   quantitatively characterizing subsurface defects.}},
