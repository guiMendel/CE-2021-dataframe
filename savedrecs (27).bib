Abstract = {{In shallow lagoons, there is a much greater ecological diversity than
   fully marine water bodies and communities comprise of representatives
   from both freshwaters and coastal sea In the present study, an attempt
   has been made, through mathematical modelling, to study the effect of
   changing salinity on freshwater and marine plankton The model proposed
   here is a five-compartment (Nutrient (N), Freshwater phytoplankton (P),
   Marine phytoplankton (Q), Zooplankton (Z) and Detritus (D)) ecological
   model The unique feature of the model is its ability to simulate
   plankton dynamics, as a response to salinity variations, with freshwater
   and marine species of phytoplankton represented separately Numerical
   experiments and sensitivity analysis show that changes in salinity
   levels, nutrients and grazing are the controlling factors For the case
   of intermediate salinity (17 psu approx), the nutrient availability and
   palatability by zooplankton play a significant role It is in this case,
   the two species are found to coexist As a case study, the model is
   applied to Chilika Lagoon (19 degrees 28 ` N-19 degrees 54 ` N and 85
   degrees 06 ` E-85 degrees 36 ` E), the largest brackish water lagoon on
   the east coast of India which has distinct and variable characteristics
   The model is able to reproduce most of the significant characteristics
   of the phytoplankton distribution in Chilika, viz, bimodal oscillations,
   major plankton peaks and increased productivity after the salinity level
   was increased due to the opening of a new mouth connecting Bay of Bengal

Title = {{Anti-cosmopolitan liberalism: Isaiah Berlin, Jacob Talmon and the
   dilemma of national identity}},
Journal = {{NATIONS AND NATIONALISM}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The debate between contemporary cosmopolitans and advocates of
   nationalism is hardly new. Nevertheless, much of it is based on the
   erroneous assumption that cosmopolitanism should be seen as an outgrowth
   of liberalism, and that both should be considered as the complete
   conceptual opposites of nationalism. In this article I focus on two of
   the post-war Jewish anglophile intellectuals who took part in this
   debate during the Cold War years: the Oxonian liberal philosopher Sir
   Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) and the Israeli historian Jacob L. Talmon
   (1916-80). I use their examples to argue that the dividing line between
   cosmopolitans and advocates of nationalism should not be regarded as
   signifying the distinction between liberals and anti-liberals; in fact,
   this debate also took place within the camp of the liberal thinkers
   themselves. I divide my discussion into three parts. Firstly, I examine
   Berlin's and Talmon's positions within the post-war anti-totalitarian
   discourse, which came to be known as `liberalism of fear'. Secondly, I
   show how a sense of Jewish identity, combined with deep Zionist
   convictions, induced both thinkers to divorce anti-nationalist
   cosmopolitanism - which they regarded as a hollow, illusionary ideal
   associated with impossible assimilationist yearnings - from the liberal
   idea. I conclude by suggesting that, although neither man had ever
   developed a systematic theoretical framework to deal with the complex
   interactions between ethno-nationalism, liberal individualism and
   multiculturalism, Berlin's vision of pluralism provides the foundations
   for building such a theory, in which liberalism and nationalism become
   complementary rather than conflicting notions.}},

Abstract = {{Current and future injector designs for diesel engines approach
   pressures of greater than 100 MPa. However, the high-pressure physical
   properties, such as viscosity, of biologically derived diesel fuel
   (biodiesel) arc nearly absent in the literature. This study focuses on
   the viscosity of biodiesel samples, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs),
   derived from soybean oil, soybean oil from Vistive soybeans, canola oil,
   recycled canola oil that has been used in cooking and frying, and
   coconut oil from 283.15 to 373.15 K and pressures up to 131 MPa.
   Petroleum-derived diesel (ultra-low sulfur, number 2 diesel) has also
   been investigated to compare to the biodiesel samples. The viscosity of
   the samples increases linearly with pressure until approximately 35 MPa,
   followed by a higher order response to pressure. Except for
   coconut-oil-derived biodiesel, the biodiesel samples have viscosities
   that are greater than petroleum-derived diesel at both ambient and
   elevated pressures. However, at lower temperatures and high pressures,
   the diesel and biodiesel samples become more similar. The viscosity of
   the biodiesel samples with pressure can increase nearly 300\% over the
   pressure range investigated over their respective ambient-pressure
   viscosity; number 2 diesel increases up to similar to 400\% over similar
   pressures. The biodiesel samples at 283.15 K were found to experience
   pressure-induced cloud points (solid-liquid equilibrium) from 70 to 100
   MPa, which significantly increases their viscosity. The Tait-Litovitz
   equation was found to correlate the data very well over the large range
   of both temperature and pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Background Police service staff are at risk of occupational exposure to
   blood and body fluids with the consequent risk of blood-borne virus
   (BBV) infection.
   Aims To examine the types of occupational exposure incidents experienced
   by Scottish police service staff and to evaluate the post-incident
   management provided by their occupational health (OH) services.
   Methods Data were collected on the circumstances and the post-incident
   management of each incident reported to OH over 12 months. An expert
   panel reviewed the post-incident management provided by OH.
   Results The panel considered that the majority of cases of occupational
   exposure incurred little or no risk of BBV transmission. In general, the
   expert panel assessed the post-incident management provided by OH units
   serving the police as adequate and appropriate. However, some concerns
   were raised in relation to a small number of incorrect risk assessments
   and an inconsistent approach to hepatitis C virus (HCV) follow-up blood
   testing.
   Conclusions The study findings suggest that most Scottish police OH
   departments were providing adequate post-incident management. There is,
   however, a need for more clarity around BBV risk assessment terminology
   and development of a standardized HCV testing protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study was conducted to quantify activity level 2 years
   after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and identify explanatory
   variables measured at baseline (demographics, concomitant
   meniscal/articular cartilage injuries and their treatment) associated
   with activity level at short-term follow-up (2 years).
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: In 2002, the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON)
   consortium began enrolling patients undergoing anterior cruciate
   ligament reconstruction at 6 recruitment sites. The current study
   reports 2-year follow-up of patients enrolled in 2002. Participants
   completed a series of validated, patient-oriented questionnaires that
   included activity level assessment. Measurement of intra-articular
   pathology, techniques of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and
   secondary procedures were recorded at baseline by participating
   surgeons. Multivariable proportional odds ordinal logistic regression
   was used to assess predictors of activity level after adjusting for
   baseline patient characteristics. Interquartile range (IQR) odds ratios
   (ORs) are given for continuous variables. The fitted model that used ORs
   to specify predicted probabilities of exceeding any activity level was
   translated into predicted mean activity level.
   Results: Of the 446 patients who underwent unilateral anterior cruciate
   ligament reconstruction, follow-up was obtained on 393 (88\%). Male
   patients comprise 56\% of the cohort, with a median age of 23 years. The
   median and IQR International Knee Documentation Committee subjective
   score was 53 (range, 40-65) preoperatively and increased to 84 (range,
   74-92) 2 years postoperatively. Median and IQR activity level was 12
   (range, 8-16) at baseline, and declined to 9 (range, 3-13) at follow-up.
   The proportion of participants returning to the same or higher level of
   activity 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was
   45\%. After controlling for other baseline factors such as age, marital
   and student status, contralateral knee status, sport and competition
   level, and articular cartilage/meniscal injuries, factors associated
   with higher activity levels at 2 years were higher baseline activity
   (IQROR 5 3.84; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.98-7.43; P < .0001)
   and lower baseline body mass index (IQROR = 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.82; P
   = .027). The following baseline factors were associated with lower
   activity: female sex (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.91; P = .015), smoking
   within 6 months prior to surgery (OR = 0.55; 95\% CI, 0.33-0.92; P =
   0.023), and revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (OR 5
   0.41; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.83; P = .014). Factors presumably related to
   functional status of the knee such as the condition of the articular
   cartilage and menisci, as well as normalcy of the contralateral knee,
   were not predictive of activity level at 2 years.
   Conclusion: (1) Evaluation of posttreatment activity levels should
   control for patients' preoperative activity because this is a strong
   predictor of future activity. (2) Assuming physical activity is an
   important component of a healthy person, investigation of potential
   interventions to improve future activity could target modifiable
   exposures such as weight. (3) Further evaluation is needed to explore
   the association of sex and revision surgery on activity level following
   anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Object. In this study, the authors' goal was to minimize false-negative
   results in the detection of ruptured cerebral aneurysms.
   Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical and
   radiological information in consecutive adult patients admitted with
   acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to their hospital between January 1,
   2002, and January 1, 2008. Patients were grouped based on the presence
   or absence of a ruptured aneurysm, which was detected by catheter
   angiography. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to
   identify factors predicting detection of aneurysmal rupture by
   angiography.
   Results. The authors identified 199 patients (121 women {[}61\%]). A
   ruptured aneurysm was detected in 167 patients (84\%). In multivariate
   analysis, loss of consciousness at the onset of SAH was a strong
   predictive factor associated with detection of a ruptured aneurysm on
   subsequent angiography (OR > 100, p = 0.0002). The positive predictive
   value of loss of consciousness at the onset of SAH for detection of a
   ruptured aneurysm was 100\%.
   Conclusions. Loss of consciousness at the onset of SAH is highly
   predictive of aneurysm rupture. A negative CT angiography study in these
   patients may be a false result, and a high-quality catheter angiography
   should be performed. (DOI:10.3171/2010.4.JNS091932)}},

Abstract = {{P>Dendritic cell (DC) subsets can mediate diverse responses, but little
   is known about the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways in
   different human DC subsets. Despite expressing many TLRs in common, we
   found that in vitro-derived Langerhans cells (LCs) and monocyte-derived
   DCs (moDCs) undergo differential signalling events following TLR
   stimulation. TLR-stimulated LCs did not secrete interleukin (IL)-12p70
   and thus induced a T helper type 2 (Th2)-biased response. moDCs secrete
   high levels of IL-12p70 and induce a Th1 response. Stimulation of moDCs
   through TLR2 or TLR7/8 was able to induce phosphorylation of the
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular-signal-regulated
   kinase (ERK). However, phosphorylated ERK was not induced in
   TLR-stimulated LCs, suggesting an ERK-independent method of Th2 cell
   induction. Inhibition of p38 MAPK suppressed moDC maturation, but was
   much less effective at inhibiting LC maturation. Phosphatidylinositol-3
   kinase (PI3K) was also found to play a greater role in moDC survival
   compared with the LCs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays to compare
   the expression of signalling molecules in LCs and moDCs identified
   differences in TLR recognition molecules and cytokine response genes,
   suggesting that differential functional responses are probably mediated
   at the post-transcriptional level. Thus we have described differences in
   LC and moDC responses to TLR stimulation, and have identified key
   differences in ERK phosphorylation and the involvement of MAPK and PI3K.}},

Abstract = {{Several new destabilized borohydride systems were prepared by
   mechanochemical synthesis and characterized to determine their
   suitability for hydrogen storage. The mixtures included:
   Mg(BH4)(2)/Ca(BH4)(2); Mg(BH4)(2)/CaH2/3NaH; and Mg(BH4)(2)/CaH2;
   systems as well as a double cation hydride MnLi(BH4)(3). Temperature
   programmed desorption, TPD, analyses showed that the desorption
   temperature of Mg(BH4)(2) can be lowered by ball milling it with
   Ca(BH4)(2). The resulting mixture absorbed and released hydrogen with
   the pressure composition temperature, PCT, isotherm displaying a
   well-defined plateau region. The other two systems; Mg(BH4)(2)/CaH2 and
   Mg(BH4)(2)/CaH2/NaH, can also absorb and release hydrogen. The
   desorption enthalpies are all in the 84-88 kJ/mol range. These systems,
   however, are only partially reversible and lose some of their
   hydrogen-holding capacity after the initial desorption. A plausible
   explanation for this is that the mechanisms involve the formation of a
   (B12H12)(-2)-containing intermediate which has a high kinetic barrier to
   re-hydrogenation. TPD analysis also showed that the double cation
   material, MnLi(BH4)(3) can release hydrogen in the range of 130 degrees
   C but the process is irreversible. A Kissinger analysis of the first
   decomposition step in the differential thermal analysis, DTA, data
   showed that the activation energies for all the Mg(BH4)(2)-based
   borohydrides range from 115 to 167 kJ/mol. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat

Abstract = {{Variation in lifespan may be linked to geographic factors. Although
   latitudinal variation in lifespan has been studied for a number of
   species, altitude variation has received much less attention,
   particularly in insects. We measured the lifespan of different
   populations of the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa, along an altitudinal
   cline. For the different populations, we first measured the residual
   longevity of wild flies by captive cohort approach and compared the F-1
   generation from the same populations. We showed an increase in lifespan
   with higher altitude for a part of the data obtained. For the
   field-collected flies (F-0) the average remaining lifespan increased
   monotonically with altitude for males but not for females. For the F-1
   generation, the longevity of both males and females of the
   highest-altitude population was longer than for the two other
   lower-altitude populations. This relationship between altitude and
   lifespan may be explained by the effects of temperature on reproduction.
   Reproductive schedules in insects are linked to temperature: lower
   temperature, which is characteristic of high-altitude sites, generally
   slows down reproduction. Because of a strong trade-off between
   reproduction and longevity, we therefore observed a longer lifespan for
   the high-altitude populations. Other hypotheses, such as different
   predation rates in the different sites, are also discussed. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{The taeniid tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is the causative agent of
   echinococcal disease, a major zoonosis with worldwide distribution.
   Several efforts to establish an in vitro model of E. granulosus have
   been undertaken; however, many of them have been designed for
   Echinococcus multilocularis. In the present study, we have described and
   characterized a stable cell line obtained from E. granulosus bovine
   protoscoleces maintained 3 yr in vitro. Growth characterization,
   morphology by light, fluorescent and electronic microscopy, and
   karyotyping were carried out. Cell culture origin was confirmed by
   immunofluorescent detection of AgB4 antigen and by PCR for the
   mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase subunit 1 (DCO1) gene. Cells seeded
   in agarose biphasic culture resembled a cystic structure, similar to the
   one formed in secondary hosts. This cell line could be a useful tool to
   research equinococcal behavior, allowing additional physiological and
   pharmacological studies, such as the effect of growth factors,
   nutrients, and antiparasitic drugs on cell viability and growth and on
   cyst formation.}},

Title = {{Proplatelet formation deficit and megakaryocyte death contribute to

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inactivation of the mouse Myh9 gene (Myh9 Delta) or its
   mutation in MYH9-related diseases leads to macrothrombocytopenia.
   Paradoxically, previous studies using in vitro differentiated
   megakaryocytes showed an increased capacity for proplatelet formation
   when myosin was absent or inhibited. Methods: To explore the origin of
   the thrombocytopenia induced by myosin deficiency, we studied
   proplatelet formation using bone marrow explants of wild-type (WT) and
   Myh9 Delta mouse where megakaryocytes have matured in their native
   environment. Results and discussion: A dramatic decrease in the number
   and complexity of proplatelets was observed in megakaryocytes from Myh9
   Delta mice, while inhibition of myosin activity by blebbistatin
   increased proplatelet formation from WT mature megakaryocytes. Moreover,
   Myh9 Delta megakaryocytes had a smaller size than the WT cells. These
   data indicate that myosin deficiency acts negatively on proplatelet
   formation, probably by impairing in situ megakaryocyte maturation, while
   myosin activity is dispensable at the latest stage of proplatelet
   formation. In addition, ultrastructural examination of Myh9 Delta bone
   marrow revealed an increased proportion of megakaryocytes exhibiting
   signs of non-apoptotic cell death as compared with the WT mice.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that thrombocytopenia in Myh9 Delta mice
   results from defective development of megakaryocyte size, impaired
   proplatelet formation and increased cell death.}},

Abstract = {{This review summarizes the current information on the relationship
   between severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), asthma and COPD.
   AATD is a genetic predisposition to the development of early COPD in
   susceptible individuals and reduction in known factors that enhance lung
   function loss is the paramount aim of management. Asthma is one
   controllable condition that leads to the accelerated decline in lung
   function. Current literature indicates that asthma signs and symptoms
   are common in those AATD with or without COPD and that bronchodilator
   response is a risk factor for FEV1 decline. Furthermore AATD itself
   predisposes to airway hyper responsiveness, an essential ingredient for
   reversible airflow obstruction. In the absence of well-characterized
   markers to distinguish COPD from asthma, clinical diagnosis leads to a
   delay in the recognition that asthma symptoms such as wheezing can be an
   early manifestation of COPD in AATD. In addition failure to appreciate
   asthma overlap in AATD may lead to inadequate suppression of airway
   inflammation leading to the development of airflow obstruction. The
   implications of this are discussed as are potential approaches and
   recommendations for treatment.}},

   inhibitors known as serpins, and so on. What is the function of these
   factors? Do thyroid cells respond to them or are these
   paracrine/endocrine factors? The purpose of this review is to highlight
   the current developments in the identification and role of the
   signalling pathways that regulate thyroid growth and function and the
   putative role of endogenous thyroid proteases in regulating this.
   Recent findings
   The roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositol 3
   kinases and integrins in mediating growth and function in thyroid cancer
   cells and the roles of plasminogen activators, their receptors and the
   downstream signalling pathways they modulate have been developed.
   Discoveries of novel proteases, expressed in thyroid cancers, may be
   useful in diagnosis.
   Summary
   The signalling pathways regulating thyroid activity are examined and the
   roles of follicular cell products in maintaining thyroid homeostasis
   evaluated. The possibility that thyroid cell products other than T3 and
   T4 may circulate and have extrathyroidal effects is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{History and clinical findings: The 27 year old female patient presented
   with chronic hypokalaemia known for 6 years and current potassium values
   of 1.8 mmol/l. She reported having diarrhea for a few days, fever was
   denied.
   Investigations: Physical examination revealed dry skin and mucosa and a
   slim nutritional status, laboratory investigations showed a
   hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic alkalosis and hypomagnesaemia. Our first
   suspicion was an eating disorder or abuse of diuretics or laxatives.
   Urine analysis showed a high concentration of potassium and chloride, a
   screening for diuretics was negative. Due to the electrolyte
   constellation we assumed a Gitelman's Syndrome which was confirmed by
   genetic testing.
   Treatment and course: After intravenous substitution of potassium and
   cessation of diarrhea the potassium values stabilised at 2.5-3.0 mmol/l.
   After being discharged she continued oral substitution of potassium and
   no such period of severe hypokalaemia occurred again.
   Conclusion: Establishing a diagnosis for patients with chronic
   hypokalaemia may present difficulties. Urine analysis can help to find
   reasons for electrolyte disorders. Via measurement of urinary chloride
   concentration repetitious vomiting as stigmatising diagnosis could be
   excluded. Urine analysis also led to the diagnosis Gitelman syndrome, an
   inherited renal tubular disorder, which is suspected to count for 50\%
   of unexplained chronic hypokalemia.}},

Abstract = {{Tobacco use among American Indians has a long and complicated history
   ranging from its utilization in spiritual ceremonies to its importance
   as an economic factor for survival. Despite this cultural tradition and
   long history, there are few studies of the health effects of tobacco in
   this population. The Strong Heart Study is a prospective observational
   study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 13 American Indian tribes in
   Arizona, Oklahoma, and North and South Dakota with 4,549 participants.
   Baseline examinations were followed by two examinations at regular
   intervals and 16 years of morbidity and mortality follow-up. Hazard
   ratios (HRs) for non-fatal CVD for current smokers vs. non-smokers after
   adjusting for other risk factors were significant in women (HR = 1.94,
   95\% CI 1.54 to 2.45) and men (HR = 1.59, 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.18). Hazard
   ratios for fatal CVD for current smokers vs. non-smokers after adjusting
   for other risk factors were significant in women (HR = 1.64, 95\% CI
   1.04 to 2.58), but not in men. Individuals who smoked and who were
   diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, hypertension or renal insufficiency
   were more likely to quit smoking than those without these conditions. On
   average, American Indians smoke fewer cigarettes per day than other
   racial/ethnic groups; nevertheless, the ill effects of habitual tobacco
   use are evident in this population.}},

Abstract = {{P>Prevention of acute portal hyperperfusion in small-for-size livers by
   inflow modulation results in beneficial postoperative outcome. The
   objective of this study was to unravel the underlying mechanism,
   emphasizing the intimate relationship between portal venous (PV) and
   hepatic arterial (HA) blood flow (BF). Rats underwent partial
   hepatectomy (pHx), splenectomy before pHx or splenectomy and ligation of
   the A. hepatica before pHx. Portal venous blood flow (PVBF), hepatic
   arterial blood flow (HABF), and tissue pO(2) were assessed during
   stepwise resection from 30\% to 90\%. Hepatic regeneration and
   hypoxia-responsive gene expression were analyzed in each group after
   nonlethal 85\% pHx. 90\% pHx caused a fourfold rise in PVBF, a slight
   decrease in HABF with a 50\% reduction in pO(2), and high mortality.
   Splenectomy before pHx reduced the PVBF and caused a rise in HABF with
   doubling in tissue pO(2). An attenuation of hypoxia-responsive gene
   expression turned into enhanced hepatocellular regeneration and improved
   survival. A. hepatica ligation abolished the beneficial effect of
   splenectomy on tissue oxygenation, proliferation, and outcome. In
   conclusion, the beneficial effect of splenectomy in small-for-size
   livers can be attributed to a rise in HABF with sufficient oxygen supply
   rather than to a reduced portal venous hyperperfusion to the remnant
   liver.}},

Abstract = {{A single-stage high-power-factor electronic ballast with a Class-DE
   low-dv/dt rectifier as a power-factor corrector is proposed in this
   paper. The power-factor corrector is achieved by using a bridge
   rectifier that acts as the Class-DE low-dv/dt rectifier. The Class-DE
   low-dv/dt rectifier is driven by a high-frequency current source, which
   is obtained from the square-wave output voltage of the Class-D parallel
   resonant inverter through an LC-series circuit. By using this topology,
   the conduction angle of the bridge rectifier diode current is increased,
   and a low line-current harmonic is obtained. A prototype ballast is
   implemented to drive a 36-W fluorescent lamp. The switching frequency is
   fixed at about 84 kHz. Experimental results verify the theoretical
   analysis. The designed electronic ballast has a power factor of 0.99, a
   total harmonic distortion of 1.3\%, a lamp current crest factor of 1.42,

Abstract = {{This study is composed of three essential parts. The first part
   describes an indirect semi-experimental method which is used to
   reconstruct the excitation force of an operating diesel engine from the
   acceleration data measured at the mounting points. These internal forces
   can not be directly measured with force sensors; they have to be derived
   from the dynamic deformation of the engine support, so a theoretical
   analysis is carried out to derive the equations for the force
   re-construction.
   The second part deals with prevention of low frequency vibration of the
   powertrain from spreading to the rest of the vehicle. Three uncoupling
   techniques are used to minimize these vibrations. The first technique
   reduces the non-diagonal elements of stiffness matrix. The second
   technique uses the elastic axes decoupling criterion. The third
   technique uncouple the torque roll axis (IRA) by using the previously
   determined excitation efforts.
   In the third part, numerical and experimental results are discussed. The
   solicitations deducted and the positions of mounts allowing decoupling
   of the powertrain are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many factors contribute to the planning process of power systems. In the
   context of expansion planning, focus is paid to selection criteria that
   enable the optimization of related factors that will result in the best
   performance. This is described as meeting demand whilst reducing costs
   and maintaining minimal risk in operation. In this paper, different
   criteria used in the planning of power system expansion studies are
   investigated with the objective of identifying their impact on the
   expansion plan. The results of these criteria on the expansion study of
   the Jordanian power system are presented. Results show good
   correspondence to the actual adopted solutions. The spinning reserve is
   the most influential planning criterion on the overall system expansion
   cost. This is followed by the peak load changes, and the forced outage
   rate of the candidate units used for capacity additions to meet future
   expected demand. Finally, the loss of load expectation and cost of
   energy not served have the least effect on the overall system expansion
   cost. These results highlight the importance to be placed on performing
   sensitivity analyses to determine the most cost effective and acceptable
   expansion plan of the electric power system. There is a need to
   continually update the planning criteria to cater for changes and
   developments in the power system and the economic situation. Finally,
   the methodology of this study can be generalized to other power systems.

Abstract = {{The Athetini are the largest and taxonomically most challenging tribe in
   the subfamily Aleocharinae. We present the first molecular phylogeny of
   Athetini. Nucleotide sequences were obtained from three genome regions
   for 58 athetine and 23 non-athetine species. The sequenced genes are
   cytochrome oxidase subunits 1 and 2 (2030 bp), tRNA-Leucine 1 and 2 (154
   bp), 16S (628 bp, partial sequence), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (54
   bp, partial sequence), and the nuclear 18S gene (999 bp, partial
   sequence). The Athetini were recovered as paraphyletic with respect to
   Lomechusini and Ecitocharini. Lomechusini were recovered as
   polyphyletic, with Myrmedonota grouping separately from Pella and
   Drusilla. The basal topology of Athetini remained largely unresolved but
   many apical clades were well supported, e.g. Geostiba + Earota,
   Pontomalota + Tarphiota, Mocyta + Atheta (Oxypodera) + Atheta
   (Mycetota), Liogluta + Atheta (Thinobaena) + Atheta (Oreostiba), and
   Lyprocorrhe + Atheta (Datomicra). The monophyly of Atheta was refuted,
   as several species of Atheta formed well supported clades with members
   of other genera. Additionally, the following groups were rejected:
   Strigotina (=Acrotonina) and Dimetrotina sensu Newton et al. (2000).
   Acrotona sensu Brundin (1952), Liogluta series (Yosii and Sawada, 1976),
   Atheta (Dimetrota) and Atheta (Alaobia) sensu Smetana (2004).
   New tribal placements are proposed for four genera: Halobrecta is
   removed from Athetini and provisionally placed in Oxypodini;
   Thendelecrotona is removed from Athetini and treated as Aleocharinae
   incertae sedis; Meronera and Thamiaraea are included in the Athetini.

   I}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{521}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We present observations of twelve rotational transitions of
   (H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-18, and (H2O)-O-17 toward the massive star-forming
   region NGC 6334 I, carried out with Herschel/HIFI as part of the
   guaranteed time key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming
   regions (CHESS). We analyze these observations to obtain insights into
   physical processes in this region.
   Methods. We identify three main gas components (hot core, cold
   foreground, and outflow) in NGC 6334 I and derive the physical
   conditions in these components.
   Results. The hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited
   lines, shows a high excitation temperature of similar to 200 K, whereas
   water in the foreground component is predominantly in the ortho-and
   para-ground states. The abundance of water varies between 4 x 10(-5)
   (outflow) and 10(-8) (cold foreground gas). This variation is most
   likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dust grains. The
   (H2O)-O-18/(H2O)-O-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with
   the O-18/O-17 ratio determined from CO isotopologues. The ortho/para
   ratio in water appears to be relatively low (1.6 +/- 1) in the cold,
   quiescent gas, but close to the equilibrium value of three in the warmer
   outflow material (2.5 +/- 0.8).}},

Abstract = {{Psychoanalysis is an art of reflection, i.e. it tries to facilitate the
   subject's retrieval of his own self. The `material' to be reflected upon
   consists of the products of human symbolization. But there are two views
   of reflection. In one, the self is searched in a temporal, structural
   and procedural `anterior' (the model of archaeology). In the other the
   self is to be found in a still evolving meaning process, i.e. it resides
   in a `future' (the model of teleology). Both these pictures are common
   in psychoanalysis. The aim of this paper is to study the figures of
   symbolization through the archaeology/teleology reflection model. The
   author tries to show that `symbol' leans on archaeology while `metaphor'
   comprises a teleological conception. In order to show the relevance of
   this finding, the author draws the outlines of both an archaeological
   and a teleological model in psychoanalysis. It is stated that the former
   builds on an inherent symbol model while the figure for the latter is
   metaphor.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the sensitivity of mountain permafrost to atmospheric
   forcing, the dominant meteorological variables such as temperature,
   precipitation and timing and duration of snow cover have to be
   considered. Simulations with a one-dimensional coupled heat and mass
   transfer model (Coup Model) are used to investigate the interactions
   between the atmosphere and the ground focusing on ground temperature
   evolution and the temporal variability of the depth of the unfrozen top
   layer in summer (active layer depth). Idealised and observed atmospheric
   forcing data sets are used to determine the meteorological conditions,
   which show the largest impact on the permafrost regime. Borehole
   temperature and energy balance data from the permafrost station
   Schilthom (2900 m asl, Berner Oberland) are used for verification. The
   results for the Schilthom site show the largest impact due to summer
   temperatures changes during the snow free period and to a lesser extent
   winter precipitation which influence the duration of the snow cover.
   Similarly important is the timing of the first snow event in autumn
   which leads to a sufficiently large snow cover to isolate the ground
   from atmospheric forcing. Simulations with different data sets from
   Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations derived from an ensemble of
   models and scenarios show that the differences in changes of active
   layer depth between different RCMs are on the same order than between
   different scenarios.}},

   injuries disturbing major cerebrovascular structures have been reported,
   and none entailing basilar artery involvement. We report here the case
   of a 51-year-old male with an intracranial nail-gun injury involving
   penetration of the distal basilar artery. Operative removal was
   accomplished under direct vision using a double concentric cranioorbital
   zygomatic osteotomy for a trans-Sylvian approach. We highlight the
   principles involved in removing foreign bodies penetrating critical

   questions on the reality of a Bible discovered in the bush. Hence, it is
   intended to critically evaluate the story of the strange Bible with the
   view of reducing the awe and mysticism surrounding the narrative. In its
   conclusion, the study shows that the story was a real event, which took
   place in Araya and had significant impact on the people. In traditional
   Isoko society, mythology is the means of transmitting information and
   events. Real events of history are therefore described in symbolic and

Abstract = {{The nutritional properties of fruits are due to the combined action of
   many categories of molecules. Studies on molecular nutrition, therefore,
   requires analytical methods that can cope with diverse molecular groups,
   including metabolites that may be currently unknown. Fractionation and
   identification protocols are crucial to validate identified compounds,
   and can be adapted from methodologies developed for metabolome studies.
   Pectin-related problems during fractionation of samples from ripe fruit
   products, both undigested and after digestion, as well as samples from
   in vitro cell culture bioassay were addressed, and chromatographic
   separations of target compounds (carotenoids, phenolics, sugars, and
   organic acids) were developed based on RP chromatography using HPLC and
   UPLC systems. The final method comprised of a chloroform methanol water
   (2: 1: 3) extraction to simultaneously extract as many polar and
   nonpolar compounds as possible, followed by chromatographic analysis
   using (a) a HPLC-ELSD-UV system with a Prevail Carbohydrate column for
   sugar analysis, (b) Prevail Organic Acid column for organic acid
   analysis, (c) LC-MS ESI of eluants from a XTerra C-18 column for
   phenolics and (d) UPLC-PDA systems in a C-18-Bridged Ethane in Hybrid
   matrix column for carotenoids and other hydrophobic components.
   Acetonitrile-based mobile phases can be used to run all chromatographic
   systems developed.}},

Abstract = {{Drug safety classifications give a very basic estimation of risk and
   should only be used as general guideline when assessing risk of
   pregnancy-related drug exposure or planning treatment. We conducted a
   study to assess the strength of association between both the clinical
   pharmacologists' risk assessment and the FDA risk categorization, and
   adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   We retrospectively reviewed records of 1,076 patients consecutively
   referred to the clinical pharmacology outpatient clinic for
   pregnancy-related drug exposure (2000-2008). Clinical pharmacologists'
   risk assessments were reviewed in relation to FDA drug categorization
   and available pregnancy outcomes.
   Overall, clinical pharmacologists' risk estimation was in agreement with
   the FDA risk categorization system in only 28\% of consulted women, and
   in only 9\% of women with high-risk exposure (FDA DX). Clinical
   pharmacologists' risk assessment confirming high-risk drug exposure had
   a better positive predictive value for adverse pregnancy outcomes than
   the FDA DX categorization (25\% vs 14\% respectively), while the
   negative predictive values were similar (92\% vs 94\% respectively).
   Clinical pharmacologists' risk assessment was a better predictor of
   adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with FDA risk categorization (OR
   2.11 {[}95\%CI 1.5-3.1; p < 0.001] vs OR 1.52 {[}95\%CI 1.1-2.1; p =
   0.014] respectively).
   Additional evaluation beyond the FDA drug classification is essential
   for safer and more rational drug use in pregnancy. Clinical
   pharmacologists who have undergone rigorous medical training are ideally
   placed to consult on administration of medicines in pregnant women, thus
   making the prescribing of treatments in that patient category
   substantially safer and more rational.}},

   efficiencies were observed for chemical oxygen demand (46\%), suspended
   solids (69\%), total phosphorous (TP) (66\%), and total N (65\%). During
   the second season, operational changes in the farm resulted in lower
   organic, solids, and nutrient loadings resulting in improved effluent
   quality, especially for suspended solids (81\% removal) and total N
   (82\% removal). The systems were not hydraulically overloaded even at 20

Abstract = {{This study assessed the Zanzibar sea cucumber fishery using a
   multidisciplinary approach. Data was collected by (i) interviewing
   various groups of actors in the fishery and reviewing management
   documentation and legislation, (ii) by monitoring catches and (iii)
   through a visual census of coastal sea cucumber populations in areas
   open and closed to fishing. The fishery showed clear signs of being
   unsustainable with high fishing effort, and weak formal and informal
   management institutions. The fishery operation was characterised by an
   intricate cross-scale structure with both fishers and sea cucumber
   products being transported across national borders. The visual census of
   commercial sea cucumber stocks at three sites open to fishing around
   Zanzibar showed low densities across the range of sea cucumber value
   groups including low value species. Furthermore, the diversity of
   commercial sea cucumber species was lower in fished reefs than on a
   protected reef. The poor status of the sea cucumber populations was
   confirmed by the perception of an overfished resource by the interviewed
   actors active in the fishery. This was also depicted by the paucity of
   high value species, and high representation of low value and newly
   commercialised species in fishers catch. We conclude that the current
   state of Zanzibar's sea cucumber populations is compromising the
   fisheries self-replenishment and existence and that the fishery is in
   urgent need of a complete management reform.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The use of rituximab in vasculitis has increased interest in
   B cell biology. A subpopulalion of B cells expressing CD25 shows
   antigen-presenting properties and may have regulatory functions. We
   assessed subpopulations of B cell maturation (Bm) and markers related to
   activity and antigen presentation, and related the findings to disease
   activity.
   Methods. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to assess numbers and
   proportions of circulating lymphocytes from 34 patients with vasculitis
   (16 remission, 18 active) and 20 controls.
   Results. Active vasculitis samples showed decreased proportions of Bm1
   (7.8\% vs 11\%; p = 0.041), Bm2' (0.2\% vs 0.7\%; p = 0.002), and
   Bm3/Bm4 (0.1\% vs 0.3\%; p = 0.006), compared with controls; Bm2 cells
   were the most frequently occurring B cells but they were not
   significantly different in active vasculitis (74\% vs 62\%; p = 0.083).
   In patients with remission the proportion of CD25+ B cells was increased
   compared to controls (48\% vs 29\%, respectively; p = 0.006) and also
   compared to active vasculitis (23\%; p = 0.006). The proportion of CD86+
   B cells was also increased (31\%) compared to active vasculitis (8\%; p
   = 0.001), and to controls (6\%; p = 0.0003). In multivariate analysis.
   Bm2' cells and CD25+27- B cells were independently influencing the
   patient group.
   Conclusion. In active vasculitis, a lower proportion of Bm I cells may
   indicate activated B cells. Patients in remission had higher proportions

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of finding correspondences
   between distributed cameras that have partially overlapping field of
   views. When multiple cameras with adaptable orientations and zooms are
   deployed, as in many wide area surveillance applications, identifying
   correspondence between different activities becomes a fundamental issue.
   We propose a correspondence method based upon activity features that,
   unlike photometric features, have certain geometry independence
   properties. The proposed method is robust to pose, illumination and
   geometric effects, unsupervised (does not require any calibration
   objects). In addition, these features are amenable to low communication
   bandwidth and distributed network applications. We present quantitative
   and qualitative results with synthetic and real life examples, and
   compare the proposed method with scale invariant feature transform
   (SIFT) based method. We show that our method significantly outperforms
   the SIFT method when cameras have significantly different orientations.
   We then describe extensions of our method in a number of directions
   including topology reconstruction, camera calibration, and distributed
   anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives - The goal of our study was to determine the incidence of
   cerebellar lesions in a cohort of children and young adults with TSC and
   analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of cerebellar TSC
   lesions including their contrast behavior and diffusion characteristics
   Material and Methods - MRI studies of 27 TSC patients (mean age 10 6
   years) were evaluated for cortical/subcortical tubers white matter
   lesions subependymal nodules and giant cell astrocytomas Patients with
   cerebellar involvement were further analyzed for the imaging and
   diffusion characteristics ADC measurements of the cerebellar tubers were
   performed and corn pared with the contralateral normal appearing
   cerebellum The clinical charts were revisited for symptoms suggesting
   cerebellar involvement
   Results - Cerebellar tubers were seen in 8/27 patients cerebellar
   atrophy in 1/27 patients Cerebellar tubers showed a pyramidal/wedge
   appearance with a broad base reaching the cortex The majority of the
   cerebellar tubers (11/12 92\%) showed a zebra like contrast enhancement
   All cerebellar tubers had increased ADC values (mean ADC 1472 x 10(-6)
   mm(2)/s) None of the patients had typical cerebellar symptoms
   Conclusion - Thirty three percent of TSC patients had cerebellar lesions
   most of them being cerebellar tubers Cerebellar tubers differ from
   supratentonal tubers both concerning shape and contrast behavior The
   exact etiology of contrast enhancement remains unclear Future studies
   have to determine the impact of cerebellar lesions on neurocognitive

Abstract = {{The number of patients awaiting lung transplantation has steadily
   increased over the past decade, but the number of donors has remained
   relatively stable. Owing to the increasing scarcity of donor lungs,
   especially for pediatric and small adult recipients, advanced operative
   strategies for the use of larger grafts for smaller recipients have been
   developed. Size matching between donors and recipients represents one of
   the organ distribution criteria widely accepted by lung transplantation
   teams. However, in some cases it is not possible to allocate a donor to
   the corresponding size-compatible recipient. To avoid possible
   complications derived from the implantation of oversized lungs into
   smaller recipients, various methods of downsizing are applied for
   cadaveric donor lungs, such as lobar transplantation. We review our
   experience in 6 patients undergoing volume reduction of the lung graft
   by lobar resection at the time of transplantation. Graft volume
   reduction by anatomic resection (lobar transplantation) is a reliable
   and safe procedure to overcome size disparities between the donor and
   the recipient of a lung transplant, and thus to maximize the number of
   donors.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic pathogens threaten ecosystems in novel ways, particularly where
   they are facilitated by stresses such as climate change and forest
   fragmentation. Although chestnut blight (CB), Dutch elm disease (DED),
   beech bark disease (BBD), and white pine blister rust (WPBR) are
   well-studied pathogens, this investigation is the first to provide
   estimated rates of spread based on an expansive geospatial database and
   a consistent, rigorous analytical framework. We use quantile regression
   to analyze 850 records of infection over the last (20th) century. The
   results show that in the past, forest disease complexes have spread at
   rates between 7.4 and 31 km year(-1), and two-thirds of the estimates
   were less than 17 km year(-1). We estimated the spread of CB at 31 km
   year(-1), DED in eastern North America at 25 km year(-1), DED in western
   North America at 14 km year(-1), BBD at 16 km year(-1), WPBR in eastern

Abstract = {{In the advent of concerns for patient safety, simulation training is
   emerging as a method to train healthcare providers to perform invasive
   procedures such as central venous catheter (CVC) insertion while
   minimising harmful complications to the patient. New technologies in
   medical simulation have begun to shift research attention to the
   performance component of clinical competency. Accurate assessment of
   healthcare provider competence is a major priority in medical education
   necessitating the development of valid and reliable assessment tools. In
   the past year alone, nine evaluative tools, both global rating scales
   and procedural checklists, have been published in the research
   literature to evaluate the insertion of CVCs. A review of the advantages
   of published evaluation tools helps inform users with regard to the
   critical components necessary for a checklist. Ease of use, ability to
   be completed by a non-expert, categorical breakdown of critical actions
   involved in CVC insertion and the need for a comprehensive stepwise
   procedural checklist are discussed. The development of an ideal
   checklist may improve future competency-based training and performance
   evaluation in the clinical setting. A more thorough understanding of the
   status of checklists as evaluation tools in assessing performance of
   invasive procedures will lead to better training protocols and
   ultimately to improved patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{Countless autonomous, self-reinforcing and countervailing forces impact
   the future competitiveness of Europe and its spatial structure. Poignant
   examples include globalization, ageing and climate change, but also
   policy decisions taken by nation-states or the European Union. Scenarios
   are an appropriate method by which to explore possible future
   developmental pathways in a dynamic context. This contribution describes
   and discusses four economic policy scenarios produced by the ESPON 3.2
   project and link these to the Lisbon Strategy and the European Social
   Model. In each scenario, a policy package is assembled from existing EU
   policy areas according to a particular ideological context. Afterwards,
   its territorial consequences are discussed in terms of socioeconomic
   disparities, migration and the environment. In so doing, some
   observations will be made regarding possible spin-offs, trade-offs and
   side effects of European policy when placed in a spatial context. These
   scenarios should hold interest for policy discussions on territorial
   cohesion, a concept which seeks to integrate economic development and
   spatial planning, as well as on European competitiveness and cohesion.

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanofibers were produced by hydrolyzing oil palm
   empty-fruit-bunches with sulfuric acid. The effect of hydrolysis time on
   the structure and properties of the nanofibers was investigated. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the change of
   chemical composition. Atomic force microscope images showed that the
   average thickness of the nanofibers ranged from 1 to 3.5 nm as the
   hydrolysis time was varied. Longer hydrolysis time produced a higher
   yield of dispersed nanofibers; whereas the degree of crystallinity and
   the degree of polymerization decreased with increasing hydrolysis time.
   The degradation of nanofibers with higher sulfate group content started
   at a lower temperature.}},

   anodic domain, the platinum oxidation/reduction and the oxygen evolution
   reactions. In a catalytic active gas mixture, despite the Faradaic
   enhancement of the CO oxidation observed over Pt/YSZ during an anodic

   activity is achieved after current interruption.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the interfacial friction of water at graphitic

   sheets, inside and outside carbon nanotubes, with the goal to
   disentangle confinement and curvature effects on friction We show that
   the friction coefficient exhibits a strong curvature dependence, while
   friction is independent of confinement for the graphene slab, it
   decreases with carbon nanotube radius for water inside, but increases
   for water outside As a paradigm the friction coefficient is found to
   vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair nanotubes Using a
   statistical description of the interfacial friction, we highlight here a
   structural origin of this curvature dependence, mainly associated with a
   curvature-induced incommensurability between the water and carbon
   structures These results support the recent experiments reporting fast

Abstract = {{Many computational problems linked to uncertainty and preference
   management can be expressed in terms of computing the marginal(s) of a
   combination of a collection of valuation functions. Shenoy and Shafer
   showed how such a computation can be performed using a local computation
   scheme. A major strength of this work is that it is based on an
   algebraic description: what is proved is the correctness of the local
   computation algorithm under a few axioms on the algebraic structure. The
   instantiations of the framework in practice make use of totally ordered
   scales. The present paper focuses on the use of partially ordered scales
   and examines how such scales can be cast in the Shafer-Shenoy framework
   and thus benefit from local computation algorithms. It also provides
   several examples of such scales, thus showing that each of the algebraic
   structures explored here is of interest.}},

Title = {{Patient-Provider Communication in Chronic Illness: Current State of
   Research in Selected Areas}},
Journal = {{REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{277-291}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Communication between patient and providers is extremely important,
   especially for the treatment of chronically ill patients, characterized
   by a biopsychosocial disease model. This article presents an overview of
   the current status of research on patient-provider communication in 3
   selected areas: the communication preferences of chronically ill
   persons, the correlation between communication and relevant endpoints,
   and interventions to improve patient-provider communication. One major
   result of the research is that patients display a rather high degree of
   inter- and intra-individual variability with respect to the preference
   of certain communication styles (e.g. patient participation); there are
   differences among them, and they develop varying preferences in the
   course of their illness. However, communicative behavior of the provider
   that is generally perceived by many patients to be positive can also be
   identified: affective behavior (for example, asking the patient about
   his/her feelings, being sensitive to these feelings and responding to
   them), providing information in an understandable, proactive manner, and
   attempting to understand the patient's perceptions, expectations, and
   cognitive concepts. Successful communication requires a certain
   congruence between the patient's communication preferences and the
   provider's behavior. It has been sufficiently documented in literature
   that successful communication leads to greater adherence. The
   correlation to patient satisfaction is not documented quite as clearly
   but has often been shown. The findings vary with respect to the
   improvement in the patient's health status. The effectiveness of
   communication training for providers has been documented quite well
   regarding the immediate endpoints in patient-provider interaction (e.g.,
   patient-oriented behavior); the evidence with respect to medium-term
   endpoints such as patient satisfaction varies, also due to the number of
   possible operationalizations of the endpoints. Supplementing provider
   training with communication-related training for patients appears to be
   an important and useful method as many studies have shown that the
   behavior of providers can be influenced using relatively simple measures
   that start with the patient. There is a need for further development of
   research on patient-provider communication, in particular with respect
   to a more solid theoretical basis, integration of methods including
   qualitative and quantitative methods, self-evaluations, and interaction
   analyses, and also concerning conducting more longitudinal studies.}},

Abstract = {{Short segment posterior fixation is the preferred method for stabilizing
   thoracolumbar fractures. In case of significant disruption of the
   anterior column, the simple short segment construct does not ensure
   adequate stability. In this study, we tried to evaluate the effect of
   inclusion of the fractured vertebra in short segment fixation of
   thoracolumbar fractures. In a prospective randomized study, eighty
   patients with thoracolumbar fractures treated just with posterior
   pedicular fixation were randomized into two groups receiving either the
   one level above and one level below excluding the fracture level
   (bridging group), or including the fracture level (including group).
   Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded and
   followed. A sum of 80 patients (42 patients in group 1 and 38 patients
   in group 2) were enrolled in the study. The patients in both the groups
   showed similar clinical outcome. There was a high rate of
   instrumentation failure in the ``bridging{''} group. The ``bridging{''}
   group showed a mean worsening (29\%) in kyphosis, whereas the
   ``including{''} group improved significantly by a mean of 6\%. The
   significant effect of the ``including{''} technique on the reduction of
   kyphotic deformity was most prominent in type C fractures. In
   conclusion, inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers a
   better kyphosis correction, in addition to fewer instrument failures,
   without additional complications, and with a comparable-if not
   better-clinical and functional outcome. We recommend insertion of screws
   into pedicles of the fractured thoracolumbar vertebra when considering a
   short segment posterior fixation, especially in Magerl type C fractures.}},

   hBD3/mL, and 90\% were inhibited at < 12.5 mu g hBD3/mL. Bacterial
   growth was not inhibited at < 1.6 mu g hBD3/mL. There were no
   significant differences in the inhibition by hBD3 of isolates from
   atopic (median MIC 12.5 mu g/mL, range 6.25-25 mu g/mL, n = 14) and
   healthy dogs (median MIC 9.4 mu g/mL, range 3.125-12.5 mu g/mL, n = 8);
   from noninfected colonized sites (median MIC 12.5 mu g/mL, range
   3.125-25 mu g/mL, n = 16) and infected lesions (median MIC 9.4 mu g/mL,
   range 6.25-12.5 mu g/mL, n = 6); or between sample sites (nose median
   MIC 12.5 mu g/mL, range 6.25-25 mu g/mL, n = 5; perineum median MIC 12.5
   mu g/mL, range 3.125-25 mu g/mL, n = 7; ear median MIC 6.25 mu g/mL,
   range 6.25-12.5 mu g/mL, n = 4; lesions median MIC 9.4 mu g/mL, range

Abstract = {{Objectives: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging has demonstrated
   significant potential as a noninvasive technology for monitoring blood
   flow in the microvasculature. With the application of nondestructive
   contrast imaging pulse sequences combined with a clearance-refill
   approach, it is possible to create quantitative time-to-refill maps of
   tissue correlating to blood perfusion rate. One limitation to standard
   two-dimensional (2D) perfusion imaging is that the narrow elevational
   beamwidth of 1-or 1.5-D ultrasound transducers provides information in
   only a single slice of tissue, and thus it is difficult to image exactly
   the same plane from study to study. We hypothesize that inhomogeneity in
   vascularization, such as that common in many types of tumors, makes
   serial perfusion estimates inconsistent unless the same region can be
   imaged repeatedly. Our objective was to evaluate error in 2D
   quantitative perfusion estimation in an in vivo sample volume because of
   differences in transducer positioning. To mitigate observed errors due
   to imaging plane misalignment, we propose and demonstrate the
   application of quantitative 3-dimensional (3D) perfusion imaging. We
   also evaluate the effect of contrast agent concentration and infusion
   rate on perfusion estimates.
   Materials and Methods: Contrast-enhanced destruction-reperfusion imaging
   was performed using parametric mapping of refill times and custom
   software for image alignment to compensate for tissue motion. Imaging
   was performed in rats using a Siemens Sequoia 512 imaging system with a
   15L8 transducer. A custom 3D perfusion mapping system was designed by
   incorporating a computer-controlled positioning system to move the
   transducer in the elevational direction, and the Sequoia was interfaced
   to the motion system for timing of the destruction-reperfusion sequence
   and data acquisition. Perfusion estimates were acquired from rat kidneys
   as a function of imaging plane and in response to the vasoactive drug
   dopamine.
   Results: Our results indicate that perfusion estimates generated by 2D
   imaging in the rat kidney have mean standard deviations on the order of
   10\%, and as high as 22\%, because of differences in initial transducer
   position. This difference was larger than changes in kidney perfusion
   induced by dopamine. With application of 3D perfusion mapping,
   repeatability in perfusion estimated in the kidney is reduced to a
   standard deviation of less than 3\%, despite random initial transducer
   positioning. Varying contrast agent administration rate was also
   observed to bias measured perfusion time, especially at low
   concentrations; however, we observed that contrast administration rates
   between 2.7 x 10(8) and 3.9 x 10(8) bubbles/min provided results that
   were consistent within 3\% for the contrast agent type evaluated.
   Conclusions: Three-dimensional perfusion imaging allows a significant
   reduction in the error caused by transducer positioning, and
   significantly improves the reliability of quantitative perfusion time
   estimates in a rat kidney model. When performing perfusion imaging, it
   is important to use appropriate and consistent contrast agent infusion
   rates to avoid bias.}},

Abstract = {{The recently observed high levels of fecal indicators in beach sand
   confound beach water monitoring efforts. The high levels of fecal
   indicators may be caused by the loss or the reduced activities of common
   environmental stresses controlling die-off in the sand. Microcosm
   experiments were conducted to compare the effects of biotic stresses
   from autochthonous sand bacteria, protozoa, and viruses on Escherichia
   coli and Enterococcus faecalis in two tropical beach sands. The
   inhibition of protozoan activities by cycloheximide did not
   significantly affect the die-off of E. coli, indicating that protozoan
   predation played a limited role in beach sand. The contribution from
   phage infection to E. coli die-off was also negligible. Consequently,
   autochthonous bacteria were identified as the predominant biotic stress
   to the die-off of E. coli in beach sand. Subsequent experiments
   demonstrated that the beach sand had a very low protozoan concentration
   and low protozoan growth potential when compared with various
   environmental samples. Co-culturing of E. coli with autochthonous sand
   bacterial isolates significantly enhanced E. coli die-off.
   PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a complex
   sand bacterial community, suggesting that bacterial antagonistic effects
   may be widespread. The study also found that E. faecalis exhibited a
   much longer survival in beach sand compared with E. coli.}},

Abstract = {{We define a new induction algorithm for k-interval exchange
   transformations associated to the ``symmetric{''} permutation i -> k - i
   + 1. Acting as a multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm, it
   defines a sequence of generalized partial quotients given by an infinite
   path in a graph whose vertices, or states, are certain trees we call
   trees of relations. This induction is self-dual for the duality between
   the usual Rauzy induction and the da Rocha induction. We use it to
   describe those words obtained by coding orbits of points under a
   symmetric interval exchange, in terms of the generalized partial
   quotients associated with the vector of lengths of the k intervals. As a
   consequence, we improve a bound of Boshernitzan in a generalization of
   the three-distances theorem for rotations. However, a variant of our
   algorithm, applied to a class of interval exchange transformations with
   a different permutation, shows that the former bound is optimal outside
   the hyperelliptic class of permutations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents PWV estimates from GPS data computed at four
   continuously operated GPS stations in Argentina established at Buenos
   Aires, Cordoba, Rosario and Salta over a 1 year period (2006-2007). The
   objective is to analyze the behaviour of the GPS PWV estimation using
   mean tropospheric temperature (T-m) values from the Bevis model, Sapucci
   model and obtained by a numerical integration of variables provided by
   the operational analysis of the National Centre of Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP). The results are validated using PWV values from
   nearest radio soundings. Moreover, a comparison between PWV values
   determined from microwave sensors deployed on the NOAA-18 satellite and
   PWV from GPS observations is also presented.
   From the analysis we can see that the computation of GPS PWV using the
   T-m from the Bevis model, originally deduced for the northern
   hemisphere, shows similar behaviour to the respective computation using
   a Sapucci model inside 0.5 mm. The differences between the T-m values
   computed from the Sapucci model and the numerical integration of NCEP
   variables are of the order of 15 K, although it does not represent a
   significant error in PWV.
   Nevertheless, differences in bias are imperceptible during the dry
   period and they are as big as 3 mm during the moist or high
   precipitation period. This behaviour could not represent an improvement
   when comparing radio soundings with respect to the GPS PWV values using
   different estimations of T-m. Thus, we conclude that the usage of T-m
   estimated from the Bevis model is the best choice for regional studies,
   considering the simplicity and dissemination of the method, unless some
   more studies taking into account the geographical and climatological
   characteristic of the region are performed. As expected, GPS PWV values
   show very good agreement with radio sounding determinations, small
   differences can be observed especially during extreme precipitation
   periods. In general the NOAA PWV values denote an over estimation of the
   available water vapour. It is important to note that the determination
   of PWV is not the mean product of the NOAA-18 satellite mission. These
   results show the potential of such a product although a preliminary
   calibration using GPS PWV is still necessary. (c) 2010 COSPAR. Published

Abstract = {{We analyzed the effect of cadmium on corticotropic (ACTH) and prolactin
   (PRL) cells in the pituitary gland of the Podarcis sicula (P. sicula)
   lizard under chronic exposure to this metal. Adult lizards were given
   CdCl2, in drinking water at the dose of 10 mu g/10 g body mass for 120
   days. Light microscopy was performed after histological and
   immunohistochemical staining, and the effects were followed at regular
   time intervals up to 120 days post-treatment. We detected substantial
   variations in the general morphology of the pituitary: unlike the
   control lizards in which the gland appeared compact, the treated lizards
   showed a glandular tissue with dilated spaces that were more extensive
   at 90 and 120 days. PRL and ACTH cells showed an increase in occurrence
   and immunostaining intensity in treated lizards in comparison with the
   same cells of control animals. This cellular increase peaked for PRL at
   30 days in the rostral, medial and also caudal pars distalis of the
   gland. ACTH cells appeared to increase markedly after 60 days of
   treatment in both the pars distalis and the pars intermedia. Again, at
   60 days small, isolated ACTH cells were also found in the caudal pars
   distalis in which these cells were generally absent. However, at 120
   days both these cellular types showed an occurrence, distribution and
   morphology similar to those observed in the control lizards. In lizards,
   protracted oral exposure to cadmium evidently involves an alteration of
   the normal morphology of the gland and an inhibitory effect of ACTH and
   PRL cells, since they increase in occurrence and immunostaining. Yet in
   time the inhibitory effect of cadmium on ACTH and PRL cells falls back
   and their occurrence appears similar to that of the control lizard.}},

Title = {{Improved computation of the atonia index in normal controls and patients
   with REM sleep behavior disorder}},
Journal = {{SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{947-949}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a simple
   method of noise reduction before the calculation of the REM sleep atonia
   index (AI) on a large number of recordings from different normal
   controls and patient groups.
   Subjects and methods: Eighty-nine subjects were included: 25 young
   controls, 10 aged controls, 31 untreated patients with idiopathic REM
   sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 8 treated patients with iRBD, 10
   patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 5 patients with
   obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The average amplitude of the
   rectified submentalis muscle EMG signal was then obtained for all 1-s
   mini epochs of REM sleep. The new correction method was implemented by
   subtracting from each mini epoch the minimum value found in a moving
   window including the 60 mini epochs surrounding it.
   Results: Two arbitrary thresholds were established at AI < 0.8 and 0.8 <
   AI < 0.9: all young controls presented AI > 0.9; this was not true for
   aged controls, 3 of whom presented 0.8 < AI < 0.9 but none had AI < 0.8;
   on the contrary 74.4\% of all iRBD showed AI < 0.9, with 38.5\% of the
   whole group having AI < 0.8 and only 25.6\% with AI > 0.9. All MSA
   patients showed AI < 0.8.
   Conclusions: After the introduction of this new method for noise
   reduction, REM sleep AI index values lower than 0.8 were strongly
   indicative of altered (reduced) chin EMG atonia during REM sleep; values
   of AI between 0.8 and 0.9 indicated a less evident involvement of
   atonia, and values above 0.9 characterized the majority of normal
   recordings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4) concentrations were investigated in shelf waters of the
   north-eastern shelf of the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Iberian Peninsula) during
   four campaigns that took place in June 2006, November 2006, February
   2007 and May 2007. CH4 saturations, ranging from 70 to 1820\%, showed
   great spatial and temporal variabilities. In general, strong
   onshore-offshore CH4 gradients indicated an important coastal input,
   which was further supported by punctual data collected within the
   Guadalquivir and Guadalete estuaries, as well as in Rio San Pedro creek.
   Tidal exchange and enhanced freshwater inputs during rainy periods were
   found to be important factors controlling CH4 distribution in shelf
   waters. The sediment was potentially another considerable source of
   biogenic CH4 to bottom waters. CH4 concentrations were found to be
   significantly higher in June and November 2006 compared to February and
   May 2007. The annual air-sea flux was estimated to range from 4.7 to 8.4
   mu mol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The recent upgrade to the MAST YAG Thomson scattering while enhancing
   the diagnostic capabilities increased the complexity of the system.
   There are eight YAG lasers now operational, doubling the number from the
   previous setup. This means alignment between each laser individually and
   reference points is essential to guarantee data quality and diagnostic
   reliability. To address this issue an alignment system was recently
   installed. It mimics the beams alignment in MAST by sampling 1\% of the
   laser beam that is sent into a telescope which demagnifies by a factor
   of 8. The demagnified beam is viewed with a CCD camera. By scanning the
   camera the profile and position of the beams in the scattering zone and
   in a range of several meters inside MAST can be determined. Therefore
   alignment is checked along the beam path without having to sample it
   inside the vessel. The experimental apparatus and test procedures are
   described. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3475377]}},

Abstract = {{Background: Aortic stenosis leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and
   accumulation of fibrillar collagens. The analysis of integrated

   myocardial properties.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 58 patients with aortic
   stenosis. They were followed up for an average 18 +/- 5 months after
   aortic valve replacement (AVR). Traditional transthoracic
   echocardiography and analysis of IBS reflectivity were performed before
   AVR and during the control visit after AVR.
   Results: A significant reduction in left ventricular mass index, a
   significant increase in the mean cyclic variation of IBS, and a decrease
   in absolute end-diastolic IBS intensity were observed after AVR.
   Conclusions: These data suggest improvements in ultrasonic myocardial
   properties after AVR. Preoperative analysis of IBS parameters might
   provide additional information for predicting left ventricular reverse

Abstract = {{Regeneration of injured adult CNS axons is inhibited by formation of a
   glial scar. Immature astrocytes are able to support robust neurite
   outgrowth and reduce scarring, therefore, we tested whether these cells
   would have this effect if transplanted into brain injuries. Utilizing an
   in vitro spot gradient model that recreates the strongly inhibitory
   proteoglycan environment of the glial scar we found that, alone,
   immature, but not mature, astrocytes had a limited ability to form
   bridges across the most inhibitory outer rim. In turn, the astrocyte
   bridges could promote adult sensory axon re-growth across the gradient.
   The use of selective enzyme inhibitors revealed that MMP-2 enables
   immature astrocytes to cross the proteoglycan rim. The bridge-building
   process and axon regeneration across the immature glial bridges were
   greatly enhanced by chondroitinase ABC pretreatment of the spots. We
   used microlesions in the cingulum of the adult rat brains to test the
   ability of matrix modification and immature astrocytes to form a bridge
   for axon regeneration in vivo. Injured axons were visualized via p75
   immunolabeling and the extent to which these axons regenerated was
   quantified. Immature astrocytes coinjected with chondroitinase
   ABC-induced axonal regeneration beyond the distal edge of the lesion.
   However, when used alone, neither treatment was capable of promoting
   axonal regeneration. Our findings indicate that when faced with a
   minimal lesion, neurons of the basal forebrain can regenerate in the
   presence of a proper bridge across the lesion and when levels of
   chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the glial scar are reduced.

Abstract = {{Research and public policy on academic entrepreneurship are largely
   based on the assumption that faculty members start businesses to
   commercialize inventions that have been disclosed to university
   administrators and have been patented. In this paper, we analyze a
   sample of 11,572 professors and find that much academic entrepreneurship
   occurs outside the university intellectual property system.
   Specifically, about 2/3 of businesses started by academics are not based
   on disclosed and patented inventions. Moreover, we show that individual
   characteristics, departmental and organizational affiliations, and time
   allocation of academics that have started business outside the IP system
   are different from those of academics that have started businesses to
   exploit disclosed and patented inventions. We discuss the implications
   for research on and the practice of academic entrepreneurship. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The article explores the plans for a New Europe developed by the Italian
   Fascist Regime after 1939 as well as its later modifications according
   to the situation at the front. At the eve of the Second World War,
   Giuseppe Bottai, at the time minister for education, called upon the
   cultural elite to think about the cultural foundations of the New
   Europe. This future entity was supposed to exhibit a clear hierarchy
   between smaller and larger states and be part of a gigantic
   Euro-Asiatic-African area dominated by the imperialist powers Italy,
   Japan and the German Reich. This project was much discussed in Italy,
   which resulted in German suspicions. Conflict between the `Axis{''}
   partners erupted in 1942, when Italy - despite devastating defeats -
   attempted to claim intellectual leadership of future Europe - clearly
   distancing itself from the Nazi Regime which only relied on violence and
   the Race Myth, while the Fascists founded their superiority on
   Christianity and the tradition of Ancient Rome. In Spring 1943, the
   Fascist leadership dissociated itself from such hybrid plans. They now
   launched the idea of a ``Europe of the Nations{''}, even though it was
   clear that this would strongly strain cooperation with the German Reich.
   The collapse of the Fascist Regime in 1943 ended these intellectual
   games: The New Europe would only come about under National Socialist
   auspices - or not at all.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a 6-month

   in rat liver. Two enzymes, 5-alpha-steroid reductase type 1 (SRD5A1) and
   the regulatory subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase (GCLM),
   which are differentially expressed on the mRNA level, were analysed for
   promoter methylation in putative cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) island
   regions located at the 5' end using base-specific cleavage and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight MS. A twofold
   increase in the mRNA level of SRD5A1 gene and a twofold decrease in the
   mRNA level of GCLM gene in VE-deficient animals were not associated with
   different CpG methylation of the analysed promoter region. Furthermore,
   global DNA methylation was not significantly different in these two
   groups. Thus, the present results indicate that the VE-induced
   regulation of SRD5A1 and GCLM in rat liver is not directly mediated by
   changes in promoter DNA methylation.}},

Abstract = {{Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are
   associated with increased mortality, largely as a consequence of
   cardiovascular (CV) disease. Studies found relative risk ratios of 2 for
   myocardial infarction in RA and up to 7 for myocardial infarction in SLE
   patients.
   Beyond the traditional CV risk factors, chronic systemic inflammation
   has been shown to be a crucial factor in atherosclerosis development and
   progression from endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture and
   thrombosis. Numerous studies have shown that atherosclerosis is not a
   passive process characterized by accumulation of lipids in the vessel
   walls, but rather represents active inflammation of the vasculature.
   Inflammatory cells such as macrophages, monocytes and T cells play an
   important role in the development of both RA and atherosclerosis.
   According to the recently published EULAR recommendations for CV risk
   screening and management in patients with inflammatory arthritis, annual
   CV risk assessment is recommended for all patients with RA. Any CV risk
   factors identified should be optimally managed. In addition to
   appropriate CV risk management, aggressive suppression of the
   inflammatory process is recommended to further lower CV risk.}},

Abstract = {{The proposals arising from the agreement reached between the Rudd
   government and the States and Territories (except Western Australia) in
   April 2010 represent the most fundamental realignment of health
   responsibilities since the creation of Medicare in 1984. They will
   change the health system, and the structures that will craft its future
   direction and design. These proposals will have a significant impact on
   Emergency Medicine; an impact from not only the system-wide effects of
   the proposals but also those that derive from the specific
   recommendations to create an activity-based funding mechanism for EDs,
   to implement the four hour rule and to develop a performance indicator
   framework for EDs. The present paper will examine the potential impact
   of the proposals on Emergency Medicine to inform those who work within
   the system and to help guide further developments.
   More work is required to better evaluate the proposals and to guide the
   design and development of specific reform instruments. Any such efforts
   should be based upon a proper analysis of the available evidence, and a
   structured approach to research and development so as to deliver on

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the performance of a vocabulary test designed to
   measure second language productive vocabulary knowledge. The test,
   Lex30, uses a word association task to elicit vocabulary, and uses word
   frequency data to measure the vocabulary produced. Here we report
   firstly on the reliability of the test as measured by a test-retest
   study, a parallel test forms experiment and an internal consistency
   measure. We then investigate the construct validity of the test by
   looking at changes in test performance over time, analyses of
   correlations with scores on similar tests, and comparison of spoken and
   written test performance. Last, we examine the theoretical bases of the
   two main test components: eliciting vocabulary and measuring vocabulary.
   Interpretations of our findings are discussed in the context of test
   validation research literature. We conclude that the findings reported
   here present a robust argument for the validity of the test as a
   research tool, and encourage further investigation of its validity in an

Abstract = {{Electrocatalysts based on Fe-Ni alloys were prepared by means of
   modified Pechini and physical mixture methods and using on a composite
   of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) and Gadolinia-Doped Ceria (GDC) as
   support. The former method was based on the formation a polymeric
   precursor that was subsequently calcined; the later method was based on
   the mixture of NiO and the support. The resulting composites had 35
   wt.\% metal load and 65 wt.\% support (70 wt.\% YSZ and 30 wt.\% GDC
   mixture) (cermets). The samples were then characterized by
   Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and
   evaluated in the ethanol steam reforming at 650 degrees C for 6 h in the
   temperature range of 300-900 degrees C. The XRD results showed that the
   bimetallic sample calcined at 800 degrees C formed a mixed oxide
   (NiFe(2)O(4)) with a spinel structure, which, after reduction in
   hydrogen, formed Ni-Fe alloys. The presence of Ni was observed to
   decrease the final reduction temperature of the NiFe(2)O(4) species. The
   addition of iron to the nickel anchored to YSZ-GDC increased the
   hydrogen production and inhibited carbon deposition. The resulting
   bimetallic 30Fe5Ni sample reached an ethanol conversion of about 95\%
   and a hydrogen yield up to 48\% at 750 degrees C. In general, ethanol
   conversion and hydrogen production were independent of the metal content
   in the electrocatalyst. However, the substitution of nickel for iron
   significantly reduced carbon deposition on the electrocatalyst: 74, 31,
   and 9 wt.\% in the 35Ni, 20Fe15Ni, and 30Fe5Ni samples, respectively.

   and Washington hospitals during 2001 and 2002 who survived to hospital
   discharge. The numbers of EMS transports and the total EMS costs were
   compared one year before and one year following the index
   hospitalization. Results. There were 30,655 injured elders in our
   cohort. Their median ICD-9-based injury severity score was 0.97, with
   4.1\% meeting a definition of serious injury and 37\% having hip
   fractures. The mean (range) numbers of EMS transports before and after
   the injury were 0.5 (0-45) and 0.9 (0-56), for an unadjusted incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) of 1.7 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.7-1.8). The
   increase in EMS utilization following an injury hospitalization was even
   greater after adjusting for risk period and other model predictors (IRR
   2.4, 95\% CI 2.3-2.5). Annual mean EMS costs rose 74\% following the
   injury hospitalization, from \$211 to \$367 per person. The greatest
   increase was in nonemergent EMS use, accounting for 67\% of the increase
   in the number of uses. Institutionalization in a skilled nursing or
   rehabilitation facility either before or after injury was strongly
   associated with the need for EMS care. Conclusion. An injury
   hospitalization in the elderly serves as a sentinel marker for an abrupt
   increase in EMS utilization and costs, even after accounting for
   confounders.}},

Title = {{A prospective global measure, the Punum Ladder, provides more valid
   assessments of quality of life than a retrospective transition measure}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We assessed the reliability and validity of two measures of
   change, one retrospective (the Global Rating of Change Scale {[}GRCS])
   and one prospective (the Punum Ladder), and the relative utility of the
   two methods of assessing change and establishing the minimal important
   difference (MID) of the Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a
   reliable and valid cough-specific quality-of-life (QoL) instrument.
   Study Design and Setting: A prospective, longitudinal study assessing
   the change in cough-related QoL over 6 months in participants with
   chronic cough was carried out in a tertiary care cough clinic. Before
   seeing a physician, subjects completed eight Punum Ladders and the CQLQ.
   At 1 and 6 months, eight Punum Ladders, the CQLQ, and seven GRCSs were
   completed. Punum Ladders and GRCSs were psychometrically tested, and
   MIDs were calculated.
   Results: Reliability and validity of GRCSs and Punum Ladders were
   acceptable. However, closer analysis of the relation between change
   scores and CQLQ pretest and posttest scores showed that the GRCS was
   only related to patient's present state, whereas the Punum Ladder was
   associated with both initial and present states. This compromises the
   validity of the GRCS. Crosstab comparisons revealed that GRCS ratings
   made more liberal estimates of change in the CQLQ than the Punum Ladder;
   this is reflected in their respective MIDs (10.58 +/- 10.63 vs. 21.89
   +/- 15.38).
   Conclusion: The prospective Punum Ladder is likely to be more useful,
   because it reflects the actual change in QoL over time in a less biased
   and more accurate way than the retrospective CRCS. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: This report describes the use of a novel sensitive
   and specific ELISA for the measurement of human fibrinogen-like protein
   2 (FGL2/fibroleukin), a novel effector of natural regulatory T (Treg)
   cells, to predict the course of chronic hepatitis C viral infection
   (HCV).
   Methods: Plasma levels of FGL2 were measured in HCV patients and
   compared to healthy controls and to patients with alcoholic liver
   disease.
   Results: FGL2 levels were significantly higher in HCV patients (84.3 +/-
   89.1 ng/ml, n = 80) compared to healthy controls (36.4 +/- 21.9 ng/ml, n
   = 30, p < 0.001), to a subset of patients who cleared HCV following
   anti-viral treatment (16.6 +/- 19.7 ng/ml, n = 32, p < 0.001), and to
   patients with inactive alcoholic liver disease (18.8 +/- 17.4 ng/ml, n =
   24, p < 0.001). Among HCV patients, plasma levels of FGL2 correlated
   significantly with the stage of fibrosis (p = 0.001) and were
   significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis (164.1 +/- 121.8 ng/ml,
   n = 60) compared to non-cirrhotics (57.7 +/- 52.8 ng/ml, n = 20, p =
   0.001). Genotype 1 patients had significantly higher levels of FGL2
   (98.1 +/- 100.3 ng/ml, n = 60) compared to patients with genotype 2/3
   (41.5 +/- 38.6 ng/ml, n = 20, p = 0.0008). Patients with genotype 2/3
   had FGL2 levels similar to healthy controls (41.5 +/- 38.6 vs. 36.41 +/-
   21.9 ng/ml, p = ns). Infiltrating lymphocytes in liver biopsies of HCV
   patients were positive for either FGL2 or FoxP3 (a marker of Treg cells)
   or expressed both markers.
   Conclusions: This report documents the development of a sensitive ELISA
   for measurement of plasma levels of FGL2 an effector Treg cells, which
   correlates with the severity of HCV infection. (C) 2010 European

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{683-688}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to verify the relationship between rating of
   perceived exertion (RPE) and electromyography (EMG) increases during
   exhaustive constant-load cycling bouts and, to compare and to correlate
   the power outputs corresponding to perceived exertion threshold (PET)
   and neuromuscular fatigue threshold (NFT). 11 men completed 3-4
   different exhaustive constant-load cycling bouts on a cycle ergometer,
   being RPE and EMG measured throughout the bouts. The linear regression
   of the RPEslope and EMG(slope) against the power output identified the
   PET and NFT intensity, respectively. There was a significant
   relationship between RPE slope and EMG(slope) (R-2 = 0.69; P < 0.01).
   However, the linearity of RPEslope (R-2 = 0.93 +/- 0.07) was
   significantly higher (P < 0.001) than EMG(slope) (R-2 = 0.63 +/- 0.25).
   In addition, the RPEslope and EMG(slope) were related to time to
   exhaustion (r = -0.59 and r = -0.60; P < 0.001). There was no
   significant difference (P = 0.42) between PET (201.5 +/- 27.9W) and NFT
   (210.3 +/- 22.6W) and they were significantly correlated (r = 0.78; P =
   0.005). Therefore, the RPE and EMG increases during exhaustive
   constant-load cycling bouts are related and, PET and NFT intensities are
   similar and closely associated.}},

Abstract = {{Well-resolved moment-tensor solutions reveal information about the
   sources of seismic waves. In this paper, we introduce a new way of
   assessing confidence in the regional full moment-tensor inversion via
   the introduction of the network sensitivity solution (NSS). The NSS
   takes into account the unique station distribution, frequency band, and
   signal-to-noise ratio of a given event scenario. The NSS compares both a
   hypothetical pure source (for example, an explosion or an earthquake)
   and the actual data with several thousand sets of synthetic data from a
   uniform distribution of all possible sources. The comparison with a
   hypothetical pure source provides the theoretically best-constrained
   source-type distribution for a given set of stations; and with it, one
   can determine whether further analysis with the data is warranted. The
   NSS that employs the actual data gives a direct comparison of all other
   source types with the best-fit source. In this way, one can choose a
   threshold level of fit in which the solution is comfortably constrained.
   The method is tested for the well-recorded nuclear test, JUNCTION, at
   the Nevada Test Site. Sources that fit comparably well to a hypothetical
   pure explosion recorded with no noise at the JUNCTION data stations have
   a large volumetric component and are not described well by a
   double-couple (DC) source. The NSS using the real data from JUNCTION is
   even more tightly constrained to an explosion because the data contain
   some energy that precludes fitting with any type of deviatoric source.
   We also calculate the NSS for the October 2006 North Korea test and a
   nearby earthquake, where the station coverage is poor and the event
   magnitude is small. The earthquake solution is very well fit by a DC
   source, and the best-fit solution to the nuclear test (M-w 4.1) is
   dominantly explosion.}},

Abstract = {{Irreversible, thermally induced sintering of heterogeneous catalysts is
   one of the most deleterious causes of activity loss during catalytic
   reaction and/or regeneration. Silica-coated Pd catalysts (Pd@SiO2) were
   prepared by a simple one-pot, water-in-oil microemulsion method and
   investigated as models for a general synthesis to encapsulate active
   nanoparticle catalysts to provide stability during extended periods of
   cycling and regeneration under harsh experimental conditions. An
   idealized stability test would involve both a catalyst whose activity
   changes significantly as particles sinter and test conditions that could
   readily induce sintering. Acetylene hydrogenation was chosen as the test
   reaction because its catalytic and regenerative (oxidative coke removal)
   cycling induce the destructive sintering conditions desired for such a
   test. When compared with Pd particles deposited on the outside of an
   identical silica support (Pd/SiO2 catalyst), the silica-encapsulated
   catalyst Pd@SiO2 deactivates at a much slower rate and is readily
   regenerated without sintering over multiple reaction and regeneration
   cycles. It is also found that silica encapsulation suppresses coking and
   in situ formation of PdC. TEM, XRD, BET, XPS, and TGA, before and after
   reaction and regeneration, were used to characterize the encapsulated
   Pd@SiO2 catalysts and compare them to conventionally supported Pd/SiO2.}},

Abstract = {{In most large-scale inventories, volume models rely on predicted heights
   instead of measured heights. The effect of height predictions over
   volume estimate uncertainty is therefore a crucial issue. In this study,
   we designed a statistical estimator that enables the propagation of tree
   height prediction errors into a general volume model. The proposed
   estimator relies on the assumption that both the volume model and the
   height-diameter model that provides the height predictions do not
   exhibit any lack of fit. This estimator was tested against a Monte Carlo
   simulation for 90 plots from three typical forest types in Quebec,
   Canada (hardwood, mixedwood, and softwood). The results show that the
   estimator provides plot volume predictions with error variances that fit
   those estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The estimator
   developed in this study may be useful to quickly provide the uncertainty
   associated with plot volume predictions in large-scale inventories.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the viability and value of comparing
   cause-specific mortality across four socioeconomically and culturally
   diverse settings using a completely standardised approach to VA
   interpretation.
   METHODS Deaths occurring between 1999 and 2004 in Butajira (Ethiopia),
   Agincourt (South Africa), FilaBavi (Vietnam) and Purworejo (Indonesia)
   health and socio-demographic surveillance sites were identified. VA
   interviews were successfully conducted with the caregivers of the
   deceased to elicit information on signs and symptoms preceding death.
   The information gathered was interpreted using the InterVA method to
   derive population cause-specific mortality fractions for each of the
   four settings.
   RESULTS The mortality profiles derived from 4784 deaths using InterVA
   illustrate the potential of the method to characterise sub-national
   profiles well. The derived mortality patterns illustrate four
   populations with plausible, markedly different disease profiles,
   apparently at different stages of health transition.
   CONCLUSIONS Given the standardised method of VA interpretation, the
   observed differences in mortality cannot be because of local differences
   in assigning cause of death. Standardised, fit-for-purpose methods are
   needed to measure population health and changes in mortality patterns so
   that appropriate health policy and programmes can be designed,
   implemented and evaluated over time and place. The InterVA approach
   overcomes several longstanding limitations of existing methods and
   represents a valuable tool for health planners and researchers in
   resource-poor settings.}},

Abstract = {{The Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is an approved chronic
   myeloid leukemia treatment and is under investigation for solid tumor
   therapy. Members of the Src family of kinases (SFKs) are involved in the
   process of metastasis and dasatinib inhibits the migration and
   invasiveness of human melanoma cell lines in vitro. SFKs are also
   involved in immune function and angiogenesis, which both contribute to
   tumorigenesis. As active and passive immunotherapies continue to be
   investigated in metastatic melanoma, we investigated possible
   interactions between kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. A murine
   syngenic model of metastatic melanoma in which B16F10 cells expressed
   ovalbumin (B16-OVA) was employed and the active immunotherapy comprised
   immunization with an OVA-expressing recombinant fowlpox virus (FPVOVA).
   Dasatinib did not affect B16-OVA viability, proliferation, migration or
   soft agar colony formation. However, depending on drug dose and
   schedule, differences in the metastatic behavior of B16-OVA were
   observed in vivo after dasatinib therapy. At a dose of 5 mg/kg/day given
   before tumor challenge, dasatinib therapy reduced the number of
   pulmonary metastases. Conversely, a higher dose (25 mg/kg/day), did not
   affect the number of pulmonary metastases and increased the number of
   extra-pulmonary metastases. Finally, immunization of B16-OVA-bearing
   mice with FPVOVA reduced the number of lung metastases. Prior treatment
   of these mice with dasatinib 5 mg/kg/day did not affect the incidence of
   lung metastases. Although the mechanisms by which dasatinib alters the
   metastatic behavior of B16-OVA cells in vivo remain to be determined, we
   hypothesize that dasatinib acts via multiple tumor-extrinsic processes
   that include immune function and neoangiogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The aerosol direct effect, which characterizes the interaction of
   radiation with aerosol particles, remains poorly understood. By
   determining aerosol composition, shape, and internal structure, we can
   predict aerosol optical properties. In this study, we performed a
   feasibility study to determine if tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
   (TM-AFM) and Raman microscopy can be effectively used to obtain
   information on aerosol composition, shape, and structure. These
   techniques are advantageous because they operate under ambient pressure
   and temperature. We worked with model aerosol particles composed of
   organic components of varying solubility mixed with ammonium sulfate. In
   particular, we explored whether aerosols could be differentiated on the
   basis of the solubility of the organic component. We also characterized
   the aerosol internal structure and investigated how this structure
   changes as the solubility of the organic compound is varied. To obtain
   indirect chemical information from AFM, we imagedparticles supported on
   both polar, SiOx/Si(100), and nonpolar, highly ordered pyrolytic
   graphite, surfaces. We have found that AFM can be used to differentiate
   the solubility of the organic component. In some cases, AFM can also be
   used to identify internal structure. With Raman microscopy, we can
   differentiate between core-shell structures and homogeneous structures.
   Surprisingly, we find that even for the most soluble compounds,
   core-shell structures are observed. To discuss consequences of our
   results for climate studies, we calculate the difference in radiative
   forcing caused by having a core-shell aerosol rather than a homogeneous
   particle. Overall, these techniques are promising for characterizing
   composition, shape, and internal structure of atmospheric particles.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-automated DNA extraction process for casework samples based on
   the Promega DNA IQ (TM) system was optimized and validated on TECAN
   Genesis 150/8 and Freedom EVO robotic liquid handling stations
   configured with fixed tips and a TECAN TE-Shake (TM) unit. The use of an
   orbital shaker during the extraction process promoted efficiency with
   respect to DNA capture, magnetic bead/DNA complex washes and DNA
   elution. Validation studies determined the reliability and limitations
   of this shaker-based process. Reproducibility with regards to DNA yields
   for the tested robotic workstations proved to be excellent and not
   significantly different than that offered by the manual
   phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA extraction of animal: human blood
   mixtures contaminated with soil demonstrated that a human profile was
   detectable even in the presence of abundant animal blood. For exhibits
   containing small amounts of biological material, concordance studies
   confirmed that DNA yields for this shaker-based extraction process are
   equivalent or greater to those observed with phenol/chloroform
   extraction as well as our original validated automated magnetic bead
   percolation-based extraction process. Our data further supports the
   increasing use of robotics for the processing of casework samples. Crown

Abstract = {{The effect of climate change on storm-surge flooding and the
   implications for population and structural damages on the city of Corpus
   Christi, Texas, was investigated. The study considered the influence of
   sea level rise and hurricane intensification, both influenced by climate
   change. Combinations of future carbon dioxide equivalent emission rates
   and carbon dioxide doubling sensitivities, based on findings of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, were considered to define
   future climate scenarios. A suite of physically based numerical models
   for hurricane winds and the resulting waves, surge, and morphological
   change at the coast were used to determine flooded areas, population
   affected, and property damages for Hurricanes Bret, Beulah, and a
   version of Carla shifted south from its original track, under present
   and predicted future climate conditions. A comparison of the economic
   damages for current climate conditions and for the 2080s climate
   scenario shows that, for Carla (shifted), there will be an increase in
   the range of \$270-1,100 million; for Beulah, of \$100-390 million; and,
   for Bret, of \$30-280 million. A similar analysis was also conducted for
   2030s predicted climate scenarios. Overall, the comparison of the
   results for the different climate conditions indicates what the
   destructive consequences of climate change could be, even within the
   somewhat short time frame of 80 years considered here.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical communication in bacteria, sometimes called quorum sensing, is
   a fundamental microbial process that is based on the exchange of
   molecular signals between cells. The signaling molecules involved in
   this process are thermodynamically unstable in some environments and
   their degradation affects microbial communication. This work reports the
   oxidation of a series of substituted N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs, a
   class of quorum sensing signals) by hydroxyl radicals. The corresponding
   bimolecular rate constants were obtained and correlated positively with
   the length of the acyl side chain (C, in numbers of carbon atoms)
   ranging from 2.4 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) to 9.4 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) (C4- to
   C10-AHL), 2.4 x 10(8) M(-1)s(-1) for 3-oxo C6-AHL, and 2.94 X 10(9) M-1
   s(-1) for 3-oxo C8-AHL. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric
   techniques were applied to qualify the identity and quantify the yields
   of the hydroxyl radical oxidation products of C6-AHL (aldo, keto, and
   hydroxylated C6-analogues identified). The biological activity of C6-AHL
   and associated products was determined using the Vibrio harveyi
   bioluminescence bioassay. Oxidation resulted in a net increase in assay
   response indexed against the starting AHL. This result suggested that
   the application of HO center dot based technologies such as advanced
   oxidation processes for biofilm control may result in unintended quorum
   sensing responses by microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{Recent foraminiferal assemblages are identified in 70 grab samples from
   20-380 m depth in the Pontine Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). All
   broken and relict tests of benthic foraminifera and other bioclastic
   sediments were counted for each sample, in order to provide a more
   complete description of the benthic community. Hierarchical cluster
   analysis (HCA) was performed on the relative abundances (live + dead) of
   53 taxa of benthic foraminifera that were common in the samples. Q-mode
   HCA recognizes three distinct foraminiferal biofacies, each associated
   with a particular bioclastic lithofacies: 1) the
   Asterigerinata-Lobatula-Rosalina biofacies occurs at 20-150 m and is
   dominated by benthic foraminifera, most notably epiphytic species such
   as Asterigerinata mantilla, Lobatula lobatula, and Rosalina brad vi;
   other bioclasts include rhodoliths, bryozoans, and echinoid spines,
   which constitute the rhodalgal lithofacies; 2) the Cassidulina carinata
   biofacies at intermediate depths of 100-250 m includes benthic and
   planktonic foraminifera among branches of bryozoans that constitute the
   bryomol lithofacies; also present are high percentages of reworked
   glauconitic tests of shallow-water taxa (e.g., Elphidium, Lobatula, and
   Asterigerinata), possibly related to Late Quaternary sea-level
   stillstands; 3) the Uvigerina-Bulimina biofacies at 200-380 m, that is
   characterized by Uvigerina mediterranea and Bulimina marginata; in
   addition to benthic and planktonic foraminifera, it has a molechfor
   lithofacies of bivalves and gastropods.}},

Abstract = {{Navigating organizations through a changing environment is central to
   leadership. Thus, innovativeness has proven to be critical to the
   process of achieving strategic competitiveness (Yukl, Leadership in
   Organizations, 1998). This skill is particularly needed when the firm is
   confronted with the unique challenges of a religious organization. The
   existence of innovation and the dependencies that encourage or restrict
   its existence in this environment are largely unknown. Utilizing a
   sample of 250 religious organizations in five geographical areas this
   research explores the impact of the leader tenure on the degree of
   organizational innovation. An analysis of variance for innovative
   strategy use across the three tenure groups was significant, F (2, 247)
   = 6.08, p < 0.01, which indicated innovation differences across the
   three levels of leader tenure. Post hoc analysis indicated that the low
   tenure leadership group was associated with lower levels of innovation
   than either of the other groups. Detailed findings are presented and the
   managerial implications and suggestions are provided. This research has
   strong implications for implementation of leadership development and
   strategic management of the increasing number of socially conscious
   organizations and organizations with large volunteer components.}},

Abstract = {{Based on in vitro rat and human hepatocyte uptake studies showing
   inhibition of warfarin uptake in the presence of the nonspecific organic
   anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitor rifampin, a clinical
   study was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers to examine the in vivo
   relevance of OATP hepatic uptake on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. In
   a randomized, single-dose, two-period, crossover design, subjects
   received a 7.5-mg dose of warfarin, either alone or immediately
   following a 600-mg intravenous dose of rifampin. Rifampin did not
   significantly alter the R-or S-warfarin area under the
   concentration-time curves (AUCs) from 0 to 12 h (period of hepatic OATP
   inhibition by rifampin) or the maximum plasma concentration (C(max))
   value. AUC(0-infinity) was decreased on days rifampin was administered,
   for both R-warfarin (25\% reduction; P < 0.001) and S-warfarin (15\%
   reduction; P < 0.05). No differences were seen in the area under the
   international normalized ratio (INR)-time curve. Our study suggests that
   hepatic uptake via OATPs may not be clinically important in the
   pharmacokinetics of warfarin.}},

Abstract = {{Glutamate and its receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of mood
   disorders and have recently emerged as potential targets for the
   pharmacotherapy of depression. In rats, we investigated plasticity
   changes of the glutamatergic system evoked by electroconvulsive shock
   (ECS), which represents the most effective therapy for patients who are
   refractory to antidepressants. Chronic ECS produced a marked increase in
   the phosphorylation of the regulatory NMDA receptor subunit NR2B
   (Ser(1303)) and the AMPA receptor subunit GluR-A (Ser(831)) in the
   hippocampus, with no effects on the obligatory subunit NR1. No effects
   were found on total receptor subunit expression levels. We suggest that,
   at least in part, ECS exerts its clinical activity through the
   modulation of the glutamatergic synapses, via potentiation of AMPA
   currents mediated by GluR-A (Ser(831)) phosphorylation, and a reduction
   of NMDA receptor activity through the phosphorylation of NR2B
   (Ser(1303)), presumably uncoupling NR2B from its signalling partner
   CaMKII. These effects functionally resemble the recently described
   antidepressant effects of ketamine.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the amounts of volatile constituents of Cymbopogon citratus
   (DC) Staf, Poaceae, collected in different regions of Sao Paulo
   State.{''} The essential oil extracted from Cymbopogon citratus (DC)
   Staf, Poaceae, is rich in citral and it has many applications in
   chemical and pharmaceutical industry. The aims of this study were to
   evaluate the amount of citral in populations of C. citratus collected in
   two different regions (Ibiuna and Pindamonhangaba, Sao Paulo State). The
   essential oil extracted of a cultivated population in Pidamonhangaba-SP,
   showed a high content of citral (approximately 96.0\%), while the
   essential oil from Ibiuna-SP, showed citral and high amounts of another
   monoterpene, geraniol. Additionally, the essential oils from this
   population of C. citratus were extracted and analyzed during 24 h (each
   3 h), being the major concentration of citral in the night period,

Abstract = {{The isolated bladder extrophy is a major congenital malformation which
   prenatal diagnosis is essential It is based on the non-visualization of
   the bladder during the first trimester ultrasound but in most cases, it
   is confirmed by the morphological ultrasound of the second trimester.
   For the baby, the prognosis of life quality depends on the accurate
   identification of the malformation, the foetal sex and the associated
   pathologies Thus, a detailed ultrasound evaluation is necessary and
   requires an operator experienced in the search of malformations As this
   abnormality has important aesthetic and functional consequences, a
   multidisciplinary management is required for a good information of the
   couple The continuation of pregnancy is currently possible but the
   couple should be informed that after surgery, often a major one, more
   than 75\% of children will have a urinary continence by reconstruction
   or bypass. Furthermore, their ability of reproduction will need to be
   medically improved. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The term Schallamach wave is used to describe a wave of detachment that
   sometimes arises during the frictional sliding of a smooth rubber
   surface against a smooth rigid surface. Extensive experimental
   investigations have been made since Schallamach first observed the waves
   in 1971; however, no successful finite element analysis (FEA) modeling
   of the behavior has been reported yet. This work uses an explicit
   dynamics FEA approach to model both the initiation and progression of
   waves of detachment for the first time. The use of the finite element
   method allows for the detailed stress and strain analysis at the
   interface to be examined. Here, the limitations of using a purely
   elastic solution in plane-strain are explored. To validate the explicit
   dynamics approach for modeling the Schallamach waves, another biaxial
   compressive buckling mode has also been modeled.}},

Abstract = {{Bovine abortion is a limiting factor for dairy business, as it decreases
   milk production and the potential, number of herd replacements,
   increases feeding and medical treatment costs, increases the number of
   artificial inseminations to obtain a calf as well as culling rates of
   cows. An estimation of the economic impact of abortion in dairy farms in
   Chile is not available yet. The aim of this study was to estimate the
   economic consequences of bovine abortion syndrome (BAS) in dairy cows
   from Chile. A stochastic model was proposed to evaluate the cost of an
   abortion on a yearly basis to include variability in cost and income by
   dairy and by year. The marginal total net revenue (Delta TNR) for a
   typical, lactation was obtained by the calculating the difference
   between total revenues (retail milk and calf sales) and total expenses
   (production cost (cows, feeding, labor, health) plus administrative and,
   general costs) for lactation with and without abortion. Production data
   were obtained from a retrospective study of 127 dairy herds located in
   southern Chile between 2000 and 2006. Milk production from cows with and
   without abortion was estimated by a mixed model using milk test day
   data. Production cost and prices paid to farmers were obtained from
   service company records (TODOAGRO S.A.). Cost and income value was
   corrected for inflation and expressed in the values from 2006. In
   addition, a separate analysis for different parities (1, 2, 3 or more)
   was performed. Distributions for the stochastic variables were obtained
   by fitting distributions from our database using @Risk. The stochastic
   variables included in the analysis were all related to income, feeding,
   depreciation, health, Artificial Insemination and general costs like
   fuel, salaries, taxes, etc. There was a high probability (89.20\%) of a
   negative Delta TNR in lactations with abortion for overall, parities,
   with a mean loss of \$ -143.32. Stratifying by parity, the predicted
   mean of the distribution for Delta TNR in each parity (1, 2, 3 or more)
   was also negative and the probability of a negative Delta TNR was
   89.40\%, 95.30\% and 97.00\%, respectively, but differs between them (p
   < 0.05). For parity 1, mean Delta TNR was \$ -120.92, parity 2 \$
   -116.35 and for parities >= 3 it was \$ -132.26 and the mean was
   statistically different from the others (p < 0.05). The age of culled
   cows was the input variable most correlated with TNR and dairy
   production was the second. However, the sale price of milk resulted in a
   low correlation with abortion cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The condensation of 85000 Cu or Ni atoms from the high-temperature gas
   phase has been simulated by molecular dynamics with the tight binding
   potential. The efect of the subsequent thermal treatment on the shape
   and structure of synthesized particles was studied by simulating their
   gradual heating in a range of 100-1200 K. Some tendencies are revealed
   that are characteristic of the influence of heat treatment on the
   nanoparticles synthesized from the gas phase. It is concluded that
   short-term heating leads to significant ordering of the internal
   structure in 70\% of agglomerated nanoparticles with the predominant
   formation of spherical shapes. In order to explain this result, the main
   mechanisms of cluster formation from the gas phase have been analyzed
   and it is found that the agglomeration temperature plays the main role
   in the formation of clusters with unified shape and structure. This
   opens the fundamental possibility of obtaining Cu and Ni nanoclusters
   with preset size, shape, and structure and, hence, predictable physical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{The hormone prolactin (PRL) contributes to the pathogenesis of breast
   cancer in part through its activation of Janus-activated kinase 2
   (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5), a PRL
   receptor (PRLr)-associated pathway dependent on cross-talk signaling
   from integrins. It remains unclear, however, how this crosstalk is
   mediated. Following PRL stimulation, we show that a complex between the
   transmembrane glycoprotein signal regulatory protein-alpha (SIRP alpha)
   and the PRLr, beta(1) integrin, and Jak2 in estrogen receptor-positive
   (ER+) and ER-breast cancer cells is formed. Overexpression of SIRP alpha
   in the absence of collagen 1 significantly decreased PRL-induced gene
   expression, phosphorylation of PRLr-associated signaling proteins, and
   PRL-stimulated proliferation and soft agar colony formation. In
   contrast, overexpression of SIRP alpha in the presence of collagen 1
   increased PRL-induced gene expression; phosphorylation of Jak2, Stat5,
   and Erk; and PRL-stimulated cell growth. Interestingly, overexpression
   of a tyrosine-deficient SIRP alpha (SIRP alpha-4YF) prevented the
   signaling and phenotypic effects mediated by wild-type SIRP alpha.
   Furthermore, overexpression of a phosphatase-defective mutant of Shp-2
   or pharmacologic inhibition of Shp-2 produced effects comparable with
   that of SIRP alpha-4YF. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRP
   alpha was unaffected in the presence or absence of collagen 1. These
   data suggest that SIRP alpha modulates PRLr-associated signaling as a
   function of integrin occupancy predominantly through the alteration of
   Shp-2 activity. This PRLr-SIRP alpha-integrin complex may therefore
   provide a basis for integrin-PRLr cross-talk and contribute to the
   biology of breast cancer. Mol Cancer Res; 8(10); 1413-24. (C) 2010 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-based

   poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) hydrogels were synthesized by
   photocopolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide with
   2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and polycaprolactone dimethacrylate. The
   hydrogels' phase transition temperature, swelling, and viscoelastic
   properties, as well as hydrolytic degradability at 25 and 37 degrees C,
   were explored. A sphere-templating technique was applied to fabricate
   hydrogel scaffolds with controllable pore size and a highly
   interconnected porous structure. The scaffold pore diameter change as a
   function of temperature was evaluated and, as expected, pores decreased
   in diameter when the temperature was raised to 37 degrees C.
   3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test
   results suggested neither the scaffolds nor their degradation products
   were cytotoxic to NIH3T3 cells. Scaffolds-with 55 +/- 5 mu m pore
   diameter were loaded with NIH3T3 cells and then were warmed to 37
   degrees C entrapping cells in pores approxitnately 39 mu m in diameter,
   a size range we have found to be optimal for angiogenesis and
   biointegration. Cells showed uniform infiltration and an elongated
   morphology after 7 days of culture. Due to the controlled monodisperse
   pore diameter. highly interconnected architecture, fully degradable
   chemistry and thermoresponsive properties, the polyNIPAM-based scaffolds
   developed here are attractive for applications in tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of directionality on the information propagation in a
   contagion model with complex propagation, i.e., that takes into account
   the need for simultaneous exposure to multiple activation sources, is
   studied. While it is known that complex propagation is blocked with
   increasing network randomness, here it is shown that network
   directionality affects such a result, leading to several different
   behaviors depending on the preservation of the in-degree or out-degree.
   The critical points for the occurrence of complex propagation in 1D
   directed small world networks are determined. It is shown that these
   points only depend on the number of outgoing links. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   surgery, and percutaneous and endoscopic transcatheter occlusion of the

   occlusion of a persistent cystic duct bile leak after cholecystectomy
   using N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue. A 51-year-old man had persistent pain
   and bilious drainage following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The bile
   leak persisted after endoscopic placement of a biliary stent for a
   confirmed cystic duct leak. A repeat ERCP was carried out and the cystic
   duct was occluded with a combination of angiographic coils and N-butyl
   cyanoacrylate glue. The patient's pain and bilious drainage resolved. A
   follow-up cholangiogram confirmed complete resolution of the cystic duct
   leak and a patent common bile duct.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines oral tissue color in Uygur and Han Chinese
   populations. The color of oral tissues is of great significance in
   dental field. It remains uncertain whether there is any difference in
   the color of oral tissues between different nationalities or
   ethnicities. Little is known about the color of oral tissues in
   different Chinese populations. The study included 263 Uygur and Han
   students aged 18-22 years. The color of anterior teeth, vermilion, and
   attached gingiva in the subjects was measured by spectrophotometry and
   expressed through the CIELCh system. The t test and ANOVA was used to
   analyze color difference between groups. Distribution ranges for L-ab{*}
   (lightness), C-ab{*} (chroma) and h(ab){*} (hue angle) of anterior
   teeth, vermilion, and attached gingiva in these two ethnicities were
   obtained. Significant differences in color of oral tissues between Uygur
   and Han Ethnicities were found out. The Uygur and Han populations have
   similar spatial distribution ranges for the color of oral tissues, with
   slight differences that displayed strong regularities, suggesting that
   the color of oral tissues was associated with race. In addition, there
   was a trend of decreasing lightness (especially for maxillary anterior
   teeth), increasing chroma and redder hue from the center of teeth toward
   the sides in both ethnicities. There were differences in the color of
   teeth and attached gingiva between sexes in the Uygur and Han
   populations. The color of the upper vermilion differed significantly
   from that of the lower vermilion. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the study was to explore the distribution of
   healthy people with different anti-tumour ability.
   Material and methods: Leukocytes were separated by the Ficoll-Hypaque
   density gradient centrifugal method. Then they were mixed with A549,
   MCF-7 and Hela cells at different ratios. The survival rate for target
   cells was observed and counted by Fluoroskan. Immune function for 200
   healthy people was analysed by flow cytometry.
   Results: The results obtained by confocal microscopy revealed that human
   blood leukocytes possessed direct anti-tumour activity. The survival
   rate for tumour cells was the lowest in the condition of 20:1 ratio of
   effector cells to target cells. We speculated that in 200 healthy people
   the leukocyte capacity for killing MCF-7 cells is stronger than the
   leukocyte capacity for killing A549 cells and Hela cells. We also found
   that the distribution for 200 healthy people with different anti-tumour
   ability was different for different tumour cells. The number of healthy
   people with the strongest anti-tumour ability was highest when the
   target cells were MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the survival of A549, MCF-7 and
   Hela cells was correlated with T, B and NK lymphocytes.
   Conclusions: From the above, we can select healthy individuals with
   strong antitumour ability as anti-tumour donors according to their
   distribution with different anti-tumour ability, which opened up a new
   direction for fighting human cancer.}},

   pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of this study was to
   examine the effects of atorvastatin on the clinical manifestations and
   expression of p38, p27 and Jab1 using a rat PAH model. Ninety-six male
   Wistar rats were divided into control (receiving no surgical treatment),
   vehicle and treatment groups, among which the last two groups underwent
   left pneumonectomy and were then treated with monocrotaline (MCT, 60
   mg/kg). Both control and vehicle groups subsequently received saline,
   and the treatment group received atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) by stomach
   catheter. Rats were sacrificed, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure
   (mPAP) and right ventricle hypertrophy index (RVHI) were measured. The
   expression of p38, p27, and Jab1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry
   and Western blotting. At 28 days, mPAP and RVHI and expression levels of
   Jab1 and p38 in the vehicle group were significantly higher than those
   in the treatment and control groups. However, the expression of p27 was
   lowest in the vehicle group among the three groups. Atorvastatin reduced
   PAP and RVHI in the rat PAH model, decreased expression of p38 and Jab1
   but increased expression of p27.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel high-throughput very large scale integration
   implementation for a lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
   First, an efficient parallel processing technique using look-ahead
   pipelining is investigated for implementation of 1-D DWT; then the
   scalable design respectively for the 1-D architecture and 2-D
   architecture is introduced. The proposed designs indicate that the delay
   registers of the 1-D architecture and the line buffers of the 2-D
   architecture do not increase proportionally to the amount of parallelism
   exploited, which is very meaningful to control increase of cost for 2-D
   high-speed implementation. The proposed 2-D architecture could complete
   one level of the decomposition transform for an NxN frame of an image in
   approximately NxN/(4IxJ) intraclock cycles, where the values of I and J
   could be set as arbitrary suitable positive integers. Compared with the
   previous similar methods, the proposed design could efficiently save
   hardware resources under the same throughput rate, and has more flexible
   scalability and simpler control complexity; thus, it could be an
   efficient alternative for high-speed applications. (C) 2010 Society of

Title = {{Designing Dependable Storage Solutions for Shared Application

Abstract = {{The costs of data loss and unavailability can be large, so businesses
   use many data protection techniques such as remote mirroring, snapshots,
   and backups to guard against failures. Choosing an appropriate
   combination of techniques is difficult because there are numerous
   approaches for protecting data and allocating resources. Storage system
   architects typically use ad hoc techniques, often resulting in
   overengineered expensive solutions or underprovisioned inadequate ones.
   In contrast, this paper presents a principled automated approach for
   designing dependable storage solutions for multiple applications in
   shared environments. Our contributions include search heuristics for
   intelligent exploration of the large design space and modeling
   techniques for capturing interactions between applications during
   recovery. Using realistic storage system requirements, we show that our
   design tool produces designs that cost up to two times less in initial
   outlays and expected data penalties than the designs produced by an
   emulated human design process. Additionally, we compare our design tool
   to a random search heuristic and a genetic algorithm metaheuristic, and
   show that our approach consistently produces better designs for the
   cases we have studied. Finally, we study the sensitivity of our design
   tool to several input parameters.}},

   sequential substitution of {[}N(3)P(3)Cl(6)] using
   (R)-2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl, 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-biphenyl and
   Cs(2)CO(3) in acetone, have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction, variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy in solution and MM
   calculations under periodic boundary conditions in the gas state. In
   both compounds only the diastereomer corresponding to the (R)-biphenoxy
   configuration is present in the solid state. In spite of the existence
   of quite large voids potentially occupied by solvents, the configuration
   adopted by the biphenoxy substituents is solely determined by packing
   interactions consisting of definite preferential supramolecular
   interactions between a biphenoxy group of one molecule and the chiral
   pocket created between the biphenoxy and binaphthoxy groups of another
   molecule. A network of T-shaped non-covalent interactions ensures an
   efficient chiral discrimination. The in silico simulations confirmed
   this hypothesis. Both the concentration-dependence and
   temperature-variable (1)H NMR spectra in solution confirmed this
   behaviour showing that on lowering the temperature one of the two
   diasteroisomers vanished after conversion into the more stable
   atropisomer as a consequence of chiral induction of the (R)-binaphthyl
   system on the (R)-biphenyl configuration. In further agreement with the
   X-ray structure as well as with the energy distribution resulting from
   the in silico calculations, the (1)H NMR spectra show the dependence of
   the chemical shift on concentration, which suggests the presence of
   aggregates in solution. Therefore molecules I and II are capable of a
   special type of self-organization by chiral recognition based on the ad
   hoc generation of chiral pockets.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been regarded as the principal
   susceptibility gene linked with Alzheimer's disease, also suggesting a
   relationship with depression in the elderly population. Thus, the
   purpose was to investigate the association of APOE polymorphisms with
   depression in elderly adults.
   Methods APOE polymorphisms were determined in a Mexican population-based
   sample older than 60 years (n = 1566) using 50 exonuclease TaqMan
   genotyping assays.
   Results The distribution of the APOE allele and genotype frequencies was
   similar in patients with and without depression. There was no
   significant association between the presence of alleles or genotypes and
   depression and anxiety (Short Anxiety Screening Test) considering
   several combinations of other features. However, patients with the
   APOE{*}4 allele presented more thinking and concentration impairment

Abstract = {{Hirsch's h index is becoming the standard measure of an individual's
   research accomplishments. The aggregation of individuals' measures is
   also the basis for global measures at institutional or national levels.
   To investigate whether the h index can be reliably computed through
   alternative sources of citation records, the Web of Science (WoS),
   PsycINFO and Google Scholar (GS) were used to collect citation records
   for known publications of four Spanish psychologists. Compared with WoS,
   PsycINFO included a larger percentage of publication records, whereas GS
   outperformed WoS and PsycINFO in this respect. Compared with WoS,
   PsycINFO retrieved a larger number of citations in unique areas of
   psychology, but it retrieved a smaller number of citations in areas that
   are close to statistics or the neurosciences, whereas GS retrieved the
   largest numbers of citations in all cases. Incorrect citations were
   scarce in Wos (0.3\%), more prevalent in PsycINFO (1.1\%), and
   overwhelming in GS (16.5\%). All platforms retrieved unique citations,
   the largest set coming from GS. WoS and PsycINFO cover distinct areas of
   psychology unevenly, thus applying different penalties on the h index of
   researches working in different fields. Obtaining fair and accurate h
   indices required the union of citations retrieved by all three
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Medical complications after lung transplantation (LT) are
   frequent despite the advances in management. The objectives of this
   study were to evaluate the incidence and clinical features of pulmonary
   embolism (PE) among LT recipients in our center.
   Patients and Methods. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of
   280 patients who underwent LT between June 1999 and December 2009.
   Results. Five patients with PE (1.78\%) had undergone single LT due to
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). PE developed in the transplanted
   lung and was bilateral in 2 cases. The only associated risk factor was
   obesity in 3 patients. The clinical presentation was nonspecific; the
   most frequent symptom being dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT)
   angiography and ventilation-perfusion scan were used for diagnosis.
   Patients underwent treatment with low molecular weight heparin followed
   by oral anticoagulation.
   Conclusions. Our study showed a low incidence of PE (1.78\%), although
   we focused exclusively on this condition, excluding other entities such
   as deep vein thrombosis. All PE events occurred in the subpopulation of
   IPF transplant recipients. Possibly some factors predisposed these
   patients to PE, although they remain unclear. Because PE can cause
   significant morbidity in LT recipients, it is important to include PE in
   the differential diagnosis among LT patients presenting with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, or clinical deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a remote laboratory for industrial automation
   comprising different programmable logic controller (PLC) manufacturers.
   This facility provides an environment for remote users to learnmany
   automation topics while using different PLCs together with several types
   of sensors, actuators, and industrial communication networks. The
   laboratory architecture that makes up the remote automation laboratory
   (RAL) is based on a Moodle-server master PC (MPC), which also manages
   the booking system of PLC benches available in the laboratory. There
   exist a cluster of virtual machines (VMs) running on several slave PCs
   (SPCs), four VMs per SPC. Each VM can manage a type of PLC bench of the
   automation laboratory. The MPC server balances the load of SPCs allowing
   the implementation and easy upgrading of the RAL offering different PLCs
   at the same time within the same remote interface. The remote laboratory
   has Internet protocol cameras providing a view of the real environment
   of each PLC bench to the remote user. The authentication system and
   management of remote users and PLC benches are made via Moodle plug-ins
   and hypertext preprocessor (PHP) scripts. Two external/internal routers
   dynamically configure the remote users' access to a particular PLC
   bench. RAL architecture can be applied to other e-learning areas.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To quantify the obliquity and dimensions of the upper and
   second sacral segment iliosacral screw safe zones and to determine the
   differences between normal and dysmorphic sacral morphology.
   Design: Retrospective cohort.
   Setting: University Level I trauma center.
   Patients/Participants: Fifty patients with pelvic computed tomography
   scans.
   Intervention: All sacra were characterized as normal or dysmorphic based
   on plain pelvic radiographs and previously described criteria. Multiple
   computed tomography scan reconstructions were viewed and manipulated
   simultaneously with 6 degrees of freedom to allow for custom
   visualization in any plane.
   Main Outcome Measurements: In each patient, a unique reconstruction
   plane was created perpendicular to the safe zone axis. The narrowest
   safe zone cross-sectional area was measured. Next, on simulated pelvic
   outlet and inlet views, safe zone obliquity and width were measured.
   Finally, the space available for a transverse screw was assessed.
   Measurements were performed for both upper and second sacral segment.
   Values for normal and dysmorphic safe zones were compared.
   Results: Sacral dysmorphism was identified in 22 patients. In these
   sacra, the upper sacral segment safe zone cross-section was 36\% smaller
   than in normal sacra (P < 0.001). No transverse screws could be placed,
   but accommodating for the caudal to cranial obliquity (30 degrees versus
   21 degrees in normals, P < 0.001) and posterior to anterior obliquity
   (15\% versus 4\% in normals, P < 0.001) of the safe zone, an iliosacral
   screw at least 75 mm in length could be placed safely in 91\% of
   patients. A transverse screw could be placed in 75\% of normal sacra. In
   the second segment safe zone, the cross-sectional area was more than
   twice as large in dysmorphic sacra compared to normals (220 mm(2) versus
   109 mm(2), P < 0.001). The obliquity was not different on either the
   inlet or outlet views between groups. A transverse screw could be placed
   at this level in 95\% of those with dysmorphic sacra and in only 50\% of
   normal sacra.
   Conclusions: Sacral dysmorphism occurred in 44\% of patients in this
   consecutive series. Many anatomic differences were consistently found
   between the two morphologies with clinical relevance to iliosacral screw
   placement. Specifically, the dysmorphic upper sacral segment safe zone
   is significantly smaller and more obliquely oriented but is still large
   enough to accommodate an iliosacral screw in nearly all patients. The
   second sacral segment safe zone is approximately transversely oriented
   in both sacral types but is more than twice as large in dysmorphic
   sacra. This segment may be a primary fixation opportunity in patients
   with sacral dysmorphism.}},

Title = {{Upscaling of Miscible Floods in Heterogeneous Reservoirs Considering
   Reservoir Mixing}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Inaccurate modeling of reservoir mixing by using large gridblocks in
   compositional simulation can affect recoveries significantly in miscible
   gasfloods and lead to inaccurate predictions of recovery performance.
   Reservoir mixing or dispersion is caused by diffusion of particles
   across streamlines; mixing can be enhanced significantly if the surface
   area of contact between the reservoir and injected fluid is increased as
   fluids propagate through the reservoir. A common way to convert
   geological models into simulation models is to upscale permeabilities on
   the basis of reservoir heterogeneity. Upscaling affects the degree of
   mixing that is modeled, but the importance of reservoir mixing in
   upscaling is largely ignored. This paper shows how to estimate the level
   of mixing in a reservoir and how to incorporate mixing into the
   upscaling procedure.
   We derive the key scaling groups for first-contact miscible (FCM) flow
   and show how they have an impact on reservoir mixing. Heterogeneities
   are assumed to dominate the flow regime so that gravity effects are
   negligible. We examine only local mixing, not apparent mixing caused by
   variations in streamline path lengths (convective spreading). Local
   mixing is important because it affects the strength of the injected
   fluid and can cause an otherwise multicontact miscible (MCM) flood to
   become immiscible. More than 1,000 2D numerical simulations are carried
   out using experimental design to estimate dispersivity as a function of
   the derived scaling groups.
   We show that reservoir mixing is enhanced owing to fluid propagation
   through heterogeneous media. Because mixing is dependent on
   heterogeneities, upscaling is an iterative process in which the level of
   mixing in both the longitudinal and transverse directions must be
   matched from the fine to the coarse scale. The most important groups
   that affect mixing are the mobility ratio, dispersion number,
   correlation lengths, and the Dykstra-Parson coefficient. Large
   dispersion numbers yield greater dispersivities away from the injection
   well. We show through simulations of both FCM and MCM floods that
   gridblock size can be increased significantly when reservoir mixing is
   large. Heterogeneous reservoirs with large longitudinal correlation
   lengths can be upscaled to larger gridblocks than reservoirs with random
   permeability fields. This paper shows how to determine a priori the
   maximum gridblock size allowed in both the x- and z-directions to
   predict the oil recovery from miscible gasfloods accurately.}},

   acid residues were studied using surface enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS) supported by quantum chemical computations. Peptides display
   different net charges and hydrophobic characteristics, which are related
   to particular structural aspects of the peptide-metal interaction.
   Samples were photostable when probed with laser lines at 514, 633 and
   785 nm. SERS samples were prepared by coating the solid peptides with
   metal colloids on a quartz slice. This innovation makes possible to
   obtain high spectral batch to batch reproducibility. MRKDV SERS spectrum
   is dominated by signals coming from the guanidinium moiety of the
   arginine amino acid (R); guanidinium is the intrinsic probe which drives
   the orientation of the peptide on the metal surface. LGRGISL interacts
   with the metal surface through the guanidinium group and other amino
   acid residues; a single structural conformation of the peptide on the
   surface is proposed. ADEDRDA interacts with the metal surface through
   various amino acid residues, also including the guanidinium moiety; at
   least two different structural conformations seem to coexist on the
   surface. Theoretical calculations performed by using extended Huckel
   theory and 6-31G{*} methods for a model of arginine interacting with a
   silver cluster support the observed experimental result. Similar
   calculations involving the MRKDV peptide are also reported. Copyright

Abstract = {{Energy innovation plays a crucial role in the reduction of carbon
   emissions. In order to design climate and energy policies that promote
   the development, deployment and diffusion of new energy technologies,
   policy makers not only require a theoretical understanding of the energy
   innovation system, but also empirical evidence of the effects that
   policy actions have had. This paper focuses on public energy R\&D, a
   traditional and controversial option among the various climate
   technology policies, and empirically analyses its relationship with
   carbon emissions per GDP (i.e. carbon intensity) and its two components:
   energy intensity and the carbon factor. Evidence of the causality links
   that have prevailed in 13 advanced economies over the 1980-2004 period
   has been obtained through dynamic panel models. Our findings confirm
   that government R\&D spending is not sufficient by itself to boost the
   energy innovation process. Public energy R\&D has been successful in
   improving energy efficiency at country level, but it has failed to have
   a significant impact on the carbon factor and carbon intensity. At the
   same time the formation of energy R\&D budgets is found to be
   significantly affected by carbon trends. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Hemostasis management has evolved to include sophisticated
   point-of-care systems that provide individualized dosing through heparin
   concentration-based anticoagulation. The Hepcon HMS Plus system
   (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) estimates heparin dose, activated clotting
   time (ACT), and heparin dose response (HDR). However, the accuracy of
   this test has not been systematically evaluated in large cohorts.
   METHODS: We examined institutional databases for all patients who
   underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at our
   institution from February 2005 to July 2008. During this period, the
   Hepcon HMS Plus was used exclusively for assessment of heparin dosing
   and coagulation monitoring. Detailed demographic, surgical, laboratory,
   and heparin dosing data were recorded. ACT, calculated and measured HDR,
   and heparin concentrations were recorded. Performance of the Hepcon HMS
   Plus was assessed by comparison of actual and target ACT values and
   calculated and measured HDR.
   RESULTS: In 3880 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, heparin bolus
   dosing to a target ACT resulted in wide variation in the postheparin ACT
   (r(2) = 0.03). The postheparin ACT did not reach the target ACT
   threshold in 7.4\% (i.e., when target ACT was 300 s) and 16.9\% (i.e.,
   when target ACT was 350 s) of patients. Similarly, the target heparin
   level calculated from the HDR did not correlate with the postbolus
   heparin level, with 18.5\% of samples differing by more than 2 levels of
   the assay. Calculated and measured HDR were not linearly related at any
   heparin level.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Hepcon HMS Plus system poorly estimates heparin bolus
   requirements in the pre-CPB period. Further prospective studies are
   needed to elucidate what constitutes adequate anticoagulation for CPB
   and how clinicians can reliably and practically assess anticoagulation
   in the operating room. (Anesth Analg 2010;111:849-55)}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent converted to its
   active metabolite by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes. Numerous drugs are
   known to inhibit P-450 isoenzymes, including proton pump inhibitors
   (PPIs), which are often associated with aspirin and clopidogrel to
   prevent adverse gastrointestinal effects. in vitro studies first showed
   that PPIs reduced the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, while recent
   clinical studies have raised concerns that the addition of a PPI to
   clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients could actually
   increase the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the
   prescription of a PPI conferred a worse prognosis in patients discharged
   with aspirin and clopidogrel treatment after ACS.
   Methods: A total of 876 patients admitted with ACS and discharged with
   aspirin and clopidogrel, with a planned duration of at least six months,
   from January 2004 to March 2008, were reviewed. Patients were classified
   in two groups according to whether or not a PPI was prescribed at
   discharge. The PPIs considered were those mainly metabolized by
   cytochrome P-450 2C19. We excluded patients with insufficient
   information available on either prescription or clinical records that
   could allow us to clearly confirm or exclude exposure to a PPI. Primary
   end points were six-month all-cause mortality and the composite of
   death, myocardial infarction and unstable angina at six months.
   Results: Of the 802 patients considered for further analysis, 274
   (34.2\%) individuals were medicated with a PPI in addition to dual
   antiplatelet therapy. Patients taking PPIs were older, more often had
   renal insufficiency and less often had a history of coronary
   revascularization and smoking. They more often presented with Killip
   class >I and lower hemoglobin concentration on admission. There were no
   significant differences between the two groups in terms of medical
   treatment (during hospital stay and at discharge) or invasive
   procedures. By multivariate analysis, independent and positive
   predictors of PPI prescription were older age and lower hemoglobin
   concentration on admission. Patients taking PPIs had a slightly higher
   prevalence of six-month mortality (6.5\% vs. 3.9\%) and of the composite
   end point (12.9\% vs. 9.2\%), although without statistical significance.
   By multivariate analysis including potential confounding variables, the
   prescription of a PPI on top of aspirin and clopidogrel was still not
   associated with a worse prognosis.
   Conclusions: In the present study, PPI prescription in addition to
   aspirin and clopidogrel after ACS was not associated with a worse
   six-month prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Steam soil disinfestation is now being reconsidered in open field and
   greenhouse horticulture for its efficiency in controlling or even
   eradicating soil borne pathogens, nematodes and weed seeds, while
   ensuring low ecological impact. Due to the high energy and labour costs
   of this treatment, technical solutions able to increase efficiency and
   to reduce workload are needed and are being sought.
   This paper presents the design, development and testing of two steam
   supply systems for soil disinfestation. Since soil conditions, in terms
   of texture and humidity, play an important role and significantly
   influence the efficacy of the treatment, determining the thermal
   properties of the soil and influencing steam diffusion, the equipment
   design followed an extensive laboratory experimentation phase during
   which the effect of soil parameters on heat efficiency was assessed. In
   a companion paper (Gay et al., in press), an innovative implement, based
   on the coupling of the two devices presented in this paper, has been
   built, connected to a caterpillar track machine, equipped with a steam
   generator and an automatic guidance system, and used in open field

   Biochemical, Physiological, and Pharmacological Evidence From Targeted

Abstract = {{Background-Oxidative stress, an excessive production of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) outstripping antioxidant defense mechanisms, occurs in
   cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension. In the present
   study, we used biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological
   approaches to explore the role of derangements of catecholamines, ROS,
   and the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO center dot)
   in the development of a hyperadrenergic model of hereditary
   hypertension: targeted ablation (knockout {[}KO]) of chromogranin A
   (Chga) in the mouse.
   Methods and Results-Homozygous (-/-) Chga gene knockout (KO) mice were
   compared with wild-type (WT, +/+) control mice. In the KO mouse,
   elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were accompanied by
   not only elevated catecholamine (norepinephrine and epinephrine)
   concentrations but also increased ROS (H2O2) and isoprostane (an index
   of lipid peroxidation), as well as depletion of NO center dot. Renal
   transcript analyses implicated changes in Nox1/2, Xo/Xdh, and Sod1,2
   mRNAs in ROS elevation by the KO state. KO alterations in blood
   pressure, catecholamines, H2O2, isoprostane, and NO center dot could be
   abrogated or even normalized (rescued) by either sympathetic outflow
   inhibition (with clonidine) or NADPH oxidase inhibition (with apocynin).
   In cultured renal podocytes, H2O2 production was substantially augmented
   by epinephrine (probably through beta 2-adrenergic receptors) and
   modestly diminished by norepinephrine (probably through
   alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors).
   Conclusions-ROS appear to play a necessary role in the development of
   hyperadrenergic hypertension in this model, in a process mechanistically
   linking elevated blood pressure with catecholamine excess, renal
   transcriptional responses, ROS elevation, lipid peroxidation, and NO
   center dot depletion. Some of the changes appear to be dependent on
   transcription, whereas others are immediate. The cycle could be
   disrupted by inhibition of either sympathetic outflow or NADPH oxidase.
   Because common genetic variation at the human CHGA locus alters BP, the
   results have implications for antihypertensive treatment as well as
   prevention of target-organ consequences of the disease. The results
   document novel pathophysiological links between the adrenergic system
   and oxidative stress and suggest new strategies to probe the role and
   actions of ROS within this setting. (Circ Cardiovasc Genet.

Abstract = {{Background: In developed countries, hospitalized patients with acute
   medical conditions are at significant risk for venous thromboembolism
   (VTE). Little is known about VTE risk and prophylaxis practices in
   China. Objective: To determine the VTE risk and the frequency of
   recommended VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized Chinese patients with acute
   medical conditions.
   Methods: Multi-center, cross-sectional, observational study. Eligibility
   criteria: >= 30 years, admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)/coronary
   care unit (CCU) for acute medical illness, had >= 1 VTE risk factor/1
   disease that predisposes to VTE, and provided informed consent. We used
   2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based
   consensus guidelines to assess VTE risk and the frequency of recommended
   VTE prophylaxis.
   Results: 1247 patients from 19 hospitals in 11 cities across 11
   provinces of China were enrolled from July 2007 to June 2008. 57.3\%
   patients had >2 VTE risk factors. Only 20.2\% received ACCP-recommended
   VTE prophylaxis (CCU patients: 22.7\%, ICU patients: 16.9\%, p=0.0117).
   Limitations: Excluding some patients with VTE risk factors did not allow
   assessment of the prevalence of VTE risk in the acute hospital-care
   setting. We could not determine whether the duration of prophylaxis
   complied with the ACCP recommendations. Our results may not be
   representative of hospitals in small cities/rural areas in China.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of VTE risk factors in Chinese patients was
   similar to that in developed countries; however, only a small proportion
   of eligible patients received the recommended VTE prophylaxis. Our
   findings highlight the need for dissemination and implementation of
   appropriate VTE prophylaxis guidelines in China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which is a recent
   breakthrough in wireless communications, has been shown to significantly
   improve channel capacity in single-user systems. However, obtaining a
   rigorous understanding of the possible MIMO gains in multihop networks
   is still an open topic. One grand challenge is that multihop wireless
   networks are interference limited and that the interference introduces
   coupling across various layers of the protocol stack, including the
   physical (PHY), medium access control (MAC), network, and transport
   layers. The fundamental differences between multihop networks and
   point-to-point settings dictate that leveraging the MIMO gains in
   multihop networks requires a domain change from high-SNR regimes to
   interference-limited regimes. In this paper, we develop a cross-layer
   optimization framework for effective interference management toward
   understanding fundamental tradeoffs among possible MIMO gains in
   multihop networks. We first take a bottom-up approach to develop a
   MIMO-pipe model based on PHY interference and extract a set of \{(R-i,
   SINRi)\}, where each pair (R-i, SINRi) corresponds to a meaningful
   stream multiplexing configuration for individual MIMO links {[}with R-i
   being the rate and SINRi being the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) requirement]. Using this link abstraction model, we study
   MIMO-pipe scheduling for throughput maximization. Based on continuous
   relaxation via randomization, we study the structural property of the
   optimal scheduling policy. Our findings reveal that, in an optimal
   strategy, it suffices for each MIMO link to use one stream configuration
   only (although each individual MIMO link can have multiple stream
   configurations). In light of this structural property, we then formulate
   MIMO-pipe scheduling as a combinatorial optimization problem, and by
   using a multidimensional 0-1 knapsack approach, we devise centralized
   approximation algorithms for both the dense network model and the
   extended network model, respectively. Next, we also develop a
   contention-based distributed algorithm, in which links update their
   contention probability based on local information only, and characterize
   the convergence and the performance of the distributed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The history of the Lorenz system is firstly discussed in this paper. In
   Chinese philosophy, Yin is the negative, historical, or feminine
   principle in nature, while Yang is the positive, contemporary, or
   masculine principle in nature. Yin and Yan are two fundamental opposites
   in Chinese philosophy (therefore, in this paper, these words ``Yin
   parameter,{''} ``Yang parameter,{''} ``historical system,{''} and
   ``contemporary system{''} are used to represent the ``positive
   parameter,{''} ``negative parameter,{''} ``time reversed (-t)
   system,{''} and ``time forward (t) system,{''} respectively). Simulation
   results show that chaos of historical Lorenz system can be generated
   when using ``Yin{''} parameters. To our best knowledge, most characters
   of contemporary Lorenz system are studied in detail, but there are no
   articles in making a thorough inquiry about the history of Lorenz
   system. As a result, the chaos of historical Lorenz system with ``Yin
   parameters{''} is introduced in this paper and various kinds of
   phenomena in the historical Lorenz system are investigated by Lyapunov
   exponents, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams.}},

   rats' back. In the seventh (group la and 2a), fourteenth (group 1b and
   2b) and twenty-first (group 1c and 2c) days, the skin biopsies were
   taken from around of the incision areas from both groups. The authors

Abstract = {{Aims We estimated the incidence of blindness in the diabetic and
   non-diabetic population in 2008 and compared it with results from
   1990-1998 in a neighbouring region.
   Methods All newly registered blindness allowance recipients in 2008 were
   drawn up in a German region (population 4.5 million). We estimated
   sex-specific, age-specific and standardized incidence rates of blindness
   in the diabetic and the nondiabetic population and relative and
   attributable risks as a result of diabetes. A comparison to the data
   from 1990-1998 was performed using log-linear Poisson regression.
   Results Four-hundred and sixty-eight cases were drawn up (63\% female).
   One-hundred and twenty-two (26.1\%) had diabetes. Blindness incidence
   rates (per 100 000 person-years) standardized to the 2008 German
   population were: men 9.1 (95\% confidence interval 7.8-10.5), women 9.9
   (8.8-11.1); diabetic population: men 21.8 (11.6-31.9), women 19.7
   (9.2-30.1); non-diabetic population: men 8.0 (6.6-9.5), women 9.1
   (7.9-10.3). Relative risk of blindness, diabetic vs. non-diabetic
   population: men 2.7 (1.6-4.5), women 2.2 (1.3-3.8). Attributable risk
   among exposed: 63\% in men, 54\% in women. Population attributable risk:
   12\% in men, 8\% in women. Incidences of blindness were significantly
   lower than in all years of the period 1990-1998 in both the diabetic and
   the non-diabetic population.
   Conclusions We found the incidence of blindness to be approximately
   2.5-fold higher in the diabetic compared with the nondiabetic
   population. Fifty-eight per cent of the risk to become blind in diabetic
   individuals and 9\% of the risk to become blind in the entire population
   were attributable to diabetes. The decrease of the blindness incidence
   observed during the 1990s may have continued.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic headaches represent a significant burden for the affected
   individuals and for the society, and a major challenge for successful
   care. Among the various types of chronic headaches, those that are
   associated with medication overuse (medication-overuse headache, MOH)
   are of particular importance because of the large proportion of patients
   who complain of this condition and their poor outcome. Most patients
   with MOH had migraine as primary headache. Practically, almost all drugs
   used for the symptomatic relief of migraine, including triptans and
   analgesics can cause MOH. Although the pathophysiology of MOH is
   unknown, recent studies hypothesize that plastic changes in specific
   pain areas of the central nervous system are main contributors to
   establishing MOH. Not infrequently, drug overuse is associated with
   habituation and failure of previously effective medications. Finally,
   treatment of MOH is poorly evidence based and mostly relies on clinical
   experience and belief.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In this article, we report findings from a 1-year
   longitudinal study examining the impact of change in posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following combat deployment on National
   Guard soldiers' perceived parenting and couple adjustment 1 year
   following return from Iraq. Method: Participants were 468 Army National
   Guard fathers from a brigade combat team (mean age = 36 years; median
   deployment length = 16 months; 89\% European American, 5\% African
   American, 6\% Hispanic American). Participants completed an in-theater
   survey 1 month before returning home from Operation Iraqi Freedom
   deployment (Time 1) and again I year postdeployment (Time 2). The FIND
   Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, \&
   Keane, 1993) was gathered at both times, and 2 items assessing social
   support were gathered at baseline only. At Time 2, participants also
   completed self-report measures of parenting (Alabama Parenting
   Questionnaire-Short Form; Elgar, Waschbusch, Dadds, \& Sigvaldason,
   2007), couple adjustment (Dyadic Adjustment Scale-7; Sharpley \& Rogers,
   1984; Spanier, 1976), parent-child relationship quality (4 items from
   the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report; Weissman \& Bothwell, 1976),
   alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Babor,
   Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, \& Monteiro, 2001), and items assessing
   injuries sustained while deployed. Results: Structural equation modeling
   analyses showed that increases in PTSD symptoms were associated with
   poorer couple adjustment and greater perceived parenting challenges at
   Time 2 (both at p < .001). Furthermore, PTSD symptoms predicted
   parenting challenges independent of their impact on couple adjustment.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of investigating and
   intervening to support parenting and couple adjustment among
   combat-affected National Guard families.}},

Abstract = {{The potential application of aggregates of nanoparticles for high-speed
   flow diagnostics is investigated. Aluminum nanoparticles around 10 nm in
   diameter are produced by spark discharge in argon gas. Through rapid
   coagulation and oxidation, aggregates of small effective density are
   formed. They are characterized by microscopy and their aerodynamics and
   optical properties are theoretically evaluated. The performance of the
   aggregates is experimentally investigated across an oblique shock wave
   in a supersonic wind tunnel of 3 x 3 cm(2) cross-section at Mach 2.
   Particle image velocimetry is used to quantify the time response of the
   aggregates. The investigations are also carried out on compact titanium
   agglomerates to provide a base for comparison. The results yield a
   relaxation time of 0.27 mu s for the nanostructured aluminum aggregates,
   which is an order of magnitude reduction with respect to the compact
   titanium nanoparticles. This work demonstrates the applicability of
   nanostructured aggregates for laser-based diagnostics in supersonic and

   fields as well as the heat transfer rate are examined. The results show
   that the addition of Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles enhances the heat transfer
   rate for all values of Richardson number and for each direction of the
   sliding wall motion. However, the downward sliding wall motion results
   in a stronger flow circulation within the enclosure and hence, a higher

   decreased during 4 day storage in the 4 degrees C, but catalase activity
   was stable. Salt type had no consistent effect on GSH-Px and catalase

   camel samples. Camel meat showed higher catalase activity and TBARS

Abstract = {{An investigation on the nature of dynamical fluctuations of
   target-evaporated slow particles emitted in C-12-AgBr interactions at

   zones in the framework of multidimensional factorial moment methodology
   considering the anisotropicity of the (cos theta-phi) phase space using
   the concept of the Hurst exponent (H). Our analysis reveals the presence
   of self-affine dynamical fluctuations in both the forward and backward
   emission angular zones. We have compared our results with those obtained
   from Monte Carlo simulated events. Non-intermittent behavior is observed
   for those simulated events in both the hemispheres. This observation
   confirms that the experimental data analysis reveals the true dynamical
   signal. Evidence of multifractality is also observed in both the
   hemispheres. We have also calculated the effective fluctuation strength
   to quantify the dynamical fluctuations in the case of C-12-AgBr
   interactions at 4.5 A GeV. The effective fluctuation strength is found
   to be higher in the backward hemisphere for our data. Stronger
   fluctuations in the backward hemisphere indicate the side splash
   phenomenon in the target fragmentation of 12C-AgBr interactions at 4.5 A
   GeV. Effective fluctuation strengths calculated from other
   nucleus-nucleus interactions data have also been compared with our

Abstract = {{Purpose: Occasionally during percutaneous surgery, significant contrast

   Materials and Methods: The cystoscopically placed, open-end ureteral

   aid of a guidewire and under fluoroscopic guidance, the tip of the
   catheter is placed in a posterior calix. The ``bull's eye{''} technique

   technique was used in four cases over a 7-year period.
   Results: Successful access was accomplished in all cases through a
   middle or upper calix.
   Conclusion: The catheter serves as a target for providing access to the
   renal collecting system and facilitates final tract dilatation.}},

   Methods: All patients in the Leicestershire abdominal aortic aneurysm
   (AAA) screening program with an initial AAA diameter of 25-30 mm and who
   had undergone two or more surveillance scans were identified (345
   patients). The primary endpoint was death from AAA rupture, referral for
   elective repair, or presentation with rupture. This information together
   with the duration of surveillance was recorded.
   Results: A total of 345 patients were followed up for mean of 4.25 years
   (1-11). At 5 years surveillance, there was a 97\% freedom from referral
   for repair or death from rupture. Conclusion: Patients presenting with

   search for a possible best data-driven value of the differencing order.

   insights into a possible `optimal' choice of the differencing order and
   its interrelation with other parameters. Applications of the selection
   procedure to non-normal models, such as Poisson models, are given.
   Simulation studies investigate the performance of the selection

Abstract = {{Background. The initial aim was to determine the rate of pathologic
   tissue damage when dissecting the rat sciatic nerve with either bipolar
   forceps or low-temperature tripolar plasma knife. The second aim was to
   determine the safety and effectiveness of the plasma knife during
   parotid surgery.
   Methods. A prospective, randomized, single-blind study was performed on
   40 rat sciatic nerves dissected by either bipolar electrocautery with a
   cold knife or a plasma knife. Dissected nerves were excised and
   submitted blindly to pathology for analysis of nerve injury. The degree
   of nerve trauma was graded by the Carlander nerve injury classification.
   Separately, a review was performed on the facial nerve outcomes of 30
   patients who underwent plasma knife parotidectomy.
   Results. No thermal or neural injury was noted in the 40 rat sciatic
   nerves dissected by either bipolar electrocautery or plasma knife (p =
   1.0). Two plasma knife-dissected nerves (8\%) demonstrated significant
   numbers of mast cells in the perineural soft tissue. In 30 patients
   undergoing plasma knife-parotidectomy, 10 (33\%) had mild weakness of 1
   or 2 preserved facial nerve branch postoperatively (House-Brackmann 2)
   that resolved within 1 month, whereas 2 (7\%) had visible weakness in 1
   branch (HB 3) that normalized after 3 months of follow-up.
   Conclusion. Plasma knife nerve dissection seems to be a safe and
   effective alternative to conventional methods. This technique may confer
   some advantages over conventional methods with the ability to
   simultaneously cut and coagulate tissue with minimal thermal spread and
   electrical stimulation of adjacent neural structures. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{Academic dental institutions face the growing challenge of securing the
   resources needed to develop a curriculum that incorporates current
   innovation and technology to ensure that students' learning experiences
   are relevant to current dental practice. As a result,
   university-industry relationships are becoming increasingly common in
   academe. While these relationships facilitate curriculum relevance, they
   also expose students to external market forces. The purpose of this
   study was to explore the influence of industry on dental education using
   a qualitative research study design. Analysis of semistructured
   interviews with thirteen Dalhousie University dental faculty members
   revealed two primary themes that suggest a tension between the
   traditional hierarchical organizational structures guiding curriculum
   (i.e., authoritarianism) and industry's quest for profit (i.e.,
   entrepreneurialism). Additional themes demonstrate a belief that
   industry directly influences students' knowledge and understanding of
   evidence as well as their experience with both the formal and informal
   curricula. Industry's presence in academe is a concern. Dental
   educators, as stewards of the profession, must be nimble in brokering
   industry's presence without compromising the integrity of both the
   educational program and the teaching institution as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the maximum skin dose (MSD) in
   patients undergoing interventional cardiology procedures, obtaining
   local reference levels and comparing these with the reference levels
   proposed in the literature.
   The patients' MSD was measured using Gafchromic XR type R films. In
   order to evaluate reference levels, the number of images acquired, the
   fluoroscopy times and the KAP(TOTAL) were recorded for each procedure.
   For the evaluation of the MSD, 8 coronary angiography (CA) and 16
   percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures,
   carried out in the period from May to June 2008, were analyzed.
   For the CA procedures the MSD values were below 0.5 Gy.
   For the PTCA procedures, we found a fairly good correlation between
   fluoroscopy time and MSD (r = 0.80, p = 0.0002) and between MSD and WFP
   (r = 0.863, p < 0.0001); there was a strong correlation between
   KAP(TOTAL). and MSD (r = 0.904, p < 0.0001). Since the correlation
   between KAP(TOTAL) and MSD is more striking than that with fluoroscopic
   time and the WFP, KAP measurements are suitable for online skin
   dosimetry and may, therefore, be used to avoid radiation-induced skin
   injuries. A MSD greater than 3 Gy occurred in only one procedure.
   For calculus of the local reference levels, we extended the
   data-gathering to 30 procedure CA and to 40 PTCA: we compared local
   practice with that in other centers using the guidance levels proposed
   by Balter et al. Our median KAP values were below these proposed
   guidance levels; our mean KAP values were above these proposed action
   levels. From a first application of the proposed reference levels, it
   appears that, according to the recommendations of Batter et al. an
   investigation into local practice is not necessary. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper reflects on some amendments to the Declaration of Helsinki in
   2008. It focuses on former paragraphs 5 (now 6) and 19 (now 17).
   Paragraph 5 suggested that the wellbeing of research participants should
   take precedence over the interests of science and society. Paragraph 6
   now proposes that it should take precedence over all other interests.
   Paragraph 19, and the new paragraph 17, suggest that research involving
   the members of a disadvantaged population is only justified if the
   clinical trial is likely to benefit them. In both cases, the
   recommendation is that the interests of the research subjects should
   prevail over the interests of third parties. This paper assesses the
   plausibility of these statements, and in order to do so, considers
   debates on the moral duty to participate in biomedical research. It is
   argued that, even if seen in the context of the Declaration as a whole,
   the statements contained in these paragraphs risk offering a misleading
   portrait of science and risk eroding some of the ethical principles that
   should form the basis of a satisfactory shared life, such as altruism
   and responsibility for our fellows.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Thymic malignancies are rare intrathoracic tumors that may
   be aggressive and difficult to treat in advanced stage. Over the past
   years, significant efforts have been conducted to dissect the molecular
   pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of these tumors. Insights have
   been made following anecdotal clinical responses to targeted therapies,
   and large-scale genomic analyses have been conducted.
   Methods: Review of the literature, 1990-2010.
   Results: The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is frequently
   overexpressed in thymomas and thymic carcinomas, but EGFR mutations are
   exceptional, and this does not support the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors. On the contrary, single observations of responses create a
   basis for further evaluation of cetuximab in thymomas. KIT-mutant thymic
   carcinomas represent a small molecular subset of thymic tumors. The
   clinical relevance of KIT mutations is more limited in thymic carcinoma
   than in GIST as KIT mutations are far less frequent (7\% of thymic
   carcinomas) and are not correlated with KIT expression; furthermore, KIT
   mutants are not uniformly sensitive to imatinib. Beyond EGFR and KIT
   signaling pathways, other molecular alterations with potential
   prognostic or predictive relevance are emerging in thymic malignancies.
   Conclusions: Given the rarity of these tumors, translation of
   preclinical findings to the clinic may be quick and represents one of
   the most promising therapeutic approaches for advanced-stage thymic
   malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many pediatric residency programs struggle to incorporate
   injury prevention training into their curricula.
   Objective: To analyze whether a 2-week injury prevention course helps
   pediatric residents to learn and retain more information than their
   peers who receive the standard education on injury prevention topics.
   Methods: A mandatory 2-week injury prevention course is provided for all
   interns at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC).
   Residents at CCHMC, completed a 50-question test on basic injury
   prevention topics at intern orientation and at the end of their first
   and third years of training. A control group of two intern classes from
   comparable children's hospitals who did not receive the injury
   prevention course were given the identical test at similar time periods.
   Data were analyzed using SPSS, and t tests were used to calculate and
   compare the mean percent change in test scores.
   Results: Seventy-six pediatric interns were enrolled (33 intervention
   and 43 controls). After internship, posttests were obtained on 29 (88\%)
   intervention residents and 38 (88\%) controls. On completing residency,
   posttests were received from 16 (48\%) CCHMC residents and 22 (51\%)
   controls. There was no difference in demographics or prior injury
   prevention training between the groups at study enrollment. A total of
   63.6\% of controls reported receiving injury prevention training by the
   end of their residency. There was a significant difference in the
   improvement of mean test scores between the intervention and control
   groups after internship (14.1\% vs. 3.2\%; p < 0.001) and again after
   the third year (11.9\% vs. 5.5\%; p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: An injury prevention curriculum for pediatric residents can
   significantly increase and sustain their fund of knowledge on these
   important topics.}},

Abstract = {{What is often stressed about The Importance of Being Earnest is its
   verbal quality. This article focuses on a version of The Importance of
   Being Earnest which, paradoxically, brings the body centre-stage. The
   play Handbag by Mark Ravenhill (one of the quintessential writers of
   so-called ``in-yer-face{''} theatre), first produced at the Lyric
   Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1998, is a rewriting of The Importance of Being
   Earnest which shifts the emphasis from the verbal to the physical. This
   article first replaces Handbag in its political, aesthetic and critical
   contexts: the emergence of ``in-yer-face{''} theatre in the 1990s, Wilde
   as a key figure in gay studies and queer theory in the late-1980s and
   1990s in the United States and in Great Britain (with the works of E. K.
   Sedgwick, Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield). It then examines the
   adaptation strategies used by Ravenhill in his reprising of The
   Importance of Being Earnest. Handbag reads both as a transposition and
   an explicitation of Wilde's play. It is built around two plots which
   parallel and intersect each other: one revolves around a lesbian couple
   and a gay couple having a baby, the other involves a set of Victorian
   characters and stages a ``prequel{''} of Wilde's play. Besides, the
   coded allusions to Bunburying or eating cucumber sandwiches are
   explicitated in Ravenhill's version. Handbag thus creates a dialogue
   between past and present and raises questions about our current
   society's relationship to the Victorians.}},

Abstract = {{An important mechanism by which pancreatic cancer avoids antitumor
   immunity is by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the tumor
   microenvironment. Recent studies suggest that suppressor Tregs and
   effector Th17 cells share a common lineage and differentiate based on
   the presence of certain cytokines in the microenvironment. Because IL-6
   in the presence of TGF-b has been shown to inhibit Treg development and
   induce Th17 cells, we hypothesized that altering the tumor cytokine
   environment could induce Th17 and reverse tumor-associated immune
   suppression. Pan02 murine pancreatic tumor cells that secrete TGF-b were
   transduced with the gene encoding IL-6. C57BL/6 mice were injected s.c.
   with wild-type (WT), empty vector (EV), or IL-6-transduced Pan02 cells
   (IL-6 Pan02) to investigate the impact of IL-6 secretion in the tumor
   microenvironment. Mice bearing IL-6 Pan02 tumors demonstrated
   significant delay in tumor growth and better overall median survival
   compared with mice bearing WT or EV Pan02 tumors. Immunohistochemical
   analysis demonstrated an increase in Th17 cells (CD4(+)IL-23R(+) cells
   and CD4(+)IL-17(+) cells) in tumors of the IL-6 Pan02 group compared
   with WT or EV Pan02 tumors. The upregulation of IL-17-secreting CD4(+)
   tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was substantiated at the cellular level
   by flow cytometry and ELISPOT assay and mRNA level for retinoic
   acid-related orphan receptor gamma t and IL-23R by RT-PCR. Thus, the
   addition of IL-6 to the tumor microenvironment skews the balance toward
   Th17 cells in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. The delayed tumor
   growth and improved survival suggests that induction of Th17 in the
   tumor microenvironment produces an antitumor effect. The Journal of
   Immunology, 2010, 185: 4063-4071.}},

Abstract = {{The application of an electronic nose equipped with a Metal Oxide
   Semiconductor sensor array for the detection of Alicyclobacillus
   acidoterrestris and A. acidocaldarius artificially inoculated in peach,
   orange and apple fruit juices is described in this study. Overall the
   system was able to detect the presence of Alicyclobacillus spp. in all
   the tested fruit juices at 24 h from inoculation. The electronic nose
   could detect bacterial concentration as low as <10(2) colony forming
   unit/ml and it was also able to classify bacterial contamination
   independently of the Alicyclobacillus species. The gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization of the volatile
   profile of orange juices confirmed the existence of quantitatively
   different patterns between contaminated and uncontaminated samples. (C)

   determine the basic parameters (epicentral coordinates, magnitude, and
   epicentral intensity of shaking). The only sources of information on
   seismic events in Kamchatka for the 18th-19th centuries were reports of
   explorers, but their presence in the region was episodic and irregular.
   We therefore believe that the M=5-8.4 earthquakes were much more

Abstract = {{Background. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) using dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry can visualize abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). AAC
   correlates with total atherosclerosis burden. We questioned whether
   VFA-detected AAC could be used for cardiovascular risk assessment.
   Methods. VFA images of 2,500 subjects were evaluated to detect and score
   AAC (n = 164). A random age- and gender-matched set of subjects (n =
   325) without AAC served as control group. Patients with prior
   cardiovascular disease or procedures were excluded. Base-line
   cardiovascular risk factors and further cardiovascular events were
   checked. Design-based Cox regression analysis was used to examine the
   prognostic value of AAC for cardiovascular outcomes.
   Results. AAC-positive subjects were divided into two groups: low-AAC
   (score 1-3), and high-AAC group (score > 3). Mean age in the groups was
   68, 68, and 71 years, percentage of females was 64.4\%, 61\%, and
   66.1\%, and the proportion of cardiovascular events within groups was
   1.5\%, 6.7\%, and 11.9\% in control, low-AAC, and high-AAC groups,
   respectively. Age- and gender-adjusted as well as multivariable analysis
   showed a significant, higher risk for cardiovascular events incidence in
   AAC-positive, low-AAC, and high-AAC when compared to the control group.
   Interpretation. AAC assessed with routine VFA was shown to be a strong
   predictor for cardiovascular events.}},

Abstract = {{Microneedle (MN) arrays have attracted considerable attention in recent
   years due to their ability to facilitate effective transdermal drug
   delivery. Despite appreciable research, there is still debate about how
   different MN dimensions or application modes influence permeabilization.
   This study aimed to investigate this issue by taking transepidermal
   water-loss measurements of dermatomed human skin samples following the
   insertion of solid polymeric MNs. Insertions caused an initial sharp
   drop in barrier function followed by a slower incomplete recovery - a
   paradigm consistent with MN-generation of microchannels that
   subsequently contract due to skin elasticity. While 600 pm-long MNs were
   more skin-perturbing than 400 pm MNs, insertion of 1000 pm-long MNs
   caused a smaller initial drop in integrity followed by a degree of long
   term permeabilization. This is explainable by the longest needles
   compacting the tissue, which then decompresses over subsequent hours.
   Multiple insertions had a similar effect as increasing MN length. There
   was some evidence that increasing MN density suppressed the partial
   barrier recovery caused by tissue contraction. Leaving MNs embedded in
   skin seemed to reduce the initial post-insertion drop in barrier
   function. Our results suggest that this in vitro TEWL approach can be
   used to rapidly screen MN-effects on skin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Brazilian government has the ambition to provide complete
   electricity coverage for all citizens as a means to promote development
   and reduce inequalities. Full coverage implies the provision of
   electricity to 15 million people in the country by the end of 2010
   through the program Luz para Todos (LPT - light for all) launched in
   2003. So far, 11 million people have benefited, 2 million of which live
   in the Amazon. In this paper, we analyze the linkages between
   development and rural electrification through the Human Development
   Index (HDI) and within the context of the Amazon. We examine the
   suitability of the HDI as a planning and monitoring tool for improving
   energy access and development. We show that the recognition of
   electricity access as a driver for development has led to concrete goals
   for electrification, actual action and welfare improvement. Our study
   serves to highlight the role of LPT in the development of the Amazon
   region, and the specific features and achievements of the Brazilian
   policy for universal electrification. We conclude that some challenges
   related to the electrification of isolated areas still lie ahead. We
   finalize with a discussion on the relevance of the Brazilian experience
   to other developing countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the evaluation of power generated by variable and
   constant frequency offshore wind farms connected to a single large power
   converter. A methodology to analyze different wind speed scenarios and
   system electrical frequencies is presented and applied to a case study,
   where it is shown that he variable frequency wind farm concept (VF) with
   a single power converter obtains 92\% of the total available power,
   obtained with individual power converters in each wind turbine (PC). The
   PC scheme needs multiple power converters implying drawbacks in terms of
   cost, maintenance and reliability. The VF scheme is also compared to a
   constant frequency scheme CF, and it is shown that a significant power
   increase of more than 20\% can be obtained with VF. The case study
   considers a wind farm composed of four wind turbines based on

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the concentrations of petrochemical compounds in
   the drinking water sources of communities located near oil-producing
   fields in the Bolivian Chaco region.
   Methods. Data were collected on total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), 16
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), including benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and 22 metals in samples from 42
   sources of water for human consumption located less than 30 km from an
   oil-producing field. Distribution of the concentration and adherence to
   the standards contained in the Bolivian, European, and United States
   regulations, as well as the recommendations of the World Health
   Organization, were analyzed.
   Results. In 76.19\% of the samples, some petrochemical contaminant was
   found in concentrations higher than permissible in any of the four sets
   of regulations mentioned. The water samples with the highest
   contamination levels were from faucets and rivers. The most common
   contaminants were TPH, PAH, aluminum, arsenic, manganese, and iron.
   Conclusions. Communities within a 30 km radius of the oil-producing
   fields in the Bolivian Chaco region consume water with TPH, PAH, and
   metal concentrations well above the levels permitted in the Bolivian
   regulations and international standards, putting the public health of
   their residents at serious risk.}},

Abstract = {{The manufacture of thermoplastic composites normally involves

   composite tested under tension is not fully understood. This work uses
   Raman spectroscopy as a tool to map the axial stress distribution around
   a kink-band in an aramid/low density polyethylene single fiber
   composite. The stress distribution along the fiber was fitted to a
   generalized shear-lag model to calculate the interfacial shear stress;
   its maximum was found around the kink-band where the fiber interface was
   still bonded to the matrix, defining a localized stress concentration.

Abstract = {{In this paper we combine nonstandard finite-difference (NSFD) schemes
   and Richardson's extrapolation method to obtain numerical solutions of
   two biological systems. The first biological system deals with the
   dynamics of phytoplankton-nutrient interaction under nutrient recycling
   and the second one deals with the modeling of whooping cough in the
   human population. Since both models requires positive solutions, the
   numerical solutions need to satisfy this property. In addition, it is
   necessary in some cases that numerical solutions reproduce correctly the
   dynamical behavior while in other cases it is necessary just to find the
   steady state. NSFD schemes can do this. In this paper Richardson's
   extrapolation is applied directly to the NSFD solution to increase the
   order of accuracy of the numerical solutions of these biological
   systems. Numerical results show that Richardson's extrapolation method
   improves accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Begonia L. is one of the largest flowering plant genera, a ubiquitous
   component of many tropical forests and an economically important
   ornamental plant. In the present study, we address the early evolution
   of Begonia by generating molecular phylogenies from approximately 7000
   bases of chloroplast DNA and approximately 6000 bases of mitochondrial
   DNA for each of 30 exemplar Begonia species. Broadscale biogeographic
   patterns found in the phylogenies, together with previously estimated
   divergence dates, indicated that extant Begonia lineages first
   diversified in Africa and then subsequently in America and Asia. The
   phylogenies also revealed that the closest African relatives of the
   American and Asian Begonia are seasonally-adapted species. Moderate to
   strong incongruence between the phylogenies suggested that they differ
   genealogically. These differences could have been the result of either
   interspecific hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting. The
   results obtained in the present study provide a much needed genus-wide
   framework for future evolutionary studies of this exceptionally diverse
   tropical genus. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological

Abstract = {{Risk measurement for derivative portfolios almost invariably calls for
   nested simulation. In the outer step, one draws realizations of all risk
   factors up to the horizon, and in the inner step, one reprices each
   instrument in the portfolio at the horizon conditional on the drawn risk
   factors. Practitioners may perceive the computational burden of such
   nested schemes to be unacceptable and adopt a variety of second-best
   pricing techniques to avoid the inner simulation. In this paper, we
   question whether such short cuts are necessary. We show that a
   relatively small number of trials in the inner step can yield accurate
   estimates, and we analyze how a fixed computational budget may be
   allocated to the inner and the outer step to minimize the mean square
   error of the resultant estimator. Finally, we introduce a jackknife
   procedure for bias reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Aerodynamic instabilities that naturally occur in compression systems,
   such as surge and rotating stall, largely reduce the life duration and
   performance of system components. The prediction of the compressor
   operating range is thus a key parameter for the design of gas turbines.
   This paper investigates the ability of an unsteady flow solver to
   simulate the rotating stall phenomenon in the full annulus of an axial
   compressor stage. A comparison with experimental data indicates that the
   simulation correctly estimates the stability limit. However the rotating
   stall flow patterns are different. While measurements show only one full
   span rotating stall cell (40 Hz), the simulation shows first a part span
   stall with 10 cells (790 Hz) that evolves then towards a full span stall
   with three cells (170 Hz). A spectral analysis based on numerical
   results underlines the role of rotor-stator interactions in the
   development of rotating stall. The effects of downstream volumes and
   inlet distortions are also discussed, showing the necessity to consider
   the whole geometry to correctly predict the rotating stall frequency.

Abstract = {{Denitrification is a process that reduces nitrogen levels in headwaters
   and other streams. We compared nirS and nirK abundances with the
   absolute rate of denitrification, the longitudinal coefficient of
   denitrification (i.e., K-den, which represents optimal denitrification
   rates at given environmental conditions), and water quality in seven
   prairie streams to determine if nir-gene abundances explain
   denitrification activity. Previous work showed that absolute rates of
   denitrification correlate with nitrate levels; however, no correlation
   has been found for denitrification efficiency, which we hypothesise
   might be related to gene abundances. Water-column nitrate and
   soluble-reactive phosphorus levels significantly correlated with
   absolute rates of denitrification, but nir-gene abundances did not.
   However, nirS and nirK abundances significantly correlated with K-den,
   as well as phosphorus, although no correlation was found between K-den
   and nitrate. These data confirm that absolute denitrification rates are
   controlled by nitrate load, but intrinsic denitrification efficiency is
   linked to nirS and nirK gene abundances. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The performance of n-type Si back-contact back-junction (BC-BJ) solar
   cells under illumination with high energy ultraviolet (UV) photons was
   investigated. The impact of the phosphorus doped front surface field
   (FSF) layer on the stability of the front surface passivation under UV
   illumination was investigated. Lifetime samples and solar cells without
   the front surface field showed a significant performance reduction when
   exposed to ultraviolet light. The surface saturation current density
   (J(Oe)) increased from 48 to 446 fA/cm(2) after the UV exposure. At the
   same time the efficiency of the BC-Si solar cells without the FSF
   diffusion reduced from 19.8\% to 14.3\%. In contrast to the lifetime
   samples and solar cells without the FSF diffusion, the tested n(+)nn(+)
   structures and the BC-BJ solar cells with applied FSF diffusion profiles
   were significantly more stable under UV exposure, i.e. J(Oe) increased
   only by a factor of 25\% and the efficiency of these cells decreased
   only 0.3\%(abs) by the UV illumination. Finally it was shown that the
   performance of the UV-degraded solar cells without FSF could be improved
   during a forming gas anneal (FGA). Due to application of FGA the
   efficiency almost fully recovered from 14.3\% to 19.6\%. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Notch signaling is critical for T-cell generation in the thymus. Notch
   signaling is linear in nature and is highly regulated through
   differential gene expression and post-translational modification. Upon
   ligand binding, the Notch receptor is sequentially cleaved, first via
   extracellular ADAM protease-mediated cleavage, followed by an
   intracellular presenilin-dependent cleavage to release the Notch
   intracellular domain and activate transcription. Delta-like-1 (Dll1) is
   a Notch ligand that positively regulates T-cell development. Dll1 is
   proteolytically processed in a similar manner to the Notch receptor, and
   it has been speculated to participate in bidirectional signaling. We
   hypothesized that inhibition of Dll1 processing in Notch signal sending
   cells would lead to changes in their ability to support thymopoiesis. We
   used the OP9 in vitro co-culture system, and transduced OP9s with full
   length, cleavable Dll1 or a non-cleavable mutant (NC-Dll1) lacking the
   ADAM protease cleavage site. OP9-NC-Dll1 cells were able to support
   T-cell development with similar efficacy to OP9-Dll1 cells.
   Interestingly, expression of the Notch target gene Hes5 was more highly
   induced in T-cell progenitors by NC-Dll1, whereas expression of Hes1,
   Deltex1, and pre-T alpha were similar to controls. Furthermore, a
   reduced ability of hematopoietic progenitors to assume the granulocyte
   cell fate in OP9-NC-Dll1 cultures was noted. Taken together, these
   findings show that proteolytic cleavage of Dll1 in Notch signal sending
   cells is dispensable for murine T-cell development, differentially
   affects expression of Notch target genes, and might be a mechanism that
   regulates myelopoiesis. Immunology and Cell Biology (2010) 88, 746-753;

   patterns of hypoxia in several standard and emerging mouse models of
   lung cancer to establish the appropriateness of each for evaluating the
   role of oxygen in lung cancer progression and therapeutic response.
   Experimental Design: Subcutaneous and orthotopic human A549 lung
   carcinomas growing in nude mice as well as spontaneous K-ras or
   Myc-induced lung tumors grown in situ or subcutaneously were studied
   using fluorodeoxyglucose and fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron
   emission tomography, and postmortem by immunohistochemical observation
   of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. The response of these models to the
   hypoxia-activated cytotoxin PR-104 was also quantified by the formation
   of gamma H2AX foci in vitro and in vivo. Finally, our findings were
   compared with oxygen electrode measurements of human lung cancers.
   Results: Minimal fluoroazomycin arabinoside and pimonidazole
   accumulation was seen in tumors growing within the lungs, whereas
   subcutaneous tumors showed substantial trapping of both hypoxia probes.
   These observations correlated with the response of these tumors to
   PR-104, and with the reduced incidence of hypoxia in human lung cancers
   relative to other solid tumor types.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that in situ models of lung cancer
   in mice may be more reflective of the human disease, and encourage
   judicious selection of preclinical tumor models for the study of hypoxia
   imaging and antihypoxic cell therapies. Clin Cancer Res; 16(19);

Pages = {{405-433}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive practices are taking place in a range of sectors and regions in
   Australia in response to existing climate impacts, and in anticipation
   of future unavoidable impacts. For a rich economy such as Australia's,
   the majority of human systems have considerable adaptive capacity.
   However, the impacts on human systems at the intra-nation level are not
   homogenous due to their differing levels of exposure, sensitivity and
   capacity to adapt to climate change. Despite past resilience to changing
   climates, many Indigenous communities located in remote areas are
   currently identified as highly vulnerable to climate impacts due to
   their high level of exposure and sensitivity, but low capacity to adapt.
   In particular, communities located on low-lying islands have particular
   vulnerability to sea level rise and increasingly intense storm surges
   caused by more extreme weather. Several Torres Strait Island community
   leaders have been increasingly concerned about these issues, and the
   ongoing risks to these communities' health and well-being posed by
   direct and indirect climate impacts. A government agency is beginning to
   develop short-term and long-term adaptation plans for the region. This
   work, however, is being developed without adequate scientific assessment
   of likely `climate changed futures.' This is because the role that
   anthropogenic climate change has played, or will play, on extreme
   weather events for this region is not currently clear. This paper draws
   together regional climate data to enable a more accurate assessment of
   the islands' exposure to climate impacts. Understanding the level of
   exposure and uncertainty around specific impacts is vital to gauge the
   nature of these islands' vulnerability, in so doing, to inform decisions
   about how best to develop anticipatory adaptation strategies over
   various time horizons, and to address islanders' concerns about the
   likely resilience and viability of their communities in the longer term.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that wheat flour can be used as a pore-forming and
   body-forming agent in ceramic technology. In contrast to pure native
   starch, however, the pores do not result from the swelling starch
   granules alone but are mainly due to protein-assisted foaming. Therefore
   the porosity is significantly higher and the pore size larger than that
   resulting from the starch granules alone, and the wet milling time
   applied for homogenizing the ceramic suspensions becomes the most
   critical process parameter. Alumina suspensions with 70 wt.\% alumina
   and 20-30 vol.\% wheat flour with different initial particle size (fine
   grade and semolina, respectively) have been prepared using milling times
   of up to 8 h. Porosities of up to approx. 60\% can be achieved with only
   20 vol.\% of flour or semolina after 8 h of milling time, with the cell
   sizes (diameters of pore cavities resulting from foam bubbles) being
   essentially independent of the milling time (median diameters of 120-240
   mu m). Effective pore throat sizes (i.e. diameters of cell windows or
   channels between cells), measured via mercury porosimetry, are 1-2 mu m
   for short milling times (2-3 h), but for long milling times (8 h) they
   change by more than one order of magnitude to median sizes of 20-30 mu
   m, closely corresponding to the median size of wheat starch granules
   (approx. 20 mu m). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kohautia Cham. \& Schltdl. belongs to the predominantly herbaceous
   Rubiaceae tribe Spermacoceae. Species of Kohautia can easily be
   distinguished from other Spermacoceae by their monomorphic short-styled
   flowers in which anthers and stigma are included in the corolla tube,
   with the stigma always positioned below the anthers. Mainly because of
   this unique floral morphology. Kohautia was considered to be a distinct
   genus. Molecular data (atpB-rbcL, petD, rps16, trnL-trnF, ETS, ITS)
   confirm that the genus is biphyletic. Two distantly related clades
   correspond to the subgenera Kohautia and Pachystigma Bremek. A similar
   type of floral organisation thus seems to have evolved twice
   independently, resulting in similar, but distantly related lineages. In
   order to translate the biphyletic nature of Kohautia into a formal
   classification, the two subgenera are recognized at generic level. A
   substitute name, Cordylostigma Groeninckx \& Dessein is proposed for K.
   subg. Pachystigma because of the existence of Pachystigma Hochst. in the
   Rubiaceae tribe Vanguerieae. Floral, pollen and seed characters were
   studied to morphologically characterize Kohautia s.str. and
   Cordylostigma. By optimizing pollination syndromes and pollen characters
   onto the molecular phylogeny, we investigated pollination shifts and
   pollen evolution within the two genera. Detailed floral morphological
   studies show that the nectar guides in the psychophilous species of
   Kohautia s.str. and Cordylostigma evolved in different ways but result
   in the same visual effect.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the spatial variability of K-d on calculations of
   contaminant travel time in the vadose zone was determined. Depth
   discrete measurements of K-d were made for a suite of radionuclides
   (Cd-109, Co-57, Co-60, Sr-85, Cs-137, and Y-88) utilizing a sediment
   core from the E-Area at the Savannah River Site. The K-d's were ordered
   as Sr-85(2+) < Cs-137(+) < Cd-109(2+) < Co-57(2+) = Co-60(2+) <<
   Y-88(3+) and the values generally fell below or near the lowest quartile
   of values reported in the literature. Correlations were generally weak
   between soil properties and K-d values. Most importantly, all of the K-d
   distributions could be reasonably approximated as log-normal.
   Deterministic and stochastic calculations of contaminant travel time to
   the water table were made. The deterministic calculations were based on
   each of three conceptual models of the vadose zone: complete
   stratification (17 strata, each with a different K-d), two strata (two
   sections of the vadose zone, each characterized by a single, average
   K-d), and unstratified (a single zone with an average K-d). Stochastic
   calculations were based on log-normal fits to the K-d data. The two
   strata model generally yielded travel times 2x greater than those in the
   completely stratified model. The unstratified model yielded travel times
   that were between 3 and 5 times greater than the completely stratified
   model. The stochastic mean travel times were comparable to those of the
   two strata model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (HEH) is a rare
   vascular neoplasm with unpredictable clinical behaviour.
   Aim: To compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)
   between liver resection (LR) and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
   for the treatment of HEH.
   Methods: Retrospective review of 30 patients with HEH treated at Mayo
   Clinic during 1984 and 2007.
   Results: Median age was 46 years with a female predominance of 2 : 1.
   Treatment included LR (n = 11), OLT (n = 11), chemotherapy (n = 5) and
   no treatment (n = 3). LR was associated with a 1-, 3- and 5-year OS of
   100\%, 86\% and 86\% and a DFS of 78\%, 62\% and 62\%, respectively. OLT
   was associated with a 1-, 3- and 5-year OS of 91\%, 73\% and 73\% and a
   DFS 64\%, 46\% and 46\%, respectively. Metastases were present in 37\%
   of patients but did not significantly affect OS. Important predictors of
   a favourable OS and DFS were largest tumour <= 10 cm and multifocal
   disease with <= 10 nodules.
   Conclusion: LR and OLT achieve comparable results in the treatment of
   HEH. LR is appropriate for patients with resectable disease and
   favourable prognostic factors. OLT is appropriate for patients with
   unresectable disease and possibly those with unfavourable prognostic
   factors. Metastases may not be a contraindication to surgical treatment.}},

Title = {{Lean implementation in primary care health visiting services in National
   Health Service UK}},
Journal = {{QUALITY \& SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background This paper presents the findings of a 13-month lean
   implementation in National Hearth Service (NHS) primary care health
   visiting services from May 2008 to June 2009.
   Method Lean was chosen for this study because of its reported success in
   other healthcare organisations. Value-stream mapping was utilised to map
   out essential tasks for the participating health visiting service.
   Stakeholder mapping was conducted to determine the links between all
   relevant stakeholders. Waste processes were then identified through
   discussions with these stakeholders, and a redesigned future state
   process map was produced. Quantitative data were provided through a
   10-day time-and-motion study of a selected number of staff within the
   service. This was analysed to provide an indication of waste activity
   that could be removed from the system following planned improvements.
   Results The value-stream map demonstrated that there were 67 processes
   in the original health visiting service studied. Analysis revealed that
   65\% of these processes were waste and could be removed in the
   redesigned process map. The baseline time-and-motion data demonstrate
   that clinical staff performed on average 15\% waste activities, and the
   administrative support staff performed 46\% waste activities.
   Conclusion Opportunities for significant waste reduction have been
   identified during the study using the lean tools of value-stream mapping
   and a time-and-motion study. These opportunities include simplification
   of standard tasks, reduction in paperwork and standardisation of
   processes. Successful implementation of these improvements will free up
   resources within the organisation which can be redirected towards
   providing better direct care to patients.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) is a
   validated tool for identifying the effects of mild traumatic brain
   injury (mTBI). Previous research focused on sport-related sideline
   evaluation of adolescents and adults. Our goal was to evaluate
   performance of the SAC among subjects with and without head injury in a
   pediatric emergency department (ED).
   METHODS: This was an observational study of children 6 to 18 years of
   age who presented to an ED with blunt head injury (case-patients) or
   minor extremity injury (controls). SAC and graded-symptom-checklist
   scores were compared. American Academy of Neurology concussion grades,
   presence of loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia were also
   compared with SAC and graded-symptom-checklist scores among
   case-patients.
   RESULTS: Three hundred forty-eight children were enrolled. SAC scores
   trended lower (greater cognitive deficits) for case-patients compared
   with controls but did not reach significance. Graded-symptom-checklist
   scores were significantly higher among case-patients. Presence of
   altered mental status magnified this effect. There was no correlation
   between SAC scores and other indicators of mTBI. There was a positive
   correlation between graded-symptom-checklist scores and posttraumatic
   amnesia and American Academy of Neurology concussion grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: The graded symptom checklist reliably identified mTBI
   symptoms for all children aged 6 years and older. SAC scores tended to
   be lower for case-patients compared with controls but did not reach
   significance. Patients with altered mental status at the time of injury
   manifest an increased number and severity of symptoms. Additional
   research into strategies to identify cognitive deficits related to mTBI
   and classify mTBI severity in children is needed. Pediatrics

Title = {{Cognitive training during infancy and adolescence accelerates adult
   associative learning: Critical impact of age, stimulus contingency and

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-340}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that juvenile
   cognitive training shapes neural networks and behavior, and thereby
   determines the adults capacity for learning and memory. In particular,
   we have shown that infant rats, even though they do not develop an
   active avoidance strategy in a two-way active avoidance task, show as
   adults accelerated learning in the same learning task. This indicates
   that a memory trace was formed in the infant rats, which most likely is
   recruited during adult training. To identify the learning conditions,
   which are essential prerequisites to form this memory trace in infancy
   or adolescence, we investigated the critical impact of: (i) age, (ii)
   CS-UCS contingency, and (iii) pre-training intensity on this
   facilitating effect. We observed: (i) an age-dependent improvement of
   avoidance learning, (ii) that the beneficial impact of infant or
   adolescent pre-training on adult learning increases with the age at
   pre-training, (iii) that CS-UCS contingency during infant pre-training
   was most efficient to accelerate adult learning, (iv) that pre-training
   intensity (i.e. number of pre-training trials) was positively correlated
   with the pre-training induced acceleration of adult learning, and (v)
   that infant rats, compared to adolescent rats, need a higher training
   intensity to show learning improvement as adults. These results indicate
   that infant rats develop a goal-oriented escape strategy, which during
   adult training is replaced by an avoidance strategy, facilitated by the
   recruitment of the CS-UCS association, which has been learned during
   infant training. Based on these results the future challenge will be to
   identify the specific contribution of prefronto-limbic circuits in
   infant and adult learning in relation to their functional maturation.

Abstract = {{A combination of two lipases was employed to catalyze methanolysis of
   soybean oil in aqueous medium for biodiesel production. The two lipase
   genes were cloned from fungal strains Rhizomucor miehei and Penicillium
   cyclopium, and each expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris.
   Activities of the 1,3-specific lipase from R. miehei (termed RML) and
   the non-specific mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from P. cyclopium
   (termed MDL) were 550 U and 1545 U per ml respectively, and enzymatic
   properties of these supernatant of fermentation broth (liquid lipase)
   were stable at 4 degrees C for >3 months. Under optimized conditions,
   the ratio of biodiesel conversion after 12 h at 30 degrees C, using RML
   alone, was 68.5\%. When RML was assisted by addition of MDL, biodiesel
   conversion ratio was increased to >95\% under the same reaction
   conditions. The results suggested that combination of lipases with
   different specificity, for enzymatic conversion of more complex lipid
   substrates, is a potentially useful strategy for biodiesel production.

   tensile deformation exist during the preparation of contacts.
   Stress-strain is most intense in the third area which locates in the
   head and the corner of contact and the first area which locates in the
   surface of contact. Both areas suffer tensile deformation with average
   strain of 80\%, and cracks would occur in these areas with the maximum
   probabilities. Contacts with high qualities could be produced if
   materials satisfy plastic tensile deformation in these two areas.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. - Roseland (R) prosthesis is a ball and socket prosthesis,
   physiological and not anatomical. This study wants to demonstrate by a
   quality life questionnaire (quick DASH described by Dubert et al., 2001
   {[}1]) that Roseland (R) prosthesis gives to patients a
   trapeziometacarpal joint native capacities.
   Patients and methods. - An exterior examinator reviewed prospectively 68
   patients having a mean age of 61,1 years at surgery with 11 bilateral
   cases that is 79 prothesis. With a mean follow-up of 43.8 months, we
   value by Kapandji's opposition, first comisssural penning, quality of
   life and patient's satisfaction.
   Results. - Three patients have been excuded: two of them had got
   post-traumatic dislocation: one trapezium fracture, one unknown reason.
   The third patient had got osteophytis with ``came{''} effects. We keep
   65 patients with 84,6\% satisfying and very satisfaying. 75,4\% of
   patients have a capacity of 80\% and more of their joint, 40\% of them
   had got 100\%.
   Discussion. - Roseland (R) prosthesis has good results because it agrees
   with already known principles as on its own concept: rotula prothesis
   gives three axes mobility, as on its own conception: metarcarpal stem
   with a palmar ``T{''} shaped against rotation and bone saving, a cup
   with equatorial ring to prevent burying of the spongy bone. Componenents
   are recovered by hydroxyapatite to favour osteo-integration with less
   loosening than ciment. An accurate technique avoids dislocations traps:
   trapezium implant centring, internal osteophytis removal. An accurate
   indication: trapeziometarpal joint osteoarthritis only (second degree's
   Dell classification).
   Conclusion. - Roseland (R) prosthesis reproduces a satisfactory and
   functional joint for 84,6\% of cases. These good results can be obtained
   by accurate indication (Dell II) and contra-indication (osteoarthritis
   around trapezium except trapeziometacarpal of course). (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Local governments are responsible for the supply of important public
   services in cities On many occasions the management of those services is
   externalized There is extensive literature analyzing the explanations
   for the governance option taken by local governments, aiming to
   ascertain the reasons why the management of certain services is
   externalized Recent research has highlighted the fact that time has not
   been contemplated by research dealing with explanatory factors in the
   decision to contract out municipal services This is a key issue in order
   to identify the real reason behind policymakers' decisions about the
   management of the services in cities This paper tests the importance of
   taking into account time in the research into contracting out This is
   undertaken by means of two methodological tests in the design of
   variables from a dataset containing 744 municipalities in Southern Spain
   Using this empirical analysis as a basis, it is concluded that
   considering time contributes towards enhancing the specification of the
   model and that omitting this aspect could lead to misunderstanding the
   motivation behind such decisions (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights

   Blockade in Inflammatory Arthritis From Southern Sweden}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To introduce a novel, simple, utility-based outcome measure,
   the number needed per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (NNQ),
   and to apply it in clinical practice in anti-tumor necrosis factor
   (anti-TNF)-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic
   arthritis (PsA), and spondylarthritis (SpA).
   Methods. The NNQ is the number of patients one has to treat in order to
   gain 1 QALY. It is calculated as the inverted value of the utility gain
   (area under the curve) over 1 year in a cohort subjected to an
   intervention. EuroQol Index utility data from the South Swedish
   Arthritis Treatment register were used.
   Results. Patients with RA (n = 1,001), PsA (n = 241), and SpA (n = 255)
   were eligible for the study. First, second, and third treatment courses
   were studied. For RA, NNQ was 4.5, 6.4, and 5.2 for first, second, and
   third courses, respectively. For PsA and SpA, NNQ was 4.2-4.5,
   irrespective of treatment order. Treatment groups with <50 patients were
   not analyzed. During the study period 2002-2007, there were no secular
   trends of utility gains.
   Conclusion. The NNQ is an easily derived and understandable
   utility-based outcome measure that may be useful for stakeholders and
   decision makers as well as for clinicians. It was readily applied in
   this study of TNF blockade across 3 arthritis diagnoses. NNQ varied
   little over diagnoses and treatment course order, with a possible
   exception in second treatment course in RA.}},

   Bruker IFS 125 HR equipped with White-type multipass cell (6.4-41.6 m)

   of a nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting technique for the lines of
   the (00011)<-(00001) band with rotational quantum number up to J=82. For
   fitting of the individual line shapes, we used the Voigt profile with
   pre-calculated Doppler broadening parameter. The experimental pressure
   broadening and shift coefficients are compared with the values available

   QDs-labeled Env proteins, the fluorescent signals were recorded by
   photoluminescent spectroscopy. Results show that the prepared Env
   proteins own bioactivity, the CdTe ODs-labeled Env proteins can combine
   with anti-HIV-1 gp41 IgG antibodies, and formed the Env-gp41-CdTe QDs
   complex, the fluorescent intensity of final products were negatively
   associated with the concentration of anti-HIV-1 gp41 IgG antibodies in
   sample, the limitation of detection is 100 pg/mL. In conclusion, HIV-1
   Env proteins with bioactivity were successfully prepared by RTS,
   established CdTe QDs labeled Env proteins-based fluorescent immunoassay
   can successfully detect HIV-1 gp41 IgG antibodies, which has great
   potential in early diagnosis of HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: This study was performed to compare the
   anxiety disorders between individuals with and without joint
   hypermobility.
   Methods: A total of 94 Turkish volunteers, 40 subjects (38 females, 2
   males) with joint hypermobility and 54 controls (47 females, 7 males)
   without joint hypermobility, were included in this study. We evaluated
   the joint hypermobility by using the Beighton scoring system in the
   participants and a Beighton score of at least 4 was considered as joint
   hypermobility. In addition, all cases were evaluated with Structured
   Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders (SCID-I) and Hamilton
   Anxiety Rating Scale by a psychiatrist in order to define their
   psychyatric disorders and anxiety levels, respectively.
   Results: Age, gender and educational levels of the participants were
   similar between these two groups. Mean of anxiety score was higher
   statistically in the study group (13.5 +/- 5.3) than that of the control
   group (11.1 +/- 4.9) (p < 0.05). No statistically a significant
   difference in the ratio of psychyatric disorders according to SCID-I
   were observed between cases with and without hypermobility.
   Conclusions: Anxiety scores have been found significantly higher in the
   group with hypermobility than that of the group without hypermobility.
   We strongly recommend the assessment of medical conditions, including
   joint hypermobility syndrome, in anxiety patients.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal degree of decentralization depends on the importance of
   inter-state externalities of local policies. We show that inter-state
   externalities are determined by the spatial distribution of interest
   groups within the country. Interest groups who have multi-state scope
   internalize inter-state externalities to a larger extent than the
   lobbyists with interests within a single state. We use variation in the
   geographic boundaries of politically-powerful industrial interests to
   estimate the effect of inter-state externalities on firm performance.
   Using firm-level panel data from a peripheralized federation, Russia in
   1996-2003, we show that, controlling for firm fixed effects, the
   performance of firms substantially improves with an increase in the
   number of neighboring regions under influence of multi-regional business
   groups compared to the number influenced by local business groups. Our
   findings have implications for the literatures on federalism and on
   international trade as trade restrictions are a common source of
   inter-state externalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A magnetic composite was prepared by wet-impregnating a powder of a
   natural zeolite with a magnetic Fe oxide-containing synthetic material.
   Both starting materials were first characterized with X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and by
   isoelectric-point using vibrating-sample magnetometry. The synthetic Fe
   oxide-containing material was characterized as a mixture of magnetite
   (Fe3O4) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). From the Fe-57 Mossbauer analysis,
   the relative subspectral area for magnetite corresponds to 93(2)\%; the
   remaining spectrum is assignable to goethite. After the impregnation
   process, magnetite was still identified in the composite material as a
   magnetic layer surrounding the zeolite particles; no magnetically
   ordered goethite could be detected. The Mossbauer pattern for this
   sample indicates a much more complex structure than for the precursor
   material, based on Fe oxides, with some more altered magnetite and an
   intense central doublet of(super)paramagnetic Fe3+., probably due to
   small Fe (hydr)oxides and/or to a residual contribution of Fe-bearing
   species from the starting zeolite material. The composite preparation
   procedure also promoted the change of the characteristic A-type zeolite
   to mordenite. The resulting magnetic composite presented a magnetic
   coercivity of as much as 0.140 A m(-1), at 77 K. The final composite is
   now being evaluated as an adsorbent: results to date confirm that this
   novel magnetic material may have applications in the remediation of
   contaminated water bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Development of an in vitro prevascularized scaffold is of great
   importance to produce vascularization in tissue-engineered devices and
   for other clinical purposes. To this aim, polymer fibres covered with
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to induce
   directional `angiogenesis' in a 3D co-culture system. Gelatin or RGD
   peptides were immobilized on surface-modified polymer fibres {[}100 mu m
   diameter poly(ethylene terephthalate) monofilaments] via N-hepthylamine
   plasma polymer and carboxy-methyl-dextran interlayers. Fibres fully
   covered with HUVECs were then embedded in a fibrin gel, following a
   parallel alignment pattern, in the presence of fibroblasts. Tube-like
   structures occurred along the fibres and a network was formed between
   neighbouring fibres. These events were promoted with increased
   incubation times. Biomolecule-grafted fibres created a guidance pathway
   that facilitated coated endothelial cells to form lumens and, from them,
   sprouting processes. However, there were no significant differences
   between the different surface modifications on fibres in terms of
   promoting tube-like structures. Thus, different stages of angiogenesis
   can be initiated and guided using HUVECs precovered polymer fibres
   embedded in a soft supportive matrix, such as fibrin, which can be
   further applied to the development of in vitro prevascularized
   tissue-engineered scaffolds. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Mild to moderate steatotic livers are used as marginal
   donors in liver transplantation. Very little is known about the
   mechanisms of ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) in fatty liver.
   This study aimed to establish whether cytochrome oxidase C (COX)
   activity is compromised by IRI in fatty liver and whether ischemic
   preconditioning (IPC) can protect COX activity.
   METHODS: New Zealand rabbits were fed on a high-cholesterol diet for 8
   weeks to induce moderate hepatic steatosis. Three groups were tested.
   The IR group underwent 60 minutes of ischemia, followed by 7 hours of
   reperfusion. The IPC group (IPC + IR) underwent 5 minutes of ischemia,
   followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion and then 60 minutes of ischemia
   and 7 hours of reperfusion. The control group (sham) underwent the same
   surgical procedure, but ischemia was not induced. Deoxyhemoglobin,
   oxyhemoglobin, and change in the redox state of COX was continuously
   monitored in vivo by near-infrared spectroscopy. COX and citrate
   synthase (CS) activity assays were carried out on liver biopsy specimens
   in vitro. Bile was collected continuously during the procedure and
   analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   RESULTS: The ER group had decreased COX activity and tissue oxygenation
   represented by deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, COX, and elevated redox
   ratios of lactate/pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutarate/acetoacetate in vivo
   and a decrease in COX and CS activity in vitro. The IPC + IR group
   showed higher levels of all measured parameters in vivo and showed a
   smaller decrease in COX and CS activity in vitro.
   CONCLUSION: This study shows that IRI affects COX activity in fatty
   livers. This is attenuated by IPC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Restenosis after percutaneous angioplasty of peripheral arteries is
   still an unsolved matter. Previous studies reported an association
   between flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), a marker of endothelial
   dysfunction, and restenosis after coronary angioplasty. This study
   evaluates the influence of FMD and brachial intima-media thickness
   (B-IMT) on restenosis after angioplasty of peripheral arteries.
   One hundred and eighty-four patients (124 male) with claudication
   related to peripheral arterial disease participated in this trial. FMD
   and B-IMT were assessed before endovascular revascularisation. In a
   12-month follow-up duplex ultrasound examinations were performed to
   detect restenosis. Finally 128 patients (91male, 37 female) were
   eligible for statistical analysis.
   Restenosis was found in 54 patients (42.2\%). Mean FMD was 3.53 +/-
   3.56\%, with no difference between the patients with restenosis (3.55
   +/- 3.64\%) and those without (3.52 +/- 3.48\%; p = 0.716). B-IMT had a
   mean value of 0.326 +/- 0.134 mm. B-IMT significantly differed between
   the patients with restenosis (0.326 +/- 0.134 mm) and those without
   (0.256 +/- 0.133 mm; p = 0.007). We confirmed that a B-IMT over 0.21 mm
   was an independent risk factor for restenosis {[}OR 2.9 (1.3-6.3)].
   Endothelial dysfunction is not associated with restenosis. Conversely
   patients with enlarged B-IMT are at risk of restenosis after angioplasty
   of peripheral arteries.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a theoretically-informed comparative analysis of the
   constitution-making processes in Japan and South Korea after the end of
   the Second World War. Written under the hegemonic influence of the
   United States and against the backdrop of the dawning Cold War, both
   constitutions demonstrate the inadequacies of the conventional
   theoretical account of ``We the People{''} as ``constituent power.{''}
   We argue that the ``constituent people{''} was forged in the course of a
   deep constitutional politics-rather than vice versa-in which the role of
   ``externalities{''} and the resuscitation of ``useable pasts{''} were
   intrinsically tied to the formation of new constitutional peoplehood in
   postwar Japan and postcolonial Korea. Going beyond the common
   presupposition that a well-defined constituent people exists prior to
   the constitutional moment with a unified political will and robust
   agency, we suggest that the Japanese and Korean ``exception{''} may
   actually prove to be the rule for theorizing about constitutional
   democracy in the age of globalization.}},

   Retrospective case-control study. Setting. Athens University, department
   of obstetrics and gynecology of a tertiary hospital serving a mainly
   urban population. Population. Endometrial cancer patients <= 40 years
   (study group, n = 40), postmenopausal women with the same malignancy
   (positive controls, n = 40) and women <= 40 (negative controls, n = 40)
   without endometrial cancer. Methods. Clinical history, treatment and
   follow-up of patients were evaluated. Factors studied included age,
   histology, stage, grade, lymphovascular space involvement, body mass
   index (BMI), cytology, lymph node status, parity, smoking, family
   history, hypertension recurrence and survival. Main outcome measures.
   Differences in risk factors and characteristics. Results. Nulliparity,
   smoking and hypertension were significantly related with endometrial
   cancer in the study group compared to positive controls (p = 0.001, p <
   0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). BMI > 30 significantly characterized
   patients in the study group compared to negative controls (p = 0.006).
   Finally, irregular menstruation and family history of cancer were
   observed more often in the study group compared to both control groups.
   Stage, grade, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space involvement and
   lymph node status were comparable between the study and positive control
   groups. Conclusion. Nulliparity, obesity, unstable menstruation, smoking
   and cancer in the family are strongly correlated with endometrial cancer
   risk in women <= 40 years.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing concern that arterial catheters (ACs) cause
   catheter-related infections (CRIs). Limited data are available
   concerning risk factors for AC-CRI and there are no studies concerning
   incidence and micro-organisms from northern Europe. The aims of this
   study were to determine the incidence of, and micro-organisms
   responsible for, AC colonisation and AC-CRI in a Swedish intensive care
   unit (ICU), and to determine risk factors contributing to AC
   colonisation and AC-CRI. We prospectively studied all patients (N = 539)
   receiving ACs (N = 691) in a mixed ICU of a county hospital. Six hundred
   (87\%) of all ACs were assessed completely. The total catheterisation
   time for 482 patients was 2567 days. The incidence of positive tip
   culture was 7.8 per 1000 catheter-days, with the predominant
   micro-organism being coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The
   incidence of AC-CRI was 2.0 per 1000 catheter-days (with no cases of
   bacteraemia). All AC-CRIs were caused by CoNS. Multivariate analysis
   revealed that immunosuppression, central venous catheter (CVC)
   colonisation and CVC infection were significant risk factors for AC-CRI.
   We conclude that AC colonisation and infection with systemic symptoms
   occur at a low rate in our ICU which supports our practice of basic
   hygiene routines for the prevention of AC-CRI. Colonisation and
   infection of a simultaneous CVC seem to be risk factors. The role of
   contemporaneous colonisation and infection of multiple bloodstream
   catheters has received little attention previously. Further studies are
   needed to verify the significance of this finding. (C) 2010 The Hospital

Abstract = {{Rotavirus is the most important etiological agent in children with acute
   gastroenteritis (AGE). The recent implementation of a rotavirus vaccine
   in Korea requires the monitoring of prevailing rotavirus strains in
   order to control the infection. One hundred thirty-nine rotavirus
   strains were detected in children hospitalized with AGE in Seoul, Korea
   from 2007 to 2009. The most frequent combination of genotypes was
   G9P{[}8] (32.1\%), followed by G1P{[}8] (20.7\%) and G3P{[}8] (11.7\%).
   Mixed G-types were detected in 14 samples (10.0\%), and mixed P-types
   were found in six samples (4.3\%). G9 genotypes were predominant from
   2007 to 2008, whereas G1 and G3 genotypes were predominant from 2008 to
   2009. G1 strains clustered mostly in the Id lineage, and some clustered
   in the Ic, IId, and Ia lineages. G2 strains clustered in the IV and V
   lineages. G3 and G9 strains clustered in the IIId and Id lineages,
   respectively. This study shows a rapid change of the prevalent genotype
   from G9 to G1 and G3 genotypes, suggesting that continuous surveillance
   of rotavirus strains is important for rotavirus vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of resorbable polymeric devices often takes months to
   years Accelerated testing at elevated temperatures is an attractive but
   controversial technique. The purposes of this paper include (a) to
   provide a summary of the mathematical models required to analyse
   accelerated degradation data and to indicate the pitfalls of using these
   models, (b) to improve the model previously developed by Han and Pan,
   (c) to provide a simple version of the model of Han and Pan with an
   analytical solution that is convenient to use: (d) to demonstrate the
   application of the improved model in two different poly(lactic acid)
   systems It is shown that the simple analytical relations between
   molecular weight and degradation time widely used in the literature can
   lead to Inadequate conclusions In more general situations the rate
   equations are only part of a complete degradation model. Together with
   previous works in the literature, our study calls for care in using the

Abstract = {{The influence from different grain boundary configurations on the crack

   described by dislocation dipole elements in a boundary element approach
   and the plasticity by discrete dislocations, located along specific slip
   planes in the material. Plane strain and quasi-static conditions are
   assumed. The crack is assumed to grow in a single shear mechanism due to
   nucleation, glide and annihilation of discrete dislocations. Different
   grain boundary configurations in front of the growing crack are
   considered, including both high angle and low angle grain boundaries. It
   is shown that both grain boundary configuration and distance between the
   crack and a grain boundary has a pronounced influence on the crack

Abstract = {{Komodo dragons from hatchlings ( approximate to 0.1 kg) to adults ( <=
   80 kg) express the full magnitude of varanid species size distributions.
   We found that all size groups of dragons regulated a similar preferred
   body temperature by exploiting a heterogeneous thermal environment
   within savanna, forest and mangrove habitats. All dragons studied,
   regardless of size, were able to regulate a daytime active body
   temperature within the range 34-35.6 degrees C for 5.1-5.6 h/day. The
   index of effectiveness of thermoregulation (a numerical rating of
   thermoregulatory activity) was not different among size groups of
   dragons. However, the index of closeness of thermoregulation, which
   rates the variability of body temperature, suggests a greater precision
   for regulating a preferred body temperature for medium compared to small
   and large dragons. Reference copper cylinders simulating small, medium
   and large Komodo dragons heated and cooled at the same rate, whereas
   actual dragons of all size groups heated faster than they cooled. Larger
   dragons heated and cooled more slowly than smaller ones. The mean
   operative environmental temperatures of copper cylinders representing
   medium sized dragons were 42.5, 32.0 and 29.4 degrees C for savannah,
   forest and mangrove habitats, respectively. The index for average
   thermal quality of a habitat as measured by the absolute difference
   between operative environmental temperature and the dragon's thermal
   range suggests the forest habitat offers the highest thermal quality to
   dragons and the savannah the lowest. The percent of total daytime that
   the operative environmental temperature was within the central 50\% of
   the body temperatures selected by dragons in a thermal gradient
   (Phillips, 1984) was 45\%, 15\%, and 9\% for forest, mangrove and
   savannah, respectively. Forest habitat offers the most suitable thermal
   environment and provides the greatest number of hours with conditions
   falling within the dragon's thermal activity zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Endothelial cells form cell-cell adhesive structures, called adherens
   and tight junctions, which maintain tissue integrity, but must be
   dynamic for leukocyte transmigration during the inflammatory response
   and cellular remodeling during angiogenesis. This review will focus on
   Vascular Endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an endothelial-specific cell-cell
   adhesion protein of the adherens junction complex. VE-cadherin plays a
   key role in endothelial barrier function and angiogenesis, and
   consequently VE-cadherin availability and function are tightly
   regulated. VE-cadherin also participates directly and indirectly in
   intracellular signaling pathways that control cell dynamics and cell
   cycle progression. Here we highlight recent work that has advanced our
   understanding of multiple regulatory and signaling mechanisms that
   converge on VE-cadherin and have consequences for endothelial barrier
   function and angiogenic remodeling.}},

Abstract = {{In KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa, where HIV prevalence is among the
   world's highest, a longitudinal qualitative study of partnership
   dynamics and HIV preventive behaviors was conducted. 47 young adults
   aged 18-24 participated in in-depth interviews, and 29 were
   re-interviewed 2 years later. Five analytical domains emerged: primary
   partnerships, love and romance; secondary partnerships;
   pregnancy/parenthood; condom use/prevention; and contextual influences,
   including schooling and future aspirations. Primary relationships were
   long-lasting, with most men and women in the same relationship at 2-year
   follow-up. Secondary, casual partnerships were common for men and women,
   although these were shorter and changed frequently. Love and marriage
   aspirations were not viewed as incompatible with secondary partners.
   Condom use increased over time in some primary relationships, but
   decreased in others, and was nearly universal with non-primary partners.
   Pregnancy, school drop-out, and economic need strongly influence young
   people's lifecourse. These findings suggest the need to focus prevention
   efforts on the partnership context, including partner reduction, and
   structural factors that impede or enhance prevention success.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in larval developmental mode are predicted to affect
   ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from gene flow and
   population bottlenecks to rates of population recovery from
   anthropogenic disturbance and capacity for local adaptation. The most
   powerful tests of these predictions use comparisons among species to ask
   how phylogeographic patterns are correlated with the evolution and loss
   of prolonged planktonic larval development. An important and largely
   untested assumption of these studies is that interspecific differences
   in population genetic structure are mainly caused by differences in
   dispersal and gene flow (rather than by differences in divergence times
   among populations or changes in effective population sizes), and that
   species with similar patterns of spatial genetic variation have similar
   underlying temporal demographic histories. Teasing apart these temporal
   and spatial patterns is important for understanding the causes and
   consequences of evolutionary changes in larval developmental mode. New
   analytical methods that use the coalescent history of allelic diversity
   can reveal these temporal patterns, test the strength of traditional
   population-genetic explanations for variation in spatial structure based
   on differences in dispersal, and identify strongly supported alternative
   explanations for spatial structure based on demographic history rather
   than on gene flow alone. We briefly review some of these recent
   analytical developments, and show their potential for refining ideas
   about the correspondence between the evolution of larval developmental
   mode, population demographic history, and spatial genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Contrast enhancement plays a fundamental role in image/video processing.
   Histogram Equalization (HE) is one of the most commonly used methods for
   image contrast enhancement. However, HE and most other contrast
   enhancement methods may produce un-natural looking images and the images
   obtained by these methods are not desirable in applications such as
   consumer electronic products where brightness preservation is necessary
   to avoid annoying artifacts. To solve such problems, we proposed an
   efficient contrast enhancement method based on genetic algorithm in this
   paper. The proposed method uses a simple and novel chromosome
   representation together with corresponding operators. Experimental
   results showed that this method makes natural looking images especially
   when the dynamic range of input image is high. Also, it has been shown
   by simulation results that the proposed genetic method had better
   results than related ones in terms of contrast and detail enhancement
   and the resulted images were suitable for consumer electronic products.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: A ``resect and discard{''} policy has been proposed
   for diminutive polyps detected by screening colonoscopy, because
   hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps can be distinguished, in vivo, by
   using narrow-band imaging (NBI). We modeled the cost-effectiveness of
   this policy. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to compare the
   cost-effectiveness of universal pathology evaluations with a resect and
   discard policy for colonoscopy screening. in a resect and discard
   approach, diminutive lesions (<= 5 mm), classified by endoscopy with
   high confidence, were not analyzed by a pathologist. Base case
   assumptions of an 84\% rate of high-confidence classification, with a
   sensitivity and specificity for adenomas of 94\% and 89\%, respectively,
   were used. Census data were used to project outputs of the model onto
   the US population, assuming 23\% as the current rate of adherence to a
   colonoscopy screening. RESULTS: With universal referral of resected
   polyps to pathology, colonoscopy screening costs an estimated
   \$3222/person, with a gain of 51 days/person. Endoscopic polypectomy
   accounted for \$179/person, of which \$46/person was related to
   pathology examination. Adoption of a resect and discard policy for
   eligible diminutive polyps resulted in a savings of \$25/person, without
   any meaningful effect on screening efficacy. Projected onto the US
   population, this approach would result in an undiscounted annual savings
   of \$33 million. In the sensitivity analysis, the rate of
   high-confidence diagnosis and the accuracy for endoscopic polyp
   determination were the most meaningful variables. CONCLUSIONS: In a
   simulation model, a resect and discard strategy for diminutive polyps
   detected by screening colonoscopy resulted in a substantial economic
   benefit without an impact on efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
   Traditional therapy for extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease, a
   significant risk factor for stroke, consists of optimal medical
   management and selective surgical treatment with carotid endarterectomy
   (CEA) for stroke risk reduction. Buoyed by the widespread application of
   percutaneous interventions for the treatment of coronary artery disease,
   carotid artery stenting (CAS) has steadily developed during the past
   decade as an alternative to CEA for patients who might benefit from
   surgical treatment. With greater operator experience have come advances
   in CAS techniques and patient selection criteria, and several
   single-center studies and industry-sponsored stent registries have
   demonstrated excellent results for CAS, especially compared with the
   landmark randomized CEA trials of the 1980s. Nevertheless, CAS has
   emerged as one of the most controversial procedures in the era of modern
   medicine, and recently published randomized trials from Europe have only
   stoked the fires of controversy. This study reviews the best available
   data for CAS as an alternative therapy to CEA for stroke risk reduction
   and gives an overview of eagerly anticipated large randomized trials.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Gastric acid suppressant medications used as stress ulcer
   prophylaxis (SUP) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often prescribed
   inappropriately after discharge. We present tools to reduce the use and
   cost of non-indicated SUP.
   OBJECTIVE: To reduce the non-indicated use of SUP after hospital
   discharge originally started in the ICU, using an education intervention
   and pharmacist-led medication reconciliation on patient care rounds and
   at hospital discharge.
   METHODS: In a retrospective medical record review using a historic
   control, 356 consecutively admitted patients to the medical/surgical ICU
   at the University of Wisconsin Hospital were assessed for the
   appropriate use of SUP at admission to the ICU, at transfer to a general
   care unit, and at hospital discharge. The education intervention
   involved teaching both the medical and pharmacist staff about
   indications for SUP using a memorandum and a pocket guide. Pharmacists
   also conducted medication reconciliation during daily patient care
   rounds and at discharge to justify medication use. The outcome of this
   study is the percentage of patients prescribed non-indicated gastric
   acid suppressants at hospital discharge. This outcome is compared to a
   previous study conducted at our hospital.
   RESULTS: Of 356 eligible patients, 308 (86.5\%) received SUP while in
   the ICU. Thirty-nine (11\%) were given continuing SUP after discharge
   from the hospital, of which 31(8.7\%) had no clear indication. This was
   a 64.3\% reduction from the 24.4\% found in the prior study (p <
   0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Educational materials that guide prescribing, pharmacist
   interaction on patient care rounds, and pharmacist-conducted medication
   reconciliation significantly reduced the prescribing of non-indicated
   gastric acid suppressant medications after hospital discharge.}},

Title = {{Effects of Two Natural Medicine Formulations on Irritable Bowel Syndrome
   Symptoms: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The study objective was to assess the effects and
   tolerability of two novel natural medicine formulations in improving
   bowel habit and abdominal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel
   syndrome (IBS). The DA-IBS formula was designed to treat
   diarrhea-predominant and alternating bowel habit IBS, and the C-IBS
   formula was designed to treat constipation-predominant IBS.
   Design: This was a two arm, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study.
   Settings/location: Subjects were recruited from the greater Lismore area
   (NSW, Australia) in 2001.
   Subjects: The study included 31 patients who fulfilled the Rome II
   criteria for IBS. Twenty-one (21) patients were classified as suffering
   from diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS and 10 patients
   were classified with constipation-predominant IBS.
   Interventions: The DA-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried,
   powdered bilberry fruit, slippery elm bark, agrimony aerial parts, and
   cinnamon quills. The C-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried
   powdered slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root. The
   aim of each formula was to normalize stool frequency and stool
   consistency.
   Results: Ingestion of the DA-IBS formula was associated with a small,
   but significant increase in bowel movement frequency (p-0.027). Subjects
   in the DA-IBS group also experienced reductions in straining (p-0.004),
   abdominal pain (p-0.006), bloating (p<0.0001), flatulence (p-0.0001),
   and global IBS symptoms (p=0.002) during the treatment phase of the
   trial. Subjects in the C-IBS group experienced a 20\% increase in bowel
   movement frequency (p=0.016) and significant reductions in straining
   (p<0.0001), abdominal pain (p=0.032), bloating (p=0.034), and global IBS
   symptom severity (p=0.0005), as well as improvements in stool
   consistency (p<0.0001). Both formulas were well-tolerated.
   Conclusions: The DA-IBS formula was not effective in improving bowel
   habit in individuals with diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel
   habit IBS, although it did significantly improve a number of IBS
   symptoms. The C-IBS formula significantly improved both bowel habit and
   IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Further
   research is warranted on C-IBS, as a potentially useful therapeutic
   formula.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{6489-6501}},

Abstract = {{The Caribbean sponges of the genus Plakortis, P. halichondrioides, and
   P. simplex have provided a series of biologically active
   furanolactones-the plakortones A-D (1-4) from the former sponge and B F
   (2-6) from the latter. The defining motif of the plakortones is a
   sterically congested 2,6-dioxabicyclo{[}3.3.0]octan-3-one moiety, the
   emblematic furanolactone core. This core is efficiently accessed by a
   palladium(II) mediated hydroxycyclization carbonylation lactonization
   cascade with an appropriate ene-1,3-diol. Total syntheses of plakortones
   C (3) and F (6) are now described which settle constitutional and
   stereochemical features in this group of secondary metabolites.
   Acquisition of plakortone D (4), the most effective activator of SR-Ca2+
   pumping ATPase, utilized stereodefined lactone cores that resulted from
   asymmetric dihydroxylation of protected homoallylic alcohol 29. A
   derived lactone aldehyde was then coupled with an independently
   generated, sulfone-activated side chain unit, 57. The 11,12-E-double
   bond, carried through the sequence as a protected, srereodefined diol,
   was released therefrom by stereospecific syn-elimination via an
   orthoester derivative. In this way, plakortone D (4) was demonstrated to
   possess the (3S,4S,6S,10R,11E) configuration. Racemic plakortone E (5)
   was also acquired by using the Pd(II) induced sequence, but in this
   case, the required, complete acyclic system 52 was assembled first.
   Plakortone C (3) resulted from a sequence commencing with
   (R)-(+)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate, with a derived iodide 76
   alkylating the enolate of the butyramide 77 generated from
   (1S,25)-(+)-pseudoephedrine. The liberated primary alcohol 79 was
   converted by standard procedures to key enediol 89 which, with the
   Pd(II) protocol, afforded the major separable plakortones 90 and 91,
   with the former being identical with natural plakortone C (3). Very mild
   hydrogenation of 90 afforded a saturated plakortone, identical with
   natural plakortone F (6), thus establishing its structure and absolute
   stereochemistry. Available information on the stereoselective routes to
   plakortones E (5) and B (2) are also outlined, so that the constitution
   and absolute stereochemistry of plakortones B F are now established.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To inform healthy women about breast cancer and screen them, as
   well as to look for any relationship between demographic and clinical
   findings and breast cancer
   Methods: Thirty-five health teams were created prior to the study. The
   teams were primarily trained for breast examination and for screening
   methods to detect breast cancer
   Results: A total of 77,934 subjects were evaluated. Clinical breast
   examination (CBE) was performed in 66\% (n=51,706) of the participants.
   The characteristics of the subjects in the examined group were similar
   to those in the group refusing examination. The percentage of the
   subjects who declined examination was 2-fold higher in the >= 60 year
   age group compared to younger women. A breast mass was detected in 2,838
   (6\%) subjects who had undergone breast examination. Lower educational
   level and urban dwellers showed higher incidence of suspicious mass in
   CBE. Fifty-eight women were diagnosed with breast cancer The cumulative
   incidence of breast cancer was 7.5/10.000 for all of the study
   population and 10.1/10.000 for women with CBE.
   Conclusion: Elderly subjects, those living in rural areas and women with
   low educational and lower socio-economic levels should be convinced to
   undergo screening for breast cancer}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the association between improvements in physical
   function, fatigue and pain and improvements in productivity at work and
   at home in patients treated with certolizumab pegol (CZP) in combination
   with MTX.
   Methods. Physical function, fatigue and pain were assessed in two CZP
   clinical trials (Rheumatoid Arthritis PreventIon of structural Damage 1
   and 2) using the HAQ-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Fatigue Assessment Scale
   (FAS) and Patient Assessment of Pain, with minimal clinically important
   differences (MCIDs) defined as epsilon 0.22, epsilon 1 and epsilon 10
   points, respectively. Work and home productivity were evaluated using
   the RA-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS-RA). The odds of achieving
   an HAQ-DI, FAS or pain `response' at Week 12, defined as improvements
   epsilon MCID, were compared between CZP and control groups. Improvements
   in productivity at Week 12 were compared between CZP-treated HAQ-DI, FAS
   or pain responders and non-responders.
   Results. The odds of achieving improvements epsilon MCID were five times
   higher for pain, and two to three times higher for physical function and
   fatigue, in patients receiving CZP vs control. Per month, responders
   reported significantly greater improvements in productivity at work and
   reduced interference of RA with their work productivity than
   non-responders. Responders also reported significantly greater
   improvements in productivity at home and participation in family, social
   and leisure activities.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated a clear association between
   patient-reported improvements in physical function, fatigue and pain,
   and improvements in productivity both at work and home.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding of polyploid rice made no breakthrough for a long time
   because of low seed set. The discovery and application of polyploid
   meiosis stability (PMeS) material played a pivotal role in solving this
   problem. Our results indicated that genome duplication led to different
   outcomes in different rice cultivars in terms of pollen fertility,
   viability, and the accumulation of important physiological substances
   such as free proline and endogenous hormones. Pollen from the PMeS
   HN2026-4X lines showed a high fertility and viability similar to those
   of HN2026-2X (4X indicates tetraploid while 2X indicates the diploid),
   whereas both rates decreased dramatically in Balilla-4X. The results of
   pollen microstructure and ultrastructure investigations suggested that
   the pollen development pattern in HN2026-4X appeared normal at all
   stages, but a lot of changes were discovered in Balilla-4X. Stable
   meiosis, timely tapetum degradation, and normal mitochondria development
   were critical factors insuring the high frequency pollen fertility of
   PMeS rice. The free proline content increased markedly in HN2026-4X as
   compared to HN2026-2X, but it was decreased for Balilla-4X. Genome
   duplication effects on regulating endogenous hormones accumulation in
   pollen were evident, resulting in the clear difference between PMeS
   HN2026-4X and Balilla-4X. The accumulation of IAA, ZR, and GA in mature
   pollen distinguished HN2026-4X from Balilla-4X, which was linked to
   normal pollen development. In particular, the excessive accumulation of
   ABA at the meiosis stage may be correlated to disorganized meiosis in
   Balilla-4X. All the results provided unequivocal evidence that genome
   duplication played specific roles in the normal pollen development of
   PMeS HN2026-4X.}},

   face-based smoothed finite element method (FS-FEM) developed recently
   have shown great efficiency in solving solid mechanics problems with
   triangular and tetrahedral meshes. In this paper, a coupled ES-/FS-FEM
   model is extended to solve the structural-acoustic problems consisting
   of a plate structure interacting with the fluid medium. Three-node
   triangular elements and four-node tetrahedral elements are used to
   discretize the two-dimensional (2D) plate and three-dimensional (3D)
   fluid, respectively, as they can be generated easily and even
   automatically for complicated geometries. The field variable in each
   element is approximated using the linear shape functions, which is
   exactly the same as that in the standard FEM. The gradient field of the
   problem is obtained particularly using the gradient smoothing operation
   over the edge-based and face-based smoothing domains in 2D and 3D,
   respectively. The gradient smoothing technique can provide a proper
   softening effect to the model, effectively solve the problems caused by
   the well-known ``overly-stiff{''} phenomenon existing in the standard
   FEM, and hence significantly improve the accuracy of the solution for
   the coupled systems. Intensive numerical studies have been conducted to
   verify the effectiveness of the coupled ES-/FS-FEM for
   structural-acoustic problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The microbial ecology of the bioleaching of chalcopyrite ores is poorly
   understood and little effort has been made to handle the microbiological
   components of these processes. In this study, the composition and
   structure of microbial communities in acid mineral bioleaching systems
   have been studied using a PCR-based cloning approach. Denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA
   gene fragments from bacteria was used to evaluate the changes in the
   bacterial community in the process of chalcopyrite bioleaching in a
   shaken flask system. The results revealed that the bacterial community
   was disturbed after the addition of chalcopyrite. Phylogenetic analyses
   of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed that the retrieved sequences
   clustered together with the genera Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum,
   and Acidovorax. Multidimensional scaling analysis of DGGE banding
   patterns revealed that the process of chalcopyrite bioleaching in 46
   days was divided into four stages. In the first stage, Leptospirillum
   were dominant. In the second stage, Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus
   groups were mainly detected. In the third and fourth stages, the
   bacterial community was relatively stable and was dominated by
   Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus. These results extend our knowledge
   on the microbial dynamics in chalcopyrite bioleaching, a key issue
   required to improve commercial applications.}},

Abstract = {{Summer observations of the morphology and the debris accumulation
   processes at an actively forming pronival rampart at Grunehogna Peaks,
   Western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica demonstrate that rockfall debris
   accumulation is causing downslope (outward) rampart extension even
   though the distal slope is not at the angle of repose. Field experiments
   show that the vast majority of rocks can traverse a stable firn surface
   to reach the proximal slope of the rampart and more than half end up on
   the distal slope or beyond. The formation processes indicate that the
   morphological characteristics and environmental conditions under which
   such features develop may be more varied than conceived in current
   models. Consequently, caution must be employed when fossil ramparts are
   used to infer palaeo-environmental conditions. Copyright (C) 2010 John

Volume = {{343}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{101-105}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Intraocular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with consequent
   oxidative stress has been shown to be a significant factor in the
   pathogenesis of many vision-impairing diseases such as cataracts and
   retinal degenerations. Previous studies have shown that pyruvate can
   inhibit such oxidative stress. This is attributable to its property of
   scavenging various ROS and consequently inhibiting many of the apparent
   toxic reactions such as lipid peroxidation and loss of tissue thiols. It
   is hence expected that ROS will have an adverse effect on tissue
   metabolism also. The present investigations were hence undertaken to
   study the possibility that while scavenging ROS, the compound could be
   effective also in preventing the inhibition of tissue metabolism as
   well. Since glycolysis constitutes the major bioenergetic source of the
   retina, the objective of the present studies was to ascertain if the
   effects of pyruvate are indeed reflected in the maintenance of this
   pathway even when the tissue is exposed to ROS. This hypothesis was
   examined by incubating retinal explants in ROS-generating medium in the
   absence and presence of pyruvate and measuring (3)H(2)O generated from
   5-(3)H glucose. In addition, the lactate generated was also measured. As
   hypothesized, ROS-induced inhibition of glycolysis indexed by the
   decrease in (3)H(2)O as well as lactate formation was significantly
   prevented by pyruvate. This effect was also reflected by the elevation
   of NAD/NADH ratio, a major pacemaker of glycolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Work place pollution during filling of anaesthetic vaporisers has been a
   matter of concern. We studied personnel breathing zone ambient air
   sevoflurane concentrations during filling of sevoflurane with three
   different filling systems: Quik-Fil (TM) for Abbott and Drager Fill (TM)
   resp. Easy-Fil (TM) adapters for Baxter sevoflurane bottles, referred to
   as `Abbott and Baxter filling systems'.
   Method
   Sequential filling of three vaporisers was performed for a 15-min
   period, once with each of Abbott and Baxter filling systems, by four
   nurses. Ambient-air sevoflurane p.p.m. concentration in the breathing
   zone was continuously measured using a Miran 1a device during filling,
   and the mean 15 min sevoflurane concentration was calculated.
   Results
   All eight measured (4 x 2 sequences) 15-min mean breathing zone
   sevoflurane concentrations covering filling of three vaporisers were
   well below the recommended short-term value (STV) provided by the
   Swedish Work Environment Authority (STV 20 p.p.m.).
   Conclusion
   The breathing zone sevoflurane concentration during filling of
   sevoflurane with Baxter or Abbott filling systems, in an ordinary
   operating theatre, was found to be reassuringly below the Swedish
   recommended STV (20 p.p.m. average for a 15-min period).}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Failure to respond to antidepressants probably is the most common
   indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The literature seems to
   be divided as to whether medication resistance has a negative influence
   on the efficacy of subsequent ECT. Therefore, we performed a systematic
   review to investigate the effect of previous pharmacotherapy failure on
   the efficacy of ECT. Relevant cohort studies were identified from
   systematic search of the PubMed electronic database. Seven studies were
   included in this meta-analysis: the overall remission rate amounts to
   48.0\% (281/585) for patients with and 64.9\% (242/373) for patients
   without previous pharmacotherapy failure. An exact analysis with the
   Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed effect model) shows a reduced efficacy of
   ECT in patients that received previous pharmacotherapy (OR, 0.52; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 0.39-0.69). In conclusion, the efficacy of
   ECT is significantly superior in patients without previous
   pharmacotherapy failure as compared with medication-resistant patients.
   Because this finding is based on observational studies, it might be
   caused by a confounding factor, for example, the presence of psychotic
   features or the duration of the index episode. Electroconvulsive therapy
   seems to be an effective treatment for severely depressed patients as
   well as for patients with previous pharmacotherapy failure.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by tissue loss and a
   stable functional deficit. While several experimental therapies have
   proven to be partly successful for the treatment of acute SCI, treatment
   of chronic SCI is still challenging. We studied whether we can bridge a
   chronic spinal cord lesion by implantation of our newly developed
   hydrogel based on 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide, either alone or seeded
   with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and whether this treatment leads to
   functional improvement. A balloon-induced compression lesion was
   performed in adult 2-month-old male Wistar rats. Five weeks after
   injury, HPMA-RGD hydrogels {[}N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide with
   attached amino acid sequences-Arg-Gly-Asp] were implanted into the
   lesion, either with or without seeded MSCs. Animals with chronic SCI
   served as controls. The animals were behaviorally tested using the
   Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) (motor) and plantar (sensory) tests once a
   week for 6 months. Behavioral analysis showed a statistically
   significant improvement in rats with combined treatment, hydrogel and
   MSCs, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Although a tendency
   toward improvement was found in rats treated with hydrogel only, this
   was not significant. Subsequently, the animals were sacrificed 6 months
   after SCI, and the spinal cord lesions evaluated histologically. The
   combined therapy (hydrogel with MSCs) prevented tissue atrophy (P <
   0.05), and the hydrogels were infiltrated with axons myelinated with
   Schwann cells. Blood vessels and astrocytes also grew inside the
   implant. MSCs were present in the hydrogels even 5 months after
   implantation. We conclude that 5 weeks after injury, HPMA-RGD hydrogels
   seeded with MSCs can successfully bridge a spinal cord cavity and
   provide a scaffold for tissue regeneration. This treatment leads to
   functional improvement even in chronic SCI.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term radiometric stability monitoring of visible and near-infrared
   Earth observing sensors has been enhanced over the past decade through
   the use of pseudo-invariant calibration sites on the Earth's surface.
   Significant work has been done to characterize sites primarily in the
   Sahara and Middle East desert regions, with some additional work at
   other locations throughout the world. The work described in this paper
   attempts to locate those sites that can be considered optimal from a
   temporal stability measure. To accomplish this, an invariant site
   identification algorithm was developed that can locate a statistically
   optimal region in an automated fashion. Results generated from studying
   virtually all previously identified pseudo-invariant sites indicate that
   there are six sites in the Sahara and Middle East that can achieve
   variabilities as low as 2\% in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and
   2\%-3\% in the shortwave infrared (SWIR). The Sonoran Desert site was
   identified in North America and produces 2\%-3\% variabilities in the
   VNIR and 4\%-5\% in the SWIR. In addition, it has a large amount of
   historical data available for calibration of historic sensors.
   Additional sites in Dunhuang, China, and Barreal Blanco, Argentina, show
   excellent potential for long-term monitoring using high-altitude desert
   sites as well as potential for improved monitoring in the SWIR region.
   Lastly, regular acquisition of these sites by current and future Earth
   observing sensors is strongly recommended for additional reductions in
   uncertainties associated with these sites, for cost-effective monitoring
   of sensor stability, and for sensor cross-calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Soil C dynamics below the plow layer have been little studied, despite a
   suspected large C-stabilization potential of subsurface horizons. The
   objective of this study was to test two simple models (model A. single
   compartment for C(3)- and for C(4)-derived C, model B: division of C(3)-
   and C(4)-derived C into active and passive compartments) in their
   ability to simulate the C dynamics in subsoil horizons of a Haplic
   Phaeozem after conversion from C(3) (rye) to C(4) cropping (maize). The
   models were calibrated on an unfertilized maize soil and then validated
   on a maize soil with NPK fertilization. Both models simulated well
   C(3)-C and C(4)-C dynamics in the investigated soil depths (20-40 cm and
   40-60 cm) In all cases, the model efficiency EF was > 0, which indicated
   that the simulated values described the trend in the measured data
   better than the mean of the observations. However, we observed some
   inconsistency in the obtained parameter set (e.g., a higher proportion
   of passive C for C(4)-derived than for C(3)-derived C or a very low
   decomposition rate constant for passive C(4)-C in 40-60 cm), which we
   assume to result from data restrictions on the investigated soils. More
   detailed data on SOC pools and turnover rates in subsoils which are
   generally not yet available for most experimental plots is vitally
   needed-especially for applying more sophisticated C-dynamics models.}},

Abstract = {{Cold trap is a purification unit used in sodium system of FBR's for
   maintaining the oxygen/hydrogen level in sodium within acceptable
   limits. It works on the principle of crystallization and precipitation
   of oxides/hydrides of sodium in a wire mesh, when the temperature of
   sodium is reduced below the saturation temperature. The cold traps
   presently used have lower effectiveness and get plugged prematurely. The
   plugged cold traps are cleaned and then put back into service. Frequent
   cleaning of cold trap results in the long down time of the sodium
   system. New design of cold trap has been conceived to overcome the above
   problems. The mathematical modeling for the new design was carried out
   and validated with experimentally tested results for its effectiveness.
   This paper shares the experience gained on the new design of cold trap
   for FBR's. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a silicone intraocular lens
   (IOL) that can be adjusted following implantation using ultraviolet (UV)
   irradiation.
   METHODS: Prospective clinical trial of 40 patients (40 eyes) with
   visually significant cataract. Participants underwent small-incision
   phacoemulsification followed by implantation of a light-adjustable,
   silicone IOL (Light Adjustable Lens {[}LAL], Calhoun Vision). All
   patients were required to wear UV-protective eyewear at all times, until
   final lock-in. Pre- and postoperative clinical parameters included
   distance visual acuity and manifest refraction.
   RESULTS: At average 2 weeks postoperative (range: 10 to 21 days),
   patients were seen and refracted to determine type and magnitude of
   refractive error needing correction. All patients required an initial
   adjustment of the LAL, whereas 28 required a second UV treatment and
   none required a third adjustment. At 4 months postoperative, mean
   refraction was 0.04 +/- 0.37 diopters (D) (range: -0.88 to 0.50 D), mean
   sphere was 0.24 +/- 0.40 D (range: -0.50 to 0.75 D), and mean cylinder
   was 0.41 +/- 0.25 D (range: 1.00 to 0.0 D). Eighty-one percent of eyes
   gained 2 or more lines of corrected distance visual acuity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The adjustment and lock-in procedures were well tolerated
   by patients. The Calhoun Vision LAL is a promising technology with the
   potential to eliminate postoperative refractive surprises of up to 2.00
   D of refractive and cylindrical error following implantation. {[}J

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy is nowadays a major therapeutic option in prostate cancer.
   Technological improvements allowed dose escalation without increasing
   late toxicity. Some randomized trials have shown that dose escalation
   decreases the biochemical failure rate, without any benefit in survival
   with the present follow-up. However, some studies indicate that the
   distant metastases rate is also decreased. Most of these studies have
   been done without hormonal treatment, and the role of dose escalation in
   case of long-term androgen deprivation is unknown. The target volume
   encompassed the whole gland: however, complete or partial focal
   treatment of the prostate can be done with sophisticated IMRT technique
   and must be evaluated. Proximal part of the seminal vesicles must be
   included in the target volumes. The role of nodal irradiation is another
   debate, but it could be logically proposed for the unfavourable group.

Abstract = {{Vascularity in the human meniscus is poor beyond 1-2 mm from the
   meniscosynovial junction, yet 22\% of the tears in this series occur
   with a >= 3-mm peripheral white rim. It is possible to suture these
   tears with the wider peripheral white rims, but healing rates are
   reduced because it is more difficult to obtain a satisfactory vascular
   supply. This article describes the history of our efforts at obtaining
   blood supply for healing of meniscus tears with a peripheral white rim
   up to 5 mm. Resection of the peripheral white rim to the vascular bed
   was unsatisfactory because it reduced the size of the meniscus and, by 3
   years, the subsequent degenerative changes in the knee were comparable
   to meniscectomy. Holes made in the rim with a biopsy needle were again
   unsuccessful at improving healing. The present technique involves using
   rasps to abrade the parameniscal synovium on both the superior and
   inferior surface of the peripheral white rim. None of the peripheral
   white rim is resected. In the first series of 240 patients in whom
   peripheral white rim resection or the biopsy punch was used, the failure
   rate of meniscus healing was 22\%. In a subsequent series of 68 patients

Abstract = {{Looking to the EU's 20/20/20 program, energy efficient retrofitting will
   be a key element in the 20\% less primary energy in 2020 compared to
   business as usual. Within that context, field studies that put
   realizable efficiency in perspective are urgently needed.
   The dwelling evaluated was built in 1957. In those days energy
   efficiency was no concern. Houses got no insulation, ventilation was
   adventitious and heating systems scored badly. The retrofit started in
   the early eighties, stepwise as to follow the impact of separate
   measures on heating energy consumed. A solar boiler was installed in
   2004. PV followed in 2009. The first 19 years a family of five inhabited
   the dwelling, then the parents only. Monitoring started in 1978.
   In the paper, predicted annual energy for space heating is compared with
   monitored result. The measured data, though showing a net decrease,
   consistently underscore predictions. Main reason is direct rebound. The
   benefits of the solar boiler and PV-panels are minimal compared to the
   energy avoided by better insulation, energy efficient windows, better
   air-tightness and upgraded ventilation and central heating. However,
   targeting passive house and zero energy quality is beyond optimal in
   terms of net present value and not doable in the dwelling. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Small hillside reservoirs are fundamental for the sustainability of the
   water resources in the semi-arid region of Tunisia, where the government
   has constructed small dams since 1990. However, flash floods and severe
   erosion are jeopardizing the life of those small hydraulic structures
   prompting an assessment of the vulnerability of semi-arid catchments to
   erosion. In this study, we investigated the degree of erosion in 23
   catchments by considering six variables related to erosion: the specific
   sediment yield, the hypsometric integral, the topographic index, the
   rainfall-related attribute as well as lithological and vegetation cover.
   More importance was assigned to the hypsometric integral and how it
   controls erosion vulnerability. The Self-Organizing Map of Kohonen, a
   robust clustering method, was implemented to analyze the patterns of the
   six variables. The results revealed four groups of catchments with
   different vulnerabilities to erosion. In addition, there is a global
   trend of increasing erosion risk from the Southwest to the Northeast of
   the semi-arid region of Tunisia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   different human tumor cell lines have revealed that the pallaclium(II)
   complexes 5-8 are more cytotoxic (IC50 values in the range of 0.21-3.79
   mu m) than their corresponding ligands (1-4) (> 60 mu m). These results
   indicate that the antiproliferative activity is enhanced when
   thiosemicarbazone ligands are coordinated to the metal. Among the

Abstract = {{Demographic parameters from seven exploited coral reef lutjanid species
   were compared as a case study of the implications of intra-family
   variation in life histories for multispecies harvest management. Modal
   lengths varied by 4 cm among four species (Lutjanus fulviflamma, L.
   vitta, L. carponotatus, L. adetii), which were at least 6 cm smaller
   than the modal lengths of the largest species (L. gibbus, Symphorus
   nematophorus, Aprion virescens). Modal ages, indicating ages of full
   selection to fishing gear, were 10 years or less for all species, but
   maximum ages ranged from 12 (L. gibbus) to 36 years (S. nematophorus).
   Each species had a unique growth pattern, with differences in
   length-at-age and mean asymptotic fork length (L-infinity), but smaller
   species generally grew fast during the first 1-2 years of life and
   larger species grew more slowly over a longer period. Total mortality
   rates varied among species; L. gibbus had the highest mortality and L.
   fulviflamma, the lowest mortality. The variability in life history
   strategies of these tropical lutjanids makes generalizations about
   lutjanid life histories difficult, but the fact that all seven had
   characteristics that would make them particularly vulnerable to fishing
   indicates that harvest of tropical lutjanids should be managed with
   caution.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a case of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP)
   in a 7-month-old infant with perianal abscesses. The infant had suffered
   from perianal abscesses from 3 weeks after birth. The abscesses
   repeatedly developed and spontaneously drained through the orifice.
   Twenty-seven days before admission, a live attenuated oral poliovirus
   vaccine (OPV) was given to the infant for the first time for routine
   immunization. His body temperature rose to 38A degrees C 19 days after
   receiving the OPV and fell 4 days later. Flaccid paralysis of the right
   leg appeared 26 days after receipt of the OPV. A Sabin type 3 poliovirus
   was isolated from a stool obtained at admission. The DNA sequences of
   the VP1 region of the isolated virus were more than 99\% identical with
   those of the vaccine strain. Mild muscle atrophy with moderate motor
   impairment in the right leg persisted at 18 months of age. One VAPP case
   provoked by a perianal abscess has been reported from the United
   Kingdom. Database search revealed that one of nine VAPP cases reported
   during 2003-2008 in Japan had a perianal abscess. Taken together, these
   reports and our case imply that we should give OPV with caution to
   infants with a perianal abscess.}},

   within families may differ, or in both components. We consider
   alternative models for defining the distribution of phenotypes to
   include a component due to heterogeneity of V-E. We review evidence for
   the presence of genetic variation in V-E and estimates of its magnitude.
   Typically the heritability of V-E is under 10\%, but its genetic
   coefficient of variation is typically 20\% or more. We consider
   experimental designs appropriate for estimating genetic variance in V-E
   and review alternative methods of estimation. We consider the effects of
   stabilizing and directional selection on V-E and review both the forces
   that might be maintaining levels of V-E and heritability found in
   populations. We also evaluate the opportunities for reducing V-E in
   breeding programmes. Although empirical and theoretical studies have
   increased our understanding of genetic control of environmental
   variance, many issues remain unresolved.}},

Abstract = {{A general approach of size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-NMR is
   introduced for the determination of the classical molar mass parameters
   M(W), M(N), and M(P). It can be used for the determination of molar mass
   distributions of homopolymers and copolymers. The main advantage of
   SEC-NMR of copolymers is the possibility of detecting each monomer unit
   simultaneously with NMR as a quantitative concentration detector.
   Therefore, it is possible to provide the chemical compositions of
   copolymers at any elution volume without calibrations. In this respect,
   a new method will be presented for getting correct signal quantities of
   onflow data with sufficient NMR sensitivities. As the consequence, the
   chemical composition of copolymers can be correctly quantified under
   typical chromatographic conditions with respect to sample concentration
   and flow rate. Finally, the molar mass calibrations of the copolymers
   can be easily adjusted according to their chemical compositions. The
   methods were applied to polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) block
   copolymers of different molar masses. The results of the molar mass
   distributions and the chemical composition distributions obtained by
   SEC-NMR are in very good agreement with the complex SEC multidetector
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A de-embedding method using an electromagnetic (EM) simulator is
   proposed to extract field-effect transistor (FET) characteristics from
   FET test-pattern measurements. In the proposed method, the S-parameters
   of the parasitic circuit are analyzed using the EM simulator. Hybrid
   S/Z-parameters, converted from S-parameters, are used for the parasitic
   circuit to express waveguide ports with S-parameters and lumped-element
   ports with Z-parameters. The proposed method requires a high accuracy of
   the EM simulator; this method was verified by comparing calculated and
   measured frequency characteristics of the S-parameters of an
   open/short-pattern. It was shown numerically that the proposed
   de-embedding method has a better accuracy than the conventional method,
   which uses the open/short-pattern. For example, the extraction error is
   below 5\% up to 75 GHz for the proposed method and a 5\% error is
   exceeded around 30 GHz for the conventional method. The dominant error
   factor in the conventional de-embedding method using the
   open/short-pattern was investigated. It was established that the
   approximation of the parasitic circuit by an equivalent circuit topology
   is the cause of the error. The extraction of the FET characteristics by
   measured data is demonstrated and it is shown that the proposed method
   can be applied to extract active devices.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall.
   Recent evidence suggests that chronic vascular inflammation ensues as an
   imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Recently
   identified lipid mediators (eg, lipoxins and resolvins) play active
   roles in promoting the resolution of inflammation. Alterations in
   vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, which manifest as a loss
   of contractile protein expression and increased proliferation and
   migration, are prominent mechanistic features of both atherosclerosis
   and restenosis following various interventions (eg, angioplasty and
   bypass grafting). We sought to determine whether human atherosclerosis
   is associated with a ``resolution deficit{''} and whether lipoxins and
   resolvins influence VSMC phenotype. Here we report that plasma levels of
   aspirin-triggered lipoxin are significantly lower in patients with
   symptomatic peripheral artery disease than in healthy volunteers. Both
   aspirin-triggered lipoxin and resolvin E1 block platelet-derived growth
   factor-stimulated migration of human saphenous vein SMCs and decrease
   phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta.
   Importantly, receptors for aspirin-triggered lipoxin and resolvin E1
   (ALX and ChemR23, respectively) were identified in human VSMCs. Overall,
   these results demonstrate that stimulatory lipid mediators confer a
   protective pheno-typic switch in VSMCs and elucidate new functions for
   these mediators in the regulation of SMC biology. These results also
   suggest that peripheral artery disease is associated with an
   inflammation-resolution deficit and highlight a potential therapeutic
   opportunity for the regulation of vascular injury responses. (Am J

Abstract = {{A cotton fiber cDNA, GhRING1, and its corresponding gene have been
   cloned and characterized. The GhRING1 gene encodes a RING-type ubiquitin
   ligase (E3) containing 338 amino acids (aa). The GhRING1 protein
   contains a RING finger motif with conserved cysteine and histine
   residues at the C-terminus, and is classified as a C3H2C3-type RING
   protein. Blast searches show that GhRING1 has the highest homology to
   At3g19950, a zinc finger family protein from Arabidopsis. Real time
   RT-PCR analysis indicates that the GhRING1 gene is expressed in cotton
   fibers in a developmental manner. The transcript level of GhRING1 gene
   reaches a maximum in elongating fibers at 15 days post-anthesis (DPA).
   In vitro auto-ubiquitination assays using wheat germ extract and a
   reconstitution system demonstrate that GhRING1 has the ubiquitin E3
   ligase activity. The histochemical GUS assay was performed to analyze
   tissue specificity of the GhRING1 and At3g19950 promoters in transgenic
   Arabidopsis plants. The GUS assay shows that the promoter of At3g19950
   is highly activated in leaves, roots, trichomes, and also in anthers and
   stigma of flowers. In contrast, the GUS expression directed by the
   GhRING1 promoter is only located at stipules and anthers. The expression
   pattern of GhRING1 suggests that protein ubiquitination and turnover may
   be involved in transition to different stages of cotton fiber
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Mechanisms underlying vasomotor abnormalities and increased
   peripheral resistance exacerbating heart failure (HF) are poorly
   understood.
   Objective: To explore the role and molecular basis of myogenic responses
   in HF.
   Methods and Results: 10 weeks old C57Bl6 mice underwent experimental
   myocardial infarction (MI) or sham surgery. At 1 to 12 weeks
   postoperative, mice underwent hemodynamic studies, mesenteric, cerebral,
   and cremaster artery perfusion myography and Western blot. Organ weights
   and hemodynamics confirmed HF and increased peripheral resistance after
   MI. Myogenic responses, ie, pressure-induced vasoconstriction, were
   increased as early as 1 week after MI and remained elevated.
   Vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine were decreased 1 week after
   MI, but not at 2 to 6 weeks after MI, whereas those to endothelin (ET)-1
   and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) were increased at all time points
   after MI. An antagonist (JTE-013) for the most abundant S1P receptor
   detected in mesenteric arteries (S1P(2)R) abolished the enhanced
   myogenic responses of HF, with significantly less effect on controls.
   Mice with genetic absence of sphingosine-kinases or S1P(2)R (Sphk1(-/-);
   Sphk1(-/-) /Sphk2(+/-); S1P(2)R(-/-))did not manifest enhanced myogenic
   responses after MI. Mesenteric arteries from HF mice exhibited increased
   phosphorylation of myosin light chain, with deactivation of its
   phosphatase (MLCP). Among known S1P-responsive regulators of MLCP,
   GTP-Rho levels were unexpectedly reduced in HF, whereas levels of
   activated p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   1/2) were increased. Inhibiting p38 MAPK abolished the myogenic
   responses of animals with HF, with little effect on controls.
   Conclusions: Rho-independent p38 MAPK-mediated deactivation of MLCP
   underlies S1P/S1P(2)R-regulated increases in myogenic vasoconstriction
   observed in HF. Therapeutic targeting of these findings in HF models
   deserves study. (Circ Res. 2010;107:923-933.)}},

Abstract = {{Many attempts to reduce the stigmatization of people with mental illness
   have often been predicated, based on the desire to persuade the public
   that people with mental illness are `ill' in the same way as people with
   medical conditions. This paper presents one aspect from the findings of
   a study that examined the ways in which lay people perceived mental
   health and illness. Data are drawn from the discussion of the roles and
   experiences of different non-mental health professionals who cared for
   and about people they met in their everyday employment. In this paper,
   we argue that central to these roles is the importance of listening to
   people in an arena which is non-statutory and without judgment. We
   demonstrate that people use popular sectors when they are unsure of the
   problem they have, or they are reluctant to refer themselves to the
   professional sector. The paper presents narrative extracts illustrating
   the emotional labour operating in each participant's role and the extent
   to which they provide support for their client's emotional and
   psychological well-being. The implications for mental health nursing are
   discussed in relation to working with and alongside people experiencing
   mental distress, in relation to `ordinary human qualities'.}},

Abstract = {{Internationally, family physicians (FP) are not routinely involved in
   young adult cancer (YAC) care. In this short report, we would like to
   make a compelling argument for primary care involvement.
   Comparative descriptions and literature review.
   Cancer among YAs is rare and usually not the first thing that comes into
   the FP's mind. Youth is sometimes mistakenly regarded as a protective
   factor. Across the countries, almost all YACs are treated in tertiary
   health care facilities with specialists providing the majority of care.
   Health care services are covered by the universal health insurance in
   Denmark, The Netherlands, and Canada but not in the US. Once the YAC has
   completed acute treatment and follow-up care, they often return to the
   care of the FPs who may potentially be expected to deal with and take
   action upon any possible medical, mental health, and psychosocial issues
   the YA cancer patient may present with. The role of the FP in follow-up
   care seems to be very limited.
   YACs in the western world seem to have comparable medical and
   psychosocial problems. However, the nature of health insurance is such
   that it impacts differently on the care of this group of cancer
   patients. Primary care features such as patient-centered, integrated,
   and comprehensive care over extended periods of time bring the FP into
   the unique position to provide follow-up for YAC. However, this will
   require integrating patient's perspectives on their care, professional
   continuing medical education (CME) initiatives, and an enhanced
   cooperative effort between those delivering and coordinating cancer
   care.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of lipoxygenase (LOX, EC 1.13.11.12) in elicitor-induced
   opium poppy defense response was investigated. Papaver somniferum L
   suspension cultures were treated with abiotic elicitor methyl jasmonate
   (MJ), fungal elicitor (Botrytis cinerea homogenate) and phenidone
   (specific inhibitor of LOX) to determine the involvement of this enzyme
   in production of sanguinarine, the major secondary metabolite of opium
   poppy cultures. P. somniferum suspension cultures responded to elicitor
   treatment with strong and transient increase of LOX activity followed by
   sanguinarine accumulation. LOX activity increased in elicited cultures,
   reaching 9.8 times of the initial value at 10 h after MJ application and
   2.9 times after B. cinerea application. Sanguinarine accumulated to
   maximal levels of 169.5 +/- 12.5 mu g g(-1) dry cell weight in
   MJ-elicited cultures and 288.0 +/- 10.0 mu g g(-1) dry cell weight in B.
   cinerea-elicited cultures. The treatment of cells with phenidone before
   elicitor addition, significantly reduced sanguinarine production. The
   relative molecular weight of P. somniferum LOX (83 kDa) was estimated by
   using immunobloting and its pH optimum was shown to be pH 6.5. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Introduction: Since the 1980s, stent implantation has evolved as an
   important therapeutic strategy for coarctation of the aorta. However,
   available data is frequently flawed by short follow-up, lack of adequate
   follow-up imaging, and retrospective nature of data collection. Methods:
   Data was prospectively collected using a multicenter registry congenital
   cardiovascular interventional study consortium (CCISC). Between 2000 and
   2009, 302 patients from 34 centers with a median weight of 58 kg
   underwent stent implantation for coarctation. Eligible patients (44\%)
   completed intermediate follow-up (3-18 months) with integrated imaging
   (cath, CT, MRI), whereas 21\% completed long-term follow-up (>18-60
   months). Procedural success was defined as UL/LL systolic gradient of
   less than 20 mm Hg, lack of significant recurrent obstruction, and
   freedom from unplanned repeat intervention. Results: Acute procedural
   success was 96\%. Cumulative intermediate success was 86\%, and
   cumulative long-term success was 77\%. Unplanned repeat interventions
   were required in 4\%, and aortic wall complications were seen in 1\% of
   patients (dissection n = 1 and aneurysm n = 3). Other adverse events (n
   = 15) occurred mainly acutely and included technical complications such
   as stent malposition (n = 9). At long-term follow-up, 23\% of patients
   continued to have systolic blood pressure above the 95th centile, 9\%
   had an upper-to-lower limb blood pressure gradient in excess of 20 mm
   Hg, and 32\% were taking antihypertensive medication. Conclusions: This
   study documented acute, intermediate, and long-term outcome data
   comparable or superior with other surgical or interventional series.
   However, even with successful initial stent therapy, patients continue
   to require long-term follow-up and have associated long-term morbidity,
   relating to aortic wall complications, systemic hypertension, recurrent
   obstruction as well as need for repeat intervention. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{The Ar-40/Ar-39 radioisotope system is widely used to date eruption and
   cooling of volcanic tephra-marker horizons that commonly provide the
   only means of correlating and assigning numerical ages to stratigraphy
   in which they are contained. This chronometer bridges the gap between
   C-14 and longer-lived isotopic systems that are too imprecise for dating
   young samples. However, Ar-40/Ar-39 ages obtained from coevally erupted
   biotite and sanidine do not always match. Here, we use an independent
   chronometer, U-238-Th-230 disequilibrium, to demonstrate that
   Ar-40/Ar-39 age disparity is not caused by differences in pre-eruption
   crystallization times. Our findings indicate that the presence of
   extraneous Ar-40 in biotite, and its absence in sanidine, may result
   from violations of two assumptions implicit in Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronology
   on volcanic samples: (1) Prior to eruption, minerals are devoid of Ar-40
   due to rapid loss to an ``infinite reservoir{''} such as the atmosphere,
   and (2) closure to volume diffusion is geologically instantaneous and
   coincident with eruption. We propose a mechanism whereby the presence of
   extraneous Ar in certain minerals is explained by the relative sequence
   of four events in a magmatic system: (1) crystallization, (2) mineral
   closure with respect to Ar diffusion, (3) isotopic equilibration of
   magmatic and atmospheric Ar, and (4) quenching of the system by
   eruption. These data have potentially far-reaching implications for
   studies that depend on geochronological data, necessitating
   re-evaluation of interpretations based solely on biotite with no
   independent age control, particularly in young samples where the effects
   are most pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{Background: B-cell chronic lymphocitic leukemia (B-CLL) still remains as
   an uncurable disease. Even the newest antineoplastic agents have
   demonstrated limitations in their efficacy. For this reason, further
   research of new compounds must be done. New pharmacological properties
   can be obtained from a great diversity botanical species. Among these
   products, Magnolia Grandiflora receives our attention since it mainly
   contains Honokiol which had demonstrated effect against B-CLL cells
   activating different cell death pathways.
   Aim: To test the ability of Magnolia Grandiflora extracts to induce
   apoptosis of B-CLL cells in vitro.
   Materials and Methods: Herb's extraction: Twenty grams of powdered
   material were submitted to three consecutives decoctions with 500 ml of
   distilled water (96 degrees C), filtered and followed by ultrafiltration
   with cellulose membrane, lyophilized and reconstituted in AIM-V medium
   at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml solution. B-CLL
   chlorambucil-resistant cells were separated and cultivated in the
   presence of Magnolia's extract. Samples of cells were taken from the
   cultures at 24, 48 and 72 h for apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry
   measuring positive annexin V (0.1 mu g/ml) cells. Statistics: Apoptosis
   values were represented by the mean plus or minus SD (+/- SD) for five
   independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by
   Student's t-test. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered as
   significant.
   Results and Conclusion: This article discusses the apoptosis properties
   of Magnolia on B-CLL cells. The evidence suggests a potentially
   effective repertoire for B-CLL treatment. This herb extract might have
   promising therapy strategies in treating B-CLL or other hematological
   disease resistant to alkylating agents in clinical practice.}},

Title = {{Assessment of left ventricular dyssynchrony in patients with coronary

   perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Some investigators have reported that left ventricular (LV)
   mechanical systolic and diastolic dyssynchrony occurs in coronary artery
   disease (CAD) patients without earlier myocardial infarction and narrow
   QRS complex duration. However, earlier studies evaluated LV dyssynchrony
   only at rest. The purpose of this study was to investigate LV
   dyssynchrony in CAD patients with preserved ejection fraction during
   adenosine stress using electrocardiogram-gated myocardial perfusion
   single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
   Methods The study population included 18 CAD patients and 18 control
   subjects. CAD patients had significant stenosis in their coronary
   arteries by coronary angiogram without earlier myocardial infarction.
   SPECT images were acquired at rest and during stress with adenosine. The
   regional time to end systole (TES), time to peak ejection, the time from
   0 to peak filling during the whole diastolic period (TPF1), and the time
   from end systole to peak filling during the whole diastolic period
   (TPF2) were obtained by using the Quantitative Gated SPECT software. The
   maximal difference (MD), which is the difference between the earliest
   and latest temporal parameter among 17 segments, was considered to
   represent LV dyssynchrony.
   Results MD-TES and MD-TPF1 during stress were significantly greater than
   those of rest in CAD patients (MD-TES: stress=242 +/- 107 ms, rest=164
   +/- 79 ms; P=0.005, MD-TPF1: stress=249 +/- 121 ms, rest=164 +/- 88 ms;
   P=0.015) but there were no significant differences in control patients.
   Conclusion LV dyssynchrony was shown in CAD with preserved ejection
   fraction during adenosine stress. Nucl Med Commun 31:864-873 (C) 2010

Title = {{EM38 for volumetric soil water content estimation in the root-zone of
   deep vertosol soils}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic induction sensors, such as EM38, are used widely for
   monitoring and mapping soil attributes via the apparent electrical
   conductivity (ECa) of the soil. The sensor response is the
   depth-integrated combination of the depth-response function of the EM38
   and `local' electrical conductivity (ECaz) at depth. In deep, Vertosol
   soils, assuming the instrument depth-response function is not perturbed
   by the soil and where volumetric moisture content at depth (theta(v)(z))
   dominates ECaz, EM38 should be capable of predicting average moisture
   content without recourse to mathematically complicated, and unstable
   profile inversion processes. Firstly a multi-height EM38 experiment was
   conducted over deep Vertosol soils to confirm the veracity of the EM38
   depth-response function and test the concomitant hypothesis of the EM38
   response being an integrated (i.e. additive) combination of
   depth-response function and theta(v)(z). Secondly, depth profiles of
   moisture content were used to calibrate the EM38 to infer average
   theta(v)(z) within the `root-zone' of crop plants-here taken to be
   surface-0.8 m and surface-1.2 m. EM38 calibration was performed using
   soil samples acquired from both extracted cores and excavated pits.
   Mathematical summation of measured theta(v)(z) from sectioned cores and
   the known depth-response function of the EM38 was found to explain 99\%
   and 97\% of the variance in measured ECd for horizontal and vertical
   dipole configurations at multiple sensor heights above the ground.
   Average theta(v) from surface to 0.8 m ((theta) over bar (0.8)) and
   surface to 1.2 m ((theta) over bar (1.2)) explained only 37\% and 46\%
   of the variance in on-ground ECa for vertical dipole configuration
   measurements compared to 55\% and 56\% of the variance for horizontal
   dipole configuration. In a separate validation experiment, the shape of
   the vertical moisture profile proved highly influential in determining
   the ability of the calibration equations to infer underlying average
   moisture content, especially where the depth profile shapes differed
   between sensor calibration and subsequent field validation (for example
   following rainfall or irrigation). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (HNPU) on corrosion behavior of carbon steel in 1 M hydrochloric acid
   solution was investigated using weight loss, potentiostatic
   polarization, and infrared spectroscopy methods. Surface morphology was
   studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results,
   suggest that HNPU inhibited the corrosion of carbon steel in acid
   solution and the inhibition efficiencies increased as the concentration
   of the compound in the solution was increased. The calculated inhibition
   efficiencies from the two investigated methods were in good agreement.
   Potentiostatic polarization measurements indicate that HNPU acts as a
   mixed-type inhibitor. The adsorption of the inhibitor on the carbon
   steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The values of
   activation energy and the thermodynamic parameters, such as adsorption
   equilibrium constant (K-ads), adsorption free energy (Delta G(ads)),
   adsorption heat (Delta H-ads), and adsorption entropy (Delta S-ads)
   values were calculated and discussed. The results obtained from infrared
   spectra, confirmed the adsorption of inhibitor on the alloy surface
   after immersion in acidic solution containing HNPU. The SEM analysis
   indicated that there are more lightly corroded and oxidative steel

Abstract = {{Objective: To report a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis occurring as a
   rare complication of neck dissection, and to present a review of
   published literature.
   Case report: A 42-year-old man underwent an elective neck dissection for
   a tumour stage 2. node stage 2(h), tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma,
   prior to chemoradiotherapy During surgery, the right internal jugular
   vein was sacrificed as part of the resection, as tumour was adherent to
   it Two weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted with seizures
   Subsequent computed tomography and magnetic resonance venography
   confirmed a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis The patient was
   subsequently anticoagulated and underwent radiotherapy without further
   complication. A review of pre-operative imaging indicated a dominant
   internal jugular vein, ligation of which may have been a factor in the
   subsequent sagittal sinus thrombosis
   Conclusion: Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis following neck dissection
   is a rare occurrence, with little reported in the literature. Dominant
   internal jugular vein anatomy may be evident on pre-operative imaging.
   An awareness of this complication may be helpful to surgeons
   contemplating sacrifice of the Internal jugular vein.}},

Abstract = {{There is a long-standing tradition among social anthropologists in
   Norwegian universities of participation in debates about current social,
   cultural, and political issues. I shall examine some of the background
   to why anthropologists have chosen to play this role and consider some
   of the practical, professional, and ethical aspects of ``engaged
   anthropology.{''} I shall also consider why the Norwegian public is so
   open to anthropological comments. A few topics have tended to attract
   the most anthropological contributions. These are issues to do with
   development aid, politics regarding the minority population of the Sami,
   and questions pertaining to ``multicultural society.{''} These topics
   are all controversial and highly sensitive or have been so at various
   times, and they all challenge a Norwegian sense of identity as well as a
   strong feeling of the moral responsibility of ethnic Norwegians to
   others less fortunate than themselves. My findings are based on
   interviews with some of the most actively engaged anthropologists in
   recent years in order to get their point of view about their
   experiences. It transpired that they are motivated by a desire to
   communicate a nuanced perspective. However, not only is the role
   personally challenging, it can also be fraught with contradictory
   demands.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to identify pre-endoscopic clinical
   parameters independently associated with 6-week mortality and to develop
   a prognostic model in cirrhotic patients with acute upper
   gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding.
   Methods: A total of 542 consecutive admissions of 389 cirrhotic patients
   with acute UGI bleeding were retrospectively investigated. Pertinent
   clinical data obtained at the emergency department were analyzed.
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine
   risk factors for 6-week mortality and to develop a predictive model.
   Results: Forty-four patients (8.12\%) died within 6 weeks. The 6-week
   mortality was independently associated with male sex, hepatocellular
   carcinoma, non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy, hypoxemia with
   peripheral oxygen saturation less than 95\%, serum bilirubin, and
   prothrombin time. A predictive model consisting of these 6 simple
   parameters was built. The c statistic of our model was 0.84,
   significantly superior to that (0.71) of the model for end-stage liver
   disease score (P = .002).
   Conclusions: Simple pre-endoscopic clinical parameters are valuable for
   early risk stratification in cirrhotic patients with acute UGI bleeding.
   Our prognostic model warrants prospective validation by further studies.

Abstract = {{Four lead-based paint (LBP) contaminated deconstructed masonry materials
   (two types of concrete blocks and two types of clay bricks) were crushed
   and used to replace all natural aggregate in conventional concrete. To
   reduce cost, the crushed materials were neither sieved nor re-graded.
   After their physical properties and lead-leaching ability were
   characterized, these masonry materials were used for concrete with
   various mix proportions. The workability, lead-leaching ability and
   compressive strength of the concrete were studied. A cost-savings
   analysis was conducted to compare such a masonry deconstruction method
   with tradition ones (including LBP removal, hazardous and non-hazardous
   material disposal) for three hypothetical buildings. The results
   indicated that after being used as aggregate in Portland cement
   concrete, the lead is sequestered, or rendered non-leachable, due to the
   high alkalinity of Portland cement, and the concrete no longer has the
   toxicity characteristic for lead. Well-designed and well-manufactured
   concrete made with all LBP-contaminated, recycled aggregates can have
   satisfactory workability and strength fora variety of constructions,
   including roadways, parking lots and foundations. The savings from
   eliminating LBP removal and waste material disposal as well as
   minimizing the use of secure landfills range from approximately \$4.63
   to \$412.80/m(2), depending on the size of the deconstruction project
   and the applicable environmental protection regulations. Recycling such
   masonry materials as concrete aggregate is a cost effective and
   environmentally friendly approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An automated multicomponent mesofluidic system (MCMS) based on
   biorecognitions carried out on meso-scale glass beads in
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels was developed. The constructed MCMS
   consisted of five modules: a bead introduction module, a bioreaction
   module, a solution handling module, a liquid driving module, and a
   signal collection module. The integration of these modules enables the
   assay to be automated and reduces it to a one-step protocol. The MCMS
   has successfully been applied toward the detection of veterinary drug
   residues in animal-derived foods. The drug antigen-coated beads (phi 250
   mu m) were arrayed in the PDMS channels (phi 300 mu m). The competitive
   immunoassay was then carried out on the surface of the glass beads.
   After washing, the Cy3-labeled secondary antibody was introduced to
   probe the antigen-antibody complex anchored to the beads. The
   fluorescence intensity of each bead was measured and used to determine
   the residual drug concentration. The MCMS is highly sensitive, with its
   detection limits ranging from 0.02 (salbutamol) to 3.5 mu g/L
   (sulfamethazine), and has a short assay time of 45 min or less. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the MCMS proves to be an economic,
   efficient, and sensitive platform for multicomponent detection of
   compound residues for contamination in foods or the environment. (C)

   amorphous nanoparticles were formed in the Pt0.5Ru0.5/C catalyst using
   the microwave-irradiated polyol method. After reduction, the content of
   metallic species increased and that of hydrous Ru oxide species
   significantly decreased. A Pt0.5Ru0.5O2/C catalyst containing more oxide
   species was also synthesized by the microwave-irradiated oxidation
   precipitation method. Performance tests demonstrated that the presence
   of more metallic Pt species in both the hydrophobic Pt and Pt Ru
   catalysts resulted in higher catalytic activity. The addition of Ru, as
   an alloy or as a hydrous oxide, can improve the catalytic activity of
   pure Pt. These experimental results were explained by the reaction

Abstract = {{The microstructure and microhardness of AlSi10Cu3 solidified in a die
   sleeve were studied, and the differential equation of local solidifying
   pressure was deduced in horizontal cold chamber high pressure die
   casting. The local solidifying pressure changed, and in the last stage
   of solidification, porosity and pores were present because of the
   decreasing pressure. Microhardness relative to microstructure varied
   with locations, the minimum value being observed at 40\% of the radius
   from the biscuit centre. Temperature distribution analysis carried out
   with ANSYS showed the solidified thickness to be proportional to t(1/2)
   in the initial 7 s of solidification; in the final stage of
   solidification, the solidified layer thickened faster and its thickness
   was proportional to t(8.4631). Microsegregation of AlSi10Cu3 was
   observed in the die sleeve and Si precipitated in fine granules,
   dendrites and coarse granules in morphology from exterior to centre.}},

Title = {{Using synoptic classification to evaluate an operational air quality

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{280-287}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Since 2006, a team of forecasters in Georgia (USA) has been using the
   high-resolution air quality forecasting system (Hi-Res) as an aid for
   making ozone (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts. Here,
   we examine Hi-Res's O-3 and PM2.5 forecasting performance for the
   Atlanta metropolitan area during the summers of 2006-2009. A
   classificatory evaluation approach was adopted. The spatial synoptic
   classification (SSC) calendar for Atlanta was used to cluster the
   forecasting days into typical summer weather types of dry moderate, dry
   tropical, moist moderate, moist tropical, and a transition class. The
   forecasting days were also classified according to emissions conditions
   as special weekdays (Monday and Friday), typical weekdays and
   weekends/holidays. Evaluation of forecasts during 20062009 shows that
   O-3 performance was worse on moist days and better on dry days. This is
   an important concern for forecasters since a sizeable number of days
   that exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O-3
   were observed under moist tropical weather type during the period. On
   the other hand, PM2.5 performance during 2006-2008 was opposite - worse
   on dry days, especially on dry tropical days, and better on moist days.
   This too is a concern since higher concentrations of PM2.5 were observed
   to occur on dry days. In 2009, PM2.5 forecasting performance on dry days
   was improved significantly by integrating a new secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) module into the system. As a result, the differences in
   PM2.5 forecasting performance between dry and moist days were
   diminished. Other results of this study, suggest that a relatively
   larger forecasting error on weekends/holidays may be due to higher
   uncertainties in emission estimates on those days. To a lesser extent,
   this was also true on special weekdays because of the greater variations
   in rush hour emissions relative to typical weekdays. (C) Author(s) 2010.

Abstract = {{Enhanced transmission through a subwavelength aperture is observed at
   two frequency bands with employment of two split-ring-resonators (SRR)
   of different sizes. Each of the SRR is excited to produce resonance and
   the electric field energy localized in its gap and split region can be
   coupled into a small hole with a radius of 2.3 mm around the respective
   resonance frequency. The simulation results show that the energy through
   the small hole is increased at 5.94 GHz (r/lambda (1)=0.045) and 7.03
   GHz (r/lambda (2)=0.054), where 1042-fold and 88-fold enhancements are
   obtained, respectively, in comparison with the case of a single isolated
   hole. Moreover, it is found that placing two identical SRR structures in
   front of the hole can realize higher enhanced transmission with respect
   to the case of only one SRR utilized. The electric field
   coupling-enhancement mechanism is well described by studying the
   electric field distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which zinc regulates insulin synthesis and secretion in
   pancreatic beta-cells is still unclear. Cellular zinc homeostasis is
   largely maintained by zinc transporters and intracellular zinc binding
   proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that zinc transporter 7 (ZnT7,
   Slc30a7) was co-expressed with insulin in the islet of Langerhans in the
   mouse pancreas. In RIN5mF cells (rat insulinoma cells), ZnT7 was found
   mainly residing in the perinuclear region of the cell, which is
   consistent with its Golgi apparatus localization. Over-expression of
   ZnT7 in RIN5mF cells increased the total cellular insulin content
   leading to a high basal insulin secretion. Furthermore, glucose-induced
   insulin secretion was not altered in RIN5mF cells over-expressing Zn17.
   Quantitative RTPCR and S-35 metabolic labeling analysis demonstrated
   that over-expression of ZnT7 in RIN5mF cells led to an increase of
   insulin mRNA expression and subsequent insulin protein synthesis in the
   cell. Metal-responsive elements (MREs) were identified in the promoter
   regions of the Ins1 and Ins2 genes. Mtf1, a metal-responsive
   transcription factor, was shown to specifically bind to the MRE in the
   Ins genes and activated the insulin gene transcription. Together, the
   data strongly suggest that ZnT7 plays an important role in regulating
   insulin expression by modulating Mtf1 transcriptional activity.

Abstract = {{This paper considers stochastic consensus problems over lossy wireless
   networks. We first propose a measurement model with a random link gain,
   additive noise, and Markovian lossy signal reception, which captures
   uncertain operational conditions of practical networks. For consensus
   seeking, we apply stochastic approximation and derive a Markovian mode
   dependent recursive algorithm. Mean square and almost sure (i.e.,
   probability one) convergence analysis is developed via a state space
   decomposition approach when the coefficient matrix in the algorithm
   satisfies a zero row and column sum condition. Subsequently, we consider
   a model with arbitrary random switching and a common stochastic Lyapunov
   function technique is used to prove convergence. Finally, our method is
   applied to models with heterogeneous quantizers and packet losses, and
   convergence results are proved. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates a novel approach to lift the inductor from the
   lossy substrate by static magnetic field. The lift angle of the
   inductor, which tuned by a position stage, is employed to control the
   quality factor of the inductor. The lifted inductor is then welded by
   localized induction heating using the ac magnetic field. Thus, the
   heating-induced thermal problem is prevented. In addition, the inductor
   is also simultaneously packaged inside a Si capping by the alternating
   magnetic field. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept,
   the meander strip inductor was fabricated and tested. The radio
   frequency performance of the inductor at various tilting angles away
   from the substrate (0, 45, and 90 deg) was characterized by using a
   two-port vector network analyzer. The quality factor has been improved
   from 4.2 (at the central frequency of 0.64 GHz) to 7.9 (at the central
   frequency of 0.74 GHz), as the lift angle increased from 0 to 90 deg. In
   other words, the central frequency of the inductor can also be varied
   from 0.64 to 0.74 GHz. Measurement results also indicate that the bonded
   Si capping has a good shear strength of 23.5 MPa. (C) 2010 Society of

Abstract = {{Measuring and monitoring fertility performance is a key part of a
   veterinary surgeon's role in the running of a successful dairy unit.
   Knowledge of trends in current fertility performance at national level
   can be useful in facilitating this process, as it allows a herd's
   performance to be seen in a more meaningful context. There have been no
   recent large-scale studies investigating this at national level in the
   UK. In this paper, data from over 250 herds are used to assess herd
   fertility by standard techniques. Overall fertility performance appears
   to have declined from 2000 to 2006, but this trend appears to have
   reversed in the last year studied. This appears to have been driven
   predominantly by an increase in rates of submission for service, while
   pregnancy rate has fallen steadily over the study period. The
   consequences of these trends are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Following the radiological study of a large number of myelograms,
   starting over 50 years ago when the only clinical contrast medium
   available to show the contents of the spinal canal was an iodized oil,
   the author has collected a number of examples where the oil was
   inadvertently injected into the subdural area, rather than the intended
   subarachnoid space. By taking follow-up films at various intervals
   following the inadvertent injection, it has been possible to study the
   extent to which the subdural space could become visualized from a lumbar
   injection, the contrast medium sometimes passing to the top of the
   cervical region and the lower part of the sacrum. Also, the contrast
   passed outward along the peri-neural lymphatic sheaths or spaces of the
   issuing spinal nerves, where it might remain for months, and under the
   influence of gravity it could extend for a considerable way. It also
   passed into abdominal and thoracic lymph vessels and nodes. Considering
   the morphology, predictability, and ease with which the demonstrated
   subdural space fills, the author concludes that the subdural region is a
   true and functionally significant ``space,'' and an important conduit or
   functional part of the body's lymphatic system. He also considers that
   it has implications for the spread or dissemination of various
   organisms, substances or pathological conditions, as well as being part
   of the normal conduit for reabsorption of CSF with implications for
   hydrocephalus, and with potential for misplacement of spinal anaesthetic
   agents. Clin. Anat. 23:829-839, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Title = {{A History of Violence: The Shooting in Jerusalem of British Assistant
   Police Superintendent Alan Sigrist, 12 June 1936}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a narrative of the shooting in Jerusalem by two
   Palestinian gunmen - Bahjat Abu Gharbiyah and Sami al-Ansari - in June
   1936 during the Arab revolt in Palestine of a British police officer,
   Alan Edward Sigrist. Abu Gharbiyah and al-Ansari specifically targeted
   Sigrist because of his violence towards Palestinians - an issue that has
   not been discussed fully in the literature. This study measures, against
   the contemporary record, Abu Gharbiyah's account of why he shot Sigrist,
   using the shooting as a case study to open up debates on the British use
   of official and unofficial violence to maintain colonial rule, alongside
   one on the response of local people to such violence. While recognizing
   the partisan nature of Abu Gharbiyah's memory of events in Palestine,
   the article gives voice to the Palestinians, explaining how and why
   rebels fighting British rule and Jewish immigration to Palestine used
   violence. Following the analysis of the shooting of Sigrist, the article
   details more general torture by British forces as recalled by Abu
   Gharbiyah, setting this against the extant evidence to test the
   traditional notion that Britain used `minimum force' in countering
   colonial disturbances, tying Sigrist's behaviour to that of British
   troops and police in Palestine more generally. Thus, while the article
   is narrow in its focus it has broader implications for contemporary
   imperial and military history.}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is critical in determining
   chromatin accessibility and regulating gene expression. This epigenetic
   mechanism has an important role in T-cell function. We used genome-wide
   methylation profiling to characterize the DNA methylome in primary human
   CD4+ T cells. We found that only 5\% of CpG islands are methylated in
   CD4+ T cells, and that DNA methylation peak density is increased in
   subtelomeric chromosomal regions. We also found an inverse relationship
   between methylation peak density and chromosomal length. Our data
   indicate that DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is not always a
   repressive epigenetic mark. Indeed, about 27\% of methylated genes are
   actively expressed in CD4+ T cells. We demonstrate that repressive
   methylation peaks are located closer to the transcription start site
   (TSS) compared with functionally non-repressive peaks (-893 +/- 110 bp
   versus -1342 +/- 218 bp (mean +/- s.e.m.), P-value <0.05). We also show
   that both a larger number and an increased CpG island density in
   promoter sequences predict transcriptional permissiveness of DNA
   methylation. TSS in the majority of genes with permissive DNA
   methylation peaks is in DNase I hypersensitive sites, indicating a
   failure of DNA methylation to induce chromatin inaccessibility in these
   loci. Genes and Immunity (2010) 11, 554-560; doi:10.1038/gene.2010.24;

Abstract = {{The Integrated Assessment Scheme (IAS) defines weight factors for each
   piece of toxicological information under REACH in an Integrated Testing
   Strategy. This IAS is illustrated on skin irritation for Classification
   and Labelling (C\&L) for five substances and using mostly (Q)SAR models.
   The models are the BfR Rulebase, Derek for Windows and TOPKAT, read
   across and pH-rules. The weight factors derived in the IAS show that for
   peracetic-acid and pentabromodiphenylether the C\&L decision could be
   easily made. For bisphenol A additional information on read across was
   used to finalise a decision on C\&L, while for methylphenyl-diisocyanate
   additional expert judgement was needed. For allylheptanoate only the
   TOPKAT prediction was in the applicability domain, which was
   insufficient on its own. Therefore, other non guideline testing
   information was used and in vitro testing results. The above examples on
   skin irritation information show how the IAS can aid in the decision
   making process and how it adds to the ToxRTool and the ITS of Hoffmann
   et al. on the same endpoint and similar methods. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Sponge communities found in Caribbean mangroves are typical to this
   habitat: partly endemic and very distinct from sponge communities on
   nearby reefs. A trade-off between resistance to competitors and
   predators appears to influence success of individual sponge species in
   mangrove habitats. We speculate that differences in the symbiotic
   microbial communities may partly be responsible for these differences,
   as partial degradation of recalcitrant compounds by tannin-degrading
   microorganisms may enhance palatability and facilitate dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) assimilation in the presence of high concentrations of
   tannins, thereby improving their competitive capabilities. We tested
   tannase activity and ability to degrade mangrove-derived DOM in a random
   set of sponge species collected from mangrove roots in Curacao and
   adjacent reefs. Our results suggest that sponges commonly associated
   with mangrove roots contain bacteria that are capable of degrading
   mangrove-derived DOM, while bacterial communities associated with
   sponges that are more typical to reef environments appear less
   proficient in degrading mangrove-derived DOM. Host specificity of
   bacterial endobionts capable of degrading mangrove-derived DOM and the
   presence of high concentrations of recalcitrant organic compounds may
   lead to ecological separation between mangrove and reef sponge
   communities.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Since DX/HA was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 as
   an acceptable tissue-augmenting substance for subureteral injection,
   endoscopic treatment has become increasingly popular for treating
   vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). However, most paediatric urologists still
   continue to recommend ureteral reimplantation as the treatment of choice
   in the management of grade V VUR. The purpose of this study was to
   prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic subureteral
   injection of DX/HA in the treatment of grade V reflux.
   During 2001-2009, 56 children (35 males, 21 females) with primary grade
   V VUR underwent endoscopic treatment using DX/HA. Their ages ranged from
   4 months to 11 years. Forty-nine patients had unilateral grade V VUR,
   and seven had bilateral grade V (63 refluxing ureters including 17
   duplex systems). Renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinic acid was observed
   in 39 kidneys (mild scarring 13, moderate scarring 14 and severe
   scarring 12). In all patients, endoscopic injection was made after
   inserting the needle within the wide ureteral orifice. Renal ultrasound
   and voiding cystourethrogram was performed 3 months after the endoscopic
   treatment. If VUR had not resolved, the patient was considered for
   further endoscopic treatment. After the VUR was resolved, children were
   followed with renal ultrasound at 1 year and every 2 years thereafter.
   The VUR completely resolved after first injection of DX/HA in 33
   (52.4\%) ureters and downgraded to grade I VUR in 7 (11.1\%) ureters. 19
   (30.2\%) ureters required a second injection, and 4 (6.3\%) ureters
   required a third injection to resolve VUR. No children in this series
   needed reimplantation of ureters or presented with ureteral obstruction
   during follow-up.
   Endoscopic treatment with DX/HA is effective in eradicating grade V
   primary reflux. This simple and minimally invasive treatment should be
   offered to all parents of children with grade V VUR as an alternative to
   ureteral reimplantation.}},

Abstract = {{An essential tool for power system monitoring is state estimation. Using
   PMUs can greatly improve the state estimation process. However, for
   state estimation, the PMUs should be placed appropriately in the
   network. The problem of optimal PMU placement for full observability is
   analysed in this paper. The objective of the paper is to minimise the
   size of the PMU configuration while allowing full observability of the
   network. The method proposed initially suggests a PMU distribution which
   makes the network observable. The Iterated Local Search (ILS)
   metaheuristic is then used to minimise the size of the PMU configuration
   needed to observe the network. The algorithm is tested on IEEE test
   networks with 14, 57 and 118 nodes and compared to the results obtained

   species complexes once considered good morphological species now
   comprise many phylogenetically distinct species. Although Phyllosticta
   species concepts are less advanced, sequence data are expected to reveal
   new species in that genus as well. Molecularly supported higher taxa in
   Dothideomycetes often differ from those circumscribed by morphological
   characters. However, DNA barcodes, recently applauded as a magic formula
   for species identification, are yet to be determined for many genera,
   and too many GenBank sequences are wrongly named or contain sequencing
   errors. Thus, despite recent molecular advances, there is an
   unprecedented need for mycologists to return to the field, recollect
   species, and re-typify taxa with living cultures. Only after we obtain
   sequences from species and genera linked to properly named taxa will
   barcoding become successful.}},

Abstract = {{The differentiated development of space is the result of historical
   development of communities, which have participated to this
   differentiation through their creative ability. The insertion in space
   was distorted over time by attitudes of different levels policy makers,
   which introduced subjective keys in the development process. Although
   nature has provided with a wide range of resources, decisions made in
   different historical periods and the territorial development policies,
   more recently, have widened the regional disparities, creating real
   islands of poverty. In this paper, the space ethics is defined outlining
   its theoretical and applied nuances and there are presented ways of
   boosting development in the most disadvantaged areas. All the ideas
   expressed are based on widespread experience of research in the field.
   In an indirect manner, the work challenges the existing ethical
   deficiency in territorial technical analysis and development. In this
   respect much is devoted to items that play an essential role in defining
   the concept of space ethics. This concept can be equated to the respect
   of all actors involved in territorial planning (decision makers,
   specialists, entrepreneurs, population) compared with its perennial
   values. The space ethics could be conceived as a set of rules and moral
   norms, with a cumulative spiral nature, which can be the basis of an
   adequate behaviour towards the most disadvantaged areas. This set of
   rules and moral values has a certain dynamic, which accounts for the
   contribution of education, for how the experience and best practices are
   transmitted in territory and over time, for how identity is preserved in
   places and for the altruism in accessing various types of values. The
   treatment of deeply disadvantaged areas requires transparency in use of
   resources and participation in ownership benefits. Over certain periods
   of time these areas can benefit of the typical elements of positive
   discrimination, given the effective treatment of chronic
   underdevelopment.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of lesions in different cerebral regions may affect the human
   ability to orient in the environment, resulting in `topographical
   disorientation'. In a recent study, we documented the first case of
   Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD), in a person with a
   life-long inability to orient despite otherwise well-preserved cognitive
   functions, and in the absence of a cerebral injury/malformation or other
   neurological condition. This selective topographical disorientation was
   due to her inability to form a `cognitive map', a mental representation
   of the environment, which in turn impaired her ability to orient in both
   familiar and unfamiliar surroundings. Here, we describe 120 new cases of
   DTD recruited via the internet and assessed with an online battery
   testing their cognitive and orientation skills. We found that people
   with DTD differ from matched (age, gender and education) healthy
   controls only in those skills confined to the orientation/navigation
   domain, among which the ability to form a cognitive map was the most
   significant factor that distinguished a person affected by DTD from
   control subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the applicability of tear meniscus height (TMH)
   measurement using Visante optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the
   diagnosis of dry eye disease.
   Design: Prospective, controlled, single-center study.
   Participants: Twenty-four right eyes of 24 patients (6 males, 18
   females; mean age, 63.14 +/- 13.4 years) with definite dry eye according
   to the Japanese dry eye diagnostic criteria and 27 right eyes of 27
   control subjects (12 males, 15 females; mean age, 56.04 +/- 14.22 years)
   were recruited.
   Methods: All subjects underwent slit-lamp TMH measurement, OCT upper and
   lower TMH measurements, tear film breakup time (BUT) measurements, vital
   stainings, and Schirmer test. The results were compared between the 2
   groups by Mann-Whitney test.
   Main Outcome Measures: The correlation between the clinical findings of
   slit-lamp TMH, strip meniscometry examination, tear functions, vital
   staining scores, and the OCT upper and lower TMH parameters were tested
   by Spearman's correlation test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curve technique was used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and
   cutoff values of OCT TMH examination in the diagnosis of dry eye.
   Results: The OCT upper and lower TMH values, slit-lamp TMH, strip
   meniscometry, tear film BUT, and vital staining scores were
   significantly lower in the dry eye patients compared with controls
   (P<0.001). A significant correlation between the OCT upper and lower TMH
   measurements as well as slit-lamp TMH, strip meniscometry, tear
   functions, vital staining scores, and the Schirmer test was found. The
   ROC curve technique analysis of the OCT lower TMH showed that, when the
   cutoff value was set at <0.30 mm, the sensitivity and specificity of the
   testing were 67\% and 81\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The Visante OCT is a quick, noninvasive method for
   assessing the TMH, with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and
   repeatability, and may have potential applications for the diagnosis and
   evaluation of dry eye disease.}},

Abstract = {{Methods In a population-based Swedish cohort comprising 124 203
   singleton males born to Nordic mothers between 1983 and 1988, we
   examined the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and
   the risk of overweight in the offspring at age similar to 18 years. We
   also investigated the association within siblings, controlling for
   common genes and shared environment.
   Results In the cohort analyses, the risk of overweight was increased in
   sons of smoking mothers compared with sons of non-smokers: adjusted odds
   ratios 1.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.49, and 1.56, 95\% CI
   1.46-1.66, for one to nine cigarettes per day, and > 10 cigarettes per
   day, respectively. Stratifying for maternal smoking habits across two
   subsequent male pregnancies, there was an increased risk of overweight
   for the second son only if the mother was smoking in both male
   pregnancies. The effect of smoking during pregnancy on the offspring's
   body mass index was not present when the association was evaluated
   within full and half sibling pairs.
   Conclusion The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and
   offspring's risk of overweight appears to be confounded by familial

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study carried out on the
   deformation of a water surface and the effect water drops have on both
   conducting and dielectric solid surfaces subjected to a 50-Hz-volage
   stress. Also, contained in it are fundamental observations of current
   discharges characterizing water drops and metal electrode configurations
   as well as those configurations resulting from a flat water surface and
   a metal electrode. The measurements taken with both rod and point
   electrodes also came under investigation. The inception field strength
   of partial discharges between water surface and metal electrodes is
   analyzed. The discharge activities between water drops and between a
   conducting water drop and a small rod electrode on a flat hydrophobic
   insulator are also investigated. The results obtained characteristics of
   show typical discharge current during the discharge inception and
   development with and without water filaments, with regard to drop-drop
   and drop-rod configurations on the dielectric solid surface. This
   experimental study provides a better understanding of the processes
   leading up to flashover of hydrophobic insulators through discharges
   between water drops resulting of the distortion of these drops.}},

Abstract = {{The recent crisis highlighted, once again, the importance of early
   warning models to assess the soundness of individual banks. In the
   present study, we use six quantitative techniques originating from
   various disciplines to classify banks in three groups. The first group
   includes very strong and strong banks: the second one includes adequate
   banks, while the third group includes banks with weaknesses or serious
   problems. We compare models developed with financial variables only,
   with models that incorporate additional information in relation to the
   regulatory environment, institutional development, and macroeconomic
   conditions. The accuracy of classification of the models that include
   only financial variables is rather poor. We observe a substantial
   improvement in accuracy when we consider the country-level variables,
   with five out of the six models achieving out-of-sample classification
   accuracy above 70\% on average. The models developed with multi-criteria
   decision aid and artificial neural networks achieve the highest
   accuracies. We also explore the development of stacked models that
   combine the predictions of the individual models at a higher level.
   While the stacked models outperform the corresponding individual models
   in most cases, we found no evidence that the best stacked model can
   outperform the best individual model. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Disrupted eating behaviors and psychological issues can have
   a role in the development of childhood obesity. Aim: To assess the
   effects of psychological support as an adjunct to the treatment of
   obesity among children. Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of
   a group of 152 obese children aged 3 to 16 years, who received medical,
   nutritional and physical training treatment. Seventy three (Group 1)
   were invited to participate in a protocol of psychological support and
   79 formed the control group (Group 2). Body mass index, body fat mass,
   waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, eating and
   physical activity habits were evaluated. Family structure, history of
   food rejection, psychological, physical and social development, and
   adherence to the program were also analyzed. To analyze responses to
   treatment, Group I was further divided into those who attended the
   psychology sections (intervened group) and those who did not attend (non
   intervened group). Results: At baseline, there were no differences in
   anthropometric, metabolic, familial and psychological profile among
   Groups I and 2. Family structure, eating behaviors and physical and
   social development were normal. Those associated with lack of control
   appeared as negative characteristics. There was a significant
   improvement in eating habits and physical activity among intervened
   children of Group 1 and Group 2. No significant change in weight was
   recorded in all three groups. Compliance with the program was
   significantly better among intervened children in Group 1 (62.1\% at
   sixth months), compared with non intervened children of Group 1 (15.9\%)
   and Group 2 (30.3\%). Conclusions: Obese children who attended

   program, had a better compliance with treatment but did not achieve a
   higher weight loss. (Rev Med Chile 2010; 138: 1217-1225).}},

Abstract = {{Iron-crosslinked hyaluronic acid hydrogel (FeHA) has been used to reduce
   postsurgical adhesions in patients undergoing open, gynecological
   surgery. The performance of FeHA gel as an adhesion barrier device is
   influenced by many factors, including the physicochemical gel
   properties, which, in turn, depend on the chemistry and conditions of
   the device manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of
   reaction pH on rheology and homogeneity of FeHA gels formulated in house
   and also compare the viscoelastic properties of FeHA gels with that of
   uncrosslinked HA solution of similar HA concentration and ionic
   strength. Dynamic mechanical analyses provide evidence that the reaction
   of HA with Fe(III) ions leads to the formation of ``weak{''} gels. The
   viscoelastic properties and homogeneity of FeHA gels vary depending on
   the pH at which crosslinking was initiated. When solution pH, at the
   start of crosslinking, varied between 1.5 and 3, the low-shear rate
   viscosity of FeHA varied between 10,000 and 40,000 cPoise (10-40 Pa s).
   The highest steady-state shear viscosity and viscoelasticity were
   measured when pH was around 2.6, which is similar to the pH-dependent
   viscoelasticity of pure HA solution. Initiating HA crosslinking at pH <=
   3 led to relatively homogenous solutions, while crosslinking higher pH >
   3 caused instantaneous gel precipitation and inhomogeneities.
   Sensitivity of FeHA gel properties to small variations in reaction pH
   clearly supports the need for a tight manufacturing control during
   medical device fabrication. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Background: Galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is used as a
   first-line drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However,
   it may have vagotonic effects, which may cause bradycardia and/or heart
   block in patients with or without a history of cardiac disease.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of
   galantamine on electrophysiology and arterial blood pressure in elderly
   patients with AD.
   Methods: From March 2008 through August 2009, consecutive patients >= 65
   years of age were approached for enrollment and underwent a
   comprehensive geriatric assessment. Patients with newly diagnosed AD who
   were enrolled in the study were treated with galantamine
   extended-release capsules using a 2- to 4-week titration schedule. The
   starting dosage was 8 mg once daily. After 2 to 4 weeks on the initial
   dosage, the dosage was increased to 16 mg once daily. After another 2 to
   4 weeks, if galantamine was still well tolerated, the dosage was
   increased to 24 mg once daily. ECG parameters and blood pressure were
   recorded at baseline and at each galantamine dose level (8, 16, and 24
   mg/d); blood pressure was measured once daily. The study lasted similar
   to 4 months after baseline assessment.
   Results: Sixty-four patients with newly diagnosed AD were enrolled in
   the study, 51 of whom completed the study (28 women and 23 men; mean
   age, 78.5 years). No significant changes relative to baseline occurred
   in any of the ECG parameters or arterial blood pressure at any of the
   investigated dosages of galantamine.
   Conclusion: None of the dosages of galantamine investigated in this
   study significantly altered ECG parameters' or arterial blood pressure
   (relative to baseline) in these elderly patients with AD. (Am J Geriatr

Abstract = {{The polymer-anchored Schiff base complexes of Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II),
   Mn(II) and Fe(III) were prepared by reacting polystyrene amine with
   2-pyridinecarbaldehyde followed by loading of metal atom in methanol.
   These complexes were characterized by using different physicochemical
   and spectroscopic methods. The catalytic activity of these
   polymer-supported metal catalysts was tested for the oxidation of
   various olefins and alcohols. Influence of various reaction parameters,
   such as reaction temperature, reaction time, oxidant,
   substrate-to-oxidant mole ratio and nature of solvent, was studied for
   the oxidation of cyclohexene with these catalysts. Among the catalysts
   studied, Cu-Cat showed higher catalytic activity toward oxidation
   reactions than the other catalysts. Moreover, hot filtration experiments
   proved that these catalysts are truly heterogeneous and can be reused a
   number of times without significant loss of activity.}},

Abstract = {{Ion-acoustic double layer structures propagating obliquely to an
   external uniform magnetic field have been considered in a low-beta
   plasma consisting of warm adiabatic ions, non-thermal electrons (due to
   Cairns et al) which generate fast energetic electrons, and electrons
   with a vortex-like distribution (due to Schamel), taking care of both
   free and trapped electrons, immersed in a uniform and static magnetic
   field. A combined Schamel's modified Korteweg-de
   Vries-Zakharov-Kuznetsov (S-KdV-ZK) equation more efficiently describes
   the nonlinear behavior of an ion-acoustic wave when the vortex-like
   velocity distribution function of electrons approaches the isothermal
   velocity distribution function of electrons, i.e. when the contribution
   of trapped electrons tends to zero. This combined S-KdV-ZK equation
   admits a double layer solution. The condition for the existence of this
   double layer solution has been discussed with respect to different
   parameters of the system.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen on tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta)
   levels and ultrastructural changes in rats with spinal cord injury. Rats
   were divided into four groups: control group (laminectomy only), trauma
   group (laminectomy + spinal trauma), tamoxifen group (laminectomy +
   spinal trauma + tamoxifen), and vehicle group (laminectomy + spinal
   trauma + vehicle). Spinal cords were extirpated at the T(7)-T(12) level
   and tissue samples from the spinal cords were gathered for TNF-alpha and
   IL-1 beta measurements at 1 and 6 hours. Spinal cords harvested at 6
   hours were evaluated for ultrastructural changes. TNF-alpha and IL-1
   beta levels at 6 hours were significantly lower in the tamoxifen group
   than in the trauma group. Electron microscopic examination of tissue
   from the trauma group revealed gross cell deformities with widespread
   edema of all structures as well as severe edema in the neuropil. At 6
   hours after trauma, these ultrastructural changes were less marked in
   the tamoxifen group. Our findings support a neuroprotective and
   restorative role for tamoxifen in the context of secondary pathological
   biochemical events after SCI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Highly porous hydroxyapatite (Ca(10)(PO(4))(6)center dot(OH)(2), HA) was
   prepared through hydrothermal transformation of aragonitic cuttlefish
   bones (Sepia officinalis L. Adriatic Sea) in the temperature range from
   140 to 220A degrees C for 20 min to 48 h. The phase composition of
   converted hydroxyapatite was examined by quantitative X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) using Rietveld structure refinement and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR). Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) approach was used to
   follow the kinetics and mechanism of transformation. Diffusion
   controlled one dimensional growth of HA, predominantly along the a-axis,
   could be defined. FTIR spectroscopy determined B-type substitutions of
   CO(3) (2-) groups. The morphology and microstructure of converted HA was
   examined by scanning electron microscopy. The general architecture of
   cuttlefish bones was preserved after hydrothermal treatment and the
   cuttlefish bones retained its form with the same channel size (similar
   to 80 x 300 mu m). The formation of dandelion-like HA spheres with
   diameter from 3 to 8 mu m were observed on the surface of lamellae,
   which further transformed into various radially oriented nanoplates and
   nanorods with an average diameter of about 200-300 nm and an average
   length of about 8-10 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{Honey is a complex mixture of different biologically active
   constituents. Honey possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
   antitumor properties. Our chief investigation was to assess the honey
   induced apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in colon cancer cell
   growth inhibition. Honey exerted antiproliferative potential against the
   HCT-15 and HT-29 colon cancer cells as assessed by 3-(4,
   5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
   Flow cytometric analysis showed the increasing accumulation of
   hypodiploid nuclei in the sub-G(1) phase of cell cycle indicating
   apoptosis. Honey transduced the apoptotic signal via initial depletion
   of intracellular non protein thiols, consequently reducing the
   mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increasing the reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) generation. An increasing earlier lipid layer break
   was observed in the treated cells compared to the control. Honey induced
   apoptosis was accompanied by up-regulating the p53 and modulating the
   expression of pro and anti-apoptotic proteins. Further apoptosis
   induction was substantiated using DNA fragmentation assay and YO-PRO-1
   staining. Results showed honey as a plausible candidate for induction of
   apoptosis through ROS and mitochondria-dependent mechanisms in colon
   cancer cells. This will promote honey as a potential chemotherapeutic
   agent against colon cancer.}},

   time Freedom from secondary aortic intervention was 90\% in AAD and 75\%
   in CAD
   Conclusion This hybrid approach in patients with AAD and CAD type I is
   safe when indicated and renders stable results over time down to the
   stent-graft end Secondary TEVAR can be easily performed downstream when
   necessary The international E-vita open registry data supports this

Abstract = {{Background: This study attempts to define clinical predictors of
   survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (UPA).
   Methods: A retrospective study of 94 consecutive patients diagnosed with
   UPA from 2001 to 2006 was performed. Using data for these patients, a
   symptom score was devised through a forward stepwise Cox proportional
   hazards model based on four weighted criteria: weight loss of > 10\% of
   body weight; pain; jaundice, and smoking. The symptom score was
   subsequently validated in a distinct cohort of 32 patients diagnosed
   with UPA in 2007.
   Results: In the original cohort, the overall median survival was 9.0
   months (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 7.6-10.4). This altered to 10.3
   months (95\% CI 6.1-14.5) in patients with locally advanced disease, and
   6.6 months (95\% CI 4.2-9.0) in patients with distant metastasis. Median
   survival was 14.6 months (95\% CI 13.1-16.1) in patients with a low
   symptom (LS) score and 6.3 months (95\% CI 4.1-8.5) in patients with a
   high symptom (HS) score. A total of 73\% of LS score patients survived
   beyond 9 months, compared with only 38\% of HS score patients (P <
   0.001). The discrimination of the LS score was greater than that of any
   conventional method, including imaging. The validation cohort confirmed
   the discriminative ability of the symptom score for survival.
   Conclusions: A simple and clinically meaningful point-based symptom
   score can successfully predict survival in patients with UPA.}},

Abstract = {{The hair follicle is a complex structure containing many cell types that
   produce highly specialized proteins. These proteins govern the
   continuous cycling of the follicle through its stages of anagen,
   catagen, telogen, and exogen. Most common forms of alopecia result from
   the changes in the follicular cycling pattern and the morphology of the
   hair follicle. Hair restoration has traditionally been performed using
   scalp reduction techniques and the rearrangement of local hair- bearing
   flaps. Over the recent decades, hair transplantation has been the
   mainstay of hair restoration, whereas the pharmacological treatment of
   androgenic alopecia has halted the progression of hair loss. Over recent
   years, significant advances in the understanding of the biology and the
   molecular mechanisms of the follicle and its cycling have been made.
   This understanding, combined with new techniques for delivering
   molecules to the follicle, has made gene therapy for alopecia a
   possibility.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale advective transport through highly heterogeneous 3D
   formations is investigated using highly resolved numerical simulations
   and simple analytic models. Investigations are focused on impacts of two
   types of contaminant injection on transport through isotropic formations
   where flow conditions are uniform in the average. Transport is
   quantified by analyzing breakthrough curves for control planes at
   various distances from the injection zone. In flux-proportional
   injection mode local mass in injection zone is proportional to local
   groundwater flux; this setup models many practical cases such as
   contaminant injection through wells. In resident concentration mode
   local concentration in injection zone is constant. Results show that
   impacts of injection mode on breakthrough curves and their moments are
   strong and they persist for hundreds of correlation scales. The resident
   concentration mode leads to a fatter tails of the breakthrough curves,
   while the peaks are generally underpredicted. For a synthetic porous
   medium with logconductivity variance of 8, dispersivity computed using
   resident concentration mode at control plane 100 integral scales away
   from the injection zone was about 10 times larger than corresponding one
   for flux-proportional mode. Hence, injection mode impacts on transport
   through highly heterogeneous formations are strong and they persist for
   large distances from the injection zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   disease with acute onset and the indefinite and unpredictable course of
   a chronic disease (ii) the different material and social set up of
   clinical and community rehabilitation settings (iii)the influence of

   stratigraphy and micropalaeontology, along a 80 km-long, E/W-oriented
   transect from the western High-Atlas to the present-day coast
   (Taghazoute), show that the Cenomanian Turonian boundary event (CTBE)
   occurred within shallow-water, oyster-bearing limestones and marls, and
   not in the overlying black shale. The age of the laminated shale is
   early Turonian as the planktonic marker Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica
   is found from its first centimetres upward. The underlying deposits
   hosting the CTBE event are bounded by two unconformities interpreted as
   emersion surfaces, and represent the strongest seawardshifts of facies
   in the local Cenomanian sedimentary wedge. The delta C-13 anomaly is
   only recorded in the coastal Taghazoute section, not in other sections
   landward, meaning that the CUBE occurred here during a short
   transgressive phase within an overall regressive trend. The lower
   Turonian black shale of the Taghazoute section is transgressive onto the
   second unconformity and pass landward to white, evenly laminated,
   chert-bearing mudstones, then to bioturbated mudstones in the
   easternmost sections of the transect (western High-Atlas). (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome commonly occurs in patients
   with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is characterized by loss of
   weight and appetite as well as diminished survival. The current study
   explored whether any of 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
   certain previously implicated inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1
   beta, interleukin-1RN, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor) are
   associated with this syndrome.
   All NSCLC patients who had been enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Lung Cancer
   Cohort, had completed a health-related questionnaire approximately 6
   months after enrollment, and had blood drawn were included in this
   study, thus yielding a sample size of 471 patients.
   Sixty-six (14\%) patients manifested weight loss shortly after
   diagnosis, and 152 (32\%) reported appetite loss. Only tumor necrosis
   factor alpha rs800629 was associated with anorexia (odds ratio: 0.46;
   95\% confidence interval: 0.29, 0.72; p < 0.001); patients who were
   heterozygous and minor homozygous were less likely to suffer anorexia.
   Otherwise, there were no statistically significant associations between
   any of the other 21 SNPs and weight loss and/or anorexia. In univariate
   analyses, weight loss, anorexia, more advanced cancer stage, and
   interleukin-1 beta rs1143627 were associated with a worse survival, and
   interleukin-6 rs2069835 was associated with better survival. However, in
   multivariate analyses, cancer stage and patient age were the only
   statistically significant predictors of worse survival.
   No specific SNP was associated with all aspects of the cancer
   anorexia/weight loss syndrome, but rs800629 may merit further study in
   cancer-associated anorexia.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the effects of traffic noise on hearing ability of
   subjects prone to traffic noise exposure.
   Method: A hospital based prospective study was performed comprising of
   200 selected subjects significantly exposed to traffic noise. These
   included rickshaw drivers, traffic constables and shopkeepers in central
   business area. All subjects were questioned according to a Performa
   after which ENT examination was carried out followed by Pure Tone
   Audiometery.
   Results: Hearing impairment showed correlation with the duration of job
   when analyzed by linear regression analysis with correlation coefficient
   r=0.36 (p<0.001), Hearing impairment was 33.81+0.42 dB according to the
   duration of job (in years).
   Conclusion: Subjects are perceptually exposed to potentially damaging
   sound pressure level in the metropolis of Karachi. It was observed that
   audiologically consistent noise induced hearing loss was found to be
   0.42 dB per octave from 500Hz to2000Hz per year of duration of job (JPMA
   60:813; 2010).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the hydrogenation properties of two
   compositions of Ni-Nb-Zr-Ta amorphous ribbons. The importance of the
   alloy composition, particularly the role of Zr, in determining the
   stability of the structure, hydrogenation kinetics and mechanical
   properties are brought out. It was observed that the partial replacement
   of Zr by Nb in the Ni42Nb28Zr25Ta5 amorphous alloy induced a reduction
   of the hydrogen absorption kinetics, a larger dilatation of the
   amorphous structure and a lower value of hydrogen permeability for
   temperature larger than 450 degrees C. These properties are interpreted
   based on the possible occupation sites of hydrogen atoms in structural
   models recently proposed for these Ni-Nb-Zr-based amorphous alloys. (C)

Title = {{A new way of relating: perceptions associated with a team-based error

Abstract = {{Background Despite the call for open and team-based approaches to error
   disclosure, the participation beyond physicians and managers is not a
   common practice in health care settings. Moreover, within the growing
   literature base on error disclosure, team-based error disclosure is an
   emerging concept. To address this knowledge gap, a study was undertaken
   to explore the perceptions associated with an educational simulation
   intervention for team-based error disclosure.
   Methods A qualitative study that involved analysis of data obtained from
   semi-structured interviews with a sample of 6 physicians, 6 surgeons,
   and 12 nurses recruited from the three participating hospitals.
   Results Perceptions from study participants elucidated a tension between
   team-based error disclosure as an unrealistic, forced practice and as a
   realistic, beneficial practice. This tension was highly contextual and
   differentiated by study participants' perceptions of the nature of the
   error; patient's preferences; and prevailing cultural and professional
   norms. Regardless of the view, study participants described the
   simulation experience as a new way of relating that departed from
   existing practice.
   Conclusions Study findings revealed that a team-based approach to
   disclosure is not realistic or necessary for all error situations, such
   as when the error involves a single discipline. However, when the error
   involves a variety of health care professionals interacting with the
   patient, a team-based approach is beneficial to them and the patient.
   Further work is required by researchers and administrators to develop
   and test out interventions that enable health care professionals to
   practice team-based error disclosure in a safe and supported
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is widespread recognition of the importance of
   angiogenesis in tissue repair, there is little work on the inhibition of
   angiogenesis in the context of tissue engineering of naturally avascular
   tissues, like articular cartilage. The objective was to engineer a
   collagen-scaffold-based cartilaginous construct overexpressing a potent
   antiangiogenic factor, endostatin, using nonviral transfection.
   Endostatin-plasmid-supplemented collagen scaffolds were seeded with
   mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes and cultured for 20-22 days. The
   effects of the following variables on endostatin expression and
   chondrogenesis were examined: collagen scaffold material, method of
   nonviral vector incorporation, plasmid load, culture medium, and oxygen
   tension. An increase and peak of endostatin protein was observed during
   the first week of culture, followed by a decrease to low levels,
   suggesting that overexpression of endostatin could be sustained for
   several days using the nonviral vector. The amount of endostatin
   produced was tunable with the external factors. Chondrogenesis was
   observed in the engineered constructs cultured in chondrogenic medium at
   the 3-week time point, demonstrating that endostatin did not inhibit the
   chondrogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells or the general
   viability of the cells. The ability to engineer endostatin-expressing
   cartilaginous constructs will be of value for future work exercising
   regulatory control of angiogenesis in cartilage repair.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of acute fixation strength of absorbable and nonabsorbable
   barrier coated mesh secured with fibrin sealant}},
Journal = {{HERNIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute fixation strength of
   fibrin sealant as an alternative fixation method for laparoscopic
   ventral hernia repair (LVHR) when utilized with absorbable and
   nonabsorbable barrier meshes.
   Representative mesh types for LVHR included one nonabsorbable barrier
   mesh (Bard(A (R))Composix (TM)) and three absorbable barrier meshes
   (Sepramesh (TM), Proceed (TM), and Parietex (TM) Composite Mesh).
   Macroporous polypropylene mesh (Prolite Ultra (TM)) served as a control.
   An associated pilot study demonstrated that acute fixation was not
   achieved with C-Qur (TM) or Dualmesh(A (R)), thus these meshes were not
   subjected to further analysis. Two fibrin sealants varying in thrombin
   concentration (TISSEEL (TM) 500 IU/ml or ARTISS (TM) 4 IU/ml) were each
   utilized to secure a 3 x 4 cm piece of mesh to the peritoneal surface of
   harvested abdominal wall from New Zealand white rabbits. Ten samples
   were prepared for each mesh and fibrin sealant combination. The
   resulting mesh-tissue interface (3 x 3 cm) underwent lap shear testing
   at a rate of 0.42 mm/s using a tensiometer (Instron 5542, Norwood, MA).
   The maximum load sustained by the construct was recorded as the acute
   fixation strength in units of Newtons (N). Data are given as means +/- A
   SEM. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined using a two-way
   ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test.
   There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the acute fixation
   strength achieved by ARTISS (TM) versus TISSEEL (TM) with Composix (TM),
   Sepramesh (TM), Proceed (TM), and Parietex (TM) Composite Mesh. However,
   Prolite Ultra (TM) fixed with ARTISS (TM) (7.099 +/- A 1.01 N) had a
   significantly higher tensile strength (P < 0.001) than Prolite Ultra
   (TM) fixed with TISSEEL (TM) (3.405 +/- A 0.72 N). Among meshes fixed
   with TISSEEL (TM), Parietex (TM) Composite (3.936 +/- A 0.73 N) was
   significantly stronger than Sepramesh (TM) (1.760 +/- A 0.33 N) (P <
   0.05).
   Acute fixation strength is equivalent for TISSEEL (TM) and ARTISS (TM)
   fibrin sealants for selected nonabsorbable (Composix (TM)) and
   absorbable barrier-coated (Sepramesh (TM), Proceed (TM), and Parietex
   (TM) Composite Mesh) meshes. Previous evaluations in this model
   indicated fibrin sealant alone did not appear to be a suitable method of
   fixation with C-Qur (TM) or DualMesh(A (R)) against the peritoneum.
   Long-term evaluation is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this method
   of fixation using absorbable and nonabsorbable barrier-coated meshes in
   a model of LVHR.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3037-3046}},

Abstract = {{The range of ecological roles exhibited by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   fungi depends on functional differences among naturally occurring local
   assemblages of AM species. While functional differences have been
   demonstrated among AM fungal species and among geographic isolates of
   the same species, almost nothing is known about functional differences
   among whole communities of naturally occurring AM fungi. In the
   greenhouse, we reciprocally transplanted whole AM fungal communities
   between plant-soil systems representing a serpentine grassland and a
   tallgrass prairie, using as hosts two grasses common to both systems.
   For Sorghastrum nutans, native fungi consistently enhanced plant growth
   more than fungi switched from the alternate system. For Schizachyrium
   scoparium, foreign and native fungi promoted plant growth similarly in
   both the serpentine and prairie systems. Thus, the use of foreign
   inoculum in restoration could change the relative performance, and
   potentially the competitive abilities, of co-occurring plant species.
   Moving AM fungal inocula into foreign environments also caused changes
   in the taxonomic composition of the resultant spore communities,
   demonstrating their response to environmental influences. These results
   provide strong evidence for functional differences among naturally
   occurring AM communities and suggest that a particular AM fungal
   community may be better matched ecologically to its local habitat than
   communities taken from other locations.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sox2 is a key transcription factor for embryonic development and plays a
   critical role in determining the fate of stem cells. Recently, Sox2 has
   been detected in several human tumors, indicating a potential function
   in tumorigenesis. We initially reported remarkably increased nuclear
   Sox2 staining in cervical carcinomas compared with normal cervix (P <
   .05). Furthermore, Sox2 staining was detected in most tumorsphere cells
   isolated from fresh cervical cancer tissues but not among the
   differentiated tumorsphere cells. When Sox2 was stably expressed in
   cervical cancer cells (SiHa and HeLa), Sox2-overexpressing cells had
   increased proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity in vitro and

Abstract = {{Novel core shell structures were presented here which consist of
   Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microspheres as cores and gold as
   shells. The fabrication of these structures was convenient because the
   modifications to PNIPAM or gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were omitted. GNPs
   were attached to the surface of PNIPAM microspheres by means of
   electrostatic adsorption, and then acted as seeds to grow quickly into
   complete shells by optimizing the pH of the HAuCl4 solution to control
   the growth rate of gold nanoshells (GNSs). These structures combine the
   thermo-responsive behavior of PNIPAM microspheres with optical property
   of GNSs, and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the GNSs
   can be changed by adjusting the temperature of the PNIPAM microspheres
   which make them have great prospects for drug release. Their good
   biological stability in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the LSPR located
   near 700 nm are expected for optical biosensors and optical analysis of
   whole-blood.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily plays a key role in the oxidative
   metabolism of a wide range of exogenous chemicals. CYP2C8 is the
   principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug
   paclitaxel in the human liver, and carries out the oxidative metabolism
   of at least 5\% of clinical drugs. Polymorphisms in CYP2C8 have been
   closely implicated in individualized medication. CYP2C8.3, a common
   polymorph of CYP2C8 with dual amino acid substitutions R139K and K399R,
   is found primarily in Caucasians. In this study, CYP2C8.3 and its wild
   type (WT) CYP2C8 were expressed in E. coli, and their purified proteins
   were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and
   circular dichroism. Their thermal stability, substrate binding ability,
   and metabolic activity against paclitaxel were investigated. The
   electron transfer kinetics during paclitaxel metabolism by WT CYP2C8 or
   CYP2C8.3 was studied by stopped-flow kinetics. The results revealed that
   mutations in CYP2C8.3 did not greatly influence the heme active site or
   protein thermal stability and paclitaxel binding ability, but the
   metabolic activity against paclitaxel was significantly depressed to
   just 11\% of that of WT CYP2C8. Electron transfer from CYP reductase to
   CYP2C8.3 was found to be significantly slower than that to WT CYP2C8
   during catalysis, and this might be the main reason for the depressed
   metabolic activity. Since the polymorph CYP2C8.3 is defective in
   catalyzing substrates of CYP2C8 in vitro, it might be expected to have
   important clinical and pathophysiological consequences in homozygous
   individuals, and this study provides valuable information in this
   aspect.}},

Journal = {{CELL PROLIFERATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{464-470}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:
   Age-related changes are common in many tissues and organs. However,
   cell-related causes in human alveolar bone remain unclear. This study
   has been carried out to explore the possibility that advancing age might
   change the biological characteristics of alveolar osteoblasts (AOBs) in
   women.
   Materials and methods:
   Alveolar osteoblasts from women donors (five women aged 33-38 years and
   five women aged 62-68 years) were cultured in vitro. The cells were
   serially passaged and maximal lifespan evaluated. Cell viability,
   ultramicrostructure and osteogenic differentiation ability were
   determined respectively, using MTT assay, transmission electron
   microscopy, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and von Kossa
   staining assay. These parameters of the two groups of AOBs were
   evaluated.
   Results:
   When compared with cells from young adult donors, AOBs from elderly
   women exhibited lower maximal lifespan (P < 0.05). Mean rate of
   population doubling was lower in elderly donor cells compared to those
   from young adult cells (P < 0.05). Organelles from AOBs of elderly
   donors were much fewer than those from young donors. MTT value of
   elderly donor cells was significantly lower than those of young adult
   donors from day 2 (P < 0.05). Relative ratio of ALP activity in elderly
   donor cells was significantly lower than those of the young womens'
   cells at 8, 12, 16 and 20 days (P < 0.05). Calcium nodules of young
   adult donors' specimens were significantly more numerous and larger than
   those from elderly donors.
   Conclusions:
   Comparison of biological characteristics of AOBs from young adult women
   with those from elderly women in vitro revealed differences in
   proliferative capacity and bone formation functions, which decreased
   with aging. These data indicate that aging may play an important role in
   pathogenesis of human AOBs loss.}},

Abstract = {{Hemispheric ratios of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), a proven
   methodology for the detection of severe hemodynamic impairment and
   stroke risk, are not sensitive for detecting bilateral hemispheric
   increases in OEF. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of
   cerebellum as the reference normal. We analyzed positron emission
   tomographic (PET) measurements of count-based OEF and clinical data from
   57 patients with unilateral atherosclerotic carotid occlusion and 13
   controls enrolled in a prospective study of stroke risk. The
   ipsilateral, contralateral, and total cerebellum were each evaluated as
   possible reference regions, and the ratios of the middle cerebral artery
   (MCA) hemispheric OEF counts against those in each reference region were
   determined. A statistically significant correlation (P < 0.0001) was
   observed with all three MCA-to-cerebellar ratios when compared with the
   gold standard of ipsilateral-to-contralateral MCA hemispheric ratio.
   Kaplan-Meier analyses showed all MCA-to-cerebellar ratios to be
   predictive of stroke. By using the total cerebellum method, 7 strokes
   were found to have occurred in 20 patients with increased OEF (P =
   0.0007), compared with 7 strokes out of 16 patients with elevated OEF
   using the ipsilateral or contralateral cerebellum methods (P < 0.0001).
   These methods may be useful for categorizing the hemodynamic status of
   patients with bilateral cerebral occlusive diseases, including
   atherosclerosis and moyamoya, to determine the association with the risk
   of subsequent stroke. Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow \& Metabolism

Abstract = {{This study assessed the protective efficacy of oral vaccination with 2
   experimental attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium-vectored vaccines for
   necrotic enteritis in protecting chickens against intestinal
   colonization by common serovars of Salmonella belonging to the 4 major
   serogroups affecting chickens. Birds were vaccinated orally with 1 x
   10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) of 1 of the vaccine strains chi 9241
   and chi 9352, which express a plasmid-encoded partial recombinant
   hypothetical protein gene (tHP) of Clostridium perfringens, at days 1
   and 7 of age, and then were challenged at 14 d of age with 10(6) CFU of
   Salmonella serovars Anatum, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Kentucky, or
   Typhimurium (representative serovars of serogroups B, C, D, and E).
   Birds were necropsied at 4 wk of age, and samples were collected to
   determine reduction in tissue and intestinal colonization. The chickens
   vaccinated with chi 9241-tHP showed reduced colonization by Salmonella
   Enteritidis (serogroup D) and by Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella
   Typhimurium (serogroup B) compared with the control birds. No reduction
   in colonization was observed in the chickens vaccinated with chi
   9352-tHP. There was an association between the efficacy of these vaccine
   strains in protecting against necrotic enteritis, assessed on an earlier
   occasion, and their efficacy in protecting against Salmonella
   colonization. Thus, the choice of an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium
   vaccine vector for delivery of heterologous antigens to chickens should
   be based partly on the vaccine's value in protecting against
   colonization by serovars within serogroups B and D. Such vectors would
   have the additional benefit of reducing colonization of important
   Salmonella serovars.}},

   that ZnO:Ga is a reasonably good candidate for detecting low energy (E <

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{To obtain insights into the cytoplasmic maturation status of cat oocytes
   recovered from cat ovaries following hormone treatment, we first
   examined microtubule and microfilament assembly in cat oocytes recovered
   from hormone-treated ovaries at various stages of maturation.
   Additionally, we determined the alteration of spindle and microfilament
   assembly, as well as mitogen-acitvated protein kinase (MAPK) activity,
   in cat oocytes at 0, 6, 12 and 18 h of further maturation in vitro. We
   then looked at pronuclear formation and cleavage of these oocytes
   following parthenogenetic activation. Similar to other species,
   microtubules are present in germinal vesicle (GV) stage cat oocytes, and
   following GV breakdown, microtubules encompassed condensed chromatin
   particles to form the meiotic metaphase spindle. Microfilaments were
   located in the cortex and around the GV. A microfilament-rich area, in
   which the chromatin is located, was observed in the oocytes during
   meiotic maturation. Maturation rates in aged oocytes (cultured for 18 h)
   were increased when compared with that in relatively fresh oocytes ( <
   12 h culture), and the number of oocytes with abnormal spindle shapes
   was also increased in aged oocytes. Furthermore, in aged oocytes, the
   incidence of the metaphase plate observed outside the thick
   microfilament domain was higher compared with that of young oocytes, and
   this seemed to result in an increase in the number of oocytes with two
   pronuclei and one polar body following activation. Western blot analysis
   revealed a decrease in MAPK activity in aged cat oocytes. Taken
   collectively, these results suggest that the optimum time for improved
   cytoplasmic maturation is < 12 h in cat oocytes recovered from
   hormone-treated ovaries.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the possibility of using fractionated radiation in a unique
   way with molecular targeted therapy, gene expression profiles of
   prostate carcinoma cells treated with 10 Gy radiation administered
   either as a single dose or as fractions of 2 Gy X 5 and 1 Gy X 10 were
   examined by microarray analysis. Compared to the single dose, the
   fractionated irradiation resulted in significant increases in
   differentially expressed genes in both cell lines, with more robust
   changes in PC3 cells than in DU145 cells. The differentially expressed
   genes (>twofold change; P < 0.05) were clustered and their ontological
   annotations evaluated. In PC3 cells genes regulating immune and stress
   response, cell cycle and apoptosis were significantly up-regulated by
   multifractionated radiation compared to single-dose radiation. Ingenuity
   Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the differentially expressed genes revealed
   that immune response and cardiovascular genes were in the top functional
   category in PC3 cells and cell-to-cell signaling in DU145 cells. RT-PCR
   analysis showed that a flexure point for gene expression occurred at the
   6th-8th fraction and AKT inhibitor perifosine produced enhanced cell
   killing after 1 Gy x 8 fractionated radiation in PC3 and DU145 cells
   compared to single dose. This study suggests that fractionated radiation
   may be a uniquely exploitable, non-oncogene-addiction stress pathway for
   molecular therapeutic targeting. (C) 2010 by Radiation Research Society}},

Abstract = {{The combined metabolic and thermoregulatory demands of exercise in the
   heat place an exceptional burden on the circulation, more than can be
   met through cardiac output and blood flow redistribution. Blood flow to
   muscle is not reduced by heat stress in exercise and cardiac output is
   insufficient to meet competing demands from skin and muscle. Skin blood
   flow during exercise in the heat is limited in several ways. Dynamic
   exercise causes a cutaneous vasoconstriction at exercise onset through
   increased vasoconstrictor activity, both in cool and warm conditions. As
   exercise continues, internal temperature reaches a threshold for
   increased active vasodilator activity that is elevated by exercise, but
   reduced by high skin temperature. Beyond that threshold, skin blood flow
   is limited well below what would be achieved at rest with the same
   thermal drive through a limit to the active vasodilator system. This
   combination of restraints on cutaneous vasodilator function compromises
   temperature regulation. Internal temperature rises to levels that limit
   exercise through central thermal effects, rather than loss of blood
   pressure or a reduction in blood flow to active muscle.}},

Title = {{Genotype and temperature affect locomotor performance in a tiger

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Anthropogenic environmental changes have the capacity to disrupt
   natural population dynamics. For amphibians with complex life cycles, it
   is important to understand how environmental perturbations interact with
   variation in larval period duration to affect the timing of dispersal
   and the abiotic conditions under which terrestrial movements occur.
   2. Widespread hybridization between California tiger salamanders and
   introduced tiger salamanders has created a situation in which length of
   larval development and metamorphic timing varies because of extrinsic
   variation in abiotic factors such as temperature, and also as a result
   of individual-specific variation in genomic admixture.
   3. We examined how line-cross type (e.g. F1, F2, backcrosses, etc.),
   morphology and temperature interact to affect the performance of
   emigrating immature salamanders. We performed endurance trials on a
   mechanized treadmill to simulate dispersal following metamorphosis. Our
   study provides insights into the interaction of environmental change and
   genomic composition on locomotor performance and the spread of the
   hybrid swarm.
   4. We found that temperature had a significant positive impact on
   endurance, potentially making it an important factor driving dispersal
   distances in the wild. Line-cross type also affected performance, with
   F1 hybrids demonstrating the greatest movement capacity. However, we did
   not observe an interaction between line-cross type and temperature.
   5. These results demonstrate that an increase in ambient temperature may
   enhance the dispersal ability of hybrid individuals and accelerate the
   spread of the hybrid swarm. An increase in the rate of introgression of
   non-native tiger salamander alleles into formerly pure native habitats
   places enhanced importance on the proper management of populations near
   the boundary of the hybrid swarm and emphasizes the need for management
   actions that prevent the intentional or accidental translocation of
   non-native species.}},

Abstract = {{Decadal-scale changes in the meridional circulation of the Southern
   Ocean south of Australia are studied, over the period 1958-2005, using
   Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis data. Upper Circumpolar
   Deep Water (UCDW) is found to upwell nearer to the surface over time,
   while the mixed layer (ML) is found to deepen, leading to an increase in
   the number of times that UCDW intrudes into the ML. This entrainment of
   nutrients, especially iron, into the ML from UCDW, is crucial for
   primary production and appears to occur predominantly in summer/autumn,
   contrary to previous reports.
   ML temperature, density and salinity all show increasing trends in
   almost all seasons and latitudinal zones within the study region. A
   notable exception to the general increase in temperature occurs in the
   most southerly zone 60-65 S in summer. An explanation for this apparent
   anomaly could be related to increased winds (in conjunction with the
   increasing trend in the Southern Annular Mode), which mix remnant winter
   water into the ML, negating the surface temperature increase.
   Unlike trends in ML variables, trends in UCDW variables appear to be
   decoupled from the surface trends and occur on time-scales that may be
   centennial rather than decadal.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate the between- and within-dog repeatability of a
   flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) measurement technique in healthy dogs.
   Animals-43 male and female dogs of various breeds (weight range, 6.9 to
   31.7 kg; age range, 11 months to 11 years).
   Procedures-5 dogs were used to refine the technique; other dogs were
   classified as large (> 15 kg) or small (<= 15 kg) before use in the main
   study. In each dog, a brachial artery was occluded for 5 minutes by
   inflating a blood pressure cuff (applied pressure was more than 50 mm Hg
   greater than that required to occlude flow). Two-dimensional
   ultrasonographic images of the artery were recorded during a 30-second
   period prior to cuff inflation (baseline) and during a 3-minute period
   after cuff deflation by each of 2 sonographers. Relative percentage
   increases in luminal size from baseline (ie, FMD) were calculated.
   Independent contributing factors to FMD (eg, body weight, age, and room
   temperature) were assessed.
   Results-Median FMD was significantly greater in small dogs (77\%; range,
   0\% to 19.3\%) than it was in large dogs (2.2\%; range, -2.2\% to
   10.6\%); values were significantly greater in dogs < 6 years old,
   compared with dogs >= 6 years old. Weight was the only independent
   contributing factor for FMD. Coefficients of variation for between- and
   within-dog repeatability were 99.7\% and 62.8\%, respectively.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Application of the FMD measurement
   technique used in humans appears to be feasible in dogs and may provide
   a means of assessing canine endothelial function, although between and
   within-dog variations were large. (Am J Vet Res 2010;71:1154-1161)}},

Abstract = {{Riparian ecosystems are important elements in landscapes that often
   provide a disproportionately wide range of ecosystem services and
   conservation benefits. Their protection and restoration have been one of
   the top environmental management priorities across the US over the last
   several years. Despite the level of concern, visibility and management
   effort, little is known about trends in riparian habitats. Moreover,
   little is known about whether or not cumulative efforts to restore and
   protect riparian zones and floodplains are affecting the rates of
   riparian habitat change nationwide. To address these issues, we analyzed
   riparian land cover change between the early 1970s and the late
   1990s/early 2000s using existing spatial data on hydrography and land
   cover. This included an analysis of land cover changes within 180 m
   riparian buffer zones, and at catchment scales, for 42,363 catchments
   across 63 ecoregions of the continental US. The total amount of forest
   and natural land cover (forests, shrublands, wetlands) in riparian
   buffers declined by 0.7 and 0.9\%, respectively across the entire study
   period. Gains in grassland/shrubland accounted for the 0.2\% lower
   percentage of total natural land cover loss relative to forests.
   Conversely, urban and developed land cover (urban, agriculture, and
   mechanically disturbed lands) increased by more than 1.3\% within
   riparian buffers across the entire study period. Despite these changes,
   we documented an opposite trend of increasing proportions of natural and
   forest land cover in riparian buffers versus the catchment scale. We
   surmise that this trend might reflect a combination of natural recovery
   and cumulative efforts to protect riparian ecosystems across the US.
   However, existing models limit our ability to assess the impacts of
   these changes on specific ecosystem services. We discuss the
   implications of changes observed in this study on the sustainability of
   ecosystem services. We also recommend opportunties for future riparian
   change assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The first aim of this study was to translate the Neck Pain and
   Disability Scale (NPAD) from English into Dutch producing the NPAD-Dutch
   Language Version (DLV). The second aim was to analyze test-retest
   reliability and agreement of the NPAD-DLV and the Neck Disability Index
   (NDI)-DLV. The NPAD was translated according to established guidelines.
   Thirty-four patients (mean age 37.5 years, 68\% female) with chronic
   neck pain (CNP), within an outpatient rehabilitation setting,
   participated in this study. The NPAD-DLV and the NDI-DLV were filled out
   twice with a mean test-retest interval of 18 days. The intraclass
   correlation coefficient of the NPAD-DLV was 0.76 (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 0.57-0.87) and of the NDI-DLV 0.84 (95\% CI 0.69-0.92).
   The limits of agreement of the NPAD-DLV and the NDI-DLV were,
   respectively, +/- 20.9 (scale 0-100) and +/- 6.5 (scale 0-50). The
   reliability of the NPAD-DLV and the NDI-DLV was acceptable for patients
   with CNP. The variation ('instability') in the NPAD-DLV total scores was
   relatively large and larger than the variation of the NDI-DLV.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Sexual dysfunction occurs frequently in patients with schizophrenia.
   Aim.
   To assess the sexual function of institutionalized patients with
   schizophrenia and compare it to both that of noninstitutionalized
   schizophrenic patients as well as patients without any mental illness.
   Methods.
   A cross-sectional comparative analysis between three groups: Group A: 75
   patients with schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder according to
   the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10)
   criteria, admitted into public psychiatric residential facilities; Group
   B: 41 patients with the same diagnosis who live in the community; Group
   C: 152 patients with no mental illness attended to by a Primary Care
   Medical Center.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Positive and Negative
   Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia and Changes in Sexual Function
   Questionnaire were used to complete the study.
   Results.
   When institutionalized patients were compared to the control group, the
   impairment of sexual function was identified in all areas except Arousal
   in women and the percentage of dysfunction in Desire-Interest for both
   sexes. The results for noninstitutionalized schizophrenic males
   indicated a deficit in Pleasure and Orgasm and in Pleasure and
   Desire-Frequency for females, when compared with the control group. The
   overall subscale indicated that 71.2\% of males and 57.1\% of females in
   the institutionalized group experienced sexual dysfunction compared with
   10\% of males and 50\% of females in the noninstitutionalized group, and
   only 12.7\% of women in the control group.
   Conclusions.
   Most areas of sexual function are impaired among patients with
   schizophrenia, especially among institutionalized patients. However,
   their percentage of sexual dysfunction associated with sexual thoughts
   or fantasies was similar to that of patients without mental illness.

Abstract = {{Objective: Police officers were hypothesized to have decreased
   endothelial function, measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation
   (FMD). Methods: We compared FMD in police officers (n = 261) and a
   population sample of men and women (n = 229), all from the same
   geographical region and free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Results: Compared with the population sample, police officers had
   significantly increased age-adjusted CVD risk factors (systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking prevalence, and
   alcohol consumption). Police officers exhibited lower mean FMD after
   adjustment for age, gender, and traditional CVD risk factors among those
   aged 55 years or younger (\%dilation: police = 5.49\%, population =
   6.49\%; P = 0.04). Conclusions: Police officers exhibited decreased
   endothelial function (lower FMD) compared with the civilian sample,
   which was not fully explained by traditional CVD risk factors,
   suggesting that other pathways may contribute to increased CVD risk in
   law enforcement work.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of sintering temperature for NiO-Fe2O3 composite oxide
   substrate was studied in order to obtain a dense substrate with smooth
   surface. By in situ reduction, the substrate was changed to a porous
   Ni-Fe alloy metal. The volumetric shrinkage and porosity of the
   substrate were also studied systematically with the Ni-Fe substrate
   reduced at different temperatures. A Sr and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) thin
   film was prepared on dense substrate by the pulsed laser deposition
   (PLD) method. The LSGM film with stoichiometric composition was
   successfully prepared under optimal deposition parameters and a target
   composition. Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC55) cathode was prepared by the slurry
   coating method on the deposited film. Prepared SOFC single cell shows
   high power density and the maximum power density (MPD) achieved was
   1.79, 0.82 and 0.29 W cm(-2) at 973, 873 and 773K, respectively. After
   thermal cycle from 973 to 298K. the cell shows almost theoretical open
   circuit potential (1.1 V) and the power density of 1.62W cm(-2), which
   is almost the same as that at first cycles. Therefore, the Ni-Fe porous
   metal support made by the selective reduction is highly promising as a
   metal anode substrate for SOFC using LaGaO3 thin film. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by a disability to
   produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) caused by a defect of
   phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. A
   hyperinflammatory response to immune activation has been reported to
   contribute to the pathology of CGD. The tryptophan catabolizing enzyme
   indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is considered critical for regulating
   immune responses and suppression of inflammation. IDO is generally
   believed to require ROI for enzymatic activity and was found to be
   inactive in murine CGD. Here, we report that, strikingly, in human CGD
   IDO metabolic activity is intact. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells
   generated from CGD patients, harbouring X-linked and autosomal recessive
   forms of CGD, and from healthy controls produced similar amounts of the
   tryptophan metabolite kynurenine upon activation with lipopolysaccharide
   and interferon-gamma. Thus, in humans, ROI apparently are dispensable
   for IDO activity. Hyperinflammation in human CGD cannot be attributed to
   disabled IDO activation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Immature platelet fraction (IPF, \%) is a measure of
   reticulated platelets (RPs), which represents the state of
   thrombopoiesis. The IPF is obtained from an automated hematology
   analyzer as one of the platelet parameters. This study was performed to
   establish reference intervals of IPF and its cut-off values for the
   differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.
   Methods: Blood samples from 2,039 healthy individuals (1,161 males, 878
   females) were obtained to establish reference intervals. The patient
   group included patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
   (N = 150) and aplastic anemia (AA) (N = 51) with platelet counts of less
   than 100 x 10(9)/L. We evaluated the reliability of the IPF
   measurements, the reference intervals, and cut-off value for the
   diagnosis of ITP.
   Results: The reference intervals of IPF were 0.5-3.2\% in males and
   0.4-3.0\% in females (95\% confidence interval). The median IPF\% of ITP
   and AA were 7.7\% (range, 1.0-33.8\%) and 3.5\% (range, 0.6-12.9\%),
   respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference
   between the IPF\% of ITP and AA (P<0.0001). The cut-off value of IPF for
   differentiating ITP from AA was 7.3\% with a sensitivity and specificity
   of 54.0\% and 92.2\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: A rapid and inexpensive automated measurement of IPF can be
   integrated as a standard parameter to evaluate the thrombopoietic state
   of the bone marrow. This study determined the reference intervals of IPF
   from a large population of healthy individuals, including children.
   Further studies are needed to establish the clinical utility of IPF.

Abstract = {{Rationale: Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is widely used in the
   treatment and prevention of vascular atherothrombosis. Cardiovascular
   doses of aspirin also reduce systemic blood pressure and improve
   endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in patients with atherosclerosis or
   risk factors for atherosclerosis. Aspirin can acetylate proteins, other
   than its pharmacological target cyclooxygenase, at lysine residues. The
   role of lysine acetylation in mediating the effects of low-dose aspirin
   on the endothelium is not known.
   Objective: To determine the role of lysine acetylation of endothelial
   nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the regulation of endothelial NO
   production by low-dose aspirin and to examine whether the lysine
   deacetylase histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 antagonizes the effect of
   low-dose aspirin on endothelial NO production by reversing acetylation
   of functionally critical eNOS lysine residues.
   Methods and Results: Low concentrations of aspirin induce lysine
   acetylation of eNOS, stimulating eNOS enzymatic activity and endothelial
   NO production in a cyclooxygenase-1-independent fashion. Low-dose
   aspirin in vivo also increases bioavailable vascular NO in an
   eNOS-dependent and cyclooxygenase-1-independent manner. Low-dose aspirin
   promotes the binding of eNOS to calmodulin. Lysine 609 in the calmodulin
   autoinhibitory domain of bovine eNOS mediates aspirin-stimulated binding
   of eNOS to calmodulin and eNOS-derived NO production. HDAC3 inhibits
   aspirin-stimulated (1) lysine acetylation of eNOS, (2) eNOS enzymatic
   activity, (3) eNOS-derived NO, and (4) binding of eNOS to calmodulin.
   Conversely, downregulation of HDAC3 promotes lysine acetylation of eNOS
   and endothelial NO generation.
   Conclusions: Lysine acetylation of eNOS is a posttranslational protein
   modification supporting low-dose aspirin-induced vasoprotection. HDAC3,
   by deacetylating aspirin-acetylated eNOS, antagonizes aspirin-stimulated
   endothelial production of NO. (Circ Res. 2010;107:877-887.)}},

Abstract = {{A shape memory polymer wire for orthodontic application was prepared by
   melt-spinning of polyurethane block copolymer (PU) which was synthesized
   in a two-step process from a reaction of 4,4'-methylene
   bis(phenylisocyanate), poly(epsilon-caprolactone)diol (PCL), and
   1,4-butanediol. An orthodontic test using the PU wire was carried out in
   an orthodontic model with a metal bracket. High shape recovery force of
   70 gf for PU wire at 40 wt\% hard segment content could be preserved for
   even 1 month after a shape recovery force test at a constant temperature
   of 50A degrees C. The shape recovery force decreased exponentially
   during the initial 2 h, but reached an equilibrium shape recovery force
   of 50 gf after about 20 days. It was found that this shape recovery
   force was sufficient to correct misaligned teeth in the orthodontic
   test. The shape memory PU wire possesses strong potential as a novel
   orthodontic appliance with esthetically appealing appearance.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event Driven
   Architecture (EDA) are two acknowledged architectures for the
   development of business applications and information systems, which have
   evolved separately over the years.
   Objective: This paper proposes a solution for extending the SOA/Web
   Services Platform Architecture (WSPA) with support for business events
   and EDA concepts. Our solution enables services to act as event
   producers and event consumers. It also enables event-driven service
   orchestrations in business processes.
   Method: Based on a comparison of SOA and EDA, we have identified and
   designed the required extensions to enable support for events and
   event-driven process orchestration in WSPA.
   Results: We propose specific extensions to WSDL and BPEL, and a flexible
   XML representation of the event payload data. We introduce event sinks,
   sources, and triggers to WSDL. We extend BPEL with new activities to
   trigger and catch events, and extend fault and event handlers,
   variables, and correlation properties to accommodate events.
   Conclusion: As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype
   implementation and assessed the extensions on three pilot projects. We
   have shown that our proposed extensions work on real projects and that
   combining event-driven and service-oriented semantics makes sense in
   many business applications and can considerably reduce the development
   effort. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   By using these plans, different optimization methods, namely analytical,
   classical mathematical, Taguchi and artificial neural networks were
   performed and the results of optimal cutting parameters obtained with
   these methods were compared. Finally, the features, the merits and the

Abstract = {{A method for detection of wear in thrust ball bearings coated with

   Extensive experimental studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of
   the proposed method for fault diagnosis of MoS2 coating. These
   experiments are conducted under both oscillatory and unidirectional
   motions. The results of vibrations are corroborated with the friction
   coefficient from the onset of the motion until failure develops. Through
   monitoring of the energy in time-frequency domain as well as the
   coefficient of friction, three stages of coating life are identified.
   They are healthy period, developing damage, and failure. It is shown
   that the energy feature can detect whenever wear and damage appear and
   solid lubricant loses its lubrication capabilities. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{There are no solid figures of the frequency of ulcer disease during
   childhood in Europe. We assessed its frequency and analyzed known risk
   factors.
   Patients and methods Ulcers, erosions, indications, and risk factors
   were recorded in all children undergoing an upper gastrointestinal
   endoscopy in a prospective study carried out during 1-month
   simultaneously in 19 centers among 14 European countries.
   Results Ulcers and/or erosions were observed in 56 out of 694 children.
   Children with ulcers/erosions were significantly older than those
   without lesions (10.3 +/- 5.5 vs. 8.1 +/- 5.7 years, P = 0.002).
   Helicobacter pylori infection was present in 15 of 56 children (27\%)
   where NSAIDs were used in eight, steroids in five, immune-suppressive
   drugs in five, antibiotics in six, antacids in one, H2-blockers in six
   and proton pump inhibitors in eight children (more than one risk factor
   was detected in 32 of 56 children). No risk factors were observed in 24
   of 56 children (43\%). The main indications for endoscopy were
   epigastric or abdominal pain (24\%) and suspicion of gastroesophageal
   reflux disease (15\%). Similarly, epigastric tenderness, hematemesis,
   melena, and weight stagnation were significantly associated with
   ulcers/erosions, whereas sex, H. pylori infection, socioeconomic and
   lifestyle factors were equally distributed.
   Conclusion Although limited by the short-time duration and the
   heterogeneity of the patients included throughout the 19 centers, our
   study shows a frequency of 8.1\% of ulcers and/or erosions in children,
   occurring mainly in the second decade of life. H. pylori infection and
   gastrotoxic medications were less frequently implicated than expected.

Abstract = {{Background: Variceal bleeding in cirrhosis can cause liver ischaemia and
   deteriorate the hyperdynamic state; thus, the effects of vasoconstrictor
   therapy on liver blood volume (LBV) and thorax blood volume (ThBV) are
   important. Aim: To evaluate and compare the effects of terlipressin and
   somatostatin on LBV and ThBV in stable patients with cirrhosis and
   portal hypertension. Methods: Twenty patients were studied (Child-Pugh
   class A/B/C: 5/8/7). The radioactivities in the liver region (LRR) and
   the thorax region (ThRR) by single-head gamma camera technique, as
   indicators of LBV and ThBV, respectively, and systemic haemodynamics
   were measured at baseline and after intravenous infusion of 2 mg of
   terlipressin (n = 10) or somatostatin 250 mg/h after an initial bolus of
   250 mg (n = 10). Results: LRR and ThRR decreased significantly with
   increasing severity of cirrhosis. Thirty minutes after terlipressin
   infusion, LRR and ThRR increased by 7.8 +/- 4.4\% (NS) and 14 +/- 5.3\%
   (P = 0.01) compared with baseline values; the increase in ThRR was
   significantly related to the increase in LRR (r = 0.682, P = 0.03). In
   contrast, somatostatin reduced LRR and ThRR by 13.3 +/- 6.5\% (P = 0.07)
   and 1 +/- 4\% (NS) respectively. LRR and ThRR increased significantly in
   the terlipressin group compared with the somatostatin group (P = 0.01
   and P = 0.02 respectively). Terlipressin reduced cardiac output and
   heart rate (both P = 0.01) and increased the mean arterial pressure
   (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (P = 0.009 and P = 0.002
   respectively); MAP decreased after somatostatin infusion (P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Terlipressin, but not somatostatin, maintains LBV,
   increases ThBV and improves the hyperdynamic state in cirrhosis. These
   effects can be beneficial in variceal bleeding, particularly in patients
   with advanced liver disease.}},

   monoexponential and a biexponential model to the acquired data. The
   biexponential function models the effect of both perfusion and
   diffusion. Results and conclusion. ADC changes of up to 40\% were seen
   with the use of different b-values. Using a lower b-value >= 150 s/mm(2)
   and an upper b-value >= 700 s/mm(2) limited the variation to less that

Title = {{Suture-Button Construct for Interosseous Ligament Reconstruction in
   Longitudinal Radioulnar Dissociations: A Biomechanical Study}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Longitudinal radioulnar dissociation is a triad of injuries
   consisting of distal radioulnar joint disruption, interosseous ligament
   complex (IOLC) tear, and radial head fracture. This renders the forearm
   longitudinally unstable, resulting in proximal migration of the radius
   and ulnar-sided wrist degeneration. We hypothesized that reconstruction
   of the central band of the IOLC in cadaver forearms using a
   Mini-TightRope suture-button construct would restore native forearm
   stability.
   Methods We implanted 8 fresh-frozen cadaver arms with steel beads into
   the distal radius and ulna, mounted them on an MTS machine, and
   cyclically loaded them from 13 N distraction to 130 N compression. Bead
   motion was recorded fluoroscopically and analyzed using Image-Pro
   Express software. We measured distal ulnar forces using strain gauge
   transducers. Longitudinal radioulnar dissociation injuries were created
   by radial head excision and complete IOLC and triangular fibrocartilage
   complex disruption. At each stage, arms were tested with and without a
   radial head implant. We reconstructed the central band of the IOLC using
   a Mini-TightRope and tightened until the distal radioulnar joint was
   reduced fluoroscopically. We used multiple-comparison analysis of
   variance with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test for
   statistical analysis.
   Results The intact arms had an average radioulnar axial displacement of
   0.7 +/- 0.8 mm and distal ulnar impaction force of 16.7 +/- 11.1 N (per
   100 N of axial load on the forearm). After destabilization, the
   radioulnar displacement increased to 10.7 +/- 3.9 mm (p < .001) and
   ulnar load increased 312\%, to an average of 52.2 +/- 25.7 N (p < .001).
   After IOLC reconstruction, average displacement decreased to 2.2 +/- 0.9
   mm with a distal ulnar load of 19.05 +/- 13.5 N (not significantly
   different from intact arms).
   Conclusions In this cadaveric study, Mini-TightRope IOLC reconstruction
   with or without a radial head prosthesis significantly reduced distal
   ulnar impaction forces to that of the native forearm, while limiting
   radioulnar displacement to near-anatomic levels. (J Hand Surg

Abstract = {{The over-replicating wMelPop strain of the endosymbiont Wolbachia
   pipientis has recently been shown to be capable of inducing immune
   upregulation and inhibition of pathogen transmission in Aedes aegypti
   mosquitoes. In order to examine whether comparable effects would be seen
   in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, transient somatic infections of
   wMelPop were created by intrathoracic inoculation. Upregulation of six
   selected immune genes was observed compared to controls, at least two of
   which (LRIM1 and TEP1) influence the development of malaria parasites. A
   stably infected An. gambiae cell line also showed increased expression
   of malaria-related immune genes. Highly significant reductions in
   Plasmodium infection intensity were observed in the wMelPop-infected
   cohort, and using gene knockdown, evidence for the role of TEP1 in this
   phenotype was obtained. Comparing the levels of upregulation in somatic
   and stably inherited wMelPop infections in Ae. aegypti revealed that
   levels of upregulation were lower in the somatic infections than in the
   stably transinfected line; inhibition of development of Brugia filarial
   nematodes was nevertheless observed in the somatic wMelPop infected
   females. Thus we consider that the effects observed in An. gambiae are
   also likely to be more pronounced if stably inherited wMelPop
   transinfections can be created, and that somatic infections of Wolbachia
   provide a useful model for examining effects on pathogen development or
   dissemination. The data are discussed with respect to the comparative
   effects on malaria vectorial capacity of life shortening and direct
   inhibition of Plasmodium development that can be produced by Wolbachia.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In a recent randomized trial of Staphylococcus aureus
   bacteremia and native valve endocarditis, daptomycin was found not
   inferior to standard therapy. We summarized findings in the subgroup of
   patients with endocarditis according to the Duke criteria.
   Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive daptomycin 6
   mg/kg/day or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g every 12 h or
   antistaphylococcal penicillin 2 g every 4 h, both with gentamicin 1
   mg/kg every 8 h for the first 4 days). The primary end point was success
   in the modified intent-to-treat population 6 weeks after the end of
   therapy.
   Results: Fifty-three patients were included: 35 with right-sided
   endocarditis (RIE) and 18 with left-sided endocarditis (LIE). The
   success rates in patients with RIE were similar between daptomycin and
   the comparator (42\% vs 44\%). Patients with RIE with septic pulmonary
   infarcts responded similarly to treatment with daptomycin and standard
   therapy (60\% vs 67\%). In the LIE population, treatment success rates
   were poor in both arms (11\% vs 22\%).
   Conclusion: Daptomycin is an efficacious and well-tolerated alternative
   to standard therapy in the treatment of RIE. Patients with LIE had a
   poor outcome regardless of the treatment received. Daptomycin is also
   effective in treating endocarditis with septic pulmonary infarcts. (C)

Abstract = {{The cellular localization of the inhibin subunits (alpha, beta(A), and
   beta(B)), steroidogenic enzymes (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3
   beta HSD) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) were evaluated in the
   ovaries of cyclic (n=6) and pregnant (n=2) Shiba goats (Capra Hircus).
   The immunointensity of inhibin alpha and beta(A) subunits showed an
   increase in the granulosa cells (GC) of developing follicles. Inhibin
   beta(B) subunit and P450arom showed high expression in GC of antral
   follicles. 3 beta HSD immunoreactivity was uniform in preantral and
   antral follicles. In follicular phase and late pregnancy, there was a
   strong expression of inhibin a subunit in GC of antral follicles.
   Although in mid pregnancy, antral follicles GC showed moderate
   immunostaining of inhibin beta subunits, the immunoreactivity of inhibin
   beta(A) and beta(B) subunits was high during the follicular and luteal
   stages, respectively. While, immunoreactivity of GC to P450arom was
   moderate during all studied stages, and 3 beta HSD immunoreactivity was
   plentiful in antral follicles during the luteal phase. The
   immunoreactivity to inhibin a subunit and P450arom was abundant during
   mid pregnancy in the luteal tissues. Immunoreaction to inhibin beta
   subunits was faint-to-moderate in cyclic and pregnancy corpora lutea.
   Immunoexpression of 3 beta HSD was maximal in late pregnancy corpora
   lutea. The present results suggest that, in goats, the GC of antral
   follicles are the main source of dimeric inhibins and that corpora lutea
   may partially participate in the secretion of inhibin. Changes in
   ovarian hormonal levels might depend on the synthesizing capacity of
   hormones in the follicles and corpora lutea to regulate the goat's
   reproductive stages.}},

Abstract = {{The mammalian genome encodes multiple Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein
   (WASP)/WASP-family Verprolin homologous (WAVE) proteins. Members of this
   family interact with the actin related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex to
   promote growth of a branched actin network near the plasma membrane or
   the surface of moving cargos. Arp2/3 mediated branching can further lead
   to formation of comet tails (actin rockets). Despite their similar
   domain structure, different WASP/WAVE family members fulfill unique
   functions that depend on their subcellular location and activity levels.
   We measured the relative efficiency of actin nucleation promotion of
   full-length WASP/WAVE proteins in a cytoplasmic extract from primary
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In this assay WAVE2 and
   WAVE3 complexes showed higher nucleation efficiency than WAVE1 and
   N-WASP, indicating distinct cellular controls for different family
   members. Previously. WASP and N-WASP were the only members that were
   known to stimulate comet formation. We observed that in addition to
   N-WASP, WAVE3 also induced short actin tails, and the other WAVEs
   induced formation of asymmetric actin shells. Differences in shape and
   structure of actin-based growth may reflect varying ability of WASP/WAVE
   proteins to break symmetry of the actin shell, possibly by differential
   recruitment of actin bundling or severing (pruning or debranching)
   factors. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed predictive growth models for Staphylococcus aureus and
   Bacillus cereus on various food matrices consisting primarily of
   ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. A cocktail of three S. aureus strains,
   producing enterotoxins A, C, and D, or a B. cereus strain, were
   inoculated on sliced bread, cooked rice, boiled Chinese noodles, boiled
   bean sprouts, tofu, baked fish, smoked chicken, and baked hamburger
   patties at an initial concentration of 3 log CFU/g and stored at 8, 10,
   13, 17, 24, and 30 degrees C. Growth kinetic parameters were determined
   by the Gompertz equation. The square-root and Davey models were used to
   determine specific growth rate and lag time values, respectively, as a
   function of temperature. Model performance was evaluated based on bias
   and accuracy factors. S. aureus. and B. cereus growth were most delayed
   on sliced bread. Overall, S. aureus growth was significantly (p<0.05)
   more rapid on animal protein foods than carbohydrate-based foods and
   vegetable protein foods. The fastest growth of S. aureus was observed on
   smoked chicken. B. cereus growth was not observed at 8 and 10 degrees C.
   B. cereus growth was significantly (p<0.05) more rapid on vegetable
   protein foods than on carbohydrate-based foods. The secondary models
   developed in this study showed suitable performance for predicting the
   growth of S. aureus and B. cereus on various food matrices consisting of
   RTE foods.}},

Abstract = {{Many economic and social conditions shape public welfare spending. We
   are able to show, however, that after taking account of these
   conditions, the expressed left-right preferences of the median voters
   significantly affect comparative welfare spending. These new findings
   support the representational claims of liberal democracy and the
   theoretical expectations of the literature on ideological congruence.
   However, we also show that insofar as the preferences of citizens and
   the promises of governing parties (which are highly correlated,) can be
   disentangled, it is the former that affect the long-term redistributive
   welfare spending equilibrium, while the latter have small, but
   significant short-term effects. Surprisingly, despite greater
   representational correspondence between positions of voters and
   governments under PR than SMD, the impact of the median voter
   preferences is quite similar under the two systems.}},

Abstract = {{A total of ninety swine (79.0 +/- 2.2 kg) were employed for 58 d to
   determine the meat quality of pigs fed fermented agricultural
   by-products (FAB) mainly consisting of brewers grain shell. FAB was
   replaced with commercial feed at dietary levels of 20\%, 40\%, 60\%,

   2, 3, 4 and 5-9 wk, respectively. Compared with the control (CON) feed,
   FAD feed had lower moisture and nitrogen-free extract content, and
   higher crude fat, crude fiber, and total calorie (p<0.05). The protein
   content, amino acid profile, and pH values of pork loin were not
   affected by dietary treatment. However, higher moisture, crude ash, and
   meat cholesterol, and lower fat, were found in CON compared with
   treatment (p<0.05). FAB treatment significantly improved drip loss and
   cooking loss value (p<0.05), and increased the CIE L{*} values of loin
   and back-fat surface, whereas it decreased the CIE a. values of loin

Abstract = {{In this paper we developed an entirely new and highly sensitive

   Immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a kind of bio-molecule was conjugated to
   different sized CdTe semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Using PL spectra
   and CL intensity profiles, it was found that chemiluminescence resonance
   energy transfer (CRET) was possibly occurring between CdTe-IgG
   bioconjugate and luminol. Under optimum conditions, increase of IgG
   concentration in CdTe-IgG bioconjugate resulted enhancing effect on CL
   intensity of luminol-H2O2 system. Moreover quenching effects on CL
   intensity by addition of different proteases can construct turn off
   biosensor for these proteases with low detection limits and wide linear
   range. Furthermore, the effects of various organic and inorganic species

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare postoperative social costs of two cataract
   surgical techniques, phacoemulsification (PHACO) and extracapsular
   extraction (ECCE).
   METHODS: Prospective randomized intervention study including 205
   patients, of which 101 underwent PHACO and 104 ECCE in the public
   service, in the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, in 2002. The
   socioeconomic impact of these surgical procedures was assessed based on
   postoperative costs for patients, employers and social security.
   Comparisons between the two groups studied were performed using the
   chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test, when appropriate. A 5\%
   significance level was set.
   RESULTS: Hospital and eyeglasses costs for PHACO were lower than for
   ECCE patients, with a mean difference of US\$ 16.74. Costs to employers
   related to medical leave for the first 15 days of absence and costs of
   caregivers in the form of absence from work to attend postoperative
   follow-up visits were on average US\$ 0.18 lower in PHACO compared to
   ECCE group. The estimated Social Security expenditure per patient
   undergoing surgery was US\$ 6.57 and US\$ 51.15 in PHACO and ECCE
   groups, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The average saving with PHACO compared to ECCE technique
   was US\$ 61.50 for employers, patients, caregivers and Social Security.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe school absences in adolescents with Juvenile
   Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) and examine the relationship
   between school absenteeism, pain, psychiatric symptoms, and maternal
   pain history. Methods Adolescents with JPFS (N = 102; mean age 14.96
   years) completed measures of pain and depressive symptoms, and completed
   a psychiatric interview. Parents provided information about the
   adolescents' school absences, type of schooling, and parental pain
   history. School attendance reports were obtained directly from schools.
   Results Over 12\% of adolescents with JPFS were homeschooled. Those
   enrolled in regular school missed 2.9 days per month on average, with
   one-third of participants missing more than 3 days per month. Pain and
   maternal pain history were not related to school absenteeism. However,
   depressive symptoms were significantly associated with school absences.
   Conclusion Many adolescents with JPFS experience difficulties with
   regular school attendance. Long-term risks associated with school
   absenteeism and the importance of addressing psychological factors are

Abstract = {{Objective: We compared the 1-year predictive value of several
   inflammatory and non-inflammatory biomarkers in ACS patients.
   Methods: In 610 patients (73.0\% male) - 36.0\% unstable angina (UA) and
   64.0\% NSTEMI - we assessed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
   (hs-CRP), interleukins 6, 10 and 18, soluble CD40 ligand, P-and
   E-selectin, NT-proBNP, fibrinogen and cystatin C at hospital admission.
   Two outcomes at 1-year follow up were selected for analysis: (1)
   all-cause death, MI, UA, or coronary revascularization, and (2)
   all-cause death, and non-fatal MI. The effect of biomarker levels on
   endpoints was examined by the Cox proportional hazards model, and their
   discrimination ability with the C statistic (AUC).
   Results: Of 549 patients (90.0\%) who completed the 1-year follow up,
   206 (37.5\%) and 54 (8.9\%) reached the first and second composite
   endpoints, respectively. None of the biomarkers studied improved
   prediction of the first endpoint. However, considered as continuous
   variables, and in combination, NT-proBNP and fibrinogen, increased the
   AUC from 0.64 (95\% CI 0.55-0.72) to 0.73 (95\% CI 0.64-0.81; p = 0.02)
   for prediction of the second endpoint. Cut-off values for NT-proBNP and
   fibrinogen, regarding best sensitivity and specificity for prediction of
   the secondary endpoint were 1043.9 ng/L and 4.47 mg/dL, respectively.
   For these cut-off points, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
   value and negative predictive value were 40.5\% vs 59.5\%, 83.3\% vs
   67.1\%, 18.8\% vs 14.9\% and 93.5\% vs 94.4\% for NT-proBNP and
   fibrinogen, respectively.
   Conclusion: In ACS patients, inflammatory biomarkers offer modest
   incremental information to that provided by clinical risk markers.
   Fibrinogen and NT-proBNP measurements, however, improve cardiovascular
   risk prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The German firm of Siemens and Halske introduced many enterprising
   features of what later came to be known as welfare capitalism in the
   mid-nineteenth century. Profit sharing, annual bonuses, a pension fund,
   a reduction in work hours, and an annual party were all means to ensure
   a productive, trouble-free workforce. We investigate the reasons why
   Siemens and Halske introduced this internal welfare system. We focus on
   the by-far most expensive part of the welfare system: the pension fund
   introduced in 1872, more than a decade before the nationwide social
   security system was implemented in Germany. We find that the adoption of
   the internal welfare system increased labor productivity, and in
   addition discouraged workers from striking. We estimate that the
   company's gains due to strike prevention and higher productivity were at
   least as high as the cost of the pension fund. This suggests that (1)
   the introduction of a pension fund is not inconsistent with simple
   profit maximizing behavior on the firm's side and (2) increased labor
   unionization induced firms to introduce subjective components of
   workers' remuneration packages.}},

Abstract = {{Adrenomedullin (AM) is a 52-amino-acid vasodilator peptide that was
   originally isolated from human pheochromocytoma. In the previous
   experimental study with rat ischemia/reperfusion model, AM reduced
   infarct size and inhibited myocyte apoptosis. AM also suppressed the
   production of oxygen-free radicals. The present study was designed to
   evaluate the feasibility of intravenous administration of AM in patients
   with acute myocardial infarction. We studied 10 patients with first
   acute myocardial infarction {[}male to female ratio: 9 to 1, age: 65 +/-
   9 (mean +/- SD) years, peak creatine phosphokinase level: 4215 +/- 1933
   (SD) U/L], who were hospitalized within 12 hours of symptom onset.
   Proceeding reperfusion therapy, AM infusion was initiated and continued
   at concentration of 0.0125-0.025 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) for 12 hours.
   Follow-up coronary angiography and left ventriculography were performed
   at 3 months. Cardiac magnetic resonance was examined at 1 month and 3
   months after AM therapy. During infusion of AM, hemodynamics kept stable
   except 2 patients. Wall motion index in the infarct area at 3 months was
   significantly improved compared with that at baseline, and infarct size
   evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance was significantly decreased at 3
   months. In conclusion, intravenous administration of AM, which possesses
   a variety of potential cardiovascular protective actions, can be
   adjunctive to percutaneous coronary intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We have extended our method of grouping Feynman diagrams (GFD theory) to
   study the transverse and longitudinal correlation functions
   G(perpendicular to)(k) and G(parallel to)(k) in phi(4) model below the
   critical point (T < T-c) in the presence of an infinitesimal external
   field. Our method allows a qualitative analysis without cutting the
   perturbation series. The long-wave limit k -> 0 has been studied at T <
   T-c, showing that G(perpendicular to)(k) similar or equal to ak(-lambda
   perpendicular to) and G(parallel to)(k) similar or equal to bk(-lambda
   parallel to) with exponents d/2 < lambda(perpendicular to) < 2 and
   lambda(parallel to) = 2 lambda(perpendicular to) - d are the physical
   solutions of our equations at the spatial dimensionality 2 < d < 4,
   which coincides with the asymptotic solution at T -> T-c as well as with
   a nonperturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis provided in our
   paper. This has been confirmed also by recent Monte Carlo simulations.
   The exponents as well as the ratio bM(2)/a(2) (where M is magnetization)
   are universal. The results of the perturbative RG method are reproduced
   by formally setting lambda(perpendicular to) = 2, although our analysis
   yields lambda(perpendicular to) < 2.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Catheter-related bloodstream infections remain costly with
   no simple prevention. We report preliminary results of a phase I trial
   of ethanol-lock administration to prevent mediport catheter-related
   bloodstream infections in children.
   Methods: Twelve patients receiving intravenous antibody treatments for
   neuroblastoma were enrolled. On 4 days of each 5-day antibody cycle,
   70\% ethanol was administered instead of heparin to dwell in each
   patient's mediport overnight. We used clinical monitoring/questionnaires
   to assess symptoms and measured blood ethanol levels and liver
   functions. Patients were tracked for positive blood cultures. Time to
   infection for ethanol-lock-treated patients was compared with historical
   controls.
   Results: We administered 123 ethanol-locks. No adverse symptoms
   attributable to ethanol occurred; one patient's urticaria worsened.
   Blood ethanol levels averaged 11 mg/dL. The study was voluntarily
   suspended after 3 patients' catheters became occluded, 1 of which
   fractured. A positive blood culture occurred in 1 (8\%) of 12 patients,
   but suspension of the study precluded statistical power to detect impact
   on time to infection.
   Conclusions: Although children with mediport catheters exhibited
   nontoxic blood ethanol levels and a low rate of bloodstream infections
   following prophylactic ethanol-lock use, there was a high incidence of
   catheter occlusion. Adjustments are necessary before adopting
   ethanol-locks for routine prophylaxis against catheter infections in
   children. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Journal = {{OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. To evaluate the repeatability of pachymetry measures at six
   distinct locations using a Fourier-domain optical coherence tomographer.
   The location of the thinnest point was also described using vector
   analysis, and repeatability of the localization of the thinnest point
   was calculated.
   Methods. The right eye of 25 healthy subjects had 3 images of their
   right cornea captured using the pachymetry protocol and anterior segment
   lens of a commercially available Fourier-domain optical coherence
   tomographer (RTVue-100, Optovue, Fremont, CA). The first two images were
   used to quantify repeatability in the central (2 mm) and paracentral
   (2-5 mm) cornea. Cartesian coordinates representing the location of the
   thinnest point were used to determine the mean location in relation to
   the central cornea.
   Results. Mean central thickness was 536.8 +/- 31.1 mu m, and the mean
   minimum thickness was 526.4 +/- 33.1 mu m. The thickest paracentral zone
   was the superior cornea and the thinnest was the temporal cornea.
   Intraclass correlation values ranged between 0.969 and 0.996, and the
   mean coefficient of repeatability was 1.74\% across all locations
   evaluated. The thinnest point was located in the inferior temporal
   region in 80\% of eyes and was an average distance of 1.01 mm from the
   corneal apex, subtending an angle of 26.7 degrees from the horizontal.
   Conclusions. The RTVue-100 provides a highly repeatable measure of
   corneal thickness at various locations. The instrument is capable of
   describing and consistently duplicating the location of the thinnest
   point of the cornea; however, further comparative work with other
   clinical imaging modalities is required. (Optom Vis Sci 2010;87:736-741)}},

Abstract = {{A semianalytical study of the creeping flow caused by a spherical fluid
   or solid particle with a slip surface translating in a viscous fluid
   within a spherical cavity along the line connecting their centers is
   presented in the quasisteady limit of small Reynolds number. In order to
   solve the Stokes equations for the flow field, a general solution is
   constructed from the superposition of the fundamental solutions in the
   two spherical coordinate systems based on both the particle and cavity.
   The boundary conditions on the particle surface and cavity wall are
   satisfied by a collocation technique. Numerical results for the
   hydrodynamic drag force exerted on the particle are obtained with good
   convergence for various values of the ratio of particle-to-cavity radii,
   the relative distance between the centers of the particle and cavity,
   the relative viscosity or slip coefficient of the particle, and the slip
   coefficient of the cavity wall. In the limits of the motions of a
   spherical particle in a concentric cavity and near a cavity wall with a
   small curvature, our drag results are in good agreement with the
   available solutions in the literature. As expected, the
   boundary-corrected drag force exerted on the particle for all cases is a
   monotonic increasing function of the ratio of particle-to-cavity radii,
   and becomes infinite in the touching limit. For a specified ratio of
   particle-to-cavity radii, the drag force is minimal when the particle is
   situated at the cavity center and increases monotonically with its
   relative distance from the cavity center to infinity in the limit as it
   is located extremely away from the cavity center. The drag force acting
   on the particle, in general, increases with an increase in its relative
   viscosity or with a decrease in its slip coefficient for a given
   configuration, but surprisingly, there are exceptions when the ratio of
   particle-to-cavity radii is large.}},

Abstract = {{Two studies were conducted to better understand arboreta and community
   members' attitudes toward programming and benefits offered at arboreta
   and public gardens. The first study, a mail survey sent to arboreta
   members, included questions regarding what encourage them to become
   members and the services they value pertaining to their paid membership.
   The second study, an Internet survey of consumers residing within a
   30-mile radius of the arboreta, also focused on interest in leisure
   activities and interest in traditional, gardening-related programs
   offered at the arboreta in an effort to understand what might increase
   membership. Over half of the members (62.5\%) responded that they were
   ``completely satisfied,{''} with only 3.4\% selecting ``neither
   dissatisfied nor satisfied{''} or some level of ``dissatisfied.{''} The
   top three reasons that motivated members to join the arboretum's
   association included ``benefits offered{''} (28.2\%), followed by
   providing the ``arboretum with financial support{''} (22.9\%), and ``to
   attend horticultural educational programs at a discounted rate{''}
   (22.6\%). Interest level in gardening appeared to be greater among
   arboreta members compared with community members, on the basis of the
   percentage of both groups who self-identified with phrases such as
   ``skilled and knowledgeable{''} and ``enjoys spending time
   gardening.{''} Arboreta member interest in garden programming activities
   differed from those of local community respondents in all categories
   except ``outdoor concerts and live performances,{''} ``wine tasting and
   tours,{''} and ``painting and drawing.{''} The one program/activity that
   appeared to be more of interest to community members than arboreta
   members was ``cooking and entertaining,{''} with community members
   returning an average mean rating of 4.77 (1 = ``very disinterested,{''}
   7 = ``very interested{''}) and arboreta members returning an average
   mean rating of 4.29. On the basis of the results of the survey and the
   strong interest expressed by both survey groups in program activities
   offered, arboreta staff should consider offering programming that
   appeals to both current members and community members at large and in an
   effort to assure a sustainable membership level.}},

Title = {{Tuning the serum persistence of human serum albumin domain III: diabody
   fusion proteins}},
Journal = {{PROTEIN ENGINEERING DESIGN \& SELECTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{789-798}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The long circulation persistence of human serum albumin (HSA) is enabled
   by its domain III (DIII) interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor
   (FcRn). A protein scaffold based on HSA DIII was designed. To modify the
   serum half life of the scaffold, residues H535, H510, and H464 were
   individually mutated to alanine. HSA DIII wild type (WT) and variants
   were fused to the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) T84.66 diabody
   (Db), radiolabeled with I-124 and injected into xenografted athymic mice
   for serial PET/CT imaging. All proteins targeted the CEA-positive tumor.
   The mean residence times (MRT) of the proteins, calculated by
   quantifying blood activity from the PET images, were: Db-DIII WT (56.7
   h), H535A (25 h), H510A (20 h), H464A (17 h), compared with Db (2.9 h).
   Biodistribution confirmed the order of blood clearance from slow to
   fast: Db-DIII WT > H535A > H510A > H464A > Db with 4.0, 2.0, 1.8, 1.6
   and 0.08 \%ID/g of remaining blood activity at 51 h, respectively. This
   study demonstrates that attenuating the DIII-FcRn interaction provides a
   way of controlling the pharmacokinetics of the entire Db-DIII fusion
   protein without compromising tumor targeting. H464 appears to be most
   crucial for FcRn binding (greatest reduction in MRT), followed by H510
   and H535. By mutating the DIII scaffold, we can dial serum kinetics for
   imaging or therapy applications.}},

Abstract = {{We interviewed 33 HIV-infected parents from the HIV Cost and Services
   Utilization Study (HCSUS), 27 of their minor children, 19 adult
   children, and 15 caregivers about the process of children learning that

   descriptions of parents' disclosure of their HIV status to their
   children, from the perspective of multiple family members. We analyzed
   transcripts of these interviews with systematic qualitative methods.
   Both parents and children reported unplanned disclosure experiences with
   positive and negative outcomes. Parents sometimes reported that
   disclosure was not as negative as they feared. However, within-household
   analysis showed disagreement between parents and children from the same
   household regarding disclosure outcomes. These findings suggest that
   disclosure should be addressed within a family context to facilitate
   communication and children's coping. Parents should consider negative
   and positive outcomes, unplanned disclosure and children's capacity to
   adapt after disclosure when deciding whether to disclose.}},

   Pain-free grip strength was measured with the Biometric E-Link
   Evaluation System V900S (Unit 25, Nine Mile Point Ind. Est., Gwent UK
   NP11 7HZ), pain levels recorded before and after grip tests with visual

   mean of three trials of pain-free grip strength testing. Median values
   of grip strength for both methods produced comparable results.
   Clinically small but statistically significant increases in pain (p <=

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3449-3459}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Flibanserin, a novel 5-HT1A agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist, has the
   potential to treat sexual dysfunction.
   Aim.
   Provide historical perspective on the rationale for development of
   flibanserin to treat sexual dysfunction, based on post hoc analyses of
   data.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   The Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) scale and the Hamilton depression
   rating scale (HAMD) Genital Symptoms item.
   Methods.
   Sexual function outcomes are presented from four double-blind,
   randomized controlled studies involving a total of 369 men and 523 women
   diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Each study had an active
   treatment arm to confirm assay sensitivity on the primary antidepressive
   endpoint. Two studies placebo, flibanserin (50 mg bid), or fluoxetine
   (20 mg qd) for 6 weeks and two involved placebo, flibanserin (50-100 mg
   bid), or paroxetine (20-40 mg qd) for 8 weeks.
   Results.
   Individual study completion rates were 77-80\%. At baseline, 38\% of men
   and 67\% of women reported sexual dysfunction. Assay sensitivity was not
   demonstrated in the fluoxetine trials and sexual function outcomes were
   inconsistent. Flibanserin and placebo were associated with low rates of
   treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction in women during the paroxetine
   studies. In one study, 70\% of flibanserin-treated women with baseline
   sexual dysfunction reported improvement in sexual function, compared
   with 30\% of placebo-treated women. Mean change from baseline on the
   HAMD ``Genital Symptoms{''} item in one paroxetine study was
   significantly better among flibanserin- than placebo-treated women at
   weeks 4, 6, and 8 (P < 0.05). Sexual function adverse events across
   flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo.
   Conclusions.
   Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual
   function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin
   on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a
   rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for
   female hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Kennedy S. Flibanserin:

Abstract = {{A diad is a generalisation of a monad and a comonad. The idea is that we
   ignore the unit or counit, and consider only the natural transformations
   between T and T(2). It turns out that almost all the constructions that
   we form for a monad or comonad can also be constructed from a related
   diad. Diads were introduced in Kenney (Appl. Categ. Structures, 2008),
   where they give a generalisation of the results that the category of
   coalgebras for a finite-limit preserving comonad on a topos is another
   topos, and that the category of algebras for a finite-limit preserving
   idempotent monad on a topos is another topos. In that paper, we were
   only interested in a special class of diads called codistributive diads,
   and we considered only the part of the theory of diads necessary to
   prove the result about finite-limit preserving diads in topoi. Here, we
   will study general diads in greater detail. We will develop the general
   theory with constructions that extend the standard constructions for
   monads and comonads.}},

   tiered approach to intervention are still under investigation. In this
   study, 23 first-grade students were identified as having below average
   reading abilities and/or poor phonemic awareness through classroom-based
   and standardized assessments and then randomly divided into two groups.
   One group received explicit phonemic awareness training with the
   speech-language pathologists (SLP) and multi-sensory reading instruction
   from a special educator in conjunction with classroom instruction. The
   remaining group received exclusively classroom reading instruction. No
   significant differences were found when comparing results of
   classroom-based intervention to students receiving classroom
   intervention plus 16 hours of additional intensive instruction. Both
   groups demonstrated overall improvements in reading efficiency,
   including segmenting and blending. Implications are discussed comparing
   Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches with children scoring below expectations
   using formal and informal reading measures.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Spinal cord injury causes muscle wasting and loss of
   function, which are especially severe after complete and permanent
   damage to lower motor neurons. In a previous cross-sectional study,
   long-standing denervated muscles were rescued by home-based functional
   electrical stimulation (h-bFES) training. Objective. To confirm results
   by a 2-year longitudinal prospective study of 25 patients with complete
   conus/cauda equina lesions. Methods. Denervated leg muscles were
   stimulated by h-bFES using a custom-designed stimulator and large
   surface electrodes. Muscle mass, force, and structure were determined
   before and after 2 years of h-bFES using computed tomography,
   measurements of knee torque during stimulation, and muscle biopsies
   analyzed by histology and electron microscopy. Results. Twenty of 25
   patients completed the 2-year h-bFES program, which resulted in (a) a
   35\% cross-sectional increase in area of the quadriceps muscle from 28.2
   +/- 8.1 to 38.1 +/- 12.7 cm(2) (P < .001), a 75\% increase in mean
   diameter of muscle fibers from 16.6 +/- 14.3 to 29.1 +/- 23.3 mu m (P <
   .001), and improvements of the ultrastructural organization of
   contractile material; and (b) a 1187\% increase in force output during
   electrical stimulation from 0.8 +/- 1.3 to 10.3 +/- 8.1 N m (P < .001).
   The recovery of quadriceps force was sufficient to allow 25\% of the
   subjects to perform FES-assisted stand-up exercises. Conclusions.
   Home-based FES of denervated muscle is an effective home therapy that
   results in rescue of muscle mass and tetanic contractility. Important
   immediate benefits for the patients are the improved cosmetic appearance
   of lower extremities and the enhanced cushioning effect for seating.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Dry mouth is a frequent complaint of adults worldwide., In
   those who experience dry mouth, therapeutic options include the use of
   salivary substitutes and sialogogues.
   Methods. The authors compared the efficacy and safety of mucoadhesive
   disks (OraMoist, Axiomedic, Zurich; distributed by Quantum Health,
   Eugene, Ore.) applied three times daily with those of placebo
   mucoadhesive disks in a double-masked, randomized, controlled crossover
   study. The primary end point of interest was within-participant
   differences in subjective (visual analog scale) ratings of dry mouth
   according to the New York University Bluestone Mouthfeel Questionnaire.
   The secondary end point was within-participant differences in salivary
   flow rates.
   Results. Twenty-seven participants completed the single-site study. The
   results showed no significant difference between the two types of
   mucoadhesive disks, both of which were associated with a statistically
   significant improvement in the subjective experience of moistness across
   the 60-minute period after application and compared with baseline
   measures after two weeks of use. Furthermore, both disks were associated
   with a statistically significant improvement in salivary flow rates
   across the 60-minute period after application and compared with baseline
   measures after one and two weeks of use. The disks were well tolerated,
   and participants did not report any adverse events.
   Conclusions. The mucoadhesive disks used in this study were safe and
   provided symptomatic relief from dry mouth.
   Practice Implications. Patients with dry mouth may benefit from this
   novel delivery system.}},

Abstract = {{Following the advent of mefloquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
   in Thailand in the 1990s, the combined treatment of falciparum malaria
   with artesunate and mefloquine was found to be highly effective in
   treating and curing the patients in the affected areas. Monitoring of
   the clinical-parasitological response and of the in vitro sensitivity of
   P. falciparum was systematically conducted in order to detect any signs
   of failure of this type of artemisinin-based combination treatment
   (ACT). In earlier observations the in vitro activity of artemisinin was
   found to be significantly enhanced when combined with retinol. The same
   applies to mefloquine. In order to check whether the synergism between
   artemisinin and mefloquine was maintained in the presence of retinol,
   the pharmacodynamic interaction of the three compounds was investigated
   in the western border area of Thailand. Successful parallel tests with
   mefloquine, artemisinin, retinol, mefloquine-artemisinin 5:1 as well as
   mefloquine-artemisinin (5:1) + retinol low, medium and high were
   obtained with 43 fresh parasite isolates. The retinol concentrations in
   the low, medium and high formulations corresponded to the 50th, 65th and
   80th percentile of the physiological mean concentrations in the blood of
   healthy adults. The IC50, IC90 and IC99 values for mefloquine alone
   showed a further increase over the data of 2008. In the combinations
   with artemisinin and retinol moderate synergism was observed at the
   IC50, but synergism increased strongly at the IC90 and the IC99.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{Spatial structure of forest stands is one of the main drivers of forest
   growth and yield, and is an important indicator of wildlife habitat,
   aesthetics, and other non-timber forest uses. Because spatial structure
   is costly to measure, a number of approaches for simulating spatial
   structures have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a simple
   approach that is capable of generating multispecies stand structures.
   Based on the method of copulas (Genest and MacKay, 1986, Am. Stat.
   40:280-283), we utilize a normal copula to simulate spatially correlated
   stand structures. Species composition, diameter, height, and crown ratio
   distributions of each species, and their correlation with underlying
   spatial patterns are all controlled by user inputs. Example data sets
   are used to demonstrate how to estimate required parameters and compare
   simulated spatial structures with observed spatial structures. Except at
   the smallest scales (<10 m in the longleaf pine dataset and <2 m in the
   mixed Acadian Forest dataset), the simulated stand structures adequately
   captured the observed spatial patterns. Based on these comparisons, we
   conclude that the system is capable of simulating a range of forest
   stand spatial structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical trialists involved in projects aimed at assessing
   the impact of a device or therapy on exercise capacity must select an
   end point that can detect a therapy-derived change and do so in a manner
   that is both sensitive to the change and valid. Using baseline data from
   the Prospective Evaluation of Elastic Restraint to Lessen the Effects of
   Heart Failure (PEERLESS-HF) trial, we describe the coefficient of
   variation (CV) for peak oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2)) and other
   parameters measured during a cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test.
   Methods: Prior to conducting CPX testing, a CPX core laboratory
   conducted training with testing staff at each site, and a standardized
   quality assurance protocol was completed. During screening, subjects
   performed two symptom-limited CPX tests (CPX-0 and CPX-1) within 14
   days.
   Results: The CVs for peak (V) over dotO(2) ventilatory efficiency, and
   ventilatory-derived anaerobic threshold were 5.9\%, 4.8\%, and 6.8\%,
   respectively. During CPX-0, the percentage of subjects with a
   respiratory exchange ratio (RER) <1.05 who increased their peak (V) over
   dotO(2) by >= 6\% during CPX-1 was 47\%, compared with 12\% of subjects
   also with an RER <1.05 who experienced a decrease in peak (V) over
   dotO(2) >= 6\%.
   Conclusions: In a multisite clinical trial setting, we showed that the
   achieved test-retest reproducibility for peak (V) over dotO(2), can be
   acceptable, as evidenced by a CV at 5.9\%. Until more data are available
   to identify patients who may demonstrate greater test-retest variance
   and to avoid repeat testing in all subjects at baseline, clinical
   trialists might consider repeating tests when RER < 1.05. Trial

Title = {{A Multiphase Method for Estimating Cohort Effects in Age-Period
   Contingency Table Data}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Understanding the effects of age, period, and cohort on disease
   morbidity and mortality may help identify etiological factors and inform
   prevention programs. We illustrate a three-phase method that
   conceptualizes the cohort effect as a partial interaction between age
   and period. As an example of application, we analyze homicide mortality
   data for males in the United States from 1935 through 2004.
   METHODS: The three-phased method begins with graphical inspection;
   second, a median polish is used to remove the log-additive components of
   age and period effects; third, a linear regression of residuals from the
   median polish is modeled to quantify the relative magnitude of the
   cohort effect.
   RESULTS: Individuals born after 1960 have a significantly increased rate
   of homicide relative to those born between 1920 and 1924. After removal
   of the log-additive effects of age and period, the estimated homicide
   rate for men born between 1980 and 1984 is more than twice the rate for
   men born between 1920 and 1924 (rate ratio, 2.11; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.98-2.25).
   CONCLUSION: The three-phase method presented herein offers several
   advantages, the foremost being an alternative conceptualization of the
   cohort effect not as an independent component of age and period effects,
   but as a partial interaction. In addition, the strengths of the method
   include computational simplicity, interpretability, and reliability. Ann

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to study the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   status and its role in P-uptake through assay of root phosphatases
   activities in four varieties of male Carica papaya L. viz. CO-1, CO-2,
   Honey Dew and Washington during flowering stages. In the present study,
   mean total root colonization of AM fungi recorded peak increase in
   flowering stage-II while mean root phosphatase (acid and alkaline)
   activities recorded peak increase in flowering stage-I. Unlike root
   colonization and root phosphatase activities, spore density did not
   exhibit any definite patterns and recorded a narrow range of fluctuation
   during different flowering stages of male C. papaya. The study brought
   out the fact that root colonization and spore density of AM fungi along
   with root phosphatase activities varied significantly within the four
   varieties of male C. papaya plants during each flowering stage. The
   study also recorded consistently higher acid root phosphatase activity
   than alkaline root phosphatase activity under P-deficient, acidic soil
   conditions during all flowering stages of male C papaya plants. Studies
   revealed that the root colonization of AM fungi influenced root
   phosphatase activities (acid and alkaline) positively and significantly
   during all flowering stages of male C. papaya plants. A total of twelve
   species of AM fungi belonging to five genera viz. Acaulospora,
   Dentiscutata, Gigaspora, Glomus, and Racocetra were recovered from the
   rhizosphere of male C. papaya plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the frequency and type of Acute Transfusion
   Reactions (ATRs) occurring in inpatients, reported to the transfusion
   service at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods: This was a three years and seven months (from January 2005 till
   July 2008) retrospective review of all the transfusion reactions that
   were reported to the transfusion service at Aga Khan University
   Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. All the reactions were clinically evaluated
   by the blood bank physician. Transfusion reactions occurring during or
   within four hours after transfusion were evaluated and classified by
   standard and recognized definitions defined by American Association of
   Blood Banks.
   Results: The acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) reported during the
   study period were 212. However, out of these 212 ATRs, 182 ATRs were
   confirmed by blood bank physician, and included febrile non haemolytic
   reactions {[}89 (41.9\%)], allergic. reaction {[}73 (34.4\%)], isolated
   hypotension {[}3 (1.4\%)], haemolytic reaction {[}4 (1.8\%)] and
   bacterial contamination {[}2 (0.9\%)]. Eleven (5.1\%) ATRs were
   unclassifiable and were thus labeled as non specific reaction.
   Conclusion: The frequency of transfusion reactions in our patients was
   found to be 0.082\%. Febrile non haemolytic reaction was the most
   frequent transfusion reaction followed by allergic reaction. This may be
   an under reported figure. There is a need for establishing a
   haemovigilance system for critical analysis of blood transfusion events
   (JPMA 60:832; 2010).}},

Abstract = {{The hot deformation behavior of Ti-55Ni (at. pct) alloy was studied
   using compression testing at 1173 K (900 A degrees C) to 1323 K (1050 A
   degrees C) and at the strain rates of 0.001 to 0.35 s(-1). The
   microstructure evolution was characterized using optical and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The influences of hot-working parameters on
   the flow stress and microstructural features of this alloy were then
   analyzed. The results indicate that, depending on the temperature and
   strain rate, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is the dominate
   mechanism. Besides, the particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN) mechanism
   could partially recrystallize the structure. The PSN phenomenon is of
   significant importance for the Ti-55Ni (at. pct) that suffers from
   insufficient workability because of its high content of intermetallic
   phases. It is of interest that the discontinuous yielding phenomenon has
   been observed when the specimens were deformed at 1173 K (900 A degrees
   C). Finally, the optimum parameters for hot working of Ti-55Ni (at. pct)
   alloy are determined as well.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol samples for PM2.5 were collected at a suburban site of India
   during Jan 2007 to Jan 2008. The sampling site is exposed to different
   antropic source emissions like vehicular emission, wood burning, coal
   based industries and other industrial activities. The mass
   concentrations of (PM2.5), major elements (Al, Si, P, S, Na, K, Ca, Ti,
   V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Te, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd. Sn, Sb, and Pb) and major ions
   (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, and NH4+) were determined for winter and rainy
   seasons. Their levels were found higher than those of in various
   European and American cities, however, comparable to those of some Asian
   cities. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant seasonal
   variation for concentrations of PM2.5, NO3-, SO42- and most of the
   elements. This seasonal variation is due to enhanced heating activities
   and stagnant climatic conditions in winter and removal of pollutants by
   wet deposition in the rainy period. Source apportionment was undertaken
   using enrichment factor (EF). Spearman's correlation and absolute
   principal component analysis. A five-factor model for explaining the
   observed PM2.5 levels was found to provide realistic results. Evaluation
   of element abundance at site indicates different pollution levels. The
   source identification of this study shows that PM2.5 levels were
   influenced by not only local and industrial activities but also long
   range transport. Traffic induced crustal sources (38\%); coal combustion
   (26\%), industrial and vehicular emissions (19\%), wood burning (9\%)
   and secondary aerosol formation (8\%) are the major contributors to
   PM2.5 levels in the city. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simple analytical model is developed to evaluate spatial distribution of
   sheet electron density in the channel of the high-electron mobility
   transistor (HEMT)-like structure periodically modulated by the bias
   voltages applied to interdigitated gate. Resonant frequencies of plasma
   oscillations excited in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel
   of such structures are evaluated in the ideal and realistic situations.
   The realistic model accounts for the ungated regions which due to
   nonideality of gate contact-2DEG channel system can be also affected by
   the gate bias voltages. It is shown that plasma resonances in realistic
   structures with fringed ungated regions deviate from those predicted by
   the ideal model. The model developed can be used to interpret the
   terahertz plasmon spectra measured experimentally. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Background: The consequences of a major incident at a sporting event
   could be catastrophic. Therefore, there should be an estimation of the
   healthcare resources at such events as part of the planning. Although
   there are National guidelines (e.g., Planning Safe Public Events:
   Practical Guidelines in Australia) defining the role of the healthcare
   system at sporting events, these guidelines either lack a simple
   calculating method to estimate the need for healthcare resources or the
   methods are complex and impractical to use. The objective of this study
   was to find a safe and easy method for the estimation of healthcare
   resources at sporting events.
   Methods: A model for the estimation of healthcare resources at music
   events recently has been approved in Sweden. After minor adjustments,
   this model was used at sport events by a number of planning officers.
   The models' accuracy and usability was evaluated by analyzing its
   outcome in a pilot and a controlled study using different sporting and
   non-sporting scenarios.
   Results: The pilot study showed that the model was valid and easily
   could be used for various sporting events. The obtained estimations were
   consistent with the methods used by experienced planning officers in
   97\% of cases. The results of the controlled study showed that by using
   this model, the minimum amount of resources required easily could be
   calculated at sporting events and by people with different backgrounds.
   Conclusions: This model safely can be used at sporting events.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{955-958}},

Abstract = {{Mollusks along the Pacific coast of South America provide one of the
   main exceptions from the latitudinal diversity gradient of decreasing
   species numbers toward the poles. From 42 degrees S southward,
   coincident with the onset of the mosaic coastline of the southern
   Chilean fiord-lands, species numbers show a twofold to threefold
   increase compared to the central Chilean coast. Here we use the Neogene
   fossil record of central and southern Chile to test hypotheses on the
   origin of this unusual pattern. Contrary to previous suggestions, we did
   not find evidence for a buildup of biodiversity since the Eocene, or for
   the northward spread of Antarctic taxa into southern mid-latitudes.
   Rather, our data suggest that the mosaic coastline south of 42 degrees S
   was colonized after the retreat of the glaciers from their marine
   termini since the later Pleistocene, by taxa that were already present
   along the Chilean coast. The majority of the most species-rich genera in
   this area are shallow-water hardground inhabitants, suggesting a rapid
   adaptive radiation of these taxa. The unusually low present-day
   diversity to the north of 42 degrees S most likely results from the
   severe late Neogene extinction and only moderate subsequent origination
   in this area.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the damp heat stability of Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) thin films

   the effect of the hard coating layer, GZO thin films were grown on PET
   substrates with and without a hard coating layer by rf-magnetron
   sputtering at room temperature. After the deposition, a clamp heat
   stability test was performed at 60 degrees C with a relative humidity of
   90\% for up to 150 hr. At the initial stage of the damp heat stability
   test, a rapid decay of the electrical property of GZO thin film was
   observed in both samples. In this experiment, the main mechanism of the
   degradation was a reduction of the mobility rather than the carrier
   concentration. The mobility of GZO on hard coated PET was saturated
   after the initial stage while there was further deterioration in the GZO
   thin film on bare PET. The origin was investigated with transmission
   electron microscopy and the result showed that the interfacial structure
   between the GZO thin film and the substrate play an important role in
   the damp heat stability.}},

Abstract = {{The proximity and topology among particles are often the most important
   factor for understanding the spatial structure of particles. Reasoning
   the morphological structure of molecules and reconstructing a surface
   from a point set are examples where proximity among particles is
   important. Traditionally, the Voronoi diagram of points, the power
   diagram, the Delaunay triangulation, and the regular triangulation, etc.
   have been used for understanding proximity among particles. In this
   paper, we present the theory of the beta-shape and the beta-complex and
   the corresponding algorithms for reasoning proximity among a set of
   spherical particles, both using the quasi-triangulation which is the
   dual of the Voronoi diagram of spheres. Given the Voronoi diagram of
   spheres, we first transform the Voronoi diagram to the
   quasi-triangulation. Then, we compute some intervals called
   beta-intervals for the singular, regular, and interior states of each
   simplex in the quasi-triangulation. From the sorted set of simplexes,
   the beta-shape and the beta-complex corresponding to a particular value
   of beta can be found efficiently. Given the Voronoi diagram of spheres,
   the quasi-triangulation can be obtained in O(m) time in the worst case,
   where m represents the number of simplexes in the quasi-triangulation.
   Then, the beta-intervals for all simplexes in the quasi-triangulation
   can also be computed in O(m) time in the worst case. After sorting the
   simplexes using the low bound values of the beta-intervals of each
   simplex in O(m log m) time, the beta-shape and the beta-complex can be
   computed in O(log m+k) time in the worst case by a binary search
   followed by a sequential search in the neighborhood, where k represents
   the number of simplexes in the beta-shape or the beta-complex. The
   presented theory of the beta-shape and the beta-complex will be equally
   useful for diverse areas such as structural biology, computer graphics,
   geometric modelling, computational geometry, CAD, physics, and
   chemistry, where the core hurdle lies in determining the proximity among
   spherical particles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study was to compare the abilities of
   undigested and enzymatically digested bifidobacteria to induce nitric
   oxide and cytokine release in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Nine different
   Bifidobacterium strains derived from herbivorous animals were digested
   with pepsin and then pancreatin, and the precipitates and supernatants
   were acquired via centrifugation. The RAW 264.7 cells were incubated
   with whole cells, the precipitate, or the supernatant, and the
   macrophage culture supernatants were analyzed with respect to the
   induction of nitric oxide and cytokines. Pronounced increases in the
   production of nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12, and
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were observed when cultured with
   whole cells and the precipitates. It is noteworthy that the precipitates
   in most of the Bifidobacterium strains evidenced a trend toward superior

Title = {{Prevalence Comparison of Accompanying Lesions Between Primary and
   Recurrent Anterior Dislocation in the Shoulder}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2071-2076}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many authors have reported the presence of intra-articular
   lesions after primary dislocation of the shoulder joint. However, few
   studies have focused on their prevalence or the differences in
   accompanying lesions between primary and recurrent dislocations of the
   shoulder joint.
   Purpose: This study was undertaken to investigate and analyze
   accompanying lesions, including types of anteroinferior labrum injuries,
   using diagnostic arthroscopy and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA)
   in 144 patients with traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder
   joint.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: There were 33 patients with 33 dislocations in the primary
   dislocation group and 111 patients with 111 dislocations in the
   recurrent dislocation group. Preoperative magnetic resonance
   arthrography and diagnostic arthroscopy were performed on all patients.
   Results: In the primary dislocation group, 8 Bankart lesions, 9 free
   anterior labrum periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) lesions, 4 bony
   Bankart lesions, and 1 adhesive ALPSA lesion were observed. In the
   recurrent dislocation group, 68 Bankart lesions, 11 free ALPSA lesions,
   13 bony Bankart lesions, 16 adhesive ALPSA lesions, and 1 glenoid
   articular rim disruption lesion were found. There were 22 (66.6\%) and
   109 (98.1\%) patients with lesions in the anteroinferior labrum in the
   primary and recurrent groups, respectively. There was a statistically
   significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .002). Also, there was
   a significant difference between the 2 groups in the prevalence of the
   Hill-Sachs lesion and inverted pear-shaped glenoid lesion (P = .008/P =
   .047). Inverted pear-shaped glenoids were observed in 15 patients in the
   recurrent group. In 139 of 144 patients, surgical findings of
   accompanying lesions coincided with magnetic resonance arthrography
   findings (96.5\%).
   Conclusion: Various forms of anteroinferior labral lesions were seen in
   patients with traumatic anterior dislocation of shoulder. The recurrent
   dislocation group showed a significantly higher prevalence of
   anteroinferior labral lesions and bony lesions in comparison with the
   primary group. In our study, magnetic resonance arthrography was an
   accurate method to assess accompanying lesions in first-time and
   recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder, suggesting that this may
   be a useful tool for determining a treatment method.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to investigate the effect of enzyme treatment
   with beta-glucosidase on antioxidant capacity of the mulberry leaf
   extract (MLE) using oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and
   cellular antioxidant capacity (CAC) assay. The MILE was prepared by
   autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 15 min and treated with
   beta-glucosidase for 9 hr. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
   analysis showed that only qercetin-3-beta-D-glucose (QT-G) among
   quercetin (QT) glycosides of MILE, including QT-G,
   quercetin-3-O-glucose-6 `'-acetate (QT-GA), and rutin (RT), was
   converted into QT by 3 hr treatment with beta-glucosidase. The in vitro
   peroxyl radical- and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity significantly
   increased after the enzyme treatment using beta-glucosidase for 6 and 9
   hr, respectively. The metal chelating activity increased after the
   enzyme treatment using beta-glucosidase for 3 hr. The intracellular
   antioxidant capacity of MLE to protect AAPH- and Cu2+-induced oxidative
   stress in HepG2 cells significantly increased after the enzyme treatment
   using beta-glucosidase for 3 and 6 hr, respectively, indicating that QT
   may be released from QT-G by beta-glucosidase and penetrate into cell
   membrane so that it can contribute to the intracellular antioxidant
   capacity of MLE.}},

Title = {{A Bankruptcy Problem Approach to Load-shedding in Multiagent-based
   Microgrid Operation}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},

Abstract = {{A microgrid is composed of distributed power generation systems (DGs),
   distributed energy storage devices (DSs), and loads. To maintain a
   specific frequency in the islanded mode as an important requirement, the
   control of DGs' output and charge action of DSs are used in supply
   surplus conditions and load-shedding and discharge action of DSs are
   used in supply shortage conditions. Recently, multiagent systems for
   autonomous microgrid operation have been studied. Especially,
   load-shedding, which is intentional reduction of electricity use, is a
   critical problem in islanded microgrid operation based on the multiagent
   system. Therefore, effective schemes for load-shedding are required.
   Meanwhile, the bankruptcy problem deals with dividing short resources
   among multiple agents. In order to solve the bankruptcy problem,
   division rules, such as the constrained equal awards rule (CEA), the
   constrained equal losses rule (CEL), and the random arrival rule (RA),
   have been used. In this paper, we approach load-shedding as a bankruptcy
   problem. We compare load-shedding results by above-mentioned rules in
   islanded microgrid operation based on wireless sensor network (WSN) as
   the communication link for an agent's interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular signals driving the regenerative process in distraction
   osteogenesis (DO) involve a complex system of cellular behavior
   triggered by mechanical strain. However, it remains unclear how
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) adapt to osteogenic demands during DO.
   We hypothesized that human MSCs (hMSCs) modulate early osteogenic
   metabolism during exposure to static stretch. The proliferation of hMSCs
   was increased by static stretch, which, in turn, suppressed TGF-beta
   1-mediated decreases in cell proliferation. The amount of stretching
   force applied had little effect on osteoblast differentiation of hMSCs
   induced by dexamethasone treatment. However, this strain induced
   sustained production of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF), which are critical factors in angiogenesis, from
   differentiated hMSCs. Mechanical stretch involved ERK and p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the selective inhibitors of
   which decreased static-stretch-induced VEGF production. These findings
   provide evidence that hMSCs act to facilitate early osteogenic
   metabolism during exposure to static stretch.}},

Abstract = {{Objective of this research was to investigate the effect of various
   potassium concentrations in fertilizer solution on growth of and
   nutrient uptake by `Chugyang' eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). Tissue
   analyses were conducted to determine the threshold levels of potassium
   in plants when disorders develop for potassium. The lower leaves of K
   deficient plants became spotted, yellowing ill color, and finally
   necrosis occurred. The necrosis spread inward and upward. K toxic plants
   developed necrotic spot at the margin of old leaves and the surface of
   old leaves were twisted. The tissue K contents in the most recently
   fully expanded leaves and dry weight of full above ground plant tissue
   at 35 days after transplanting showed linear and quadratic response to
   elevated K concentrations with the equation of y=1.127+0.3147x
   (R-2=0.8916) and y=14.92+2.2743x-0.1402x(2) (R-2=0.8659). When 10\%
   reduction in dry weight set to threshold levels, optimum tissue K
   contents are in the range from 2.1 to 5.1\%. The yield through 150 days
   after transplanting and tissue K contents at 150 days after
   transplanting also showed quadratic and linear responses to elevated
   potassium concentrations in fertigation solution with the equation of
   y=153.24+345.5x-18.46x(2) (R-2=0.8620) and y=0.9921+0.3860x
   (R-2=0.9611), respectively. When the 10\% reduction in yield is set to
   threshold levels, the tissue K contents for maximum yield should be
   around 3.4\% to 5.9\% in most recently fully expanded leaves.}},

Abstract = {{Telomerase extends the 3'-ends of linear chromosomes by adding conserved
   telomeric DNA repeats and is essential for cell proliferation and
   genomic stability. Telomerases from all organisms contain a telomerase
   reverse transcriptase and a telomerase RNA (TER), which together provide
   the minimal functional elements for catalytic activity in vitro. The RNA
   component of many functional ribonucleoproteins contains modified
   nucleotides, including conserved pseudouridines (Psi s) that can have
   subtle effects on structure and activity. We have identified potential
   Psi modification sites in human TER. Two of the predicted Psi s are
   located in the loop of the essential P6.1 hairpin from the CR4-CR5
   domain that is critical for telomerase catalytic activity. We
   investigated the effect of P6.1 pseudouridylation on its solution NMR
   structure, thermodynamic stability of folding and telomerase activation
   in vitro. The pseudouridylated P6.1 has a significantly different loop
   structure and increase in stability compared to the unmodified P6.1. The
   extent of loop nucleotide interaction with adjacent residues more
   closely parallels the extent of loop nucleotide evolutionary sequence
   conservation in the Psi-modified P6.1 structure.
   Pseudouridine-modification of P6.1 slightly attenuates telomerase
   activity but slightly increases processivity in vitro. Our results
   suggest that Psi s could have a subtle influence on human telomerase
   activity via impact on TER-TERT or TER-TER interactions.}},

   Corrosion Cracking of Bottom-Mounted Instrumentation Penetration Mock-Up}},

Abstract = {{The present article is concerned with the effect of a residual stress
   induced by a dissimilar metal welding on stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
   of an Alloy 600 (UNS N06600) bottom-mounted instrumentation nozzle as a
   penetration mock-up in a pressurized water reactor: From a finite
   element analysis (FEA), the changes in the inner diameter (ID) of the
   nozzle and hoop and axial stresses on the inner surface of the nozzle
   were calculated with various conditions of materials, mock-up design,
   and welding constraints. The ID change by welding and its dependence on
   the wall thickness of the nozzle calculated from the FEA were consistent
   with those measured from the mock-up, verifying the validity of the FEA
   model. In a highly acidic solution of sodium tetrathionate
   (Na(2)S(4)O(6)) at room temperature, the SCC behavior of the sensitized
   Alloy 600 nozzle in the mock-up was closely related with the
   characteristics of the residual stress in the inner surface of the
   nozzle. Axial cracks were observed in the inner surface of the nozzle in
   the J-weld region where the tensile hoop stress was expected, while
   circumferential cracks were found beyond both the J-weld root and face
   where the tensile axial stress was predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium plays a role as a signaling molecule in various cellular events.
   It has been reported that calcium suppresses adipocyte differentiation
   only in the early phase of adipogenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that
   treatment of A23187, a mobilizer of intracellular calcium, on day 4 post
   adipocyte differentiation could still reduce lipid accumulation in
   differentiating 3T3-L1 cells for 48 h. In addition, luciferase reporter
   gene and RT-Q-PCR assays demonstrate that A23187 can selectively inhibit
   transcriptional activities and expression of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha,
   suggesting that A23187 may reduce lipid accumulation in the late phase
   of adipogenesis via downregulation of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha
   expression and transactivation. Moreover, inhibition of HDAC activity by
   trichostatin A (TSA) partially blocked A23187-mediated downregulation of
   transcriptional activities of PPAR gamma and LXRa. Together, our data
   demonstrate that calcium mobilization inhibits expression and
   transcriptional activities of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha, resulting in
   reduced lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocytes, and thus,
   mobilization of intracellular calcium in adipocytes may serve as a new
   preventive and therapeutic approach for obesity.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic exchange of histone lysine methylation status by histone
   methyltransferases and demethylases has been previously implicated as an
   important factor in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.
   Using immunoaffinity TAP analysis, we purified the WHISTLE-interacting
   protein complexes, which include the heat shock protein HSP90 alpha and
   the jumonji C-domain harboring the histone demethylase JMJD1C. In this
   study, we demonstrate that JMJD1C specifically demethylates histone H3K9
   mono- and di-methylation, and mediates transcriptional activation. We
   also provide evidence suggesting that both WHISTLE and JMJD1C performs
   functions in the development of mouse testes by regulating the
   expression of the steroidogenesis marker, p450c17, via SF-1-mediated
   transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WHISTLE is recruited to
   the p450c17 promoter via SF-1 and represses the transcription of
   prepubertal stages of steroidogenesis, after which JMJD1C replaces
   WHISTLE and activates the expression of target genes via SF-1-mediated
   interactions. Our results demonstrate that the histone methylation
   balance mediated by HMTase WHISTLE and demethylase JMJD1C perform a
   transcriptional regulatory function in mouse testis development.}},

Abstract = {{Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic against a wide range
   of solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by severe side
   effects such as cardiotoxicity as well as inherent and acquired drug
   resistance of tumors. DOX encapsulation within self-assembled polymeric
   micelles has the potential to decrease the systemic distribution of free
   drug and enhance the drug accumulation in the tumor via the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR). In this study. DOX was encapsulated in
   micelles composed of poly (ethylene oxide)-poly
   {[}(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate]-poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO-PHB-PEO) triblock
   copolymers. Micelle size, DOX loading and DOX release were
   characterized. To evaluate DOX activity, micelles were tested in both
   monolayer cell cultures and three-dimensional (3-D) multicellular
   spheroids (MCS) that mimic solid tumors. Antitumor activity in vivo was
   further studied with tumor-bearing mice. The micelles improved the
   efficiency of Dox penetration in 3-D MCS compared with free DOX.
   Efficient cell killing by Dox-micelles in both monolayer cells and 3-D
   MCS was also demonstrated. Finally, DOX-loaded micelles mediate
   efficient tumor delivery from tail vein injections to tumor-bearing mice
   with much less toxicity compared with free DOX. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sulfur-iodine (SI) cycle should overcome many engineering challenges to
   commercialize and prove its feasibilities to compete other
   thermo-chemical cycles. Some critical issues such as structural
   material, harsh operating condition and high capital costs were
   considered obstacles to be actualized. Operating SI cycle at
   low-pressure is one of the solutions to actualize the cycle. The flash
   operation with over-azeotropic HI at low pressure does not require
   temperature and pressure as high as those in the existing methods as
   well as heating for separation. The operation in low pressure reduces
   corrosion problems and enables us to use flexible selection of
   structural material. We devised an intermediate heat
   exchanging-depressurizing loop to eliminate high operating pressure in
   the hydrogen side as well as a large pressure difference between the
   reactor side and the hydrogen side. Molten salts are adequate candidates
   as working fluids under the high-temperature condition with homogeneous
   phase during pressure changing process. Using molten salts, 2.20-4.65 MW
   of pumping work is required to change the pressure from 1 bar to 7 MPa.
   We selected BeF2-containing salts as the possible candidates based on
   preliminary economic and thermal hydraulic consideration. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Transient behaviour is a key parameter for the vehicular application of
   proton-exchange membrane (REM) fuel cell. The goal of this presentation
   is to construct better control technology to increase the dynamic
   performance of a REM fuel cell. The REM fuel cell model comprises a
   compressor, an injection pump, a humidifier, a cooler, inlet and outlet
   manifolds, and a membrane-electrode assembly. The model includes the
   dynamic states of current, voltage, relative humidity, stoichiometry of
   air and hydrogen, cathode and anode pressures, cathode and anode mass
   flow rates, and power. Anode recirculation is also included with the
   injection pump, as well as anode purging, for preventing anode flooding.
   A steady-state, isothermal analytical fuel cell model is constructed to
   analyze the mass transfer and water transportation in the membrane. In
   order to prevent the starvation of air and flooding in a REM fuel cell,
   time delay control is suggested to regulate the optimum stoichiometry of
   oxygen and hydrogen, even when there are dynamical fluctuations of the
   required REM fuel cell power. To prove the dynamical performance
   improvement of the present method, feed-forward control and Linear
   Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with a state estimator are compared.
   Matlab/Simulink simulation is performed to validate the proposed
   methodology to increase the dynamic performance of a PEM fuel cell
   system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The article examines the process of innovation and knowledge sharing
   from a perspective that focuses on the influence that local
   circumstances can have. In particular, it looks at the problems of
   knowledge sharing between groups of professionals. It presents a
   comparative analysis of two studies, one involving two groups of IT
   professionals; the other a network of healthcare professionals. The data
   was collected in two sets. The first set consisted of the results from
   two earlier, independent studies; the second was collected specifically
   for this article. We investigate the role played by boundary objects and
   brokers. Through an analysis of the interplay between boundary object
   and broker, we uncover the dynamics of the innovation process and show
   that the role played by the broker can be political. We identify two
   strategies that are used by brokers in the selection of a boundary
   object. The first is directed towards achieving a balance between the
   actors involved and the second is directed towards controlling their
   activities. We conclude by suggesting that other researchers should also
   consider the interplay between broker and boundary object when examining
   cross-boundary knowledge sharing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper describes the effect of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on
   joint properties of copper-zinc alloy (brass) and low carbon steel
   friction welded joints. The as-welded joint obtained 100\% joint

   weld interface, and had no intermetallic compound layer. The joint
   efficiency with PWHT decreased with increasing heating temperature and
   its holding time, and its scatter increased with those increasing
   parameters. When the joint was heat treated at 823 K for 360 ks, it did
   not achieve 100\% joint efficiency and fractured between the weld
   interface and the brass base metal although it had no intermetallic
   compound. The cracking at the peripheral portion of the weld interface
   was generated through PWHT. The cracking was due to the dezincification
   and the embrittlement of the brass side during PWHT.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic hypothermia remains a promising treatment for patients with
   severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Multiple animal studies have
   suggested that hypothermia is neuroprotective after TBI, but clinical
   trials have been inconclusive. Systemic hypothermia, the method used in
   almost all major clinical trials, is limited by the time to target
   temperature, the depth of hypothermia, and complications, problems that
   may be solved by selective brain cooling. We evaluated the effects on
   brain temperature of a cooling device called the ChillerPad,(TM) which
   is applied to the dura in a non-human primate TBI model using controlled
   cortical impact (CCI). The cortical surface was rapidly cooled to
   approximately 15 degrees C and maintained at that level for 24 h,
   followed by rewarming over about 10 h. Brain temperatures fell to 34-35
   degrees C at a depth of 15 mm at the cortical gray/white matter
   interface, and to 28-32 degrees C at 10 mm deep. Intracranial pressure
   was mildly elevated (8-12 mm Hg) after cooling and rewarming, likely due
   to TBI. Other physiological variables were unchanged. Cooling was
   rapidly diminished at points distant from the cooling pad. The
   ChillerPad may be useful for highly localized cooling of the brain in
   circumstances in which a craniotomy is clinically indicated. However,
   because of the delay required by the craniotomy, other methods that are
   more readily available for inducing hypothermia may be used as a bridge
   between the time of injury to placement of the ChillerPad.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic pancreatitis is a debilitating disease resulting in pain,

   chronic pancreatitis. Data for patients undergoing operations for
   chronic pancreatitis between 1990 and 2009 were reviewed. Demographics,
   operative and perioperative data, and survival were catalogued. QoL was
   determined (Short Form 36 and European Organisation for Research and
   Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire + PAN-26) and compared
   with historical controls. The mean age was 51 +/- 2 years, 38 patients
   were male (53\%), the most common indication was pain (71\%), the
   etiology of pancreatitis often was alcohol, and most patients underwent
   a Whipple procedure (56\%). Operative time was 316 +/- 17 minutes and
   blood loss was 363 +/- 75 mL. There were 34 complications in 30 patients
   (42\%) and one death. QoL surveys were administered for 25 of 55 (45\%)
   surviving patients at a mean follow-up of 72 16 months. Mean survival
   was 99 +/- 9 months, whereas 5- and 10-year survival were 86 and 75 per
   cent. QoL scores were uniformly better than historical controls. Our
   data demonstrate that operations for chronic pancreatitis can be
   performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Patients have
   excellent survival and improved QoL compared with historical controls.
   Surgery is an effective and durable treatment option for patients with

Abstract = {{Goserelin acetate, which is injected through a 16-gauge needle, makes
   some patients feel substantial, although tolerable, pain. We tried to
   clarify whether injection pain was reduced by icing the skin at the
   injection site.
   Pain associated with the injection of goserelin acetate was
   prospectively evaluated in 48 patients who had received an 10.8-mg
   goserelin injection at least once previously. In this study, the first
   injection was administered by usual methods, and 3 months later a second
   injection was administered after icing the skin at the injection site.
   Pain intensity was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score.
   VAS pain scores for the usual injection method were 32.4 +/- A 21.7 mm
   {[}mean +/- A 2 standard deviation (SD)] and was significantly lower
   (16.4 +/- A 17.9) for the icing method (p = 0.001, paired t test).
   Thirty-three (68.8\%), eight (16.7\%), and seven (14.6\%) of the 48
   patients reported a decrease, no change, and increase, respectively, in
   VAS pain score by the icing method.
   Icing at the injection site of goserelin acetate is a safe and effective
   method to reduce injection pain. This method can be easily performed in
   daily practice if a patient complains of pain at the injection site.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT HIV RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{510-514}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate HIV-1 incidence and cofactors for HIV-1
   incidence during pregnancy and postpartum.
   Design: Retrospective study among women who were HIV seronegative during
   pregnancy.
   Methods: Mothers accompanying their infants for routine 6-week
   immunizations at 6 maternal child health clinics in Nairobi and Western
   Kenya were tested for HIV-1 after completing a questionnaire that
   included assessment of sociodemographics, obstetric history and HIV-1
   risk perception.
   Results: Of 2,135 mothers who had tested HIV-1 seronegative antenatally,
   2,035 (95.3\%) accepted HIV-1 re-testing at 6 weeks postpartum. Of
   these, 53 (2.6\%) were HIV-1 seropositive yielding an estimated HIV-1
   incidence of 6.8 (95\% CI: 5.1-8.8) per 100 woman-years). Mothers who
   seroconverted were more likely to be employed (45.3\% vs 29.0\%,
   p=0.01), married (96.2 vs 86.6\%, p=0.04) and from a higher HIV-1
   prevalence region (60.4\% in Western Kenya vs 28.8\% in Nairobi,
   p<0.001). Among married women, those in polygamous relationship were
   significantly more likely to seroconvert (19.6\% vs 6.7\%, p<0.001). In
   multivariate analysis, region and employment independently predicted
   seroconversion.
   Conclusions: Repeat HIV-1 testing in early postpartum was highly
   acceptable and resulted in detection of substantial HIV-1 incidence
   during pregnancy and postpartum period. Within prevention of
   mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission programs strategic approaches to

Abstract = {{A systematic investigation of a series of magnesium-calcium binary
   alloys is presented to reveal the influence of increasing calcium (Ca)
   additions on the in vitro degradation of magnesium (Mg). Because of its
   prevalence in structural tissues, Ca is among the most biologically
   viable additions to orthopedic-intended Mg-based biomaterials. Hence, a
   fundamental electrochemical study of Ca additions to Mg biomaterials is
   essential to its continued role as an alloying addition. In this work,
   in vitro degradation conditions closer to the physiological environment
   were implemented through the addition of proteins to simulated body
   fluid and maintenance of a constant pH, with tests conducted using Hanks
   solution, minimum essential medium (MEM), and MEM containing fetal
   bovine serum. Alloying with Ca leads to the formation of Mg2Ca
   intermetallic particles that result in systematically enhanced
   dissolution kinetics. This observation is rationalized via
   micro-electrochemical tests upon the Mg2Ca intermetallic in isolation,
   which reveals rapid anodic kinetics. Hence, the extent of MgCa alloy
   dissolution can be modified depending on the amount of Mg2Ca present,
   suggesting that Ca can be deployed as a functional addition capable of
   not only enhancing bio-dissolution of the alloy, but being able to do
   this in a systematic, controllable manner depending on its volume
   fraction. In addition, up to a 3-fold reduction in the corrosion rate is
   observed with corrosion testing in an albumin-containing medium when
   compared to Hanks solution, the results highlighting that the use of a
   physiologically ``correct{''} medium is essential for the in vitro
   screening of Mg-based alloys suitable for orthopaedic applications. (C)

Title = {{Outcome After Discontinuing Prophylactic Antibiotics in Children With

Abstract = {{Purpose: Treatment for vesicoureteral reflux remains controversial.
   Lacking an evidence-based treatment protocol, we offered the option of
   terminating prophylactic antibiotics in otherwise healthy patients with
   persistent vesicoureteral reflux at age 5 years or greater. We report
   outcomes with respect to the urinary tract infection incidence and to
   whether surgical intervention was eventually done.
   Materials and Methods: We obtained institutional review board approval
   to retrospectively review the records of all children with
   vesicoureteral reflux from December 1999 to February 2009. Of this group
   we selected children 5 years old or older who had been taken off
   prophylactic antibiotics. We assessed children with primary
   vesicoureteral reflux in detail.
   Results: The records of 1,217 that we reviewed showed that antibiotics
   were discontinued in 185 patients, including 160 girls (89\%) and 25
   boys (11\%), at an average age of 6.2 years. Average followup was 2.0
   years with recorded followup up to 8 years off prophylaxis. In 50 girls
   (91\%) and 5 boys (9\%), urinary tract infection developed after
   discontinuing prophylaxis. Correction was done in 57 patients, including
   open repair in 34 and endoscopic injection in 23. Two patients underwent
   intervention at parent request after an average of 0.7 years of
   uneventful observation. We identified no parameter predicting patients
   at risk for urinary tract infection.
   Conclusions: Urinary tract infection develops in 29\% of patients 5
   years old or older with persistent vesicoureteral reflux within 2 years
   after the cessation of prophylaxis. Most of these cases are febrile.
   Discontinuing antibiotics is reasonable but a prospective, randomized,
   long-term, multi-institutional trial is required to determine whether
   this approach is beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Of 14 transgenic poplar genotypes (Populus tremula x Populus alba) with
   antisense 4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase that were grown in the field
   for 2 years, five that had substantial lignin reductions also had
   greatly reduced xylem-specific conductivity compared with that of
   control trees and those transgenic events with small reductions in
   lignin. For the two events with the lowest xylem lignin contents
   (greater than 40\% reduction), we used light microscopy methods and acid
   fuchsin dye ascent studies to clarify what caused their reduced
   transport efficiency. A novel protocol involving dye stabilization and
   cryo-fluorescence microscopy enabled us to visualize the dye at the
   cellular level and to identify water-conducting pathways in the xylem.
   Cryo-fixed branch segments were planed in the frozen state on a sliding
   cryo-microtome and observed with an epifluorescence microscope equipped
   with a cryo-stage. We could then distinguish clearly between
   phenolic-occluded vessels, conductive (stain-filled) vessels, and
   nonconductive (water-or gas-filled) vessels. Low-lignin trees contained
   areas of nonconductive, brown xylem with patches of collapsed cells and
   patches of noncollapsed cells filled with phenolics. In contrast,
   phenolics and nonconductive vessels were rarely observed in normal
   colored wood of the low-lignin events. The results of cryo-fluorescence
   light microscopy were supported by observations with a confocal
   microscope after freeze drying of cryo-planed samples. Moreover, after
   extraction of the phenolics, confocal microscopy revealed that many of
   the vessels in the nonconductive xylem were blocked with tyloses. We
   conclude that reduced transport efficiency of the transgenic low-lignin
   xylem was largely caused by blockages from tyloses and phenolic deposits
   within vessels rather than by xylem collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the
   relevance of using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
   (MLPA) for detection of selected microdeletion syndromes (22q11,
   Prader-Wilh/Angelman, Miller-Dieker, Smith-Magenis, Ip-, Williams), the
   reciprocal microduplication syndromes and imbalance at the subtelomere
   regions of chromosomes in a routine prenatal setting
   Method A total of 530 prenatal samples wet e analysed by commercial MLPA
   kits (SALSA P064. P036 and P069) in addition to rapid aneuploidy testing
   and G-band karyotyping
   Results Among the prenatal samples with a normal metaphase karyotype,
   nine submicroscopic imbalances were detected. seven 22q11 deletions
   (Velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome), one 15q11 deletion (Prader-Willi
   syndrome) and one terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4
   (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome). All imbalances were found in amniocentesis
   (AC) taken due to fetal structural malformation and/or other ultrasound
   scan (US) detected abnormality. The diagnostic yield was 4 1\% in the
   subgroup with structural malformation and 1 6\% in the subgroup with
   other US abnormality
   Conclusion The data set substantiates that additional MLPA analyses for
   selected microdeletions and subtelomere imbalances ate valuable in
   routine prenatal diagnostics. when a malformation(s) and/or other
   abnormalities are detected by US In contrast. the additional MLPA

Abstract = {{Caecilians have a unique dual jaw-closing system in that jaw closure is
   driven by the ancestral jaw-closing muscles (mm. levatores mandibulae)
   plus a secondarily recruited hyobranchial muscle (m. interhyoideus
   posterior). There is a variety of feeding habits (suction feeding, skin
   feeding, intrauterine scraping, and biting) during ontogeny that relate
   to reproductive modes in different caecilian species. This study
   examines the cranial biomechanics of caecilians in the suction-feeding
   larva of Ichthyophis cf. kohtaoensis, in the embryo and juvenile of the
   skin-feeding Boulengerula taitana, and in a newborn of the intrauterine
   feeder Typhlonectes natans. A lever arm model was applied to calculate
   effective mechanical advantages of jaw-closing muscles over gape angles
   and to predict total bite force in developing caecilians. In I. cf.
   kohtaoensis, Notable differences were found in the larval jaw-closing
   system compared to that of the adult. The suction-feeding larva of I.
   cf. kohtaoensis has comparatively large mm. levatores mandibulae that
   insert with an acute muscle fiber angle to the lower jaw and a m.
   interhyoideus posterior that has its optimal leverage at small gape
   angles. Conversely, the skin-feeding juvenile of B. taitana and the
   neonate T. natans are very similar in the feeding parameters considered
   herein compared to adult caecilians. Some ontogenetic variation in the
   feeding system of B. taitana before the onset of feeding was present.
   This study contributes to our understanding of the functional demands
   that feeding habits put on the development of cranial structures. (C)

Title = {{Direct integration and non-perturbative effects in matrix models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We show how direct integration can be used to solve the closed
   amplitudes of multi-cut matrix models with polynomial potentials. In the
   case of the cubic matrix model, we give explicit expressions for the
   ring of non-holomorphic modular objects that are needed to express all
   closed matrix model amplitudes. This allows us to integrate the
   holomorphic anomaly equation up to holomorphic modular terms that we fix
   by the gap condition up to genus four. There is an one-dimensional
   submanifold of the moduli space in which the spectral curve becomes the
   Seiberg-Witten curve and the ring reduces to the non-holomorphic modular
   ring of the group G(2). On that submanifold, the gap conditions
   completely fix the holomorphic ambiguity and the model can be solved

Abstract = {{To restore physiological function through regenerative medicine,
   biomaterials introduced into the body must degrade at a rate that
   matches new tissue formation. For effective therapies, it is essential
   that we understand the interaction between physiological factors, such
   as routine mechanical loading specific to sites of implantation, and the
   resultant rate of material degradation. These relationships are poorly
   characterized at this time. We hypothesize that mechanical forces alter
   the rates of remodeling of biomaterials, and this impact is modulated by
   the concentration of enzymes and the duration of the mechanical loads
   encountered in situ. To test this hypothesis we subjected silk fibroin
   fibers to repeated cyclic loading in the presence of enzymatic
   degradation (either alpha-chymotrypsin or Protease XIV) and recorded the
   stress-strain response. Data were collected daily for a duration of 2
   weeks and compared to the control cases of stretched fibers in the
   presence of phosphate buffered saline or non-stretched samples in the
   presence of enzyme alone. We observed that incubation with proteases in
   the absence of mechanical loads causes a reduction of the ultimate
   tensile strength but no change in stiffness. However, cyclic loading
   caused the accumulation of residual strain and softening in the
   material's properties. We utilize these data to formulate a mathematical
   model to account for residual strain and reduction of mechanical
   properties during silk fiber degradation. Numerical predictions are in
   fair agreement with experimental data. The improved understanding of the
   degradation phenomenon will be significant in many clinical repair cases
   and may be synergistic to decrease silk's mechanical properties after in
   vivo implantation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have combined ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry with tandem
   mass spectrometry to characterise large, non-covalently bound
   macromolecular complexes in terms of mass, shape (cross-sectional area)
   and stability (dissociation) in a single experiment. The results
   indicate that the quaternary architecture of a complex influences its
   residual shape following removal of a single subunit by
   collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. Complexes whose
   subunits are bound to several neighbouring subunits to create a
   ring-like three-dimensional (3D) architecture undergo significant
   collapse upon dissociation. In contrast, subunits which have only a
   single neighbouring subunit within a complex retain much of their
   original shape upon complex dissociation. Specifically, we have
   determined the architecture of two transient, on-pathway intermediates
   observed during in vitro viral capsid assembly. Knowledge of the mass,
   stoichiometry and cross-sectional area of each viral assembly
   intermediate allowed us to model a range of potential structures based
   on the known X-ray structure of the coat protein building blocks.
   Comparing the cross-sectional areas of these potential architectures
   before and after dissociation provided tangible evidence for the
   assignment of the topologies of the complexes, which have been found to
   encompass both the 3-fold and the 5-fold symmetry axes of the final
   icosahedral viral shell. Such insights provide unique information about
   virus assembly pathways that could allow the design of anti-viral
   therapeutics directed at the assembly step. This methodology can be
   readily applied to the structural characterisation of many other
   non-covalently bound macromolecular complexes and their assembly
   pathways. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer immunotherapy with NKT cells is a potential new treatment
   strategy for advanced head and neck cancer. NKT cell therapy is
   promising due to its unique anti-tumor activity and higher degree of
   safety compared to current therapies. Radiotherapy is indispensable as a
   standard treatment for advanced head and neck cancer. To elucidate the
   possibility of using NKT cells as an adjuvant immunotherapy with
   radiotherapy, we examined the effect of radiotherapy on NKT cells in
   patients with head and neck cancer.
   The number, IFN-gamma production and proliferation capacity of NKT cells
   were analyzed before and after 50 Gy radiation therapy in 12 patients
   with stage IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The cytotoxic
   activity of NKT cells was examined in vitro.
   The number of NKT cells in the blood varied widely between patients.
   After radiation therapy, the population of CD3 T cells decreased
   significantly, while the NKT cell population remained stable. The number
   of NKT cells was the same after radiation therapy as before. IFN-gamma
   production from NKT cells collected just after radiotherapy was impaired
   after stimulation with exogenous ligand, but the proliferative responses
   of these NKT cells was enhanced in comparison to those collected before
   radiation therapy. Furthermore, the proliferated NKT cells displayed a
   significant level of anti-tumor activity.
   NKT cells are relatively resistant to radiation and might therefore be
   suitable for adjuvant immunotherapy to eradicate remnant cancer cells in
   patients who have undergone radiation therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Chemokine receptor CXCR4 is known to be crucially involved in tumor
   progression, but the role of its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1
   (SDF-1), remains unclear. The present study was conducted to clarify the
   clinicopathological and prognostic impact of SDF-1 expression in
   invasive breast cancers. Expression of SDF-1 mRNA and protein was
   examined in five breast cancer cell lines with or without estradiol
   treatment. In 52 surgically resected breast cancers, the level of SDF-1
   mRNA in frozen samples and the pattern of SDF-1 protein immunoreactivity
   in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were compared. In
   another cohort of 223 breast cancers, the correlation between SDF-1
   immunoreactivity and clinicopathological parameters was examined using a
   tissue microarray. Estradiol treatment markedly increased the expression
   of SDF-1 mRNA and protein in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cell
   lines, MCF-7 and T47D. Among the 52 resected breast cancers, those with
   a cytoplasmic-dominant pattern of SDF-1 expression showed higher SDF-1
   mRNA levels (median 27.4) than those with a membrane-dominant or
   negative pattern (median 13.6, P = 0.0017). Accordingly, the
   cytoplasmic-dominant pattern was defined as ``high SDF-1 expression,{''}
   and other patterns were defined as ``low SDF-1 expression.{''} Among the
   cohort of 223 tumors, ``high SDF-1 expression{''} was detected in 158
   (70.9\%) and was significantly correlated with ER positivity (P <
   0.0001), HER2 negativity (P = 0.021), and lower grade (P < 0.0001).
   Univariate analysis demonstrated that ``high SDF-1 expression{''} was a
   significant indicator of better clinical outcome in both the entire
   patient cohort (P = 0.017) and the 133 patients with ER-positive tumors
   (P = 0.036), but not in the 90 patients with ER-negative tumors.
   Multivariate analysis showed that SDF-1 status was an independent factor
   related to overall survival in patients with ER-positive tumors (P =
   0.046). SDF-1 status is a significant prognostic factor and may be
   clinically useful for assigning adjuvant therapy to patients with
   ER-positive invasive breast cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced obesity

   Methods Female Swiss mice were submitted to a high-fat diet for 16

   pressure, relaxation in response to acetylcholine in aortic rings in the
   absence and the presence of the superoxide anion scavenger, superoxide
   dismutase (SOD, 150 U/ml), and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B
   inhibitor, sodium salicylate (5 mmol/l). Aortic protein expression of
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Cu/Zn-SOD, NF-kappa B, I kappa

   Results Obese mice presented higher systolic and diastolic blood

   acetylcholine, but not to sodium nitroprusside, was significantly
   decreased in obese mice and was corrected by both SOD and sodium
   salicylate (P<0.05). The protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase and Cu/Zn-SOD was significantly decreased in aorta from obese
   mice (P<0.05). Total p65 NF-kappa B subunit protein expression was not
   affected by obesity, but the protein expression of NF-kappa B inhibitor
   I kappa B-alpha was lower in aorta from obese mice (P<0.05). There were
   no significant differences in the interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6
   protein expression between groups. In contrast, the expression of
   TNF-alpha was significantly increased in aortas from obese mice.
   Conclusion Our resultssuggest that the reducedantioxidant defense and
   the local NF-kappa B pathway play an important role in the impairment of
   endothelium-dependent relaxation in aorta from obese mice. J Hypertens

Abstract = {{This paper aims at providing reliable methods of assessing moisture in
   oil-paper-insulated power transformers. The traditional method of
   moisture evaluation, oil sampling with the subsequent application of an
   equilibrium diagram, suffers from severe errors resulting in an
   overestimation of water concentration. To improve this, moisture
   sorption in cellulose (paper, press-board) and moisture solubility in
   insulation oils were theoretically described and represented as sorption
   isotherms and equilibrium diagrams under the special consideration of
   aging. Several steps lead to the key recommendation of this paper, which
   is to use water saturation in oil and in cellulose to describe water in
   power transformers. The practical application and the use of vegetable
   oils are considered as well.}},

   structured in such a way, that the column caps were coated with a
   protein-adherent layer. In the second approach, the whole surface except

   the column cap surfaces in a subsequent step with anti-A antibodies,
   selective attachment of erythrocytes of blood group A was observed.}},

Abstract = {{The anti-anginal efficacy of the selective I(f) inhibitor ivabradine has
   been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. However, there is
   limited information about the safety and efficacy of a combined
   treatment of ivabradine with beta-blockers, particularly outside of
   clinical trials in every day practice. This analysis from the REDUCTION
   study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a combined therapy of
   beta-blockers and ivabradine in every day practice.
   In this multi-center study 4,954 patients with stable angina pectoris
   were treated with ivabradine in every day routine practice and underwent
   a clinical follow-up for 4 months. 344 of these patients received a
   co-medication with beta-blockers. Heart rate (HR), angina pectoris
   episodes, nitrate consumption, overall efficacy and tolerance were
   analyzed.
   After 4 months of treatment with ivabradine HR was reduced by 12.4 +/- A
   11.6 bpm from 84.3 +/- A 14.6 to 72.0 +/- A 9.9 bpm, p < 0.0001. Angina
   pectoris episodes were reduced from 2.8 +/- A 3.3 to 0.5 +/- A 1.3 per
   week, p < 0.0001. Consumption of short-acting nitrates was reduced from
   3.7 +/- A 5.6 to 0.7 +/- A 1.7 units per week, p < 0.0001. Five patients
   (1.5\%) reported adverse drug reactions (ADR). The most common ADR were
   nausea and dizziness (< 0.6\% each). There was no clinically relevant
   bradycardia. Efficacy and tolerance were graded as `very good/good' for
   96 and 99\% of the patients treated.
   Ivabradine effectively reduces heart rate and angina pectoris in
   combination with beta-blockers and is well tolerated by patients in
   every day practice.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogenation of tetragonal InPd3 in the ZrAl3 type structure (four-fold
   ccp superstructure) yields a hydride with a cubic AuCu3 type structure
   (one-fold ccp superstructure). Deuterium can be located by neutron
   powder diffraction in octahedral voids surrounded exclusively by
   palladium, {[}Pd-6], which are 88.5(6)\% occupied in a statistical
   manner. The resulting deuteride InPd3D0.89 thus crystallizes in a cubic
   anti-perovskite type structure (space group Pm (3) over barm (no. 221),
   a=402.25(1) pm at 299(2) K). The Pd-D distance of 201.13(1) pm is
   typical for interstitial hydrides with palladium. Inelastic neutron
   scattering on the hydride InPd3H0.89, which shows a spectrum similar to
   that of binary palladium hydride, confirms the cubic site symmetry of
   hydrogen in {[}Pd-6] interstices. This is also confirmed by the absence
   of any quadrupole splitting in the D-2-NMR signal of the deuteride. H-1
   NMR spectra of InPd3H0.89 do not show any motional narrowing. Values
   found for the H jump rate tau(-1) in InPd3H0.89 remain below 10(6) s(-1)
   in the studied temperature range 28-360K. indicating a small hydrogen
   mobility in InPd3H0.8 as compared with binary palladium hydride, PdH (<=
   1).This can be attributed to the large spatial separation of the
   {[}Pd-6] sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on freshly fallen
   Almahata Sitta meteorites. Most recovered samples are polymict
   ureilites. Those found in the first 4 months since impact, before the
   meteorites were exposed to rain, have a magnetic susceptibility in the
   narrow range of 4.92 +/- 0.08 log 10-9 Am2 kg-1 close to the range of
   other ureilite falls 4.95 +/- 0.14 log 10-9 Am2 kg-1 reported by
   Rochette et al. (2009). The Almahata Sitta samples collected 1 yr after
   the fall have similar values (4.90 +/- 0.06 log 10-9 Am2 kg-1),
   revealing that the effect of 1 yr of terrestrial weathering was not
   severe. However, our reported values are higher than derived from
   polymict (brecciated) ureilites 4.38 +/- 0.47 log 10-9 Am2 kg-1
   (Rochette et al. 2009) containing both falls and finds, confirming that
   these are significantly weathered. Additionally, other fresh-looking
   meteorites of nonureilitic compositions were collected in the Almahata
   Sitta strewn field. Magnetic susceptibility measurements proved to be a
   convenient nondestructive method for identifying nonureilitic meteorites
   among those collected in the Almahata Sitta strewn field, even among
   fully crusted. Three such meteorites, no. 16, 25, and 41, were analyzed
   and their composition determined as EH6, H5, and EL6, respectively
   (Zolensky et al. 2010). A high scatter of magnetic susceptibility values
   among small (< 5 g) samples revealed high inhomogeneity within the 2008
   TC3 material at scales below 1-2 cm.}},

Abstract = {{Acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy is a rare disorder that has been
   only anecdotally reported. We characterized the clinical,
   electrophysiological, pathological and prognostic features of 21
   patients with acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy. An antecedent
   event, mostly an upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract
   infection, was reported in two-thirds of patients. Profound autonomic
   failure with various degrees of sensory impairment characterized the
   neuropathic features in all patients. The initial symptoms were those
   related to autonomic disturbance or superficial sensory impairment in
   all patients, while deep sensory impairment accompanied by sensory
   ataxia subsequently appeared in 12 patients. The severity of sensory
   ataxia tended to become worse as the duration from the onset to the peak
   phase of neuropathy became longer (P < 0.001). The distribution of
   sensory manifestations included the proximal regions of the limbs, face,
   scalp and trunk in most patients. It tended to be asymmetrical and
   segmental, rather than presenting as a symmetric polyneuropathy. Pain of
   the involved region was a common and serious symptom. In addition to
   autonomic and sensory symptoms, coughing episodes, psychiatric symptoms,
   sleep apnoea and aspiration, pneumonia made it difficult to manage the
   clinical condition. Nerve conduction studies revealed the reduction of
   sensory nerve action potentials in patients with sensory ataxia, while
   it was relatively preserved in patients without sensory ataxia. Magnetic
   resonance imaging of the spinal cord revealed a high-intensity area in
   the posterior column on T-2{*}-weighted gradient echo image in patients
   with sensory ataxia but not in those without it. Sural nerve biopsy
   revealed small-fibre predominant axonal loss without evidence of nerve
   regeneration. In an autopsy case with impairment of both superficial and
   deep sensations, we observed severe neuronal cell loss in the thoracic
   sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia, and Auerbach's plexus with well
   preserved anterior hone cells. Myelinated fibres in the anterior spinal
   root were preserved, while those in the posterior spinal root and the
   posterior column of the spinal cord were depleted. Although recovery of
   sensory impairment was poor, autonomic dysfunction was ameliorated to
   some degree within several months in most patients. In conclusion, an
   immune-mediated mechanism may be associated with acute autonomic and
   sensory neuropathy. Small neuronal cells in the autonomic and sensory
   ganglia may be affected in the initial phase, and subsequently, large
   neuronal cells in the sensory ganglia are damaged.}},

Abstract = {{An effective isolation protocol for outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC)
   resulting in higher cell numbers and a reduced expansion time would
   facilitate the therapeutical application. In this study a standard
   protocol based on the isolation of mononuclear cells from adult
   peripheral blood was modified by adding a passaging step 7 days after
   the isolation. OEC colonies gained by both protocols were evaluated
   after 28 days and resulted in different frequencies of OEC colonies
   depending on the donor and culture protocol. Accordingly, we defined two
   groups, namely, high colony-forming cultures (HCC) and low
   colony-forming cultures (LCC) for further analysis. LCC revealed no
   increase in OEC colonies by the modified protocol, whereas in HCC the
   frequency of OEC colonies was significantly improved by the passaging
   step. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry,
   and immunofluorescence for endothelial markers indicated an enrichment
   of OEC by protocol modification in HCC. In addition, HCC revealed higher
   expression of CD34 and CD133 compared to LCC and resulted in higher
   numbers of OEC gained per donor, which was further improved by the
   modified protocol. We conclude that the modified protocol supports the
   selection of OEC from adult peripheral blood with a high clonogenic
   potential and results in a better efficacy in OEC isolation.}},

Abstract = {{We present the case of a 17-year-old ice-hockey player, who complained

   meniscal repair 1 year previously. Sequential MRIs performed 8 and 12
   months after surgery were inconclusive, and failed to show the
   insufficient integration of the osteochondral fragment. Combined single
   photon emission and conventional computerized tomography (SPECT/CT)
   clearly revealed the cause of the patient's persistent knee problems-the
   osteochondral fragment had not integrated. SPECT/CT may hold great
   clinical value for symptomatic patients who have previously undergone
   treatment for osteochondral lesions, and it should be considered as

Abstract = {{Introduction Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with extensive intra-tumoral
   hemorrhage is an infrequently described entity, usually misdiagnosed as
   intra-muscular hematoma. The outcomes in this group of patients have not
   been previously described.
   Materials and methods We retrospectively identified 15 patients, with
   initial clinical or imaging diagnosis of hematoma, or hematoma versus
   hemorrhagic sarcoma, although final diagnosis of high-grade STS was
   established in all cases.
   Results The most common location was the thigh. Three patients had a
   bleeding predisposition. Ten patients were referred for further
   evaluation with the initial diagnosis of muscle strain/hematoma,
   hematoma versus abscess in one, whereas four were referred for soft
   tissue mass evaluation. Final diagnosis was made by one biopsy in only
   53\% of patients. Mean time to diagnosis for patients with two biopsies
   was 7 months from initial presentation. Histologic diagnosis was
   malignant fibrous histiocytoma in ten patients. Surgical treatment
   included tumor resection in eleven and amputation in three patients. One
   patient had lung metastatic disease at presentation and eight developed
   lung metastases within a median time of 7 months.
   Conclusion We suggest that an STS masquerading as hematoma should be
   suspected when the mechanism and the energy of the trauma do not justify
   the clinically detected severity of the injury, or the lesion does not
   follow the expected clinical course of resolution after initial
   conservative management. Bleeding predisposition does not exclude
   malignancy. The evacuation of hematomas should include pathologic
   examination of tissue. Prognosis is dismal due to early metastatic
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the
   decomposition of pollutants present in textile wastewater in the Fenton
   process. The main processing parameters, namely the optimum quantities
   of hydrogen peroxide and ferric salts added as well as the pH of a
   solution, were determined in textile wastewater formed during different
   technological operations. These data were used to verify the
   applicability of empirical formulae describing these values. It was
   found that the use of Fenton's reagent in the technology of textile
   wastewater treatment was an efficient method for the decomposition of
   pollutants and could be successfully applied as a preliminary stage
   prior to further biological treatment. To achieve the proper efficiency
   and economy of this solution, continuous control of the wastewater
   composition and quick optimisation of process conditions are required.
   It is necessary to check the reaction for a large amount of various
   types of wastewater and to find relevant relations which would enable
   quick optimisation of the process with respect to the changing input
   parameters of the wastewater subjected to treatment.}},

Journal = {{SOLDAGEM \& INSPECAO}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{336-343}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Duplex stainless steels (DSS, including super duplex stainless steels
   {[}SDSS]) have proven to be very useful engineering materials, albeit
   with somewhat different welding requirements than those of the more
   familiar austenitic stainless steels. Despite a generally good track
   record in welding of duplex stainless steels, certain pitfalls have been
   encountered with enough frequency that they deserve review.
   Inappropriate base metal specification often leads to unsuitable heat
   affected zone (HAZ) properties. Autogenous fusion zones are also of
   concern. This issue centers around nitrogen limits. The most frequently
   encountered is applying the UNS S31803 composition for 2205 DSS, instead
   of the S32205 composition. Inappropriate welding heat input arises most
   frequently with SDSS. While 0.5 to 1.5 kJ/mm is a normal heat input
   recommendation for SDSS, either a root pass or many small beads towards
   the low end of this heat input range tends to result in precipitation
   and/or secondary austenite formation in weld metal subjected to repeated
   thermal cycles from multiple weld passes. Inappropriate PWHT occurs when
   the enhanced nickel filler metals (typically 9\% Ni) are used. DSS are
   not normally given PWHT, but extensive forming of heads, for example, or
   repair welding of castings, may require a postweld anneal.
   Specifications such as ASTM A790 and A890 call for annealing at 1040
   degrees C minimum, and the fabricator tends to use temperatures close to
   that minimum. However, the enhanced nickel filler metals require higher
   temperatures to dissolve sigma phase that forms during heating to the
   annealing temperature.}},

   complication. It is especially common in small patients. Hypothermia has
   adverse effects on metabolism and many organ systems. Many drugs used in

   by decreasing the temperature set point at the thermal control center in
   the brain and by vasodilatation. Long surgery time, low room temperature
   and cold operation tables as well as surgery of open body cavities lead
   to an additional decrease of the temperature of the patient. Warming of
   the patient can be done by passive and active methods such as a short
   surgery time, force air blankets, and warm body cavity lavage. These

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the imaging and clinical outcomes of patients with
   single brainstem metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery
   (SRS).
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data from
   patients with single brainstem metastases treated with SRS. Locoregional
   control and survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Prognostic factors were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results: Between 1997 and 2007, 43 patients with single brainstem
   metastases were treated with SRS. The median age at treatment was 59
   years, the median Karnofsky performance status was 80, and the median
   follow-up was 5.3 months. The median dose was 15 Gy (range, 9.6-24), and
   the median conformality and heterogeneity index was 1.7 and 1.9,
   respectively. The median survival was 5.8 months from the procedure
   date. Of the 33 patient with post-treatment imaging available, a
   complete radiographic response was achieved in 2 (4.7\%), a partial
   response in 8 (18.6\%), and stable disease in 23 (53.5\%). The 1-year
   actuarial rate of local control, distant brain control, and overall
   survival was 85\%, 38.3\%, and 31.5\%, respectively. Of the 43 patients,
   8 (19\%) died within 2 months of undergoing SRS, and 15 (36\%) died
   within 3 months. On multivariate analysis, greater performance status
   (hazard ratio {[}HR], 0.95, p = .004), score index for radiosurgery (HR,
   0.7; p =.004), graded prognostic assessment score (HR, 0.48; p = .003),
   and smaller tumor volume (HR, 1.23, p = .002) were associated with
   improved survival. No Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed.
   Conclusion: The results of our study have shown that SRS is a safe and
   effective local therapy for patients with brainstem metastases. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper relates recursive utility in continuous time to its
   discrete-time origins and provides an alternative to the approach
   presented in Duffie and Epstein (Econometrica 60:353-394, 1992), who
   define recursive utility in continuous time via backward stochastic
   differential equations (stochastic differential utility). We show that
   the notion of Gateaux differentiability of certainty equivalents used in
   their paper has to be replaced by a different concept. Our approach
   allows us to address the important issue of normalization of aggregators
   in non-Brownian settings. We show that normalization is always feasible
   if the certainty equivalent of the aggregator is of the expected utility
   type. Conversely, we prove that in general Levy frameworks this is
   essentially also necessary, i.e. aggregators that are not of the
   expected utility type cannot be normalized in general. Besides, for
   these settings we clarify the relationship of our approach to stochastic
   differential utility and, finally, establish dynamic programming
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of CD4(+) T cells with MHC class II (MHCII)-expressing
   hematopoietic APCs plays a critical role in both the generation of
   protective immune responses and maintenance of tolerance in the lung.
   The functional significance of MHCII expression by nonhematopoietic
   stromal cells, however, has not been defined in vivo. Using a novel
   mouse model of orthotopic left lung transplantation, we demonstrate that
   selective elimination of MHCII expression on nonhematopoietic cells
   leads to an inflammatory response as a result of reduced peripheral
   generation of regulatory CD4(+) T cells. Absence of MHCII expression on
   nonhematopoietic cells also inhibits local growth of metastatic
   pulmonary tumor. These findings indicate that nonhematopoietic cells
   play a previously unrecognized role in downregulating inflammatory
   responses in nonlymphoid tissues. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{928-936}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{P>Purpose
   Implant prosthodontic treatment outcomes for patients suffering from
   autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with or without concomitant
   connective tissue diseases (CTD) were evaluated.
   Material and Methods
   Thirty-four female patients' (25 isolated RA; nine RA+CTD) implant
   survival/success rate, peri-implant conditions (marginal bone loss,
   pocket depth, plaque index, gingiva index and bleeding index) and
   incidence of prosthodontic maintenance were retrospectively evaluated.
   Results
   Implants evaluated presented a high implant survival (100\%) and a
   3.5-year success (93.8\%) rate during the follow-up programme (mean 47.6
   month) without difference between isolated RA (94.6\%) and RA and
   concomitant CTD (92.3\%), respectively. In isolated RA, acceptable
   marginal bone resorption (mean: 2.1 mm; SD: 0.5 mm), pocket depth (mean:
   2.8 mm; SD:3.2 mm) and healthy soft-tissue conditions
   (plaque/bleeding/gingiva index Grade 0 in 80\%) were noticed. However,
   patients with RA+CTD presented increased bone resorption (mean: 3.1 mm;
   SD: 0.7 mm) and more vulnerable soft-tissue conditions (higher bleeding
   index) differing significantly to patients with isolated RA (p < 0.01).
   Peri-implant parameters were significantly influenced by the patients'
   underlying disease (RA, RA+CTD; Kruskal-Wallis test, Jonckheere-Terpstra
   test).
   Conclusions
   In contrast to isolated RA, in RA patients with concomitant CTD,
   differences in the peri-implant parameters such as pronounced marginal
   bone resorption and bleeding may be anticipated and appear to be
   significantly influenced by the patients' underlying disease.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. Eighteen children and adolescents aged 5-17 years (median 15
   years) underwent 74 iHD treatment sessions with RCA. Twelve of 18
   patients presented with overt local or diffuse haemorrhage before
   beginning the HD sessions, and six had an increased risk of haemorrhagic
   complications. Forty children on acute haemodialysis with general
   heparin anticoagulation, matched for bleeding risk, age and body surface
   area, served as a control group. Citrate 3\% solution was begun with
   3.3\% blood flow rate, and calcium gluconate 10\% substitution was
   started with 0.4\% of blood flow rate. Citrate flow was adapted to
   achieve a post-filter ionized calcium of < 0.30 mmol/L; calcium
   substitution was adapted to maintain the patients' serum calcium levels
   within the physiological range. Calcium-free dialysis fluid was used.
   The blood flow rate ranged from 3 to 5 mL per minute and kilogram body
   weight.
   Results. Regional anticoagulation was successfully achieved within the
   extracorporeal blood circuit, while the coagulation of all 18 patients
   remained within physiological parameters. No adverse effects of RCA were
   observed. In all 18 children, neither new haemorrhage nor worsening of
   the bleeding situation occurred, and in 10/12 patients, bleeding stopped
   during dialysis with RCA. In contrast, one-third of the control group
   developed new haemorrhagic complications or presented with worsening of
   pre-existing bleeding during haemodialysis (P = 0.006).
   Conclusion. RCA is feasible, safe and effective in paediatric
   intermittent haemodialysis treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Recent efforts worldwide have resulted in a growing database of measured
   concentrations of chemicals in blood and urine samples taken from the
   general population. However, few tools exist to assist in the
   interpretation of the measured values in a health risk context.
   Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) are defined as the concentration or
   range of concentrations of a chemical or its metabolite(s) in a
   biological medium (blood, urine, or other medium) consistent with an
   existing health-based exposure guideline, and are derived by integrating
   available data on pharmacokinetics with existing chemical risk
   assessments. This study reviews available health-based exposure guidance
   values for triclosan based on recent evaluations from the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the European Commission's
   Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (EC SCCP) and the Australian
   National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme
   (NICNAS). BE values corresponding to the reference dose (RfD) or margin
   of safety (MOS) targets from these agencies were derived based on
   kinetic data (urinary excretion and plasma clearance) from human studies
   and measured blood concentration data in animal studies. Estimated BE
   values for urinary total triclosan (free plus conjugates) corresponding
   to the US EPA RfD and the EC-identified margin of safety target from the
   NOAEL are 6.4 and 2.6 mg/L, respectively (corresponding to 8.3 and 3.3
   mg/g creatinine, respectively). Plasma BE values corresponding to the US
   EPA, EC, and Australian NICNAS values are 0.3, 0.9, and 0.4 mg/L,
   respectively. These values may be used as screening tools for evaluation
   of population biomonitoring data for triclosan in a risk assessment
   context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   agreement index (R-1) of 0.055 for 484 unique reflections with vertical
   bar F-o vertical bar >= 4 sigma(F). The mineral is rhombohedral, R32, a
   = 5.2745(7), c = 45.36(1) angstrom. The diffraction pattern of the
   crystal has strong and sharp Bragg reflections having h-k not equal 3n
   and l = 3n and lines of weak superstructure reflections extended
   parallel to c{*} and centred at h-k 0 3n. The structure contains six
   layers within the unit cell with the layer stacking sequence of
   ...AC=CA=AC=CA=AC=CA... The Mg and Al atoms are ordered in metal
   hydroxide layers to form a honeycomb superstructure. The full
   superstructure is formed by the combination of two-layer stacking
   sequence and Mg-Al ordering. This is the first time that a long-range
   superstructure in carbonate-bearing layered double hydroxide (LDH) has
   been observed. Taking into account Mg-Al ordering, the unique layer
   sequence can be written
   as...=Ab(1)C=Cb(1)A=Ab(2)C=Cb(2)A=Ab(3)C=Cb(3)A=... The use of an
   additional suffix is proposed in order to distinguish between LDH
   polytypes having the same general stacking sequence but with different c
   parameters compared with the `standard' polytype. According to this
   notation, the quintinite studied here can be described as
   quintinite-2H-3c or quintinite-2H-3c{[}6R], indicating the real
   symmetry.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To follow the stability of a simultaneously delivered therapy
   that corrects aberrations and stiffens the corneal collagen of eyes with
   progressive keratoconus.
   METHODS: Two patients with progressive keratoconus underwent partial
   treatment (70\% cylinder and sphere up to 50-mu m central depth) with
   topographic customized photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) using the T-CAT
   module of the ALLEGRETTO WAVE Eye-Q excimer laser (Alcon Laboratories
   Inc), and then immediate corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) with
   riboflavin 0.1\% drops every 2 minutes while exposed to mean 365-nm
   ultraviolet A (UVA) light at 3.0 mW/cm(2) for 30 minutes (the Athens
   Protocol). Pre- and postoperative evaluations included manifest and
   cycloplegic refraction, Scheimpflug corneal tomography and pachymetry,
   and slit-lamp examination of corneal clarity with a minimum follow-up of
   30 months.
   RESULTS: Both treated eyes experienced rapid healing of the epithelial
   surface within 5 days and progressive improvement of vision. In the
   first case, partial treatment reduced the astigmatism and aberrations,
   allowing for successful soft contact lens wear at 3 months. Follow-up at
   13, 19, 30, and 36 months showed progressive reduction of refractive
   myopia and keratometric power. In the second case, laser treatment led
   to a near emmetropic refraction with an uncorrected visual acuity of
   20/20 at 3 months, which remained unchanged at 21 and 30 months
   postoperative.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partial topography-guided PRK followed by riboflavin/UVA
   CXL is a safe and effective therapy that halts the progression of
   keratoectasia and reduces the spherocylindrical refraction and
   aberrations to improve the visual function of patients with progressive
   keratoconus. Stability and progressive improvement over time is
   observed, although limitations may exist for steeper and thinner
   corneas. {[}J Refract Surg. 2010;26(10):S827-S832.]

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of selenium (Se) on
   the growth, accumulation and possible mechanisms of Se transport in
   certain parts (roots, leaves, stamp and apex) of nettle (Urtica dioica
   L.) plants. Se was supplemented by one-shot and two repeated doses to
   the soil (2.0 and 4.0 mg Se per kg of substrate). Selenium content in
   roots increased linearly with dose and was significantly higher compared
   to other plant parts of interest. However, growth of the above-ground
   parts of plant as well as roots was slightly inhibited with increasing
   selenium concentration in comparison to the untreated plants. The
   content of phytochelatin2, a low molecular mass peptide containing a
   sulfhydryl group, correlated well with the Se content. This suggests a
   possible stimulation of synthesis of this plant peptide by Se.}},

   usually low from January to April and a major population increase takes
   place during May to August when water temperatures are relatively low
   (about 22 degrees C) and supposedly suboptimal for B. nyassanus. This
   study was designed to compare performance (growth, reproduction,
   survival, and hatchability of egg-masses) of B. nyassanus at four
   constant temperatures (22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C). Survival and
   reproduction were optimal at 25 degrees C while growth and egg
   development were faster at the higher temperatures. Findings are

   Torus eXperiment (NSTX). The quadrature receiver in this case can be
   implemented as a simple homodyne circuit, without the complication of a
   single-sideband modulator or a feedforward tracking circuit present in
   more typical designs. A pair of direct-conversion receivers is coupled
   with broadband microwave voltage-controlled oscillators to construct a
   flexible dual-channel radar system with a fast frequency settling time
   of similar to 160 mu s. A detailed description of the design and a full
   characterization of the hardware are provided. Examples of turbulence
   measurements from radial and poloidal correlation reflectometry on NSTX

Abstract = {{Borrow-pit constructed ponds, formed during road building, are common
   along highways that run through the Peace Parkland, Alberta, Canada,
   providing habitat for a variety of aquatic birds. The horned grebe
   (Podiceps auritus) is a migratory diving bird that is in decline, likely
   due to native habitat destruction; however, it readily nests on roadside
   borrow pits. We conducted stable isotope analysis (SIA), based on carbon
   and nitrogen, of the food-webs of 14 borrow pits in the Peace Parkland,
   half occupied and half unoccupied by nesting horned grebes, to determine
   if food-web structure differed between ponds where breeding grebes were
   present versus ponds where grebes were absent. Grebe eggs were collected
   from seven ponds and suspected vertebrate and invertebrate prey were
   collected from all ponds. Borrow pits had simple, consistent food-webs.
   No difference in food-web structure or invertebrate biomass was detected
   between occupied and unoccupied ponds. When present, horned grebes were
   top predators, as determined by nitrogen signatures of egg albumen, and
   held the same trophic position as small-bodied fish. Grebes use
   nutrients acquired from the breeding pond for egg formation. SIA
   indicated that horned grebes were generalists, feeding on organisms from
   a variety of trophic positions including odonates, leeches, and
   amphipods.}},

Abstract = {{P>Plasmodium falciparum is predicted to transport over 300 proteins to
   the cytosol of its chosen host cell, the mature human erythrocyte,
   including 19 members of the Hsp40 family. Here, we have generated
   transfectant lines expressing GFP- or HA-Strep-tagged versions of these
   proteins, and used these to investigate both localization and other
   properties of these Hsp40 co-chaperones. These fusion proteins labelled
   punctate structures within the infected erythrocyte, initially
   suggestive of a Maurer's clefts localization. Further experiments
   demonstrated that these structures were distinct from the Maurer's
   clefts in protein composition. Transmission electron microscopy verifies
   a non-cleft localization for HA-Strep-tagged versions of these proteins.
   We were not able to label these structures with BODIPY-ceramide,
   suggesting a lower size and/or different lipid composition compared with
   the Maurer's clefts. Solubility studies revealed that the Hsp40-GFP
   fusion proteins appear to be tightly associated with membranes, but
   could be released from the bilayer under conditions affecting membrane
   cholesterol content or organization, suggesting interaction with a
   binding partner localized to cholesterol-rich domains. These novel
   structures are highly mobile in the infected erythrocyte, but based on
   velocity calculations, can be distinguished from the `highly mobile
   vesicles' previously described. Our study identifies a further
   extra-parasitic structure in the P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte,
   which we name `J-dots' (as their defining characteristic so far is the
   content of J-proteins). We suggest that these J-dots are involved in
   trafficking of parasite-encoded proteins through the cytosol of the
   infected erythrocyte.}},

Abstract = {{The conformational properties of the polyproline I (PPI) helix of
   oligoprolines toward heating were examined. Oligoproline H-Pro(12)-NH2
   served as a model which adopts in n-PrOH a pronounced PPI conformation
   with all cis amide bonds, whereas a polyproline II (PPII) conformation
   with all trans amide bonds is predominant in pure aqueous buffer. CD
   spectroscopic studies revealed that a conformational change from the PPI
   to the PPII helix takes place upon heating and back to the PPI helix
   upon cooling. This conformational transition cycle is characterized by a
   strong hysteresis. With a quantitative fitting of the experimentally
   observed hysteresis loops by a newly developed iterative integration
   with different starting conditions, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters
   for the transition from the PPI to the PPII helical conformation were
   determined. The transition is as expected for cis-trans isomerizations
   of amide bonds comparatively slow (k = 0.003 s(-1) at 80 degrees C) and
   characterized by an activation energy E-a of 81.1 +/- 3.6 kJ mol(-1).
   Thermodynamically, the transition from the PPI to the PPII helix is
   characterized by a positive standard enthalpy (Delta H degrees = 33.5
   +/- 2.1 kJ min(-1)) and a positive standard entropy (Delta S degrees =

Abstract = {{The failures of the bituminous pavements are not only due to increase in
   traffic but also due to extreme climatic conditions prevailing in the
   country. There are very high and very low pavement temperatures that
   exist during different seasons of the year. Thus, climatic conditions
   play an important role in selecting the type of materials to be used in
   road construction. In order to increase the life of bituminous pavement,
   quality of bitumen needs to be enhanced. To achieve the improvement of
   binder, it is necessary to add the polymers to bitumen. In this study,
   two types of polymer - ethylene vinyle acetate (EVA), a plastomer, and
   linear styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), an elastomer - and crumb rubber
   (CR) were used. The changes of rheological properties of 60/70 grades
   bitumen modified with different percentages of CR, EVA, and SBS (3-9\%)
   were studied. The rheological properties of the bituminous binders in
   terms of their complex modulus (G({*})), stiffness and overall
   resistance to deformation, storage modulus (G(')), binder elasticity,
   loss modulus (G(')), viscous behavior and phase angle (delta), and
   viscoelastic behavior were measured by using dynamic shear rheometer
   (SR5 asphalt rheometer). Testing was performed at higher temperatures
   ranging from 46 to 82 degrees C in increments of 6 degrees C at a
   frequency of 10 rad/s in the range from 0.1 to 100 rad/s before and
   after aging. It was observed that the rheological properties of
   bituminous binders had changed after modification. There is an
   improvement in rheological properties of the neat bitumen after mixing
   with modifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial glycocalyx (GCX) has been reported as a protective factor

   by cationic colloidal iron staining using a transmission electron
   microscope. In the control group, the mean (standard error of the mean)
   thicknesses of retinal and choroidal GCX were 60.2 (1.5) nm and 84.3
   (3.1) nm, respectively. The diabetic rats showed a significant decrease
   of GCX thickness in the retina, but not in the choroid, compared to
   controls (28.3 (0.3) nm, p < 0.01 and 77.8 (1.4) nm, respectively). In
   the hypertensive rats, both retinal and choroidal GCX were significantly
   decreased compared to the control values (10.9 (0.4) nm and 13.2 (1.0)
   nm, respectively, both p < 0.01). Moreover, we could visualize the
   adhesion of leukocytes and platelets on the luminal surface of VEC, at
   the site where the GCX was markedly degraded. These findings suggest
   that the GCX prevents adhesion of leukocytes and platelets to the VEC
   surface, and this impairment may lead to ocular vasculopathy in diabetes

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature tensile test results of solution annealed 304 stainless
   steel at strain rates ranging between 5 x 10(-4) and 1 x 10(-1) s(-1)
   reveal that with increase in strain rate yield strength increases and
   tensile strength decreases, both maintaining power-law relationships
   with strain rate. The decrease in tensile strength with increasing
   strain rate is attributed to the lesser amount of deformation-induced
   martensite formation and greater role of thermal softening over work
   hardening at higher strain rates. Tensile deformation of the steel is
   found to occur in three stages. The deformation transition strains are
   found to depend on strain rate in such a manner that Stage-I deformation
   (planar slip) is favoured at lower strain rate. A continuously
   decreasing linear function of strain rate sensitivity with true strain
   has been observed. Reasonably good estimation for the stress exponent
   relating dislocation velocity and stress has been made. The linear plot
   of reciprocal of strain rate sensitivity with true strain suggests that
   after some critical amount of deformation the increased dislocation
   density in austenite due to the formation of some critical amount of
   deformation-induced martensite plays important role in carrying out the
   imposed strain rate.}},

   August 4, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00395.2010. The neurophonic is a
   sound-evoked, frequency-following potential that can be recorded
   extracellularly in nucleus laminaris of the barn owl. The origin of the
   neurophonic, and thus the mechanisms that give rise to its exceptional
   temporal precision, has not yet been identified. Putative generators of
   the neurophonic are the activity of afferent axons, synaptic activation
   of laminaris neurons, or action potentials in laminaris neurons. To
   identify the generators, we analyzed the neurophonic in the
   high-frequency (>2.5 kHz) region of nucleus laminaris in response to
   monaural pure-tone stimulation. The amplitude of the neurophonic is
   typically in the millivolt range. The signal-to-noise ratio reaches
   values beyond 30 dB. To assess which generators could give rise to these
   large, synchronous extracellular potentials, we developed a
   computational model. Spike trains were produced by an inhomogeneous
   Poisson process and convolved with a spike waveform. The model explained
   the dependence of the simulated neurophonic on parameters such as the
   mean rate, the vector strength of phase locking, the number of
   statistically independent sources, and why the signal-to-noise ratio is
   independent of the spike waveform and subsequent filtering of the
   signal. We found that several hundred sources are needed to reach the

Abstract = {{In a sticky-price model with labor market search and matching frictions,
   forecast-based interest rate policy almost always induces indeterminacy
   when it is strictly inflation targeting and satisfies the Taylor
   principle. Indeterminacy is due to a vacancy channel of monetary policy
   that makes inflation expectations self-fulfilling. The effect of this
   channel strengthens as the sluggishness of the adjustment of employment
   relative to that of consumption increases. When this relative
   sluggishness is high, the Taylor principle fails to ensure determinacy,
   regardless of whether the policy is forecast-based or outcome-based,
   whether it is strictly or flexibly inflation targeting, or contains
   policy rate smoothing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid for all organisms. In
   plants, Met also functions as a precursor of plant hormones, polyamines,
   and defense metabolites. The regulatory mechanism of Met biosynthesis is
   highly complex and, despite its great importance, remains unclear. To
   investigate how accumulation of Met influences metabolism as a whole in
   Arabidopsis, three methionine over-accumulation (mto) mutants were
   examined using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics
   approach. Multivariate statistical analyses of the three mto mutants
   (mto1, mto2, and mto3) revealed distinct metabolomic phenotypes.
   Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis
   highlighted discriminative metabolites contributing to the separation of
   each mutant and the corresponding control samples. Though Met
   accumulation in mto1 had no dramatic effect on other metabolic pathways
   except for the aspartate family, metabolite profiles of mto2 and mto3
   indicated that several extensive pathways were affected in addition to
   over-accumulation of Met. The pronounced changes in metabolic pathways
   in both mto2 and mto3 were associated with polyamines. The findings
   suggest that our metabolomics approach not only can reveal the impact of
   Met over-accumulation on metabolism, but also may provide clues to
   identify crucial pathways for regulation of metabolism in plants.}},

Abstract = {{General fluid intelligence (gF) is a major component of intellect in
   both adults and children. Whereas its neural substrates have been
   studied relatively thoroughly in adults, those are poorly understood in
   children, particularly preschoolers. Here, we hypothesized that gF and
   visuospatial working memory share a common neural system within the
   lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during the preschool years (4-6 years).
   At the behavioral level, we found that gF positively and significantly
   correlated with abilities (especially accuracy) in visuospatial working
   memory. Optical topography revealed that the LPFC of preschoolers was
   activated and deactivated during the visuospatial working memory task
   and the gF task. We found that the spatio-temporal features of neural
   activity in the LPFC were similar for both the visuospatial working
   memory task and the gF task. Further, 2 months of training for the
   visuospatial working memory task significantly increased gF in the
   preschoolers. These findings suggest that a common neural system in the
   LPFC is recruited to improve the visuospatial working memory and gF in
   preschoolers. Efficient recruitment of this neural system may be
   important for good performance in these functions in preschoolers, and
   behavioral training using this system would help to increase gF at these
   ages.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we generalize the method suggested in an earlier
   paper by the author and overcome its main deficiency.
   First, we modify the well-known Prony method, which subsequently will be
   utilized for recovering exactly the locations of jump discontinuities
   and the associated jumps of a piecewise constant function by means of
   its Fourier coefficients with respect to any system of the classical
   orthogonal polynomials.
   Next, we will show that the method is applicable to a wider class of
   functions, namely, to the class of piecewise smooth functions-for
   functions which piecewise belong to C(2){[}-1, 1], the locations of
   discontinuities are approximated to within O(1/n) by means of their
   Fourier-Jacobi coefficients. Unlike the previous one, the generalized
   method is robust, since its success is independent of whether or not a
   location of the discontinuity coincides with a root of a classical
   orthogonal polynomial. In addition, the error estimate is uniform for
   any {[}c, d] subset of (-1,1).
   To the end, we discuss the accuracy, stability, and complexity of the
   method and present numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{This article on French innovations in aesthetic surgery is a report
   mainly centered on the cervicofacial renovation surgery, with historic
   review and interviews of people who played a dominating role regarding
   anatomical works, invention and innovation of techniques, and their
   development. The main theme is the facial face-lift, which genesis dates
   back to the First World War, and to the surgery of the ``gueules
   cassees{''} with Morestin, father of the French plastic surgery. During
   the interwar years, plastic surgery techniques were developed by great
   French names such as Passot, Noel and Bourguet. The invention of the
   craniofacial surgery in the 1960s and historic anatomical works on the
   SMAS by Tessier and his team in the 1970s, allowed to clarify for
   everyone the various principles and indications of the face-lift,
   recently improved by Le Louarn and Besins. It is besides, in nasal
   aesthetic surgery, and still thanks to anatomical works, that Robin
   described in 1973 the technique of rhinoplasty by extramucous way, then
   developed by Jost, co-inventor with his master Redon of the aspirating

Abstract = {{Background. The development of invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype
   b (Hib) disease after prior immunization with the Hib conjugate vaccine
   (ie, Hib vaccine failure) is extremely rare, suggesting that affected
   children may have an underlying genetic susceptibility in their immune
   response. The objective of this study was to investigate
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to affect function in
   biologically plausible genes in relation to the risk of Hib vaccine
   failure and its clinical manifestations.
   Methods. The families of UK children with Hib vaccine failure diagnosed
   during the period October 1992 through December 2005 were identified
   through enhanced national surveillance and approached for the study at a
   median interval of 4 years after invasive disease. The Wellcome Trust
   Case Control Consortium data sets were used as controls. Nineteen
   functional SNPs in 14 immune response genes were investigated in 172
   white children.
   Results. The recessive homozygous genotype for a SNP in the TIRAP (also
   known as MAL) gene (rs1893352) that is in strong linkage disequilibrium
   (r(2) = 0.93) with the known functional Ser180Leu polymorphism in white
   persons was strongly associated with nonmeningitis cases of Hib vaccine
   failure (odds ratio, 5.6; 95\% confidence interval, 2.7-11.5; P = 1.2 x
   10(-7)). In addition, the recessive homozygous genotype for another SNP
   (rs1554286) in strong linkage disequilibrium with both the C-819T (r(2)
   = 0.87) and C-592A (r(2) = 0.75) promoter polymorphisms in the
   interleukin-10 gene was associated with epiglottitis only (odds ratio,
   5.8; 95\% confidence interval, 2.4-14.2; P = 1.1 x 10(-5)).
   Conclusions. Our findings strongly suggest that the development of
   invasive Hib disease after prior immunization is in part genetically
   determined and may direct the immune response to specific clinical
   manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{We obtained Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-8 mu m images of the nearby spiral galaxy
   NGC 4258 to study possible interactions between dust and the radio jet.
   In our analysis, we also included high-resolution radio continuum, H
   alpha, CO, and X-ray data. Our data reveal that the 8 mu m emission,
   believed to originate largely from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
   molecules and hot dust, is an excellent tracer of the normal spiral
   structure in NGC 4258, and hence it originates from the galactic plane.
   We investigated the possibility of dust destruction by the radio jet by
   calculating correlation coefficients between the 8 mu m and radio
   continuum emissions along the jet in two independent ways, namely, (1)
   from wavelet-transformed maps of the original images at different
   spatial scales and (2) from one-dimensional intensity cuts perpendicular
   to the projected path of the radio jet on the sky. No definitive sign of
   a correlation (or anticorrelation) was detected on relevant spatial
   scales with either approach, implying that any dust destruction must
   take place at spatial scales that are not resolved by our observations.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the templated DNA-directed self-assembly of individual gold
   nanoparticles (AuNPs) into discrete nanostructures is described. The
   templating nanostructures consisted of a linear configuration of six
   metal dots with a center-to-center dot distance of 55 nm, fabricated by
   means of electron beam lithography. The 40 nm DNA-capped AuNPs were
   immobilized onto this templating nanostructure to produce a linear
   configuration of six adjacent AuNPs. The geometry of the templating
   nanostructure was found to be critically important for the successful
   direction of a single nanoparticle onto individual adsorption sites. For
   optimized template structures the immobilization efficiency of
   nanoparticles onto the individual adsorption sites was found to be 80\%.
   The nonspecific association of nanoparticles with specifically adsorbed
   nanoparticles and the between adsorption of nanoparticles, bridging two
   individual adsorption sites, were the two main defects observed in the
   immobilized assemblies. Less than 1\% of all surface confined AuNPs
   adsorbed nonspecifically in the areas between the self-assembled regular
   arrays.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, autoregressive and time-frequency-techniques have been
   investigated to predict and monitor the damage in implantable biological
   electronics such as pacemakers and defibrillators. The approach focuses
   is on the pre-failure space and methodologies for quantification of
   failure in electronic equipment subjected to shock and vibration loads
   using the dynamic response of the electronic equipment. Presented
   methodologies are applicable at the system-level for identification of
   impending failures to trigger repair or replacement significantly prior
   to failure. Leading indicators of shock-damage have been developed to
   correlate with the damage initiation and progression in under variety of
   stresses in electronic systems. The approach is based on monitoring
   critical solder interconnects, and sensing the change in test-signal
   characteristics prior to failure, in addition to monitoring the
   transient strain characteristics optically using digital image
   correlation and strain gages. Previously, SPR based on wavelet packet
   energy decomposition and the Mahalanobis distance approach have been
   studied by the authors for quantification of shock damage in electronic
   assemblies ({''}Solder-joint reliability in electronics under shock and
   vibration using explicit finite element sub-modeling,{''} P. Lall, et
   al. Proc. 56th ECTC, May-Jun. 2006, pp. 428-435, `` Life prediction and
   damage equivalency for shock survivability of electronic components,{''}
   P. Lall, et al. Proc. ITherm, May-Jun., 2006, pp. 804-816). In this
   paper, Autoregressive (AR), wavelet packet energy decomposition, and
   time-frequency (TFA) techniques have been investigated for system
   identification, condition monitoring, and fault detection and diagnosis
   in implantable biological electronic systems. One of the main advantages
   of the AR technique is that it is primarily a signal-based technique.
   Reduced reliance on system analysis helps avoid errors which otherwise
   may render the process of fault detection and diagnosis quite complex
   and dependent on the skills of the analyst. Results of the present study
   show that the AR and TFA-based health monitoring techniques are feasible
   for fault detection and damage-assessment in electronic units. Explicit
   finite-element models have been developed and various kinds of failure
   modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, package falloff,
   and solder ball failure.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The native European flat oyster Ostrea edulis is listed in the OSPAR
   Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
   North-East Atlantic (species and habitat protection) and in the UK
   Biodiversity Action Plan. Once extremely abundant in the nineteenth
   century, European stocks of O. edulis have declined during the twentieth
   century to rare, small, localised populations due to overexploitation,
   habitat degradation and, most recently, the parasitic disease
   bonamiosis. Selective breeding programmes for resistance to bonamiosis
   have been initiated in France and Ireland. High genetic diversity and
   bonamiosis-resistance would be important features of any sustainable
   restoration programmes for O. edulis. Oysters were sampled across Europe
   from four hatchery sources, four pond-cultured sources and four wild,
   but managed fisheries and were genotyped at five microsatellite loci.
   Hatchery-produced populations from small numbers of broodstock showed a
   significant loss of genetic diversity relative to wild populations and
   pedigree reconstruction revealed that they were each composed of a
   single large full-sib family and several small full-sib families. This
   extremely low effective population size highlights the variance in
   reproductive success among the potential breeders. Pond-cultured oysters
   were intermediate in genetic diversity and effective population size
   between hatchery and wild populations. Controlled hatchery production
   allows the development of bonamiosis-resistant strains, but at the
   expense of genetic diversity. Large scale pond culture on the other hand
   can provide a good level of genetic diversity. A mixture of these two
   approaches is required to ensure a healthy and sustainable restoration
   programme for O. edulis in Europe.}},

Title = {{Swim stress differentially blocks CRF receptor mediated responses in
   dorsal raphe nucleus}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1321-1332}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Modulation of the serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmitter system arising
   from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) is thought to support the behavioral
   effects of swim stress, i.e., immobility. In vivo pharmacological and
   anatomical studies suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic transmission closely interact to
   set the response of the DR to swim stress. To investigate the cellular
   basis of these physiological mechanisms the effects of ovine CRF (oCRF)
   on GABA(A)-dependent miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs)
   in 5-HT and non-5-HT DR neurons in acute mesencephalic slices obtained
   from rats either naive or 24 h after a 15 min swim stress session were
   tested. In this study, the effect of swim stress alone was to decrease
   the holding current, i.e., hyperpolarize the neuron, and to increase the
   amplitude and charge of mIPSCs recorded from non-5-HT neurons. Ovine CRF
   (10 nM) induced an increase in mIPSC frequency in 5-HT neurons recorded
   from naive rats, an effect that was suppressed by swim stress. The
   inward current elicited by oCRF in both 5-HT and non-5-HT neurons was
   also blocked by swim stress. Ovine CRF increased mIPSCs amplitude and
   charge in both 5-HT and non-5-HT neurons, but this effect was not
   modified by swim stress. In concert with our previous findings that swim
   stress decreased input resistance, action potential threshold and action
   potential duration and increased glutamatergic synaptic activity the
   overall primary effect of swim stress is to increase the excitability of
   5-HT neurons. These data provide a mechanism at the cellular level for
   the immobility induced by swim stress and identifies critical components
   of the raphe circuitry responsible for the altered output of 5-HT
   neurons induced by swim stress. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The position and intensity of the southern westerly wind belt varies
   seasonally as a consequence of changes in sea surface temperature.
   During the austral winter, the belt expands northward and the wind
   intensity in the core decreases. Conversely, during the summer, the belt
   contracts, and the intensity within the core is strengthened.
   Reconstructions of the westerly winds since the last glacial maximum,
   however, have suggested that changes at a single site reflected shifts
   throughout the entire southern wind belt(1-4). Here we use
   sedimentological and pollen records to reconstruct precipitation
   patterns over the past 12,500 yr from sites along the windward side of
   the Andes. Precipitation at the sites, located in the present core and
   northern margin of the westerlies, is driven almost entirely by the wind
   belt(5), and can be used to reconstruct its intensity. Rather than
   varying coherently throughout the Holocene epoch, we find a distinct
   anti-phasing of wind strength between the core and northern margin over
   multi-millennial timescales. During the early Holocene, the core
   westerlies were strong whereas the northern margin westerlies were weak.
   We observe the opposite pattern in the late Holocene. As this variation
   resembles modern seasonal variability, we suggest that our observed
   changes in westerly wind strength can best be explained by variations in
   sea surface temperature in the eastern South Pacific Ocean.}},

Title = {{The Meiotic Recombination Checkpoint Suppresses NHK-1 Kinase to Prevent
   Reorganisation of the Oocyte Nucleus in Drosophila}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The meiotic recombination checkpoint is a signalling pathway that blocks
   meiotic progression when the repair of DNA breaks formed during
   recombination is delayed. In comparison to the signalling pathway
   itself, however, the molecular targets of the checkpoint that control
   meiotic progression are not well understood in metazoans. In Drosophila,
   activation of the meiotic checkpoint is known to prevent formation of
   the karyosome, a meiosis-specific organisation of chromosomes, but the
   molecular pathway by which this occurs remains to be identified. Here we
   show that the conserved kinase NHK-1 (Drosophila Vrk-1) is a crucial
   meiotic regulator controlled by the meiotic checkpoint. An nhk-1
   mutation, whilst resulting in karyosome defects, does so independent of
   meiotic checkpoint activation. Rather, we find unrepaired DNA breaks
   formed during recombination suppress NHK-1 activity (inferred from the
   phosphorylation level of one of its substrates) through the meiotic
   checkpoint. Additionally DNA breaks induced by X-rays in cultured cells
   also suppress NHK-1 kinase activity. Unrepaired DNA breaks in oocytes
   also delay other NHK-1 dependent nuclear events, such as synaptonemal
   complex disassembly and condensin loading onto chromosomes. Therefore we
   propose that NHK-1 is a crucial regulator of meiosis and that the
   meiotic checkpoint suppresses NHK-1 activity to prevent oocyte nuclear
   reorganisation until DNA breaks are repaired.}},

Title = {{A trigger tool fails to identify serious errors and adverse events in

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{143}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify errors and adverse events on an
   inpatient academic tertiary-care pediatric otolaryngology service, a
   trigger tool was developed and validated as part of a quality
   improvement initiative.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective record review.
   SETTING: Children's Hospital Boston quality improvement initiative.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty inpatient admissions were reviewed. The gold
   standard for errors and adverse events identification was a detailed
   chart review by two board-certified otolaryngologists blinded to trigger
   tool findings.
   RESULTS: Trigger tool interrater reliability ranged from poor to high
   for admission triggers (kappa = 0.35, 95\% confidence interval {[}95\%
   CI] -0.07 to 0.76), discharge triggers (kappa = 0.63, 95\% CI
   0.27-0.99), medical records triggers (kappa = 0.61, 95\% CI 0.11-1.00),
   and medication triggers (kappa = 0.90, 95\% CI 0.71-1.00). Errors and
   adverse events were found in all admissions: three percent were
   potentially harmful, and 93 percent were documentation-related.
   CONCLUSION: The trigger tool was successful in identifying clerical and
   administrative errors and adverse events but failed to identify complex
   errors and adverse events. A hybrid approach for chart review may be
   cost-effective in pediatric otolaryngology. (C) 2010 American Academy of

Abstract = {{Calmodulin (CAM) is an ubiquitous calcium binding protein whose function
   is to translate the signals, perceived as calcium concentration
   variations, into the appropriate cellular responses. In Arabidopsis
   thaliana there are 4 CAM isoforms which are highly similar, encoded by 7
   genes, and one possible explanation proposed for the evolutionary
   conservation of the CAM gene family is that the different genes have
   acquired different functions so that they play possibly overlapping but
   non-identical roles. Here we report the characterization of the
   Arabidopsis mutant cam2-2, identified among the lines of the
   gene-trapping collection EXOTIC because of a distorted segregation of
   kanamycin resistance. Phenotypic analysis showed that in normal growth
   conditions cam2-2 plants were indistinguishable from the wild type while
   genetic analysis showed a reduced transmission of the cam2-2 allele
   through the male gametophyte and in vitro pollen germination revealed a
   reduced level of germination in comparison with the wild type. These
   results provide genetic evidence of the involvement of a CAM gene in
   pollen germination and support the theory of functional diversification

Title = {{Balancing Access to Health Data and Privacy: A Review of the Issues and
   Approaches for the Future}},
Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5, 2}},
Pages = {{1456-1467}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background
   There has been a dramatic increase in the types of microdata, and this
   holds great promise for health services research. However, legislative
   efforts to protect individual privacy have reduced the flow of health
   care data for research purposes and increased costs and delays,
   affecting the quality of analysis.
   Aim
   This paper provides an overview of the challenges raised by concerns
   about data confidentiality in the context of health services research,
   the current methodologies used to ensure data security, and a
   description of one successful approach to balancing access and privacy.
   Materials and Methods
   We analyze the issues of access and privacy using a conceptual framework
   based on balancing the risk of reidentification with the utility
   associated with data analysis. The guiding principle should be to
   generate released data that are as close to the maximum acceptable risk
   as possible. HIPAA and other privacy measures can perhaps be seen as
   having had the effect of lowering the ``maximum acceptable risk{''}
   level and rendering some data unreleasable.
   Results
   We discuss the levels of risk and utility associated with different
   types of data used in health services research and the ability to link
   data from multiple sources as well as current models of data sharing and
   their limitations.
   Discussion
   One particularly compelling approach is to establish a remote access
   ``data enclave,{''} where statistical protections are applied to the
   data, technical protections ensure compliance with data-sharing
   requirements, and operational controls limit researchers' access to the
   data they need for their specific research questions.
   Conclusion
   We recommend reducing delays in access to data for research, increasing
   the use of remote access data enclaves, and disseminating knowledge and
   promulgating standards for best practices related to data protection.}},

Abstract = {{Although low bone mineral density (BMD) predicts fractures, there are
   postulated sex differences in the fracture ``threshold.{''} Some studies
   demonstrate a higher mean BMD for men with fractures than for women,
   whereas others note similar absolute risk at the same level of BMD. Our
   objective was to test the preceding observations in the population-based
   Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS). We included
   participants 50+ years of age at baseline. Mean BMD in men was higher
   than in women among both fracture cases and noncases. Three methods of
   BMD normalization were compared in age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards
   models. In a model using the same reference population mean and standard
   deviation (SD), there were strong effects of age and total-hip BMD for
   prediction of fractures but no significant effect of sex {[}hazard ratio
   (HR) = 0.97, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.20] for men versus
   women. In a model using sex-specific reference means but a common SD, an
   apparent sex difference emerged (HR = 0.66, 95\% CI 0.54-0.81) for men
   versus women. The sex term in the second model counterbalanced the
   higher risk introduced by the lower normalized BMD in men. A third model
   using sex-specific reference means and SDs gave nearly identical
   results. Parallel results for the three methods of normalization were
   seen when adjusting for clinical risk factors, excluding antiresorptive
   users and considering death as a competing risk. We conclude that no
   adjustment for sex is necessary when using common reference data for
   both men and women, whereas using sex-specific reference data requires a
   substantial secondary adjustment for sex. (C) 2010 American Society for

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is thought to be required for the associative
   recognition of objects together with the spatial or temporal contexts in
   which they occur. However, recent data showing that rats with fornix
   lesions perform as well as controls in an object-place task, while being
   impaired on an object-place-context task (Eacott and Norman (2004) J
   Neurosci 24: 1948-1953), suggest that not all forms of context-dependent
   associative recognition depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. To
   examine the role of the hippocampus in context-dependent recognition
   directly, the present study tested the effects of large, selective,
   bilateral hippocampus lesions in rats on performance of a series of
   spontaneous recognition memory tasks: object recognition, object-place
   recognition, object-context recognition and object-place-context
   recognition. Consistent with the effects of fornix lesions, animals with
   hippocampus lesions were impaired only on the object-place-context task.
   These data confirm that not all forms of context-dependent associative
   recognition are mediated by the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments
   suggested that the object-place task does not require an allocentric
   representation of space, which could account for the lack of impairment
   following hippocampus lesions. Importantly, as the object-place-context
   task has similar spatial requirements, the selective deficit in
   object-place-context recognition suggests that this task requires
   hippocampus-dependent neural processes distinct from those required for
   allocentric spatial memory, or for object memory, object-place memory or
   object-context memory. Two possibilities are that object, place, and
   context information converge only in the hippocampus, or that
   recognition of integrated object-place-context information requires a
   hippocampus-dependent mode of retrieval, such as recollection. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Background The incidence of trocar site incisional hernia following
   laparoscopic surgery is reported to be relatively high. The main reasons
   are trocar diameter and design, preexisting fascial defects, and some
   operation- and patient-related factors. The goal of this article is to
   present a new procedure for anatomical closure of the trocar site to
   prevent its herniation.
   Methods In this study, 120 patients underwent laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy from June 2006 through February 2009 at the General
   Surgery Department, Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt. After the
   laparoscopic procedure was complete, the trocar sites were closed in
   anatomical layers by using a tip hole needle and a redirecting suture
   hook. The mean follow-up period was 2 years for any complication at
   these trocar sites.
   Results The mean hospital stay was 1.2 days, the mean age of the
   patients was 49.4 years, and the mean time to place one suture was 5
   min. No trocar site hernia occurred with this technique during a mean
   follow-up of 2 years. Seven patients developed superficial infection at
   the trocar site and no mortality was reported.
   Conclusion Good closure of the trocar site in layers by using a tip hole
   needle and a redirecting suture hook will prevent trocar site
   herniation.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims:
   To determine the detection limit of diagnostic negative staining
   electron microscopy for the diagnosis of pathogens that could be used
   for bioterrorism.
   Methods and Results:
   Suspensions of vaccinia poxvirus and endospores of Bacillus subtilis
   were used at defined concentrations as a model for poxviruses and spores
   of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), both of which are pathogens that could
   be used for bioterrorist attacks. Negative staining electron microscopy
   was performed directly or after sedimentation of these suspensions on to
   the sample supports using airfuge ultracentrifugation. For both virus
   and spores, the detection limit using direct adsorption of a 10-mu l
   sample volume onto the sample support was 106 particles per ml. Using
   airfuge ultracentrifugation with a sample volume of 80 mu l, the
   detection limit could be reduced to 105 particles per ml for spores and
   to 5 x 104 particles per ml for poxviruses. The influence on particle
   detection of incubation time, washing and adsorption procedures was
   investigated.
   Conclusions:
   The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method were acceptable,
   particularly considering the small sample volume and low particle number
   applied onto the sample support.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Diagnostic negative staining electron microscopy is used for the
   diagnosis of pathogens in emergency situations because it allows a rapid
   examination of all particulate matter down to the nanometre scale. This
   study provides precise detection limit for the method, an important
   factor for the validation and improvement of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{Acanthamoeba spp. has been isolated from many habitats, including
   swimming pools. Investigations on its distribution are relevant because
   many of its species cause human diseases. The aim of the present work
   was to investigate, isolate and characterize protozoan of the genus
   Acanthamoeba from indoor swimming pools in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, in
   the four seasons, during the 2007-2008 period. Seven pools were studied
   and samples were collected from the bottom, surface and wall by scraping
   them. Besides, samples for bacteriological analysis were taken from each
   pool. The samples were analyzed by direct observation and by culturing
   on non nutritive agar at 37 C and at 42 C. The generic identification
   was performed according to the morphologic characteristics of cysts and
   trofozoites, while the amoebo-flagellate transformation test was carried
   out to identify Naegleria. Free-living amoebas were isolated from five
   of the seven swimming pools examinated, in at least one season.
   Naegleria genus was not found as the amoebo-flagellate transformation
   tests were negative in all samples. All the isolations corresponded to
   the genus Acanthamoeba belonging to Pussard \& Pons morphological Groups
   II and III. Although elimination of Acanthamoeba from the water is
   difficult because it is a ubiquitous protozoan. which is highly
   resistant to the commonly used disinfectants, a thorough cleaning of the
   pools to minimize the risks of infection is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Structural and textural properties of extruded corn and corn-lentil
   mixtures were investigated as a result of process conditions, including
   extrusion temperature (170-230 degrees C), feed rate (2.52-6.84 kg/h)

   corn flour at a ratio of 10-50\% (legume/corn). Apparent density
   increased with feed rate, moisture content and material ratio and
   decreased with temperature, while expansion ratio showed an opposite
   behavior. Modulus of elasticity increased with feed composition and
   decreased with extrusion conditions. Number of peaks during compression
   decreased with extrusion temperature and feed composition. Similar
   behavior was also found for sensory evaluated structural and textural
   characteristics. The examination of macrostructure confirmed the effects
   of extrusion conditions and feed composition on structural and textural
   properties. The properties correlation revealed critical relationships
   among instrumental and sensorial characteristics. Hence, simple power
   model equations were developed, which enable their prediction and
   consequently the design of extruded snacks with acceptable quality

Abstract = {{Categorization of gastroschisis into low risk (simple) and high risk
   (complex) has been reported as an important determinant of outcome. The
   role of risk categorization in choosing the optimal surgical approach is
   unreported. This study aims to investigate the role of risk
   categorization in decision making for ward reduction of gastroschisis.
   Data on a cohort of 52 consecutive neonates with gastroschisis between
   2000 and 2009 were reviewed. A clinical pathway based on risk
   categorization was implemented in 2004, and children with simple
   gastroschisis underwent ward reduction and those with complex
   gastroschisis underwent surgical closure. Thirty-three neonates since
   2004 were analysed and compared to the 19 born prior to 2004.
   Of the 33 children with gastroschisis in the study group, 23 were
   assessed as simple and underwent ward reduction with 96\% survival. Ten
   had complex gastroschisis and underwent varying surgical procedures.
   Only six out of ten children (60\%) with complex gastroschisis survived
   in spite of multiple surgical attempts.
   Risk stratification of gastroschisis at birth helps in choosing optimal
   surgical management. Ward reduction can be successfully and safely
   performed in all children with simple gastroschisis. Those with complex
   gastroschisis require conventional surgical treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a case of heart transplantation (HTX) performed using a
   heart from a 20-year-old donor who underwent surgical closure of a
   ventricular septal defect during childhood. Our 26-year-old patient was
   successfully discharged to a rehabilitation centre on day 20
   post-transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an
   HTX performed with a `redo' donor heart with previous surgical
   correction of a congenital heart defect. The widespread use of HTX as a
   therapeutic option is currently limited by the increase in number of
   patients listed annually for this procedure. The concomitant lack of
   organ donors has led to the concept of `marginal donor' to broaden the
   classic standard criteria of donor suitability, but these extended
   criteria do not consider the possibility of using hearts that have
   undergone surgical correction of simple congenital heart defects. There
   has been a considerable increase in the grown-up congenital heart
   disease population over the past 20 years. We discuss the feasibility of
   using these hearts for transplantation and consider the limitations and
   precautions of such practice. (C) 2010 Published by European Association

Abstract = {{Class switch recombination (CSR) is mediated by G-rich tandem repeated
   sequences termed switch regions. Transcription of switch regions
   generates single-stranded R loops that provide substrates for
   activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Mice deficient in MSH2 have a
   mild defect in CSR and analysis of their switch junctions has led to a
   model in which MSH2 is more critical for switch recombination events
   outside than within the tandem repeats. It is also known that deletion
   of the whole S mu region severely impairs but does not abrogate CSR
   despite the lack of detectable R loops. Here, we demonstrate that
   deficiency of both MSH2 and the S mu region completely abolishes CSR and
   that the abrogation occurs at the genomic level. This finding further
   supports the crucial role of MSH2 outside the tandem repeats. It also
   indicates that during CSR, MSH2 has access to activation-induced
   cytidine deaminase targets in R-loop-deficieni: I mu-C mu sequences
   rarely used in CSR, suggesting an MSH2-dependent DNA processing activity
   at the I mu exon that may decrease with transcription elongation across
   the S mu region.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a novel monolithic fabrication method was
   developed for the manufacturing of a plastic microfluidic chip with
   liquid interconnecting ports. As the present method can realize both
   interconnecting ports and through holes, which are essential components
   for the delivery of working fluids, in the plastic microfluidic chip, no
   additional processes and external ports are required. Furthermore, the
   connection of external silicone tubing can be simply achieved by
   utilizing an elastic deformation of the used tubing. As one
   representative example, a microinjection molding of a prototype
   microfluidic chip having two types of interconnecting ports was
   demonstrated. After obtaining upper and lower plates by the
   microinjection molding process utilizing mold cores with pin structures,
   the thermal bonding of the molded plates was carried out, resulting in
   the prototype plastic microfluidic chip with interconnecting ports. From
   microfluidic experiments using the fabricated prototype, it was found
   that the present method could be quite useful in various microfluidic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a fundamental study on the sloshing effect for
   the sway motion of two boxes in two dimensions. First, we carry out
   experiments for two boxes of the same size and also different size in
   regular waves with different filling ratios, where the boxes are firmly
   connected each other. The sway motion is measured by a non-contact video
   camera. The measured motion is compared with numerical results obtained
   by using a computer program constructed based on the single-dominant
   multi-modal method. Good agreements are in general found, but clear
   discrepancies can also be observed at some incident wave frequencies.
   The friction on the tank rail and the locally resonated fluid motion
   between two boxes are regarded as main error sources. Therefore, it is
   necessary to clarify these error sources to predict more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{The capability to accurately characterize lateral etch rate is needed
   for the manufacture of micro/nano-electromechanical devices which
   incorporate air-gaps. Optical microscopy can be used to monitor the
   etch-front and to detect whether a structure has been completely

   e. g., less than 10 nm. In this paper, an electrical method of
   lateral-etch end-point detection is presented. By electrically testing
   cantilever beams of differing widths, the lateral etch rate can be
   determined. The accuracy of this method is verified via correlation with
   optical interferometry (R = 0.998) for gap thicknesses down to 70 nm.
   This new electrical characterization method is shown to be applicable to
   gap thicknesses as small as 4 nm.}},

Abstract = {{We attempted to isolate Lactobacillus spp. from the marine oyster

   of a future marine aquaculture feed adjuvant. A total of 83 lactobacilli
   strains were isolated from oyster. They were all Gram-positive,
   rod-shaped and catalase-negative. By performing a stress resistance
   assay, we selected eighteen isolates. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
   Lactobacillus paracasei was the most prevalent species among the
   selected isolates. The in vitro antagonistic effect of the selected
   strains against fish pathogens was assayed by measurement of inhibition
   diameters. Except for MH44, MH51, MH53 and MH62, most of the isolates
   showed inhibition of Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio proteolyticus
   (diameters over 15 mm). Lactobacillus rhamnosus MH22 was selected as the
   most stress resistant strain showing the MICs of 1.8 M NaCl, 14\%
   ethanol and 0.014\% hydrogen peroxide. L rhamnosus MH22 isolated from
   oyster has a potential to be applied as a microbial feed adjuvant for

Abstract = {{Integrating the precise GPS carrier phases and INS sensor technologies
   is a methodology that has been applied indispensably in those
   application fields requiring accurate and reliable position, velocity,
   and attitude information. However, conventional integration approaches
   with a single GPS reference station may not fulfil the demanding
   performance requirements, especially in the position component, when the
   baseline length between the reference station and mobile user's GPS
   receiver is greater than a few tens of kilometres. This is because their
   positioning performance is primarily dependent on the common mode of
   errors of GPS measurements. To address this constraint, a novel GPS/INS
   integration scheme using multiple GPS reference stations is proposed
   here that can improve its positioning accuracy by modelling the
   baseline-dependent errors. In this paper, the technical issues concerned
   with implementing the proposed scheme are described, including the GPS
   network correction modelling and integrated GPS/INS filtering. In
   addition, the results from the processing of the simulated measurements
   are presented to characterise the system performance. As a result, it
   has been established that the integration of GPS/INS with multiple
   reference stations would make it possible to ensure centimetre-level
   positioning accuracy, even if the baseline length reaches about 100 km.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that a specific chemokine receptor, CXC
   chemokine receptor-2 (CXCR2), mediates acute inflammatory damage during
   chlamydial urogenital infection, which ultimately leads to the chronic
   sequelae of hydrosalpinx - a surrogate marker of infertility. Homozygous
   CXCR2 genetic knockouts (CXCR2-/-), heterozygous littermates (CXCR2+/-)
   or homozygous wild-type (wt) controls (CXCR2+/+) were infected
   intravaginally with Chlamydia muridarum. Although no change was observed
   in the infection in the lower genital tract based on CXCR zygosity, a
   delay in the ascension of infection into the upper genital tract was
   seen in CXCR2-/- mice. Significantly elevated peripheral blood
   neutrophil counts were observed in CXCR2-/- mice when compared with
   controls. Reduced rates of acute inflammatory indices were observed in
   the affected tissue, indicating reduced neutrophil extravasation
   capacity in the absence of CXCR2. Of note was a reduction in the
   postinfection development of hydrosalpinx that correlated with CXCR2
   zygosity, with both CXCR2-/- (13\%) and their CXCR2+/- (35\%)
   littermates displaying significantly lower rates of hydrosalpinx
   formation than the wt CXCR2-sufficient mice (93\%). We conclude that
   CXCR2 ligands are a major chemotactic signal that induces damaging acute
   inflammation and the resulting chronic pathology during the repair phase
   of the host response, but are dispensable for the resolution of
   infection.}},

Title = {{A new model for semantic photograph description combining basic levels

Abstract = {{Few studies have been conducted to identify users' desired semantic
   levels of image access when describing, searching, and retrieving
   photographs online. The basic level, or the level of abstraction most
   commonly used to describe an item, is a cognitive theory currently under
   consideration in image retrieval research. This study investigates
   potential basic levels of description for online photographs by testing
   the Hierarchy for Online Photograph Representation (HOPR) model, which
   is based on a need for a model that addresses users' basic levels of
   photograph description and retrieval. We developed the HOPR model using
   the following three elements as guides: the most popular tags of all
   time on Flickr, the Pyramid model for visual content description by
   Jorgensen, Jaimes, Benitez, and Chang, and the nine classes of image
   content put forth by Burford, Briggs, and Eakins. In an exploratory test
   of the HOPR model, participants were asked to describe their first
   reaction to, and possible free-text indexing terms for, a small set of
   personal photographs. Content analysis of the data indicated a clear set
   of user preferences that are consistent with prior image description
   studies. Generally speaking, objects in the photograph and events taking
   place in the photograph were the most commonly used levels of
   description. The preliminary HOPR model shows promise for its intended
   utility, but further refinement is needed through additional research.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical and microbiologic features of
   isolates among patients with puerperal mastitis requiring
   hospitalization.
   STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2000 and December 2008, postpartum
   patients who were hospitalized for mastitis were enrolled. The clinical
   characteristics, microbiologic results, management, and outcomes were
   reviewed.
   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven cases were enrolled. Seventy-six
   patients (59.9\%) underwent incision and drainage for abscess drainage,
   all of whom discontinued breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus and
   coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates. Among 81
   isolates of S aureus, 52 (64.2\%) were resistant to oxacillin. Patients
   undergoing incision and drainage were more likely to discontinue
   breastfeeding, had a longer duration of symptoms, a longer
   hospitalization, a higher platelet count and higher rates of infection
   caused by S aureus and oxacillin-resistant S aureus.
   CONCLUSION: Oxacillin-resistant S aureus has emerged in patients with
   puerperal mastitis during the past decade, and often necessitates
   incision and drainage, which results in discontinuation of
   breastfeeding.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal abscess is rare in children, especially in young infants. The
   most common etiology is bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus in particular.
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis is another cause. We report an unusual
   cervical spinal abscess with spinal cord compression in a 13-month-old
   child. The presenting symptoms were weakness in the right arm and,
   predominantly, the right leg for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging
   showed an abscess of the cervical spine, extension with bony
   destruction, and spinal cord compression. The patient underwent an
   emergency neurosurgical decompression and laminectomy. Pathology and
   culture results confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After 12 months of
   antituberculosis treatment, the child could walk with a walker. At 37
   months, he was able to walk without assistance. We conclude that spinal
   tuberculosis should be considered in cases of children with spinal
   cord-compression symptoms and an image showing an extraspinal abscess.
   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical for maximizing a
   functional recovery.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study was designed to elucidate the contribution of
   parental height to the stature of children with inflammatory bowel
   disease (IBD), who often exhibit growth impairment. Accordingly, we
   compared patients' final adult heights and target heights based on
   measured parental heights and examined predictors of final adult height
   in pediatric IBD patients.
   Methods: We prospectively analyzed the growth of 295 patients diagnosed
   between ages 1 and 18 (211 Crohn's disease {[}CD], 84 ulcerative colitis
   {[}UC]) and their family members (283 mothers, 231 fathers, 55
   siblings).
   Results: Twenty-two percent had growth impairment (height for age
   Z-score <-1.64, equivalent to <5th percentile on growth curve) in more
   than 1 measurement since diagnosis; most growth-impaired patients had CD
   (88\% CD versus 12\% UC). Parents of the growth-impaired group had lower
   mean height Z-scores compared to parents of nongrowth-impaired patients
   (-0.67 versus 0.02 for mothers {[}P < 0.001]; -0.31 versus 0.22 for
   fathers {[}P = 0.002]). For 108 patients who reached adult heights and
   had available parental heights, the growth-impaired group continued to
   demonstrate lower adult height Z-scores (-1.38 versus 0.07; P < 0.001).
   Adult heights were within 1 SD of target heights even for the
   growth-impaired group. Only 11.3\% remained persistently growth-impaired
   in adulthood. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated lower
   parental height and minimum patient height Z-score as significant
   predictors of lower final adult height in IBD.
   Conclusions: Parental height is a powerful determinant of linear growth
   even in the presence of chronic inflammation, and should be an integral
   part of the evaluation of growth in IBD children.}},

   erase and further reduced by an in-situ regulated erase operation using
   negative feedback. Although over-programmed charges leak from the
   floating gates over several days, the remaining charges are retained
   without further loss. The 512-bit planar EEPROM occupies 0.018 mm(2) and

Abstract = {{A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strain, designated
   MJ07(T), was isolated from a farm soil and was characterized to
   determine its taxonomic position by using a polyphasic approach.
   Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain MJ07(T)
   belongs to the family Alcaligenaceae, class Betaproteobacteria, and is
   related most closely to Pusillimonas ginsengisoli KCTC 22046(T) (98.6\%
   sequence similarity) and Pusillimonas noertemannii BN9(T) (96.9\%). The
   levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain MJ07(T) and
   members of all other recognized species of the family Alcaligenaceae
   were below 95.2\%. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain MJ07(T)
   was 59.4 mol\%. The detection of a quinone system with ubiquinone Q-8 as
   the major respiratory lipoquinone, putrescine as the predominant
   polyamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol,
   diphosphatidylglycerol and two unknown aminolipids as major polar lipids
   and a fatty acid profile with C(16:0)(32.0\%), C(17:0) cyclo (24.7\%)
   and C(19:0) cyclo omega 8c (11.5\%) as the major components supported
   the affiliation of strain MJ07(T) to the genus Pusillimonas. Strain
   MJ07(T) exhibited relatively low levels of DNA DNA relatedness with
   respect to P. ginsengisoli KCTC 22046(T) (50 +/- 8\%) and P.
   noertemannii KACC 13183(T) (18 +/- 7\%). On the basis of its phenotypic
   and genotypic properties together with its phylogenetic distinctiveness,
   strain M107(T) (=KCTC 22455(T) =JCM 16386(T)) should be classified in
   the genus Pusillimonas as the type strain of a novel species, for which
   the name Pusillimonas soli sp. nov. is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a technique to improve the slow-light performance of a

   with a stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain medium in optical
   fibers. We evaluate device performance of SCISSOR-only and SCISSOR + SBS
   systems for different numbers of cascaded resonators from 1 to 70 using
   two different data fidelity metrics including eye-opening and mutual
   information. A practical system design is demonstrated by analyzing its
   performance in terms of fractional delay, power transmission, and data
   fidelity. We observe that the results from the two metrics are in good
   agreement. Based on system optimization under practical resource and
   fidelity constraints, the SCISSOR consisting of 70 cascaded resonators
   provides a fractional delay of similar to 8 with 22 dB attenuation at a
   signal bit rate of 10 Gbps. The combined optimal SCISSOR (with 70
   resonators) + SBS system provides a improved fractional delay up to
   similar to 17 with unit power transmission under the same constraints.}},

Abstract = {{There is a wide variety of congenital anomalies that may affect the
   gastrointestinal tract. Most symptomatic congenital anomalies are found
   in newborns and infants. Such anomalies are relatively rare in
   adolescents and adults, and they may be difficult to identify because
   clinical symptoms often are nonspecific and insidious, causing them to
   be mistaken for other common abdominal conditions. Multimodality imaging
   is useful in evaluating congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal
   tract in adults. The imaging features at radiography, fluoroscopy,
   ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging may
   help identify congenital gastrointestinal anomalies such as congenital
   esophageal stenosis, gastric volvulus, duodenal web, annular pancreas,
   heterotopic pancreas, cecal volvulus, anomalies of the omphalomesenteric
   duct, Hirschsprung disease, and gastrointestinal duplication cyst.
   Familiarity with the imaging features of the various congenital
   anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract and their complications is
   important to establish the correct diagnosis and determine appropriate
   treatment, which is critical to avoid life-threatening complications.

Title = {{A Safety Measure for Control Mode Switching of Skill-Assist for
   Effective Automotive Manufacturing}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{817-825}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The objective of our study is to develop a safety measure that ensures
   smooth control mode switching of an intelligent assist device
   (IAD)-Skill-Assist for the purpose of effective automotive
   manufacturing. Smooth switching, i.e., switching without abrupt
   deceleration, from the hands-off control mode (used for automatic
   travel) to the hands-on control mode (as typified by a power-assist
   control mode) is expected to enhance the productivity of IADs. However,
   the hazardous behaviors, i.e., careless behaviors that disregard an
   approaching IAD in hands-off control mode might cause collision and
   serious injuries to a human operator. For safety purposes, we focused on
   the operator's gesture of reaching for the force sensor of the
   Skill-Assist. Laser range sensors were employed to recognize the
   reaching gesture during control mode switching. A reaching gesture
   recognition algorithm, based on a hidden Markov model, processes
   characteristic patterns acquired by the laser range sensors, and judges
   the operator safety. Experimental results suggest that the Skill-Assist
   to which the proposed safety measure was applied could recognize the
   reaching gesture of an operator when the control mode was smoothly
   switched. In an experiment on hazardous behavior, the Skill-Assist could
   predict that the operator would be unsafe.
   Note to Practitioners-IADs are force-control based robotic devices that
   enable a human operator to handle heavy modules, and they play a
   valuable role in automobile production lines. IADs can function in both
   a force control mode, defined as a hands-on control mode, and in an
   automatic traveling mode, defined as the hands-off control mode. How the
   unit switches between the hands-off and hands-on control modes has a
   considerable impact on productivity of automotive manufacturing. Smooth
   control mode switching, i.e., control mode switching without abrupt
   deceleration, could be achieved in our previous study. However, safety
   measures for dealing with the hazardous behaviors, i.e., careless
   behaviors that disregard an approaching IAD in hands-off control mode,
   which might cause serious injuries to the operator, were not considered.
   The objective of our study is to develop a safety measure ensuring
   smooth control mode switching of an IAD based on the method in our
   previous study, the use of laser range sensors (LRSs), and a pattern
   recognition algorithm. The proposed safety measure is expected to allow
   smooth control mode switching of IADs in practical automobile
   manufacturing; it can ensure safety monitoring that continuously
   operates an IAD without the production cycle delay by the frequent
   abrupt deceleration. This is important for efficient and safe operations
   of IADs with hands-off and hands-on control modes and will contribute
   toward effective automobile manufacturing. However, the proposed safety
   measure adopted the general purpose type LRSs and depended on the
   relatively large-scaled software for safety purpose. Therefore, LRS with
   certification by safety standards, and techniques and verification
   processes for safe software are essentially required for practical
   application. Moreover, the proposed safety measure was verified by
   certain foreseeable hazardous behaviors; for further improvement and
   practical application, it should be verified for other possible
   behaviors in fields where IADs are used.}},

Abstract = {{The size effect observed in the micro-indentation of FCC single crystal
   copper is modelled by the employment of mechanism-based strain gradient
   crystal plasticity (MSG-CP). The total slip resistance in each active
   system is assumed to be due to a mixed population of forest obstacles
   arising from both statistically stored and geometrically necessary
   dislocations. The MSG-CP constitutive model is implemented into the
   Abaqus/Standard FE platform by developing the User MATerial subroutine
   UMAT. The simulation of micro-indentation hardness on (0 0 1) and (1 1
   1) single crystal copper, with a conical indenter having a sharp tip, a
   conical indenter with a spherical tip and a three-sided Berkovich
   indenter, is undertaken. The phenomena of pile-up and sink-in have been
   observed in the simulation and dealt with by appropriate use of the
   contact analysis function in Abaqus. These phenomena have been taken
   into account in the determination of the contact areas and hence the
   average indentation depth for anisotropic single crystals. The depth
   dependence of the micro-indentation hardness, the size effect, is
   calculated. The micro-hardness results from the simulation are compared
   with those of the published experimental ones in the literature and a
   good agreement is found. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an empirical study focused on the
   observation and analysis of an innovative design process. We have had
   the opportunity to observe and participate in the early phase of a new
   innovative project within a design office of a truck manufacturer. Our
   observations based on the actor-network theory highlight the importance
   of the various design rationales carried by the actors involved. The
   results of this study show the weakness and complexity of an innovative
   process within a highly constrained environment. We particularly show
   that carrying out innovation requires different viewpoints with regard
   to the object of the design to evolve along with the network of actors
   and the organisation involved. The issue of product and process
   integration involving knowledge transfer between actors throughout the
   design process is also discussed here. As a result, we highlight the
   importance of rethinking the interface role played by the material
   expert (in our case) and, in line with other works, we put forward the
   ``interface actor{''} as the key network actor involved during the early
   development phases. To provide the network and the interface actor with
   a means to share information and co-operate during these informal early
   design phases we propose some features of a new web-based information
   system and the basis for a debate on the idea lifecycle management
   concept as a solution to the issue of innovative idea information
   structuring.}},

Abstract = {{Methods: Leptin levels were measured in 103 consecutive women with
   anorexia nervosa. Results: Spine BMD and Z-score values were found to be
   significantly lower in the low tertile compared with the highest
   tertile. Duration of amenorrhea and leptin level accounted for 27\% of
   the variance in lumbar spine BMD.
   The purpose of this study was to assess leptin levels and other
   biological variables in a population of anorexia nervosa patients.
   Leptin levels were measured consecutively in 103 women with anorexia
   nervosa (AN) with a mean age of 24.9 +/- 7.4 years. Osteodensitometry
   was also performed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
   Spine bone mineral density (BMD) and Z-score values were found to be
   significantly lower in the low tertile compared with the highest
   tertile. Duration of amenorrhea and leptin level accounted for 27\% of
   the variance in lumbar spine BMD. The mean leptin level was 3.9 +/- 4.6
   ng/mL (normal values, 3.5-11 ng/mL). The distribution of leptin values
   was not a Gaussian distribution, and a log-transformed was therefore
   performed. A significant correlation was found between leptin level and
   spinal BMD (r = 0.3; p = 0.002); significant correlations were observed
   for both femoral neck and total hip BMDs. When leptin level values were
   divided into tertiles, spine BMD and Z-score values were found to be
   significantly lower in the lower tertile (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02)
   compared with the highest tertile. For femoral neck BMDs, the T-score
   was slightly lower between low and high tertile, but the difference was
   not statistically significant (p = 0.07). When multivariate analyses
   were performed, two independent factors which could possibly account for
   the variance in spinal BMDs were found. Duration of amenorrhea and
   leptin level accounted for 27\% of the variance (p < 0.0001).
   The mechanisms underlying bone loss in AN patients remain unclear and
   complex, involving hypoestrogenia as well as nutritional factors such as
   insulin-like growth factor and leptin.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Perioperative hemorrhage in the repair of acute type A
   aortic dissection increases morbidity, mortality, and costs of
   treatment. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) mitigates
   intractable blood loss in surgery. By enhancing thrombin generation on
   activated platelet surfaces and activating thrombin-activatable
   fibrinolysis inhibitor and factor XIII, rFVIIa promotes platelet
   aggregation and fibrin plug formation at the site of endothelial injury.
   We report outcomes for type A aortic dissection patients treated
   postoperatively with rFVIIa for life-threatening hemorrhage.
   Methods: Patients charts were reviewed to gather demographic,
   procedural, and laboratory data as well as information regarding
   clinical outcomes and blood product use.
   Results: Nine patients with acute type A aortic dissection received
   rFVIIa in the perioperative period. In the 6 hour period after rFVIIa
   treatment, transfusion of blood products was reduced. The international
   normalized ratio decreased after treatment (1.6 versus 0.9, P < .01).
   One patient experienced perioperative stroke.
   Conclusions: In patients with acute type A aortic dissections who have
   life-threatening bleeding, early administration of rFVIIa may safely
   normalize coagulation variables, decrease transfusion requirements, and
   enhance hemostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Eating behavior can be influenced by the rewarding value of food, i.e.,
   ``liking{''} and ``wanting.{''} The objective of this study was to
   assess in normal-weight dietary restrained (NR) vs. unrestrained (NU)
   eaters how rewarding value of food is affected by satiety, and by eating
   a nonhealthy perceived, dessert-specific food vs. a healthy perceived,
   neutral food (chocolate mousse vs. cottage cheese). Subjects (24NR age =
   25.0 +/- 8.2 years, BMI = 22.3 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2); 26NU age = 24.8 +/- 8.0
   years, BMI = 22.1 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2)) came to the university twice, fasted
   (randomized crossover design). Per test-session ``liking{''} and
   ``wanting{''} for 72 items divided in six categories (bread, filling,
   drinks, dessert, sweets, stationery (placebo)) was measured, before and
   after consumption of chocolate mousse/cottage cheese, matched for energy
   content (5.6 kJ/g) and individual daily energy requirements (10\%).
   Chocolate mousse was liked more than cottage cheese (P < 0.05). After
   consumption of chocolate mousse or cottage cheese, appetite and
   ``liking{''} vs. placebo were decreased in NR and NU (P < 0.03), whereas
   ``wanting{''} was only decreased in NR vs. NU (P <= 0.01). In NR vs. NU
   ``wanting{''} was specifically decreased after chocolate mousse vs.
   cottage cheese; this decrease concerned especially ``wanting{''} for

Abstract = {{If it survives for a little longer, the human race will probably start
   to spread across its galaxy. Germ warfare, though, or environmental
   collapse or many another factor might shortly drive humans to
   extinction. Are they likely to avoid it? Well, suppose they spread
   across the galaxy. Of all humans who would ever have been born, maybe
   only one in a hundred thousand would have lived as early as you. If, in
   contrast, humans soon became extinct then because of the population
   explosion you would have been `fairly ordinary'. Roughly ten per cent of
   all humans would have been your contemporaries. Now (as the cosmologist
   Brandon Carter saw to his dismay) a scientific principle tells us not to
   treat observations as highly extraordinary when they could easily be
   fairly ordinary. How to apply the principle is controversial, yet it
   seems we can safely conclude that humanity's chances of galactic
   colonization cannot be high. Still, we should work to make them as high
   as possible, resisting those philosophers who argue that human
   extinction would be no tragedy.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:
   The objective of this study was to determine the test characteristics
   for two different ultrasound (US) measures of severe dehydration in
   children (aorta to inferior vena cava {[}IVC] ratio and IVC inspiratory
   collapse) and one clinical measure of severe dehydration (the World
   Health Organization {[}WHO] dehydration scale).
   Methods:
   The authors enrolled a prospective cohort of children presenting with
   diarrhea and/or vomiting to three rural Rwandan hospitals. Children were
   assessed clinically using the WHO scale and then underwent US of the IVC
   by a second clinician. All children were weighed on admission and then
   fluid-resuscitated according to standard hospital protocols. A percent
   weight change between admission and discharge of greater than 10\% was
   considered the criterion standard for severe dehydration. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for each of the three
   tests of severe dehydration compared to the criterion standard.
   Results:
   Children ranged in age from 1 month to 10 years; 29\% of the children
   had severe dehydration according to the criterion standard. Of the three
   different measures of dehydration tested, only US assessment of the
   aorta/IVC ratio had an area under the ROC curve statistically different
   from the reference line. At its best cut-point, the aorta/IVC ratio had
   a sensitivity of 93\% and specificity of 59\%, compared with 93\% and
   35\% for IVC inspiratory collapse and 73\% and 43\% for the WHO scale.
   Conclusions:
   Ultrasound of the aorta/IVC ratio can be used to identify severe
   dehydration in children presenting with acute diarrhea and may be
   helpful in guiding clinical management.

Abstract = {{Adolescents with chronic pain frequently report sleep disturbances,
   particularly short sleep duration, night wakings, and poor sleep
   quality. Prior research has been limited by assessment of subjectively
   reported sleep only and lack of data on daily relationships between
   sleep and pain. The current study utilized multilevel modeling to
   compare daily associations between sleep and pain in adolescents with
   chronic pain and healthy adolescents. Ninety-seven adolescents (n = 39
   chronic pain; n = 58 healthy) aged 12-18, 70.1\% female participated.
   Adolescents completed pain diary ratings (0-10 NRS) and actigraphic
   sleep monitoring for 10 days. Actigraphic sleep variables (duration,
   efficiency, WASO) and self-reported sleep quality were tested as
   predictors of next-day pain, and daytime pain was tested as a predictor
   of sleep that night. Effects of age, gender, study group, and depressive
   symptoms on daily associations between sleep and pain were also tested.
   Multivariate analyses revealed that nighttime sleep (p < .001) and
   minutes awake after sleep onset (WASO) (p < .05) predicted next-day
   pain, with longer sleep duration and higher WASO associated with higher
   pain. Contrary to hypotheses, neither nighttime sleep quality nor sleep
   efficiency predicted pain the following day. The interaction between
   nighttime sleep efficiency and study group was significant, with
   adolescents with pain showing stronger associations between sleep
   efficiency and next-day pain than healthy participants (p = .05).
   Contrary to hypotheses, daytime pain did not predict nighttime sleep.
   Daily associations between pain and sleep suggest that further work is
   needed to identify specific adolescent sleep behaviors (e. g.,
   compensatory sleep behaviors) that may be targeted in interventions. (c)

Abstract = {{Beyond their hypolipidemic effect, statins reduce cardiovascular risk in
   hypertensive subjects via various mechanisms; one suggested mechanism is
   that they reduce sympathetic activity. We investigated the hypothesis
   that simvastatin decreased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in
   31 hypertensive subjects with hypercholesterolemia (aged 38.7 +/- 10
   years). In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study,
   patients were treated with simvastatin (40mg day(-1); n=15) or placebo
   (n=16) for 8 weeks. Before and after treatment, we measured MSNA, blood
   pressure and heart rate. Baroreceptor control of the heart rate, or
   baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), was computed by the sequence method, a
   cross-analysis of systolic blood pressure and the electrocardiogram R-R
   interval. Blood samples were tested for plasma levels of catecholamines,
   neuropeptide Y, aldosterone, endothelin and renin activity. Simvastatin
   significantly reduced MSNA (from 36.5 +/- 5 to 27.8 +/- 6 bursts per
   min, P=0.001), heart rate (from 77 +/- 6.7 to 71 +/- 6.1 beats per min,
   P=0.01) and both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 249
   +/- 30.6 to 184 +/- 28.3 mgdl(-1), P=0.001 and from 169 +/- 30.6 to 117
   +/- 31.2 mgdl(-1), P=0.01, respectively). Simvastatin also improved BRS
   (from 10.3 +/- 4.1 to 17.1 +/- 4.3 ms per mm Hg, P=0.04). No changes
   were observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressures, or in plasma
   levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, endothelin, aldosterone and
   renin activity. After simvastatin therapy, MSNA and BRS were inversely
   related (r=-0.94, P<0.05). In conclusion, we found that, in patients
   with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin reduced MSNA,
   and this was related to increased baroreceptor sensitivity. Hypertension

   common that the system is continuously monitored. Therefore, the
   research on the maintenance optimization of the continuously monitored

   maintenance is considered to be imperfect and formulated. The expected
   interval of two continuous preventive maintenances is derived. Then, the
   maintenance optimization model of the continuously monitored
   deterioration system is presented. In the model, the minimization of the
   expected operational cost per unit time and the maximization of the
   system availability are the optimization objectives. The improved ideal
   point method with the normalized objective functions is employed to
   solve the proposed model. The validity and sensitivity of the proposed
   multiobjective maintenance optimization model are analyzed by a

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Constitutive activation of the signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway is frequently encountered in several
   human cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). Thus, agents that
   suppress STAT3 phosphorylation have a potential for treatment of MM. In
   the present report, we investigated whether thymoquinone (TQ), the main
   component isolated from the medicinal plant Nigella sativa, modulated
   the STAT3 signalling pathway in MM cells.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   The effect of TQ on both constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation,
   associated protein kinases, STAT3-regulated gene products involved in
   proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, cellular proliferation and
   apoptosis in MM cells, was investigated.
   KEY RESULTS
   We found that TQ inhibited both constitutive and IL-6-inducible STAT3
   phosphorylation which correlated with the inhibition of c-Src and JAK2
   activation. Vanadate reversed the TQ-induced down-regulation of STAT3
   activation, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine
   phosphatase. Indeed, we found that TQ can induce the expression of Src
   homology-2 phosphatase 2 that correlated with suppression of STAT3
   activation. TQ also down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated
   gene products, such as cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, Mcl-1 and
   vascular endothelial growth factor. Finally, TQ induced the accumulation
   of cells in sub-G1 phase, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis,
   as indicated by poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. TQ also
   significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of thalidomide and
   bortezomib in MM cells.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   Our study has identified STAT3 signalling as a target of TQ and has thus
   raised its potential application in the prevention and treatment of MM
   and other cancers.}},

   Composite membranes based on SPEEK and PEEK-BI are prepared and their

   that the composite membranes exhibit greatly improved mechanical

Abstract = {{Moisture sensitive trees from the central Tien Shan area, northwest
   China show a pattern of extremely low growth in 1945. Evidence from a
   number of sources indicates that a remarkable drought event, in both
   spatial and temporal terms, occurred over the central Tien Shan and
   surrounding areas in that year. Climatological analysis reveals that
   this significant growth reduction is likely a combined effect of
   unusually dry and warm conditions. We also show that this extreme
   drought is associated with a La Nina or cold phase El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) event. Meanwhile, cooler sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) in the northern Indian Ocean, particularly in the Arabian Sea,
   also appear to have contributed to this severe drought episode. Overall,
   our case study of 1945 extreme drought event in the central Tien Shan
   area suggests there might be a close link between extreme climate
   conditions in remote north central Asia and coupled ocean-atmosphere
   dynamics in the tropics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a novel cytokine of the IL-6/12 family with a
   broad range of immune regulation properties, which has been considered
   as a potential therapeutic agent for immune diseases and cancers.
   However, little is known about the effect of IL-27 on human neutrophils
   before its clinical administration. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of IL-27 on human neutrophil functions including adhesion,
   reactive oxygen species (ROS)/cytotoxic granule components production,
   inflammatory cytokines production, major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) molecules expression and neutrophils' survival. We showed that
   IL-27 receptor complex, WSX-1/TCCR and gp130, is constitutively
   expressed on human neutrophils. In vitro, IL-27 suppressed neutrophil
   adhesion in response to fMLP, which might depend on the down-regulation
   of Mac-1. IL-27 also suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced ROS
   production and attenuated cytotoxic granule components production in the
   cytoplasm of human neutrophils. In addition, IL-27 enhanced the
   production of IL-1 beta but not TNF-alpha from neutrophils. However,
   IL-27 failed to regulate the expression of MHC molecules and the
   survival of human neutrophils. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that
   IL-27 mainly down-modulates human neutrophil function, which might
   extend our understanding of the role of IL-27 in the innate immune
   response.}},

Title = {{Interval Model Control of Consumable Double-Electrode Gas Metal Arc
   Welding Process}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{826-839}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This application paper concerns the modeling and control of an
   innovative welding process, namely, the Consumable Double-Electrode Gas
   Metal Arc Welding. This innovative process can dramatically increase
   welding productivity and reduce weld distortion. It has demonstrated the
   feasibility to double the travel speed for automatic welding but
   requires controls to realize its unique advantages. To reach this goal,
   the bypass voltage and base metal current were selected as process
   outputs to be controlled. The bypass current and main wire feed speed
   were selected as the inputs and the control system was reduced to two
   single-input-single-output (SISO) subsystems for convenient
   implementation and design. Physical analysis and derivation show that
   these subsystems can be approximated as first-order model systems but
   their parameters depend on manufacturing conditions. Hence, they were
   described using first-order interval models whose parameters are unknown
   but bounded by known intervals. Step response experiments were conducted
   with selected range of manufacturing conditions to identify a few models
   for each of the subsystems. These models were then used to derive two
   interval models. To increase the stability margin, the intervals
   identified were artificially enlarged. Finally, a prediction-based
   interval model control algorithm was used to control the resultant
   interval models and closed-loop control experiments verified the
   effectiveness of the developed control system.
   Note to Practitioners-Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is the most widely
   used arc welding process. However, its current melting the wire is the
   same as the current heating the base metal. Increasing the melting speed
   for higher productivity proportionally increases the base metal heat
   input resulting in increased distortion. To resolve this problem, the
   authors proposed a simple way to modify the GMAW process such that the
   base metal current is independent from the melting current. The melting
   speed can thus be increased, while the base metal heat input and
   resultant distortion are still controlled at given desirable levels.
   This modified process, referred to as the double-electrode GMAW or
   DE-GMAW, has been proved to be capable of doubling the travel speed for
   automobile welding. However, it is more complex than GMAW and requires
   appropriate controls to achieve its claimed advantages. This paper is
   devoted to the modeling and control of this innovative process.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the downlink opportunistic scheduling approach is studied
   in a multiuser environment with single-antenna transmitter and users.
   Exact bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived under the assumptions
   of full and quantized channel state information (CSI) at the
   transmitter. These expressions are then used to optimize the channel
   state feedback parameters. Moreover, asymptotic BERs are investigated in
   the limiting cases of a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a large
   number of users K. It is shown that both under the full and quantized
   CSI assumptions, the achieved BER is proportional to SNR-K and K-SNR in
   these two asymptotic cases, respectively. This means that the diversity
   order is equal to K, whereas the multiuser diversity gain is equal to
   SNR.
   In the case when the CSI feedback is quantized, the impact of feedback
   errors on the achieved BER is studied. It is shown that the
   opportunistic scheduling can greatly improve the BER performance even if
   the feedback is quite low-rate and erroneous.}},

Abstract = {{The family with sequence similarity 172, member A (FAM172A) is a
   hypothetical protein. We recently cloned the FAM172A gene from normal
   human aortic tissues. In a previous study we also showed that the
   FAM172A gene was up-regulated by high glucose levels in macrophages. In
   the present study, we further identified the FAM172A protein at the
   level of translation and studied the effects of high glucose levels on
   its expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells. The FAM172A gene was
   subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors, PDC315 and pEGFP-N2.
   The cloned sequence shows an open reading frame of 1251 nucleotides
   encoding a protein of 416 amino acids. We further expressed the
   recombinant FAM172A protein and generated rabbit anti-human FAM172A
   polyclonal antibodies. The FAM172A protein was identified for the first
   time at the translation level by Western blot analysis. Western blotting
   also demonstrated that the FAM172A protein could be detected in human
   aortic endothelial, human aortic smooth muscle cells and THP-1-derived
   macrophages, the highest expression being observed in the human aortic
   smooth muscle cells. By a combination of bioinformatics and confocal
   laser scanning microscopy, we found that the FAM172A protein in HEK293
   cells, was mainly located in the nucleus, and that there was an Arb2
   conserved domain in the FAM172A protein sequence. We also presented
   evidence that the FAM172 protein expression in human aortic smooth
   muscle cells was up-regulated by high glucose levels in a
   concentration-dependent and time-course manner. We speculated that as a
   novel protein, FAM172A could be involved in the pathogenesis of high
   glucose-induced vascular damage.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal compression of a Ti-5.6Al-4.8Sn-2.0Zr alloy was conducted on
   a Thermecmaster-Z simulator at the deformation temperatures ranging from

   s(-1), and the maximum height reduction of 70.0\%. In the two-phase
   region of the Ti-5.6Al-4.8Sn-2.0Zr alloy, the volume fraction of alpha
   phase decreases with an increase in deformation temperature, but the
   grain size has a slight variation with deformation temperature. The
   strain rate affects both morphologies and grain size of the alpha phase
   in the isothermal compression of the Ti-5.6Al-4.8Sn-2.0Zr alloy. The
   optimal height reduction also contributes to the small and

Abstract = {{The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in
   activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and
   memory. In a sample of 948 younger and older adults, we investigated
   whether a common Val66Met missense polymorphism (rs6265) in the BDNF
   gene affects the serial position curve-a fundamental phenomenon of
   associative memory identified by Hermann Ebbinghaus more than a century
   ago. We found a BDNF polymorphism effect for backward recall in older
   adults only, with Met-allele carriers (i.e., individuals with reduced
   BDNF signaling) recalling fewer items than Val homozygotes. This effect
   was specific to the primacy and middle portions of the serial position
   curve, where intralist interference and associative demands are
   especially high. The poorer performance of older Met-allele carriers
   reflected transposition errors, whereas no genetic effect was found for
   omissions. These findings indicate that effects of the BDNF polymorphism
   on episodic memory are most likely to be observed when the associative
   and executive demands are high. Furthermore, the findings are in line
   with the hypothesis that the magnitude of genetic effects on cognition
   is greater when brain resources are reduced, as is the case in old age.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in
   the world especially in Asia. Radiofrequency ablation is now commonly
   use as either first line or in combination with other treatment modality
   for patients with HCC. It is the objective of this article to report our
   experience in a tertiary referral hospital.
   Methods:
   Patients who diagnosed with HCC and underwent RFA in Queen Elizabeth
   Hospital during the period from May 2002 to February 2009 were included
   and analyzed.
   Results:
   During this period, 138 sessions of RFA were performed in 117
   consecutive patients with HCC. The calculated rate of primary (single
   attempt) successful ablation during this entire period was 89.2\%. The
   in-hospital/30-day mortality rate was zero, and morbidity was 24.1\%.
   Hospital stays were significantly longer in the open group (4.4 days
   versus 8.9 days, P = 0.000). Median follow-up in this study was 21
   months. 11 (9.4\%), 10 (8.5\%) and 49 (41.0\%) patients developed local
   tumor progression (LTP), systemic recurrence and Intrahepatic distant
   recurrence (IDR), respectively. The mean and median times to recurrence
   were 15.4 and 11 months, respectively. Most patients (91\%) with LTP
   developed in the first 24 months. Disease-free survival was 65\% at 1
   year, 40\% at 3 years and 25\% at 5 years. Overall survival at 1, 3 and
   5 years was 85, 66 and 40\%, respectively. Alpha fetoprotein, aFP >
   1,000 ng/ml and multiple tumor ablation predicted increased risk of
   recurrence.
   Conclusion:
   Radiofrequecy ablation is useful tool in treating patients with HCC with
   high successful rate. However, intrahepatic recurrence is common and a
   well designed post ablation follow up protocol based on a sound
   knowledge of recurrence pattern is vital.}},

Abstract = {{Metastasis to distant sites is a severe treatment challenge and a major
   cause of death for breast cancer patients. Laser immunotherapy (LIT) is
   a novel technique, combining a selective photothermal therapy with local
   application of glycated chitosan, a potent immunoadjuvant. The
   pre-clinical studies of LIT have shown its unique characteristics in
   generating specific antitumor immunity. The clinical application of LIT
   in the treatment of melanoma patients has achieved preliminary success.
   Recently, LIT has been used to treat late-stage breast cancer patients.
   Here we report for the first time the clinical results of this
   combination therapy in breast cancer patients. The LIT treatment
   procedures are presented and the medical history of two stage IV breast
   cancer patients is reviewed. Most of the breast cancer lesions and the
   metastasis of lung and brain disappeared after repeated treatments of
   LIT. One patient achieved complete response; the other achieved partial
   response at the time of this report. Although there is still a long way
   for LIT to become a standard modality for breast cancer treatment, the
   results of this study indicated its promising future.}},

Abstract = {{The eared pheasant consists of four species: white eared pheasant
   (Crossoptilon crossoptilon), Tibetan eared pheasant (Crossoptilon
   harmani), blue eared pheasant (Crossoptilon auritum), and brown eared
   pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum). These species are found only in
   China, and are also on the list of the world's threatened species. In
   this paper, 74 individuals from the four eared pheasant species were
   assessed for population genetic diversity by means of fluorescent-AFLP
   markers. A total of 429 AFLP peaks were amplified by 11 pairs of
   fluorescent EcoRI/TaQI primer combinations. Out of all markers, 329
   AFLPs were polymorphic. Each primer combination produced in reactions
   from 19 to 72 fragments and the polymorphic peaks percentage ranged from
   53.33\% to 86.11\% with an average of 74.36\% polymorphic bands. Genetic
   distance between species and genetic diversity within species were
   evaluated using Jaccard's similarity coefficients (SC) and the
   corresponding dendrogram. It was found that there was a moderate genetic
   distance between the four species (SC = 0.674-0.832). Brown eared
   pheasant was genetically closely related to blue eared pheasant (SC =
   0.832), while white eared pheasant was more closely related to Tibetan
   eared pheasant (SC = 0.812). Genetic diversity was lower in brown eared
   pheasant (SC = 0.913) and Tibetan eared pheasant (SC = 0.903) than in
   white eared pheasant (SC = 0.832) and blue eared pheasant (SC = 0.853).

Abstract = {{Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase with the ability to oxidize a broad
   range of persistent organic pollutants, including benzo{[}a]pyrene, the
   most carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, the reaction conditions for
   benzo{[}a]pyrene oxidation by laccase from Trametes versicolor were
   optimized in a liquid medium by a series of single factor experiments.
   The maximal benzo{[}a]pyrene oxidation rate was observed at 40 degrees
   C, pH 4, 10\% of acetonitrile and an incubation time of more than 24 hr,
   and the benzo{[}a]pyrene oxidation was enhanced significantly by the
   addition of a mediator,
   2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid) (ABTS). Laccase
   was also applied to aged PAHs polluted soil to examine the efficiency of
   enzymatic bioremediation. The results showed that the enzyme was still
   effective in the degradation of anthracene, benzo{[}a]pyrene and
   benzo{[}a]anthracene in soil. Moreover, the degradation rate of most
   PAHs increased by the addition of ABTS. Our results indicated that the
   bioremediation of PAHs contaminated soil using laccase is feasible but a
   suboptimal pH might be a limiting factor in the enzymatic treatment of
   soil.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that duplicate genes on the X chromosome evolve much
   faster than duplicate genes on autosomes in Drosophila melanogaster.
   However, whether this phenomenon is general and can be applied to other
   species is not known. Here we examined this issue in chicken that have
   heterogametic females (females have ZW sex chromosome). We compared
   sequence divergence of duplicate genes on the Z chromosome with those on
   autosomes. We found that duplications on the Z chromosome indeed evolved
   faster than those on autosomes and show distinct patterns of molecular
   evolution from autosomal duplications. Examination of the expression of
   duplicate genes revealed an enrichment of duplications on the Z
   chromosome having male-biased expression and an enrichment of
   duplications on the autosomes having female-biased expression. These
   results suggest an evolutionary trend of the recruitment of duplicate
   genes towards reproduction-specific function. The faster evolution of
   duplications on Z than on the autosomes is most likely contributed by
   the selective forces driving the fixation of adaptive mutations on Z.
   Therefore, the common phenomena observed in both flies and chicken
   suggest that duplicate genes on sex chromosomes have distinct dynamics
   and are more influenced by natural selection than autosomal
   duplications, regardless of the kind of sex determination systems.}},

Abstract = {{The world's energy demand is met mainly by the fossil fuels today. The
   use of such fuels, however, causes serious environmental issues,
   including global warming, ozone layer depletion and acid rains. A
   sustainable solution to the issues is to replace the fossil fuels with
   renewable ones. Implementing such a solution, however, requires
   overcoming a number of technological barriers including low energy
   density, intermittent supply and mobility of the renewable energy
   sources. A potential approach to overcoming these barriers is to use an
   appropriate energy carrier, which can store, transport and distribute
   energy. The work to be reported in this paper aims to assess and compare
   a chemical energy carrier, hydrogen, with a physical energy carrier,
   liquid air/nitrogen, and discuss potential applications of the physical
   carrier. The ocean energy is used as an example of the renewable energy
   sources in the work. The assessment and comparison are carried out in
   terms of the overall efficiency, including production,
   storage/transportation and energy extraction. The environmental impact,
   waste heat recovery and safety issues are also considered. It is found
   that the physical energy carrier may be a better alternative to the
   chemical energy carrier under some circumstances, particularly when
   there are waste heat sources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A flow cytometry-based immuno-titration titer assay was established to
   determine infectious unit (IU) and transducing unit (TU) of modified
   vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vectors. This titration method enumerates
   infected cells by measuring the expression of viral protein for IU and
   transgene protein for TU in individual cells after staining with
   fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. It presents many advantages over
   standard virus titration approaches, such as TCID(50) or plaque assay,
   for its convenience, rapidity and accuracy as illustrated by excellent
   assay linearity and reproducibility. Importantly, the Ill and the
   TCID(50) assays generated similar batch-specific titer values when
   testing varied MVA-derived virus preparations. Assay development
   revealed that the post-infection time at which viral protein expression
   is evaluated, host cell type, and blocking the formation and release of
   progeny virion with nocodazole, an anti-microtubule agent or rifampin, a
   specific vaccinia virus assembly inhibitor, are critical parameters for
   the precision, robustness, and accuracy of IU titer determination. An
   added advantage of this assay is that it enables the concurrent
   determination of IU and transducing units (TU) by measuring the
   expression of a transgene product when testing recombinant viruses. The
   latter was demonstrated using a MVA vector carrying a human HER-2 gene
   fragment as model. Hence, this assay is very versatile in that it can be
   used to determine IU as well as multiple TU titers simultaneously.
   Furthermore, it can readily be adapted to other poxvirus vectors. (c)

Abstract = {{The method of complete polar decomposition for arbitrary Mueller
   matrixes is introduced to analyze the birefringence vector induced in a
   fiber, and then based on the Mueller matrix (MM) method, three kinds of
   computation methods including the absolute, the relative, and the
   differential rotation methods are proposed and investigated in detail. A
   computer-controlled measure system is employed to measure the Mueller
   matrix and birefringence vector for a 2.5-km fiber system with length
   5mm under lateral press in complicated environment with much
   perturbation. Experimental results show that the differential rotation
   (DR) method is the optimal approach to achieve fiber birefringence
   vectors in a large dynamic range of lateral press on fibers in perturbed
   situations, which reaches the highest linearity of 0.9998 and average
   deviation below 2.5\%. Further analyses demonstrate that the DR method
   is also available for accurate orientation of lateral press direction
   and the average deviation is about 1.1.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion is regulated by a multitude of
   pathways initiated distally to the core cell-matrix adhesion machinery,
   such as via growth factor signaling. In contrast to these extrinsically
   sourced pathways, we now identify a regulatory pathway that is intrinsic
   to the core adhesion machinery, providing an internal regulatory
   feedback loop to fine tune adhesion levels. This autoinhibitory negative
   feedback loop is initiated by cell adhesion to vitronectin, leading to
   PAK4 activation, which in turn limits total cell-vitronectin adhesion
   strength. Specifically, we show that PAK4 is activated by cell
   attachment to vitronectin as mediated by PAK4 binding partner integrin
   alpha v beta 5, and that active PAK4 induces accelerated integrin alpha
   v beta 5 turnover within adhesion complexes. Accelerated integrin
   turnover is associated with additional PAK4-mediated effects, including
   inhibited integrin alpha v beta 5 clustering, reduced integrin to
   F-actin connectivity and perturbed adhesion complex maturation. These
   specific outcomes are ultimately associated with reduced cell adhesion
   strength and increased cell motility. We thus demonstrate a novel
   mechanism deployed by cells to tune cell adhesion levels through the
   autoinhibitory regulation of integrin adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{We prepared gradated nano-transient layers at different interfaces
   between deposited film and substrates by high-intensity pulsed ion beam
   (HIPIB) irradiation. The deposited film was (Al-Si) alloy and substrates
   were Ni and Ti, respectively. The gradated nano-transient layers at
   different interfaces were measured by Rutherford backscattering, its
   spectra were solved by SIMNRA code and then the microstructures of the
   gradated nano-transient layers at the interfaces of these two irradiated
   samples were obtained. The experimental results were analyzed by STEIPIB
   code. The formation of the gradated distribution of element contents in
   nano-transient layer at the interface can eliminate the abrupt changes
   of thermal and elastic characteristics at the interface. And, it can
   greatly reduce the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients and
   Young's modulus at the interface between deposited film and substrate.
   Thus, after the formation of the gradated nano-transient layer, the
   adhesion at the interface between different materials can be enhanced
   and the level of thermal stresses can also be reduced in the case of
   thermal loading.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the factors affecting immigrant remittances on the
   basis of the experience of immigrants to Greece. In addition to factors
   commonly used in similar analyses, we examine two new ones: stability of
   employment and relative deprivation. Our results show that the stability
   of employment has no significant effect on the decision to remit, while
   relative deprivation does. Immigrants from less relatively deprived
   families are more likely to send money back home. As for their effects
   on the size of remittances, our results show that the relative
   deprivation variable is insignificant, while those in steady jobs remit
   less money than those employed in unsteady jobs. The latter finding
   suggests that fluctuations in migrant employment and migrant income are
   borne by migrants themselves, whose goal appears to be to secure a
   steady flow of remittances to country of origin. This type of remittance
   behaviour has implications for the interpretation of volatility in
   remittance flows to migrant-sending countries. Specifically, variation
   in flows may be attributable to changes in the numbers of migrants and
   not only to changes in the economic and employment conditions in
   destination countries.}},

Abstract = {{The latest class of neuroendovascular devices being evaluated is
   intended to treat cerebral aneurysms. In addition to inducing flow
   stasis-mediated thrombosis of aneurysms and thus at times being referred
   to as flow diverters, these devices reconstitute pathologic arterial
   segments to near-physiologic normalcy. The successful implementation of
   such an endoluminal scaffold for vascular reconstruction in the cerebral
   circulation requires careful consideration of various factors drawn from
   engineering, physics, and biological sciences. Here we review some of
   these factors. (Stroke. 2010;41{[}suppl 1]:S21-S25.)}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic motors (USM) have good prospects in various application
   fields, such as actuators in mobile-phone auto-focus (AF) modules due to
   their prominent characteristics. From the perspective use, we must
   understand the influence of the temperature on characteristics such as
   the resonant frequency of the USM. In our experiment, an octagonal
   nut-type USM was produced and optimized by using a finite-element method
   (FEM). The resonant frequency and the rotational speed of the USM were
   measured at temperatures between -20 degrees C and 50 degrees C. With
   decreasing temperature, the results show an increasing resonant
   frequency. However, the speed decreases with decreasing temperature due
   to an excursion of the resonant frequency. By using the feedback voltage
   from an isolated electrode from the piezoelectric ceramic bonded on the
   stator of the USM, we could self adjust the output frequency of the
   driver to stabilize the speed of the USM while changing the temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine aqueous vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in
   patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) before a single
   intravitreal bevacizumab injection.
   Methods: Twelve eyes with symptomatic CSC were included. Samples from
   patients with cataracts served as controls. The levels of VEGF and IL-8
   concentrations were measured in aqueous humor and plasma by multiplex
   bead assays.
   Results: All patients with CSC showed an improvement in visual acuity
   and resolved neurosensory detachment after intravitreal bevacizumab
   injection. The aqueous humor levels of VEGF and IL-8 were not
   significantly increased in patients with CSC compared with the healthy
   control group (18.2 +/- 24.8 vs. 35.3 +/- 28.5 pg/mL, P > 0.05; 2.3 +/-
   0.4 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.3 pg/mL, P. 0.05, respectively). The plasma levels of
   VEGF and IL-8 in patients with CSC were not different from those in the
   healthy control group.
   Conclusion: Vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-8 were not
   increased in the aqueous humor and plasma of patients with CSC. The
   effect of intravitreal bevacizumab injection as a treatment for CSC must
   be fully understood, and the true effect of anti-VEGF treatment in
   patients with CSC remains to be elucidated. RETINA 30: 1465-1471, 2010}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim: Very low carbohydrate ad libitum diets have been
   shown to enhance weight loss without increasing cardiometabolic risk
   factors but no kilojoule-controlled trials have been conducted relative
   to no intervention. The aim of this study was to compare the changes in
   weight and other cardiovascular risk factors in 3 isocaloric
   energy-restricted diets to no-intervention control after 1 year.
   Methods and results: One hundred and thirteen subjects (age 47 +/- 10
   years, BMI 32 +/- 6 kg/m(2) with one additional cardiovascular risk
   factor) were randomly allocated to one of three isocaloric diets
   (VLC-very low carbohydrate, 60\% fat, 4\% carbohydrate, n = 30; VLF-very
   low fat, 10\% fat, n = 30; HUF-high unsaturated fat, 30\% fat, n = 30)
   with intensive support for 3 months followed by minimal support for 12
   months compared to a control group (no intervention, n = 23). The
   estimated weight change was -3.0 +/- 0.2 kg for VLC, -2.0 +/- 0.1 kg for
   VLF, -3.7 +/- 0.01 kg for HUF and 0.8 +/- 0.5 kg for controls (P =
   0.065). After correcting for baseline values, decreases in body weight
   and diastolic blood pressure in the diet groups (-2.9 +/- 5.2) were
   significantly different to the increase in the control group (0.8 +/-
   5.0) (P < 0.05). No differences in cardiovascular risk factors were
   observed between the diet groups.
   Conclusion: Significant cardiometabolic risk factor reduction was
   observed equally with VLC, VLF and HUF diets after 15 months, compared
   to an exacerbation of risk factors in the control group. At a modest
   level of adherence, 3 months of intensive support on these dietary
   patterns confer an improvement in cardiometabolic profile compared to no
   dietary intervention after 15 months. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-The role of noninvasive methods in the evaluation
   of collateral circulation has yet to be defined. We hypothesized that a
   favorable pattern of leptomeningeal collaterals, as identified by CT
   angiography, correlates with improved outcomes.
   Methods-Data from a prospective cohort study at 2 university-based
   hospitals where CT angiography was systematically performed in the acute
   phase of ischemic stroke were analyzed. Patients with complete occlusion
   of the intracranial internal carotid artery and/or the middle cerebral
   artery (M1 or M2 segments) were selected. The leptomeningeal collateral
   pattern was graded as a 3-category ordinal variable (less, equal, or
   greater than the unaffected contralateral hemisphere). Univariate and
   multivariate analyses were performed to define the independent
   predictors of good outcome at 6 months (modified Rankin Scale score <=
   2).
   Results-One hundred ninety-six patients were selected. The mean age was
   69 +/- 17 years and the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
   score was 13 (interquartile range, 6 to 17). In the univariate analysis,
   age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, prestroke
   modified Rankin Scale score, Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT score,
   admission blood glucose, history of hypertension, coronary artery
   disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, site of
   occlusion, and collateral pattern were predictors of outcome. In the
   multivariate analysis, age (OR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 0.98; P=0.001),
   baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (OR, 0.75; 0.69 to
   0.83; P<0.001), prestroke modified Rankin Scale score (OR, 0.41; 0.22 to
   0.76; P=0.01), intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (OR,
   4.92; 1.83 to 13.25; P=0.01), diabetes (OR, 0.31; 0.01 to 0.98;
   P=0.046), and leptomeningeal collaterals (OR, 1.93; 1.06 to 3.34;
   P=0.03) were identified as independent predictors of good outcome.
   Conclusion-Consistent with angiographic studies, leptomeningeal
   collaterals on CT angiography are also a reliable marker of good outcome
   in ischemic stroke. (Stroke. 2010;41:2316-2322.)}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to investigate the effect of various reimmunization
   schemes for hepatitis B in adults with low or undetectable anti-HBs
   titers. Over 2 years, 10 mu g of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-recombinant
   hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (synthesized in China) was used in at
   least one standardized scheme to immunize 2,310 healthy male and
   nonpregnant female adults. Of these, 240 subjects tested negative for
   hepatitis B markers. These 240 subjects were equally divided into 4
   groups. The first group, designated Engerix-40, was revaccinated with 40
   mu g Engerix-B; the second, Engerix-20, was revaccinated with 20 mu g
   Engerix-B; the third, Chinese-20, was revaccinated with 20 mu g
   Chinese-made yeast-recombinant vaccine; and the last group, Chinese-10,
   was revaccinated with 10 mu g Chinese-made yeast-recombinant vaccine.
   Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, 8, and 12 months after the
   first injection. The anti-HBs-positive conversion rates of the
   Engerix-40, Engerix-20, and Chinese-20 groups were higher than that of
   the Chinese-10 group (P < 0.01). Over time, the anti-HBs conversion rate
   increased in all groups, but values were significantly different from
   those for the other groups only in the Chinese-10 group (P < 0.001). The
   anti-HBs geometric mean titers (GMTs) of the Engerix-40, Engerix-20, and
   Chinese-20 groups were higher than in the Chinese-10 group (P < 0.05).
   Increased doses raise and maintain anti-HBs titers in subjects with low
   or undetectable titers after HBV vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the adjusted daily total precipitation data at Canadian
   stations and the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of
   Precipitation (CMAP) data during the most recent 30 Northern Hemisphere
   winters, the connection between the tropical convection of the
   Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the intraseasonal variability of
   precipitation in Canada is investigated. The dominant convection
   patterns associated with the MJO are represented by the two leading
   modes of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis that is
   applied to the pentad outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) in the
   equatorial Indian Ocean and western Pacific. The first EOF mode is
   characterized by a single convection center near the Maritime Continent,
   whereas the second EOF has an east-west dipole structure with enhanced
   precipitation over the Indian Ocean and reduced convective activity over
   the tropical western Pacific. Lagged regression analysis reveals
   significant precipitation anomalies in Canada associated with the
   tropical convection of the MJO. Above-normal precipitation starts to
   occur in the west coast of Canada one pentad after a positive EOF2
   phase. In the next two pentads, positive precipitation anomalies extend
   to a large area of south Canada. At the same time, the northeast region
   experiences reduced precipitation. For strong MJO events when the
   principal component of EOF2 exceeds its standard deviation, the
   precipitation anomaly in the west coast of Canada can reach about
   20\%-30\% of its standard deviation of pentad-to-pentad variability. A
   linearized global primitive equation model is utilized to assess the
   cause of the intraseasonal variability in the Northern Hemisphere
   extratropics and its influence on North American weather associated with
   the tropical heating of the MJO.}},

   findings reveal that market orientation is significantly related to
   embedding operant resources and resource integration, and that resource
   orientation is significantly related to value co-creation, embedding
   operant resources and resource integration. The findings also confirm
   that value co-creation and the value constellations as the drivers of

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method for merging partial overlapping time series of
   ocean profiles into a single time series of profiles using empirical
   orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition with the objective analysis is
   presented. The method is used to handle internal waves passing two or
   more mooring locations from multiple directions, a situation where
   patterns of variability cannot be accounted for with a simple time lag.
   Data from one mooring are decomposed into linear combination of EOFs.
   Objective analysis using data from another mooring and these patterns is
   then used to build the necessary profile for merging the data, which is
   a linear combination of the EOFs. This method is applied to temperature
   data collected at a two vertical moorings in the 2006 New Jersey Shelf
   Shallow Water Experiment (SW06). Resulting profiles specify conditions
   for 35 days from sea surface to seafloor at a primary site and allow for
   reliable acoustic propagation modeling, mode decomposition, and

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation using molecular dynamics is increasingly used to
   simulate the folding equilibria of peptides and small proteins. Yet, the
   quality of the obtained results depends largely on the quality of the
   force field used. This comprises the solute as well as the solvent model
   and their energetic and entropic compatibility. It is, however,
   computational very expensive to perform test simulations for each
   combination of force-field parameters. Here, we use the one-step
   perturbation technique to predict the change of the free enthalpy of
   folding of a beta-peptide in methanol solution due to changing a variety
   of force-field parameters. The results show that changing the solute
   backbone partial charges affects the folding equilibrium, whereas this
   is relatively insensitive to changes in the force constants of the
   torsional energy terms of the force field. Extending the cut-off
   distance for nonbonded interactions beyond 1.4 nm does not affect the
   folding equilibrium. The same result is found for a change of the
   reaction-field permittivity for methanol from 17.7 to 30. The results
   are not sensitive to the criterion, e.g., atom-positional RMSD or number
   of hydrogen bonds, that is used to distinguish folded and unfolded
   conformations. Control simulations with perturbed Hamiltonians followed
   by backward one-step perturbation indicated that quite large
   perturbations still yield reliable results. Yet, perturbing all solvent
   molecules showed where the limitations of the one-step perturbation
   technique are met. The evaluated methodology constitutes an efficient
   tool in force-field development for molecular simulation by reducing the
   number of required separate simulations by orders of magnitude. (C) 2010

   Intrathecal morphine at 0.3 mu g/kg (LMPC), 3 mu g/kg (MMPC) or 30 mu
   g/kg (HMPC) was administered for 5 min before 120-min reperfusion
   following 30-min ischemia. Infarct size as a percentage of area at risk
   (IS/AAR) was determined using triphenyltetrazolium staining. MMPC was
   repeated following the intrathecal administration of nor BNI, NTD, CTOP,
   or naloxone methiodide (NM), kappa, delta, mu and non-specific opioid
   receptor antagonists, respectively. The role of peripheral opioid,
   adenosine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors was
   examined by the intravenous administration of NM, 8--sulfophenyl
   theophylline (8-SPT) and human CGRP fragment (CGRP(8-37)), respectively.
   Results
   Morphine post-conditioning at all three doses was cardioprotective
   (IS/AAR of LMPC=37 +/- 4\%, MMPC=35 +/- 5\%, HMPC=32 +/- 4\%, control=50
   +/- 5\%, P < 0.01). The prior administration of opioid receptor
   antagonists intrathecally, as well as intravenous 8-SPT and CGRP(8-37)
   receptor antagonists, abolished this effect (nor BNI+MMPC=47 +/- 7\%,
   NTD+MMPC=49 +/- 7\%, CTOP+MMPC=45 +/- 9\%, NM+MMPC=47 +/- 6\%
   8-SPT+MPC=46 +/- 5\% \& CGRP(8-37)+MPC=53 +/- 6\%, P=0.63). However, the
   intravenous administration of NM did not prevent the protective effect
   (34 +/- 4\%, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions
   Intrathecal morphine administration can induce pharmacological cardiac
   post-conditioning as it involves opioid receptor centrally but
   non-opioid receptors peripherally.}},

   absence has a great negative predictive value and environnemental factor
   with gluten consumption. There is also on increased incidence of

   Skin lesions are small vesicles and/or bullae, with pruritus, located at
   the extensor surface of the elbows, proximal forearms and the buttocks.
   Gastrointestinal manifestations are rare.
   The biopsies from uninvolved skin establish the diagnostic with a
   deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae for direct immunofluorescence
   and in a representative lesion classically neutrophil micro-abcesses
   within the papillary dermis.
   The differential diagnosis is clinical with other causes of pruritus and

   The discretizations of this operator is derived for the case of a full

   use scalar mu. We prove that the new tensor viscosity preserves spatial

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe how parents consider disease
   and test characteristics when making decisions about newborn screening.
   METHODS: We conducted focus groups with parents from primary care
   clinics and interviews of parents from a genetics clinic (total of 45
   participants). Participants discussed 7 vignettes about newborn
   screening that we developed and refined with the assistance of an expert
   panel. Two coders coded the data independently, compared coding, and
   resolved disagreements through discussion. Using framework analysis, we
   analyzed the data and identified how parents' preferences varied
   according to disease characteristics, test characteristics, and
   perceptions of the associated risks and benefits.
   RESULTS: Study participants strongly supported population-wide screening
   for disorders with well-defined, effective treatments, even if the
   treatment (eg, a bone marrow transplant) had significant morbidity.
   However, particularly among primary care clinic participants, there were
   more-varied preferences and greater difficulty making decisions about
   disorders associated with older age at onset, less-accurate screening
   tests, or less-effective treatment. In those cases, many participants
   suggested optional screening. For all disorders, participants expressed
   a desire for more information to facilitate decision-making.
   CONCLUSIONS: Participants supported newborn screening for treatable
   disorders but suggested optional screening for other disorders. The
   variable influences on parents' decision-making suggest that parents
   with diverse experiences, if they were included in decision-making
   regarding screening policies, could provide critical perspectives and
   help screening programs address parents' preferences and meet parents'
   information needs. Pediatrics 2010;126:696-704}},

Abstract = {{It is an effective approach to adopt software agent in pervasive
   computing (Per-Com) environment. Meanwhile, task execution is the key
   problem which is affected directly by task representation method in
   Per-Com environment. The task of agent in Per-Com environment is dynamic
   and changeful, so the task representation should be flexible and
   agent-oriented. However, most of the existing task representation
   methods cannot present task relationship clearly and lack unified
   format, which leads to a drawback that the corresponding task processing
   efficiency is not satisfying. In this paper, firstly, an agent-based
   Per-Com architecture is presented in which the agent is endowed with
   certain role. Secondly, through analyzing task relationship, an agent
   role based task relationship tree (TRT) model and an XML-based agent
   task representation method are proposed. Thirdly, based on TRT, an agent
   task decomposing and online multi-agent scheduling algorithm are
   presented to solve time-optimal problems. Meanwhile, a load balancing
   strategy based on probability is proposed to increase agent utilization.
   Finally, a prototype of an application on traffic monitoring is
   presented. The results of evaluation indicate that the architecture is
   feasible and the simulation tests of time performance indicate that the
   proposed TRT-based task processing methods have a better performance
   than others. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the dramatic progress in the computer processing power,
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology can be applied in
   investigating the detailed knowledge of thermal hydraulic
   characteristics in the rod bundle, especially with the spacer grid.
   These localized information, including flow, turbulence, and heat
   transfer characteristics, etc., can assist in the design and the
   improvement of rod bundles for nuclear power plants. In this paper, a
   three-dimensional (3D) CFD model with the Reynolds stresses turbulence
   model is proposed to simulate these characteristics within the rod
   bundle and subsequently to investigate the effects of different types of
   grid on the turbulent mixing and heat transfer enhancement. Two types of
   grid designs are used herein, including the standard grid and split-vane
   pair one, respectively. Based on the CFD simulations, the secondary flow
   can be reasonably captured in the rod bundle with the grid. The
   split-vane pair grid would enhance both the flow mixing and the heat
   transfer capability more than the standard grid does, as clearly shown
   in the simulation results. In addition, compared with the results of
   experiment and correlation, the present predicted result for the Nusselt
   (Nu) number distribution downstream the grid shows reasonable agreement
   for the standard grid design. However, there is discrepancy in the decay
   trend of Nu number between the prediction and measurement for the
   split-vane pair gird. This would be improved by adopting the finer mesh
   (y(+) < 1) simulation and Low-Reynolds form turbulence model, which is
   our future research work. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the in vitro degradation of yarns made from PCL

   that the electrospun PCL yarns degraded slowly with a weight loss less
   than 3 \% in 12 weeks. The addition of various concentrations of
   ampicillin salt increased the degradation rate slightly. The
   morphological changes observed in fiber microstructure suggested that
   the degradation underwent bulk erosion and the degradation began with
   the amorphous regions. Revealed by the fiber morphological changes with
   degradation, the microstructure of electrospun PCL fibers followed the
   fringed fibril fiber model. The fiber arrangement in the yarn was

Abstract = {{The oxidation reaction mechanism of NO by O(2) over Na-ZSM-5 molecular
   sieves with a high SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio was studied at ambient
   temperature by temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) and in
   situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (DRIFTS). The results show that the NO catalytic oxidation process is
   accompanied by a significant adsorption of NO(2) and it exhibits a
   dynamic equilibrium between NO(2) adsorption and the reaction of NO.
   TPSR and in situ DRIFTS characterization of the adsorbed NO species
   revealed that adsorbed NO(3) formed on the surface of the Na-ZSM-5
   molecular sieve as a result of the reaction between adsorbed NO and
   gaseous O(2). The oxidation of NO(3) with NO produced weakly-adsorbing
   NO(2) and N(2)O(4) which were released once the adsorption reached
   saturation. Therefore, the strongly-adsorbing NO(3) was an intermediate
   of the NO oxidation reaction and its presence promoted NO adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and
   symptoms of acute stress disorder (ASD) in the paediatric surgical
   children and adolescents injured during the Wenchuan earthquake in
   China. One hundred eighteen children and adolescent inpatients were
   surveyed by the ASD scale (ASDS) within 1 month of the earthquake. Using
   the validated ASDS score above cut-off threshold levels, the incidence
   of ASD in this sample was 54.3 per cent. The morbidity of ASD were 56.1,
   24.6 and 19.3 per cent in the child, in the early adolescent and in the
   middle adolescent, respectively. There was no significant difference
   among the three age groups about the severity of ASD symptom. The
   proportions of ASD positive were 44.0 per cent in boys and 63.6 per cent
   in girls that showed significant difference. The exposure risk factors
   were being buried in the earthquake, injury of parent, injury of
   relatives, amputation and operation. These results indicated that ASD
   was widely prevalent among the children and adolescents wounded in the
   earthquake, which needed an effective psychosocial intervention.

Abstract = {{We develop an analytic model to describe the dynamic average thermal

   refractive index constitutes the major contribution of the thermal
   lensing for Nd:YAG rod lasers. Temperature-and stress-dependent
   variation of the refractive index constitute the major contributions of
   the thermal lensing for Nd:glass rod lasers. In the case of the same

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used in fuel cell
   impedance analysis. However, for ohmic resistance (R-Omega), EIS has
   some disadvantages such as long test period and complex data analysis
   with equivalent circuits. Therefore, the current interruption method is
   explored to measure the value of R-Omega in direct methanol fuel cells
   (DMFC) at different temperatures and current densities. It is found that
   R-Omega decreases as temperature increase, and decreases initially and
   then increases as current density increases. These results are
   consistent with those measured by the EIS technique. In most cases, the
   ohmic resistances with current interruption (R-iR) are larger than those
   with EIS (R-EIS), but the difference is small, in the range from
   -0.848\% to 5.337\%. The errors of RiR at high current densities are
   less than those of R-EIS. Our results show that the R-iR data are
   reliable and easy to obtain in the measurement of ohmic resistance in

   adolescents. Furthermore, singletons received higher levels of parental
   responsiveness, which was inversely related to psychological distress
   and delinquent participation, respectively. The difference in
   psychological distress between singletons and non-singletons was
   completely mediated by both maternal and paternal responsiveness.
   Paternal responsiveness alone fully mediated the difference in

Abstract = {{A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a bioelectrochemical system that
   can produce hydrogen from acetate at high hydrogen recoveries, but the
   composition and structure of the microbial communities in this system
   have not been extensively studied. We used a high throughput
   metagenomics technology (GeoChip) to examine the microbial community
   functional structure in MECs initially operated under different
   conditions. We found that startup conditions had little or no effect on
   reactor performance in terms of Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) and COD
   removals, somewhat greater effects on CO2 and CH4 production, and very
   large effects on hydrogen production. Hydrogen yields were generally
   higher for reactors that were always operated as MECs than those
   initially operated as MFCs. Hydrogen yields were nine times larger for
   MEC reactors with an applied voltage of 0.7 V (64\%similar to 80\%
   efficiencies) than 0.3V( <7-8\%), independent of startup conditions.
   GeoChip analysis revealed that the functional and phylogenetic diversity
   of MEC microbial communities after 4 months was quite high despite the
   use of only a single substrate (acetate). MECs with the largest hydrogen
   yields had the highest microbial diversity. Multivariate analyses showed
   that communities that developed in the MECs were well separated from
   those present under startup conditions, indicating reactor operation
   altered microbial community composition. Community shifts based on a
   Mantel test were significantly related to CEs and COD removals in these

Abstract = {{The electronic structures and elastic properties of Al doped MoSi2 were
   calculated using the plane wave pseudo-potential method based on the
   density functional theory, in which the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange-correlation
   potential Starting from the elastic constants bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, elastic modulus and Poisson ratio of Al-doped MoSi2 were
   obtained by using the Hill method The results indicate that conductivity
   of Al-doped MoSi2 is improved to some extent in comparison with that of
   pure MoSi2 due to the orbit hybridization of Mo 4d Al 3p and Si 3p
   electrons In addition, calculations show that the elastic modulus and
   the brittleness of Al doped MoSi2 are smaller than those of pure MoSi2,
   which implies that It is feasible to toughen MoSi2 by doping Al The
   agreement of the conclusion with experiment shows that the present
   theory is reasonable}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies in the fruitfly. Drosophila melanogaster, have uncovered
   a conserved insulin/insulin growth factor signaling (IN pathway that
   regulates nutrition-dependent growth rates of insects. From the
   silkworm, Bombyx mori, we have identified and characterized several key
   genes involved in the IIS pathway, including InR, IRS, PI3K110, PI3K60,
   PTEN, PDK, and Akt Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of
   these genes were highly expressed in the fat body implying that the IIS
   pathway is functionally important within insect adipose tissue.
   Developmental profile studies revealed that the expression levels of
   InR, IRS, PI3K110, and PDK were elevated in the fat body during molting
   and pupation, periods when animals ceased feeding and hemolymph levels
   of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) were high Starvation rapidly up-regulated
   the mRNA levels of these same genes in the fat body, while 20E slowly
   induced their transcription. We conclude that 20E slowly reduces food
   consumption and then indirectly induces a state of starvation resulting
   in the elevation of the mRNA levels of InR, IRS, P13K110, and PDK in the
   Bombyx fat body during molting and pupation (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All

Abstract = {{Bhut Jolokia, the hottest pepper in the world, Scotch Bonnet and
   Jalapeno are hot Capsicum spp. with 1001,304, 250,000-300,000 and 5000
   Scoville Heat Units (SHUs), respectively. The SHU is also an indication
   of varying concentrations of lipid-soluble capsaicinoids present in
   these hot peppers. However, our studies using lipid peroxidation (LPO)
   and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2) enzyme assay with the water extracts
   of these peppers showed similarity in inhibitory activities. Also,
   chromatographic analyses of water extracts of these hot peppers showed
   identical profiles except for the capsaicinoids. This prompted us to
   investigate the water-soluble compounds in these pepper extracts with
   LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. A bioassay-guided
   investigation of the water extract of Scotch Bonnet pepper afforded
   compounds 1-6, also common in Jalapeno and Bhut Jolokia water extracts.
   Compounds 1-6 inhibited LPO by 73\%, 45\%, 20\%, 43\%, 16\% and 72\%,
   respectively, and COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 14-72\% and 30-31\%. Most of
   these compounds showed higher COX-1 inhibitory activity similar to
   aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. However, compound 5 showed higher COX-2
   enzyme inhibition similar to Celebrex, a prescription non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug. Compound 1 is novel; 2, 3, 5 and 6 were
   isolated from genus Capsicum for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In order to simulate biological wastewater treatment processes, data
   concerning wastewater and sludge composition, process kinetics and
   stoichiometry are required. Selection of the most sensitive parameters
   is an important step of model calibration. The aim of this work is to
   verify the predictability of the activated sludge model, which is
   implemented in BioWin software, and select its most influential kinetic
   and stoichiometric parameters with the help of sensitivity analysis
   approach. Two different measures of sensitivity are applied: the
   normalised sensitivity coefficient (S(ij)) and the mean square
   sensitivity measure (delta(msqt)(j)). It occurs that 17 kinetic and
   stoichiometric parameters of the BioWin activated sludge (AS) model can
   be regarded as influential on the basis of S(ij) calculations. Half of
   the influential parameters are associated with growth and decay of
   phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs). The identification of the set
   of the most sensitive parameters should support the users of this model
   and initiate the elaboration of determination procedures for the
   parameters, for which it has not been done yet. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   repeated after perturbing individual aerosol optical properties (aerosol
   optical depth, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, scale
   height, and anthropogenic fraction) from their base values, keeping all
   other parameters fixed. The total DARF uncertainty from all aerosol
   parameters combined is 0.5-1.0 W m(-2), a factor of 2-4 greater than the
   value cited in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC's)
   Fourth Assessment Report. Most of the total DARF uncertainty in this
   analysis is associated with single-scattering albedo uncertainty. Owing
   to the greater sensitivity to single-scattering albedo in cloudy
   columns, DARF uncertainty in all-sky conditions is greater than in
   clear- sky conditions, even though the global mean clear- sky DARF is
   more than twice as large as the all-sky DARF.}},

   multifocally exhibited strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Factor
   VIII-related protein (von Willebrand's factor).

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) were used in this
   work for the structural characterisation of lycopene, the antioxidant
   carotenoid, and its complexes with two synthetic thermotropic
   cholesteric polyesters. Both polyesters were employed successfully to
   encapsulate the carotenoid lycopene (Lyc). Besides protecting it from
   oxidation, they induced the trans-cis isomerisation of lycopene towards
   the more biologically active and bioavailable isomer cis-Lyc. The Raman
   spectra revealed changes mainly concerning the band nu(1) and bands of
   methyl groups. This would explain the interaction mechanism between
   lycopene and cholesteric polyesters, inducing structural changes in the
   carotenoid by formation of a cis C=C bond in central positions of the
   isomer chain and hydrophobic interaction that affects the side methyl
   groups. DFT calculations confirmed that the isomerisation occurs at
   central positions of lycopene molecule. The analysis of nu(1) and nu(2)
   bands and those of methyl groups in the calculated spectra of lycopene
   indicates that the interaction with the synthetic cholesteric polyesters
   could mainly lead to the 13-cis-Lyc isomer. The analysis of marker
   structural bands of the polyesters revealed structural changes in the
   host which mainly affect the ester groups, most probably due to a
   restructuring of the polyester chain to better accommodate the ligand.

Abstract = {{Bathymodiolinae mussels have been used as a biological model to better
   understand the evolutionary origin of faunas associated with deep-sea
   hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Most studies to date, however, have
   sampled with a strong bias towards vent and seep species, mainly because
   of a lack of knowledge of closely related species from organic falls.
   Here we reassess the species diversity of deep-sea mussels using two
   genes and a large taxon sample from the South-Western Pacific. This new
   taxonomic framework serves as a basis for a phylogenetic investigation
   of their evolutionary history. We first highlight an unexpected
   allopatric pattern and suggest that mussels usually reported from
   organic falls are in fact poorly specialized with regard to their
   environment. This challenges the adaptive scenarios proposed to explain
   the diversification of the group. Second, we confirm that deep-sea
   mussels arose from organic falls and then colonized hydrothermal vents
   and cold seeps in multiple events. Overall, this study constitutes a new
   basis for further phylogenetic investigations and a global systematic
   revision of deep-sea mussels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Two soluble forms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   receptors, sVEGFR-1 and sVEGFR-2, are physiologically released and
   overproduced in some pathologies. They are known to act as anti-VEGF
   agents. Here we report that these soluble receptors contribute to vessel
   maturation by mediating a dialogue between endothelial cells (ECs) and
   mural cells that leads to blood vessel stabilization. Through a
   multidisciplinary approach, we provide evidence that these soluble VEGF
   receptors promote mural cell migration through a paracrine mechanism
   involving interplay in ECs between VEGF/VEGFR-2 and
   sphingosine1-phosphate type-1 (S1P)/S1P1 pathways that leads to
   endothelial nitric oxyde synthase (eNOS) activation. This new paradigm
   is supported by the finding that sVEGFR-1 and -2 perform the following
   actions: 1) induce an eNOS-dependent outgrowth of a mural cell network
   in an ex vivo model of angiogenesis, 2) increase the mural cell coverage
   of neovessels in vitro and in vivo, 3) promote mural cell migration
   toward ECs, and 4) stimulate endothelial S1P1 overproduction and eNOS
   activation that promote the migration and the recruitment of neighboring
   mural cells. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms
   regulating physiological and pathological angiogenesis and vessel
   stabilization.-Lorquet, S., Berndt, S., Blacher, S., Gengoux, E.,

Abstract = {{We developed an ion accelerator with a double accelerating gap system

   fields. After the first gap action, the ions were again accelerated by a
   second gap. The total acceleration can imprint a maximum ion energy up
   to 160 keV per charge state. We analysed the extracted charge from a Cu
   target as a function of the accelerating voltage at laser energy of 9,
   11 and 17 mJ deposited on a spot of 0.005 cm(2). The peak of current
   density was 3.9 and 5.3 mA for the lower and medium laser energy at 60
   kV. At the highest laser energy, the maximum output current was 11.7 mA
   with an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. The maximum ion dose was
   estimated to be 10(12) ions/cm(2). Under the condition of 60 kV
   accelerating voltage and 5.3 mA output current the normalized emittance

   (DCTB) has been considered as an excellent matrix for matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of many types of synthetic
   compounds. However, it might provide troublesome results for compounds
   containing aliphatic primary or secondary amino groups. For these
   compounds, strong extra ion peaks with a mass difference of 184.1 Da
   were usually observed, which might falsely indicate the presence of some
   unknown impurities that were not detected by other matrices. On the
   basis of the possible mechanisms proposed, these extra ions are the
   products of nucleophilic reactions between analyte amino groups and DCTB
   molecules or radical cations. In these reactions, an amino group
   replaces the dicyanomethylene group of DCTB forming a matrix adduct via
   a -C=N-bond. An aliphatic primary amine could react easily with DCTB and
   the reaction could start once they are mixed in a MALDI solution. For an
   aliphatic secondary amine, on the other hand, the reaction most likely
   occurs in the gas phase. Protonation of amino groups by adding acid
   seems to be a useful way to stop DCTB adduction for compounds with one
   single amino group, but not for compounds with multiple amino groups.
   Unlike aliphatic primary or secondary amines, aliphatic tertiary amines
   and aromatic amines do not yield DCTB adducts. This is because tertiary
   amines do not have the required transferrable H-(N) atom to form an
   extra -C=N-bond, while aromatic amines are not sufficiently nucleophilic
   to attack DCTB. In view of the possible matrix adduction, care should be
   taken in MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) when DCTB is
   used as the matrix for compounds containing amino group(s). Copyright

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{5654-5666}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Externally imposed fields can directly affect microstructural evolution
   arising from diffusional phase separation in binary mixtures and
   potentially can be utilized to form highly ordered nanostructures. The
   effects of elastic fields on phase separation and coarsening are
   investigated in this paper using a Cahn-Hilliard-type phase-field model.
   Periodic traction distributions are shown to lead to patterned
   microstructures. The kinetics and morphology of aggregation are found to
   depend significantly on the transformation strain, contrast in moduli
   between phases and the magnitude of externally applied tractions
   (mechanical fields). The trends observed in simulations are analyzed in
   detail in terms of Eshelby-type estimates for elastic interaction
   energies, and the correlations are shown to be remarkably accurate.
   Predictions based solely upon interaction energies can provide very
   useful guidelines to develop strategies to control the morphology of
   aggregation. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) offers a treatment option for
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients that are not eligible for
   surgery, embolization, chemotherapy, or radiofrequency ablation. We have
   evaluated the feasibility, tolerance and toxicity of SRT for 25 HCC
   patients who were not eligible for these other modalities. The patients
   (6 women and 19 men) were treated with CyberKnife stereotactic
   radiotherapy using respiratory motion tracking. All patients had liver
   cirrhosis with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
   score of less than 2 and pre-treatment Child scores ranging from A5 to
   B9. A total dose of 45 Gy in three fractions of 15 Gy each was
   prescribed to the 80\% isodose line (95\% of the PTV received 45 Gy) and
   delivered to the target volume over 10 to 12 days. Overall the treatment
   was well tolerated with two Grade 3 acute toxicities and no acute Grade
   4 toxicities. Late toxicity was minimal with all observed late
   toxicities occurring within the first six months of follow-up. Three
   hepatic recurrences at a distance from the target and one metastasis
   were observed. The actuarial 1- and 2-year local control rate was 95\%
   (95\% CI: 69-95\%). At a median overall follow-up of 12,7 months (range,
   1-24 months), six of the twenty-five (24\%) patients have died. Overall
   actuarial survival at 1- and 2-years was 79\% (95\% CI: 52-92\%) and
   52\% (95\% CI: 19-78\%), respectively. Our results suggest promising
   therapeutic efficacy and good clinical tolerance to CyberKnife SRT
   treatment for HCC patients not eligible for other treatment modalities.}},

Title = {{Expression of Maspin and Glutathionine-S-Transferase-pi in Normal Human
   Prostate and Prostatic Carcinomas}},

Abstract = {{Background: Maspin and glutathionine-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) are both
   involved in tumor suppression activity. Maspin expression functions as
   an inhibitor of tumor progression preventing the local invasion and
   metastatic spread of prostate cancer cells. GST-pi has an essential role
   in the inactivation of xenobiotic agents and protection from oxidative
   stress and in resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, a recent
   experimental evidence indicated that maspin and GST-pi may directly
   interact in the protection of the prostatic cells from oxydative damage.
   Design: Maspin and GST-pi expression were assessed in needle core and
   transurethral resection prostatic biopsies from 42 patients (34 with
   carcinoma, and 8 with normal prostate gland) using immunohistochemical
   methods.
   Results: Maspin and GST-pi were strongly and consistently coexpressed in
   the cytoplasm of basal cells of normal prostatic glands, whereas normal
   luminal cells were inconsistently weakly positive. Prostatic
   adenocarcinomas overexpressed maspin in 27/34 cases (79\%). In the
   majority of the cases, the subcellular distribution showed a
   predominance of nuclear expression. In contrast, only 1 case of
   prostatic carcinoma expressed GST-pi.
   Conclusion: Consistent coexpression of maspin and GST-pi was observed in
   basal cells of the prostatic glands, which could be used as an
   additional immunohistochemical test in the evaluation of prostatic
   malignancy. Prostatic adenocarcinomas express maspin in an aberrant
   nuclear distribution without coexpresion of GST-pi. These results
   indicate a deregulation of expression of maspin and GST-pi in prostatic
   adenocarcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{We examined properties of the innate immune response against the
   tumor-specific antigen simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (Tag)
   following experimental pulmonary metastasis in naive mice. Approximately
   14 days after mKSA tumor cell challenge, expression of inflammatory
   mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-2
   (IL-2), and RANTES was upregulated in splenocytes harvested from mice,
   as assessed by flow cytometry and antibody array assays. This response
   was hypothesized to activate and induce tumor-directed NK cell lysis
   since IL-2-stimulated NK cells mediated tumor cell destruction in vitro.
   The necessary function of NK cells was further validated in vivo through
   selected antibody depletion of NK cells, which resulted in an
   overwhelming lung tumor burden relative to that in animals receiving a
   control rabbit IgG depletion regimen. Interestingly, mice achieved
   increased protection from experimental pulmonary metastasis when NK
   cells were further activated indirectly through in vivo administration
   of poly(I:C), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist. In a separate
   study, mice receiving treatments of poly(I:C) and recombinant SV40 Tag
   protein immunization mounted effective tumor immunity in an established
   experimental pulmonary metastasis setting. Initiating broad-based
   immunity with poly(I:C) was observed to induce a Th1 bias in the SV40
   Tag antibody response that led to successful antitumor responses not
   observed in animals treated only with poly(I:C) or SV40 Tag. These data
   have direct implications for immunotherapeutic strategies incorporating
   methods to elicit inflammatory reactions, particularly NK cell-driven
   lysis, against malignant cell types that express a tumor-specific
   antigen such as SV40 Tag.}},

Abstract = {{A compact high-speed low-power rail-to-rail buffer amplifier, which is
   suitable for driving heavy capacitive loads, is proposed. The buffer
   amplifier is composed of a pair of push-pull output transistors with two
   feedback loops consisting of a pair of complementary error amplifiers
   and a pair of complementary common-source amplifiers. The buffer draws
   little current while static but has a large driving capability while
   transient. A mutual bias scheme is also proposed to reduce the power
   consumption and the die area for LCD applications. An experimental
   prototype buffer amplifier implemented in a 0.35 mu m CMOS technology
   demonstrates that the settling time is 1.5 mu s for a voltage swing of
   0.1 similar to (VDD-0.1) V under a 600 pF capacitance load. Quiescent
   current of 4 mu A is measured. The area of this buffer is 32 x 109 mu

Abstract = {{High spatial resolution images have been increasingly used for urban
   land-use/land-cover classification, but the high spectral variation
   within the same land-cover, the spectral confusion among different
   land-covers, and the shadow problem often lead to poor classification
   performance based on the traditional per-pixel spectral-based
   classification methods. This paper explores approaches to improve urban
   land-cover classification with Quick Bird imagery. Traditional per-pixel
   spectral-based supervised classification, incorporation of textural
   images and multispectral images, spectral-spatial classifier, and
   segmentation-based classification are examined in a relatively new
   developing urban landscape, Lucas do Rio Verde in Mato Grosso State,
   Brazil. This research shows that use of spatial information during the
   image classification procedure, either through the integrated use of
   textural and spectral images or through the use of segmentation-based
   classification method, can significantly improve land-cover
   classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Ba0.5Sr0.5Ta2O6 (BSTA) thin film was successfully fabricated on a
   Pt/SiO2/TiO2/Si substrate using the Sol-Gel method. Fundamental
   electrical properties of the BSTA thin film were investigated using
   metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. No diffusion of ions, from the
   thin film or the substrate, is observed because of the using of MIM
   structure. The Root Mean Square roughness of 1.04 nm shows that thin
   film grew well on the substrate. The BSTA thin film shows a much higher
   dielectric constant of about 130 than conventional gate insulators and
   high-k materials that are currently used in Thin Film Transistors. Low
   leakage current density of about 10(-8) A/cm(2) was obtained at an
   applied electric field of 500 kV/cm. Schottky emission is the dominant
   conduction mechanism at applied electric fields lower than 500 kV/cm and
   Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is the dominant conduction mechanism at higher
   applied electric fields. The Schottky barrier height between the Pt
   electrode and the Ba0.5Sr0.5Ta2O6 thin film was estimated to be 0.75 eV.}},

Abstract = {{Most polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems employ pre-determined
   settings and proprietary master mixes that differ from one system to
   another. It is not known whether these differences may affect gene
   expression values. We compared two major real-time PCR technologies,
   from Life Technologies (formerly Applied Biosystems; ABI7500) and Roche
   Applied Science (LC480), using their default settings, proprietary
   reagents and other potential variables such as ramp rates and magnesium
   concentrations. We analyzed four genes (IL-8, COX2, ID-1 and CXCR2) in a
   human breast cancer cell line and found that two of them, though readily
   detected by ABI, were not detected using the Roche system. By altering
   some of the parameters and reagents used in the Roche protocol, we were
   able to detect expression of these two genes, but the level remained far
   below that detected by ABI, particularly for ID-1. When we tested three
   additional ID-1 primer pairs, two of these primer pairs yielded higher
   expression values in the LC system, yet still significantly lower than
   the values obtained in ABI. These results suggest critical differences
   in these two PCR systems, which could result in significant
   discrepancies in results reported by different laboratories. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{The infrared absorption and 514.5 nm excited Raman spectra were measured
   for the metallo-tetra-(tert-butyl)-tetraazaporphyrin (MT(tBu)TAP, M=Cu,
   Co, Ni, Zn). The ground-state structures and vibrational spectra of
   MT(tBu)TAPs have been calculated at the B3LYP level of theory. The
   observed Raman and IR bands have been assigned based on the calculation
   results and by comparing with the normal metalloporphyrins. The
   relationship between the Raman/IR frequencies and the structures of TAP
   ring was investigated. The results show that the frequencies of C beta C
   beta' stretch (A(g)), asymmetric C alpha Nm stretch (A(g)), and
   symmetric C alpha Nm stretch (B-g) modes increase linearly with the
   decrease of the core-sizes of TAP ring. Among the three modes, the later
   two are more sensitive to the core-size change.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
   mass spectrometry method has been developed for the residue analysis of
   chloramphenicol (CAP) in several food matrices. Following the addition
   of D(5)-CAP as internal standard, egg, honey, and milk were extracted
   and cleaned by means of solid-phase extraction, utilizing multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes as sorbent. The extracts were separated on a Halo
   fused-core C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 2.7 mu m) and quantified by a
   4000 Q-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray (TM)
   interface using electrospray ionization and multiple-reaction monitoring
   mode. The method validation was performed according to the criteria of
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limit (CC alpha) and
   detection capability (CC beta) of CAP in milk were calculated for m/z
   320.8 > 151.9. Due to the existence of slight signal suppression,
   quantification was performed by matrix-matched calibration curves,
   ranging from 0.1 to 100 ng mL(-1), with regression coefficients of
   0.9993, 0.9998, and 0.9997 for egg, honey, and milk, respectively. Mean
   recoveries of the CAP ranged from 95.8\% to 102.3\%, with the
   corresponding intra- and inter-day variation (relative standard
   deviation) less than 7.13\% and 8.89\%, respectively. The limit of
   detection and limit of quantification of the method were also reported.
   This method successfully applied to several food matrixes (egg, honey,
   and milk) and can serve as a monitoring tool to avoid unacceptable
   levels of residues of CAP entering the food chain.}},

Abstract = {{Using a previously developed system-bath model Hamiltonian for the
   vibrational relaxation of H atoms adsorbed on a Si(100) surface
   (Andrianov and Saalfrank in J Chem Phys 124:034710, 2006), temperature
   effects on the relaxation of excited adsorbate vibrations are studied
   non-perturbatively. In particular, the Si-Si-H bending mode, for which
   relaxation times in the order of picoseconds have been predicted
   theoretically, is considered. Also, the excitation by infrared laser
   pulses is explicitly modelled. To do so, a combined system-bath
   Schrodinger equation is considered, in which an anharmonic system
   describing the vibrating H atom is coupled non-linearly to a set of
   harmonic oscillators which represent the phonon bath of the solid. For
   the time evolution, the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree
   (MCTDH) method is used together with a stochastic approach to sample
   thermal initial conditions. In contrast to perturbative approaches
   (Golden Rule), it is found that the bending mode relaxes the slower, the
   hotter the surface is. Possible reasons for this ``puzzle{''}, which
   also seems at variance with measurements for H:Si(100), are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With the objective to evaluate the reproductive stage in green iguana
   (Iguana iguana) females maintained in captivity in Oaxaca, Mexico, a
   total of 137 females were used during six years. Iguanas were fed with
   concentrate, frijolillo plants (Desmodium informal) and tulip flower
   (Tulipa gesneriana). The females were identified and housed in cages of
   30 m(2) and were observed. Reproductive activities such as proestrus,
   estrus and pregnancy were daily recorded. In the stage of hatching,
   variables were measured in eggs that were incubated in styrofoam boxes
   with relative humidity of 65 to 85\% and temperature between 28 to 34
   degrees C, and the newborn were measured after hatching. Results were
   analyzed with descriptive statistics and canonical correlation analysis
   using the Statistical Analysis System. At the beginning of the
   reproductive season the females weighed 975.9 +/- 405 g and measured
   27.9 +/- 3.4 cm snout-vent length, with a relative clutch mass of 36.3
   +/- 7.1\%, clutch size of 23.5 eggs, hatching success of 64.8\%, and
   newborn weight of 12.5 +/- 2.3g. The periods of proestrus, estrus, and
   pregnancy were 85, 36.2 y 59.7 days, respectively. The females weight at
   the beginning of the reproductive stage, snout-vent length and total
   were correlated (canonical correlation r = 0.69, r = 0.64 and r = 0.64,
   respectively) with the number and weight of newborn, indicating the
   importance of female management before the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{NATO Network Enabled Capability is first and foremost about achieving

   Consequently, the NATO information infrastructure will consist of a

   communication systems, as well as a mix of new and legacy systems. NATO
   recommends a service-oriented architecture approach based on Web
   services to enable such a federation. In this article we explain how the
   communication protocols normally used in Web services are unsuited for
   disadvantaged and heterogeneous networks. We then present our prototype
   proxy, which enables the use of standard unmodified Web services across
   all network types, including tactical networks with low data rates and
   frequent disruptions. It is designed to work with existing security

Title = {{Imaging foci of epileptic discharges from simultaneous EEG and fMRI

Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{133-142}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (EEG fMRI) is considered as a powerful and
   non-invasive method that allows definition of the irritative zone.
   However, the complex interictal epileptic discharge (IED) may be present
   in some patients, and sometimes no active foci can be localized using
   General Linear Model (GLM) which is a widely adopted tool in EEG fMRI
   study. The purpose of this study is to develop a new scheme to improve
   the detectability and localize the canonical HRF localizable foci.
   Method: Various IEDs are classified using a combination of an
   independent component analysis (ICA) and a temporal correlation analysis
   between the independent components and the raw EEG channel; and the
   classified IEDs are then separately used for foci localization. This
   scheme is tested by ten patients with variable IEDs, including two
   patients whose activity could not be identified by common method.
   Result: Applying this scheme to the two patients, some foci consistent
   with electroclinical data were localized. When it was applied to the
   remaining eight patients with positive results using common method, 2-4
   types of IEDs were classified, and the activity could be identified from
   at least one type of IED. The results were similar to that received from
   common method.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the proposed scheme could
   enhance the imaging of the localizable foci by isolating its IEDs. This
   scheme is potentially a useful tool for epilepsy clinic. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The volumetric change of expansive clays in pavement subgrade produces
   serious pavement distresses. Dry-land longitudinal cracking is one of
   the most prevalent pavement distresses due to expansive subgrade.
   However, the mechanism of the dry-land crack development has not been
   addressed in depth, and the propagation process of dry-land cracks has
   not yet been clarified. This paper investigates the mechanism of
   longitudinal crack developing at the pavement surface caused by
   expansive soils. The non-uniform matric suction change in the subgrade
   is simulated by a thermal expansion model in a finite element program,
   ABAQUS, to determine the shrinkage stresses in the subgrade soil and
   pavement structure. Numerical solution by the finite element program
   shows that the most likely location of shrinkage crack initiation in the
   subgrade is close to the pavement shoulder and close to the interface of
   the base and subgrade. Linear elastic fracture mechanics theory is used
   to analyze the crack propagation in the pavement. Compared to the
   fracture toughness of the pavement materials, the stress concentration
   at the initial shrinkage crack tip is large enough to drive the crack to
   propagate further. When the shrinkage crack propagates through the whole
   pavement structure, a longitudinal crack develops at the pavement
   surface close to the pavement shoulder.}},

Abstract = {{Stable and narrow distribution polyion complex micelles (PICMs) were
   prepared in an aqueous milieu through electrostatic interaction between
   a pair of oppositely charged block copolymers
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-block-poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfo
   nic acid) (PVP-b-PAMPS) and monomethoxy poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PEG-b-P4VP). The critical
   aggregate concentration (CAC), hydrodynamic size, and surface morphology
   of the prepared PICMs were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy,
   dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), respectively. The resulting CAC and the average diameter of the
   PICMs were about 43 mg/L and 121 nm, indicating high structural
   stability of micelles and a size favorable for delivery of drug. In
   addition, the PICMs exhibited good biocompatibility using the MTT
   (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay
   with human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. All of these features are
   quite feasible for utilizing the PICMs as a novel intelligent drug
   delivery system. In order to assess its application in the biomedical
   area, the model drug folic acid (FA) was loaded into the micelles and
   the in vitro drug release behavior was investigated. We found that by
   manipulating the pH value and salt concentration of the release
   solution, it was possible to control the release rate of FA. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective - Closure of the fistula tract with an anal fistula plug has
   been reported to provide success rates as high as 80\% The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate our results with this new method
   Method - From June 2006 to September 2007, an anal fistula plug was used
   for the treatment of high transsphincteric fistulae Success was defined
   as no residual leakage or abscess formation and closure of the external
   opening
   Results - Fifteen patients (seven women), median age 46 years (range
   32-58 years), were included in the study Three had Crohn's disease,
   three had an anovulvar fistula and seven had undergone previous surgical
   repair attempts Three patients expelled the prosthesis on post operative
   day 2, 5 and 7, respectively, and a second plug placement was followed
   by expulsion again One patient developed an abscess that was noted on
   postoperative day 4 The fistula tract healed in 6/15 patients (40\%)
   after 3 months and in 8/15 (53 3\%) after 7 months The success rate in
   Crohn's disease was 33\% No significant difference was found between
   patients with or without previous surgical repair
   Conclusion - In our experience, this simple technique provided success
   rates of 40\% at 3 months and 53\% at 7 months (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{The structure, magnetic and magnetostrictive properties of
   Sm0.88Nd0.12(Fe1-xCox)(1.93) (0 <= x <= 1.0) alloys have been
   investigated. The alloys have the cubic MgCu2 structure over the whole
   composition range and the lattice parameter a decreases with increasing
   x. For 0 <= x <= 0.2, substitution of Co for Fe slightly increases the
   saturation magnetization M-s and Curie temperature T-c, while further
   substitution causes a decrease in both M-s and T-c. The spin
   reorientation is observed, and a phase diagram for the spin
   configurations of the Sm0.88Nd0.12(Fe1-xCox)(1.93) system is determined.
   The spontaneous magnetostriction lambda(111) increases as x is
   increased, while a monotonic decrease of the saturation magnetostriction
   lambda(s) with x originates from the increase of lambda(100) with
   opposite sign to that of lambda(111), which may be caused by the filling
   of the d band due to Co substitution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Orthogonal arrays (OA's) are widely used in design of experiments. Each
   OA has a specific number of rows that is fixed by the number of factors
   in the OA and the number of levels in each factor. In a practical
   application of an industrial experiment, however, because of various
   operational constraints it could happen that the number of runs of the
   experiment cannot be set exactly equal to the number of rows of an OA.
   In this case, a lean design can be used. A lean design is obtained by
   removing some specific rows and columns from the extended design matrix
   formed from an OA, so that the resulting sub-matrix still allows
   efficient estimation of the effects of some of the factors. Tables for
   2-level lean designs are already available in the literature. In this
   paper, the authors will investigate 3-level lean designs and mixed-level
   lean designs, and construct tables for such designs for convenient use.

   interesting to check whether different stellar evolutionary models can
   give consistent results for the same cluster. Brown et al. constrained
   the age of B379 by comparing its CMD with isochrones of the 2006
   VandenBerg models. Using SSP models of Bruzual \& Charlot and its
   multiphotometry, ZMa et al. independently determined the age of B379,
   which is in good agreement with the determination of Brown et al. The
   models of Bruzual \& Charlot are calculated based on the Padova
   evolutionary tracks. It is necessary to check whether the age of B379 as
   determined based on the Padova evolutionary tracks is in agreement with
   the determination of Brown et al.. In this article, we redetermine the
   age of B379 using isochrones of the Padova stellar evolutionary models.
   In addition, the metal abundance, the distance modulus, and the
   reddening value for B379 are reported. The results obtained are
   consistent with the previous determinations, which include the age
   obtained by Brown et al. This article thus confirms the consistency of
   the age scale of B379 between the Padova isochrones and the 2006
   VandenBerg isochrones; i.e., the comparison between the results of Brown
   et al. and ZMa et al. is meaningful. The results reported in this
   article of values found for B379 are: metallicity {[}M/H] = logd
   (Z/Z(circle dot)) = -0.325, age tau 11.0 +/- 1.5 Gyr, reddening E(B-V) =
   0.08, and distance modulus (m - M)(0) 24.44 +/- 0.10.}},

Abstract = {{The low-temperature rheological properties of binders in the recycled
   asphalt pavement (RAP) material without the damaging effects of solvent
   extractions were analyzed. The developed procedure is based on testing
   of bitumen-RAP mortars produced by mixing the fresh (virgin) binder with
   RAP material smaller than \# 8 sieve. Different mortars were prepared,
   containing RAP material passing the \#8 sieve and 15\% by weight of
   fresh binder. Low temperature properties of these mortars were
   investigated by using the bending beam rheometer (BBR) test procedure
   that is specially modified for testing of the RAP mortars. The
   modification involved the development of a new kind of mold and
   different testing parameters. The RAP material used in the experimental
   study were both extracted from real reclaimed pavement and prepared in
   the laboratory, by aging binder through repeated PAV cycles. The results
   indicate the new procedure can capture the effect of aged properties of
   bitumen in the RAP and can be used to estimate the PG low temperature
   grade of the blended binder. Although data is limited in size, the
   modification of the BBR appears to be simple and provide repeatable
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Human-caused landscape change negatively affects the sustainability of
   many wildlife populations. In Alberta, Canada, grizzly bears (Ursus
   arctos L., 1758) live in one of the most populated and heavily exploited
   landscapes in which the species survives. Long-term physiological stress
   in individual animals may be the predominant mechanism linking landscape
   change with impaired wildlife population health. Hair cortisol
   concentration has been validated as a biomarker of long-term stress in
   humans and domestic animals; however, limited work has examined factors
   that may affect its measurement or interpretation. We have measured
   cortisol in as few as five guard hairs of a grizzly bear and have
   identified factors influencing hair cortisol concentration in this
   species. Hair cortisol varies with hair type, body region, and capture
   method. It is not influenced by colour, age, sex, environmental exposure
   (18 days), or prolonged laboratory storage (> 1 year) and does not vary
   along the length of the hair shaft. Recommendations for prudent use of
   hair cortisol analysis in grizzly bears are discussed with implications
   for the development of hair cortisol concentration as a tool to monitor
   long-term stress in other wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the 5-HT system and the dopaminergic system and
   cholinergic system may be important in determining cognitive function
   and motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have
   shown effects of reducing serotonin function, by acute tryptophan
   depletion (ATD), on neuropsychological function. In particular, an
   adverse effect on verbal memory has been demonstrated. This study
   compared with the effects of ATD on cognitive and motor function in PD
   and healthy control subjects. The effects of ATD were investigated in a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, cross-over,
   randomised design in 20 patients with PD and 35 healthy controls matched
   for age, gender and premorbid IQ. There was a differential group effect
   of ATD on global cognitive function whereby the mean score on the
   modified mini mental state examination during ATD was lower than placebo
   in PD but higher in controls. There was a similar pattern of effects on
   verbal recognition. In a visual recognition task, ATD improved
   performance in the PD but not in the control group. In terms of
   psychomotor speed, there was also a group-specific effect with reduced
   latency of response during ATD in the PD group but increased latency in
   the control group. ATD has subtle neuropsychological effects, which
   differ significantly between PD and healthy control subjects. This
   suggests that the dopaminergic and cholinergic deficit of PD
   significantly modulates the effects of serotonin depletion, resulting in
   positive effects in some domains. Further investigation on the effects
   of specific serotonin antagonists may be merited in PD.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate the need to include the speech-language
   pathologist and audiologist in the municipal health system of the city
   of Fortaleza (Northeastern Brazil), due to the high demand of patients
   and the lack of public speech-language and audiology services in the
   city. Methods: Documental, cross-sectional and descriptive study with a
   quantitative approach, developed between July and September 2008. Data
   were collected through the analysis of the records of the
   speech-language and audiology assistance provided for patients at
   NAMI-Unifor (The Medical Care Nucleus of the University of Fortaleza) in
   the period from January 2006 to December 2007. Results: There was
   predominance of the assistance provided for the age groups between 0 and
   6 years old in the audiology service (22.05\%) and 0 to 10 years old in
   the speech-language therapy service (58.09\%). The most applied
   audiology procedure was audiometry (65.78\%), and the main professional
   responsible for referring patients to the audiology service was the
   otorhinolaryngologist (56.39\%). In speech-language therapy, oral
   language and/or writing was the area with the highest prevalence of
   visits (36.99\%). Group therapy reached a significant percentage:
   37.27\% in 2007. A fall in the number of visits during the University's
   recess period was observed, due to the reduction in the number of
   students who are responsible for the procedures. Conclusion: With work
   in the level of primary care as regards the health of human
   communication/deglutition, there would be a reduction in public expenses
   with the treatment of speech-language and audiology alterations in the
   other health care levels. The presence of the speech-language therapist
   in the Primary Care Units would help to improve the quality of life of
   the population across the whole life cycle, and would also reduce the
   burden in the public services that provide speech-language therapy in
   the city of Fortaleza.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana
   Harris, and the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni Hubner, are serious
   fruit and vegetable pests requiring multiple insecticide applications
   per year. To reduce non-target exposure to hazardous insecticides and to
   curb resistance development, alternative controls are required.
   Accordingly, a selection of 17 essential oils was screened against both
   lepidopteran pests, and the influence of azinphos-methyl resistance on
   essential oil toxicity to C. rosaceana was studied.
   RESULTS: Of the 17 essential oils screened, patchouli oil (Pogostemon
   cablin Benth.) and thyme oil (Thymus vulgaris L.) were selected for
   further testing against C. rosaceana, whereas patchouli oil, garlic oil
   (Mum sativum L.) and lemongrass oil (Cymopogon nardus L.) were selected
   for further testing against T. ni. LC50 and LD50 values confirmed that
   patchouli oil was the most toxic to C. rosaceana larvae, with LC50 = 2.8
   mu L mL(-1) and LD50 = 8.0 mu g insect(-1). Garlic oil was the most
   toxic oil to T. ni larvae with LC50 = 3.34 mu L-1 and LD50 = 22.7 mu g
   insect(-1), followed by patchouli oil and lemongrass oil.
   Azinphos-methyl-resistant leafrollers were 1.5-fold more tolerant to
   patchouli oil and 2.0-fold more tolerant to thyme oil.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, patchouli oil and other essential
   oils have sufficient efficacy to be considered as components of an
   essential oil-based insecticide that targets these lepidopteran pests.

Abstract = {{We measured the plasma D-dimer (DD) concentration in 205 dogs.
   Simultaneously, fibrinogen/tibrin degradation products (FDPs)
   concentration, platelet (PLT) count, prothrombin time (PT), activated
   partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and plasma concentrations of
   fibrinogen (Fib) were measured in the same dogs. From these results, we
   were able to divide the animals into four groups: control (healthy dogs,
   n=18), pre-disseminated intravascular coagulation (preDIC) (n=20),
   disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (n=21), and other (n=146).
   Significant differences in plasma DD concentration were found among the
   four groups: control, 0.45 +/- 0.46 mu g/ml (reference ranee, 0-1.37);
   preDIC, 5.0 +/- 4.8 mu g/ml; DIC, 16.3 +/- 12.2 mu g/ml; and other, 1.5
   +/- 2.7 mu g/ml. A weak positive correlation (r=0.62) was found between
   FDPs and DD concentrations in the DIC group. As a DIC diagnostic test,
   the PLT/APTT/FDPs/DD combination had the highest accuracy of 100\%, with
   a sensitivity of 73\% and a specificity of 97\%. We propose the use of
   FDPs and DD concentrations as part of the DIC diagnostic test panel,

Abstract = {{Parasites are characteristically aggregated within hosts, but
   identifying the mechanisms underlying such aggregation can be difficult
   in wildlife populations. We examined the influence of host age and sex
   over an annual cycle on the eggs per gram of feces (EPG) of nematode
   parasites infecting wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) on
   Yakushima Island. Five species of nematode were recorded from 434 fecal
   samples collected from an age-structured group of 50 individually
   recognizable macaques. All parasites exhibited aggregated EPG
   distributions. The age-infection profiles of all three directly
   transmitted species (Oesophagostomum aculeatum, Strongyloides
   fuelleborni, and Trichuris trichiura) exhibited convex curves, but
   concavity better characterized the age-infection curves of the two
   trophically transmitted species (Streptopharagus pigmentatus and
   Gongylonema pulchrum). There was a male bias in EPG and prevalence of
   infection with directly transmitted species, except in the prevalence of
   O. aculeatum, and no sex bias in the other parasites. Infection with O.
   aculeatum showed a female bias in prevalence among young adults, and
   additional interactions with sex and seasonality show higher EPG values
   in males during the mating season (fall) but in females during the birth
   season (spring). These patterns suggest that an immunosuppressive role
   by reproductive hormones may be regulating direct, but not indirect,
   life-cycle parasites. Exposure at an early age may trigger an immune
   response that affects all nematodes, but trophically transmitted species
   appear to accumulate thereafter. Although it is difficult to discern
   clear mechanistic explanations for parasite distributions in wildlife
   populations, it is critical to begin examining these patterns in host
   species that are increasingly endangered by anthropogenic threats.}},

Abstract = {{An unknown disease abruptly appeared on hydroponic cultures of common
   ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) in the greenhouse, causing
   catastrophic damage. Although the symptoms of the plant were unlike
   typical Botrytis lesions on leaves and stems of other plants, fungi
   isolated from the necrotic lesions on the plant were similar to genus
   Botrytis in terms of conidial shape, colony color and nature. A
   representative isolate, Ice-2, caused similar symptoms on the host
   plants after inoculation with conidia, and the same fungus was isolated
   from the lesions. The conidia and conidiophores of Ice-2 were
   morphologically similar to those of B. cinerea but not to those of B.
   allii, B. fabae or B. squamosa. The tested Botrytis fungi grew at
   temperatures between 5 and 30A degrees C. Ice-2 grew faster than the
   others at the lower end of the temperature range. Ice-2 was also more
   virulent than B. cinerea (Bay-1) in artificial inoculations, especially
   on common ice plant leaves. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
   gene (G3PDH) sequence of Ice-2 was determined and compared with those
   from four Botrytis species. The gene sequence of Ice-2 appeared to be
   identical to that of B. cinerea. In leaf tests on common ice plant and
   kidney bean, the diseases caused by Ice-2 and Bay-1 were controlled
   equally well by the primary Botrytis fungicides. Based on the results of
   the present studies, Ice-2 is thought to be Botrytis cinerea Person:

Abstract = {{Aluminium-silicon alloy, an important material used for the construction
   of internal combustion engines, exhibit pressure induced distinct
   regimes of wear and friction; ultra-mild and mild. In this work the
   alloy is slid lubricated against a spherical steel pin at contact
   pressures characteristic of the two test regimes, at a very low sliding
   velocity. In both cases, the friction is controlled at the initial
   stages of sliding by the abrasion of the steel pin by the protruding
   silicon particles of the disc. The generation of nascent steel chips
   helps to breakdown the additive in the oil by a cationic exchange that
   yields chemical products of benefits to the tribology. The friction is
   initially controlled by abrasion, but the chemical products gain
   increasing importance in controlling friction with sliding time. After
   long times, depending on contact pressure, the chemical products
   determine sliding friction exclusively. In this paper, a host of
   mechanical and spectroscopic techniques are used to identify and
   characterize mechanical damage and chemical changes. Although the basic
   dissipation mechanisms are the same in the two regimes, the matrix
   remains practically unworn in the low-pressure ultra-mild wear regime.
   In the higher pressure regime at long sliding times a small but finite
   wear rate prevails. Incipient plasticity in the subsurface controls the
   mechanism of wear.}},

Abstract = {{Musicians are highly trained motor experts with pronounced associations
   between musical actions and the corresponding auditory effects. However,
   the importance of auditory feedback for music performance is
   controversial, and it is unknown how feedback during music performance
   is processed. The present study investigated the neural mechanisms
   underlying the processing of auditory feedback manipulations in
   pianists. To disentangle effects of action-based and perception-based
   expectations, we compared feedback manipulations during performance to
   the mere perception of the same stimulus material. In two experiments,
   pianists performed bimanually sequences on a piano, while at random
   positions, the auditory feedback of single notes was manipulated,
   thereby creating a mismatch between an expected and actually perceived
   action effect (action condition). In addition, pianists listened to tone
   sequences containing the same manipulations (perception condition). The
   manipulations in the perception condition were either task-relevant
   (Experiment 1) or task-irrelevant (Experiment 2). In action and
   perception conditions, event-related potentials elicited by manipulated
   tones showed an early fronto-central negativity around 200 msec,
   presumably reflecting a feedback ERN/N200, followed by a positive
   deflection (P3a). The early negativity was more pronounced during the
   action compared to the perception condition. This shows that during
   performance, the intention to produce specific auditory effects leads to
   stronger expectancies than the expectancies built up during music
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To review the literature and our current understanding of nondermatomal
   somatosensory deficits (NDSDs) associated with chronic pain in regards
   to their prevalence, assessment and clinical presentation, cause and
   pathophysiology, relationship with conversion disorder and psychological
   factors, as well as their treatment and prognosis.
   Recent findings
   NDSDs are negative sensory deficits consisting of partial or total loss
   of sensation to pinprick, light touch or other cutaneous modalities.
   Although they had been noted more than a century ago and appear
   prevalent in chronic pain populations, they are poorly studied. They may
   be very mild or very dense, may occupy large body areas, are often
   highly dynamic and changeable or, to the contrary, very stable and long
   lasting. NDSDs may occur in the absence of biomedical pathology or
   coexist with structural musculoskeletal or nervous system abnormalities.
   They appear to be associated with psychological factors and a poor
   prognosis for response to treatment and return to work. Recent brain
   imaging studies provide a basis for understanding NDSD pathophysiology.
   Summary
   NDSDs represent prevalent phenomena associated with chronic pain.
   Further, research is needed to elucidate their origin, response to
   treatment, and prevalence in the general population, primary care
   settings, and nonpain patients.}},

Title = {{Goal-setting in youth football. Are coaches missing an opportunity?}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{323-343}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Goal-setting is not always the simple motivational technique
   when used in an applied sport setting especially in relation to the
   meaning of achievement in competitive sport. Goal-setting needs to be
   examined in a broader context than goal-setting theory, such as provided
   by social cognitive theories of motivation. In football, the culture of
   the club and the role of the coach must be considered.
   Purpose: The aim of the study was to (1) use naturalistic inquiry and
   Roberts' suggested framework of social cognitive theories of motivation
   to identify and describe the motivational choices that elite youth
   football players make as they go through the goal-setting process, (2)
   examine the influence of the coach on this process in the elite football
   environment, and (3) gain an understanding of the goal-setting process.
   The paper considers the implications of the study for coaching practice.
   Participants and setting: Ten elite youth football players (five male,
   five female) at four British football clubs.
   Design: The study used naturalistic enquiry to examine the goal-setting
   practices of the players at their club. The key social-cognitive
   motivation concepts of personal agency beliefs, personal goals, and
   evaluative standards and affect were used to frame the instrumentation,
   including the production of the interview questions.
   Data collection: Each participant was asked to complete a weekly diary
   for four weeks to provide insights into the duration and frequency of
   goal-setting as well as the motivational processing by the players. At
   the end of the four weeks, a semi-structured interview was conducted
   with each player.
   Data analysis: Inductive analysis of the pooled data from the diaries
   and the transcribed interviews, using grounded theory, was used to
   identify the themes and categories from the data, using the research
   questions generated during the conceptual and design phase of the study
   as an initial framework.
   Findings: Real life goal-setting in elite youth football is more complex
   when compared to the goal-setting heuristic. The players' motivational
   choices as they set and evaluated their discrete goals could be examined
   in the context of the social cognitive motivational tenets of personal
   goals, personal agency beliefs and affective response. The coaches
   played a pivotal role and there was a mismatch between players' needs
   and coaches' responses throughout this process. Finally the process of
   goal-setting varied from the heuristic of goal-setting theory.
   Conclusion: Coaches should engage in a two-way, interactive and ongoing
   dialogue with players, taking into account the players' and their own
   motivational needs and the environment within which they operate, in
   order to improve the effectiveness of goal-setting as a technique, and
   hence their effectiveness as a coach.}},

Abstract = {{Comminution of the dorsal metaphysis is a relatively common feature of
   distal radius fractures. However, its effects on the radiographic
   outcomes of these fractures are not entirely understood. One hundred and
   twenty-four conservatively managed distal radius fractures were analysed
   retrospectively to assess the effect of dorsal metaphyseal comminution
   on fracture stability, especially with respect to initial displacement
   (minimally displaced versus displaced) and age group. Seventy-seven
   fractures (62\%) had radiographic evidence of dorsal comminution. The
   secondary displacement rate of these fractures was 75\%, compared to
   45\% in non-comminuted counterparts (P<0.001). In minimally displaced
   fractures, the secondary displacement rate was higher in those with
   dorsal comminution as compared to those without (57\% vs. 31\%,
   P=0.086). Dorsal metaphyseal comminution was found in 75\% of fractures
   in patients 65+years old (P=0.05). Among those with dorsal comminution,
   the secondary displacement rates were similar for both men and women
   (63\% vs. 79\%; P=0.20). In conclusion, distal radius fractures with
   dorsal metaphyseal comminution had significantly higher rates of
   secondary displacement compared to non-comminuted counterparts, and
   there exists a correlation with this displacement and increasing patient
   age but not gender.}},

Abstract = {{Mucor rouxii CFR-G15, a locally isolated phycomycetous fungus, on
   cultivation at room temperature produced more than 30\% (w/w) lipid in
   their dry cell weight, in which 14.2\% accounted to be GLA content of
   the total fatty acids. It was observed that when incubation temperature
   lowered at 14 degrees C, GLA content of the mycelium increased
   significantly (P < 0.05) from 14.2\% to 21.97\%. In order to optimize
   the cultural conditions for high biomass and lipid production with high
   GLA content, the fungus was grown in association of two different
   temperatures and supply of additional glucose in culture medium. Maximum
   lipid and GLA were obtained 23.56 and 19.5\% respectively, when the
   culture was grown at 28 degrees C for four days and followed by addition
   of glucose (5\%), and lowered the incubation temperature to 14 degrees C
   for another four days. The presence of GLA in the oil obtained from M.
   rouxii CFR-G15 was confirmed by the gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Gamma linolenic acid (GLA, n-6) is gaining importance in

   increasing the level of performance and reliability.
   In terms of physical architecture, even if the brick concept is more
   current at mid-term, the tile concept is investigated for conformal
   and/or multifunction phased array antennas: a 3-dimensional module will
   lead to a drastic reduction of size and weight of the antennas.
   MMICs are always the key components, with evolution toward multifunction
   chips, and new processes like GaN, SiGe, MEMS power switches.
   Concerning the packaging, a technological roadmap indicates different
   capabilities:
   thick film multilayer ceramic circuits,
   co-fired ceramics based on LTCC or HTCC processes,
   surface-mounted packages on printed circuits boards, and
   3D architectures.
   For the interconnections domain, it is now more important to be
   compatible with the level of integration required for the microwave
   modules: fuzz buttons, flex, sub-miniature connectors.
   All of these technologies mastered by Thales are dual use for Airborne
   and Space, Military and Civilian applications.}},

Abstract = {{A CFD simulation of pulverized coal and straw combustion using a
   commercial multifuel burner have been undertaken to examine the
   difference in combustion characteristics. Focus has also been directed
   to development of the modeling technique to deal with larger
   non-spherical straw particles and to determine the relative importance
   of different modeling choices for straw combustion. Investigated
   modeling choices encompass the particle size and shape distribution, the
   modification of particle motion and heating due to the departure from
   the spherical ideal, the devolatilization rate of straw, the influence
   of inlet boundary conditions and the effect of particles on the carrier
   phase turbulence. It is concluded that straw combustion is associated
   with a significantly longer flame and smaller recirculation zones
   compared to coal combustion for the present air flow specifications. The
   particle size and shape distribution is the most influential parameter
   for the correct prediction of straw combustion. The inlet boundary
   conditions and the application of a turbulence modulation model can
   significantly affect the predicted combustion efficiency whereas the
   choice of devolatilization parameters was found to be of minor
   importance. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in the treatment and prevention of Molar/Incisor

   Hypomineralized enamel was found to have from 3- to 15-fold higher

   amelogenins. This distinguished MIH from hypomaturation defects with
   high residual amelogenins (amelogenesis imperfecta, fluorosis) and so
   typified it as a hypocalcification defect. Second, hypomineralized
   enamel was found to have accumulated various proteins from oral fluid
   and blood, with differential incorporation depending on integrity of the
   enamel surface. Pathogenically, these results point to a pre-eruptive
   disturbance of mineralization involving albumin and, in cases with
   post-eruptive breakdown, subsequent protein adsorption on the exposed

   Results: A total of 15 strains of Shigella were isolated from 156
   stools; Shigella flexneri was the only species found. Two infected
   children died of dehydration. Most strains were resistant to antibiotics
   except quinolones, which were active on all of these strains.
   Conclusions: The control of Shigella infections should be reinforced in

Title = {{EEG Hemispheric Asymmetries During Cognitive Tasks in Depressed Patients
   With High Versus Low Trait Anxiety}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{196-202}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Studies of regional hemispheric asymmetries point to relatively less
   activity in left frontal and right posterior regions in depression.
   Anxiety was associated with increased right posterior activity, which
   may be related to arousal and, in anxious-depressed individuals, offset
   the posterior asymmetry typically seen in depression. These asymmetries
   have been indexed by resting EEG or inferred through the use of
   lateralized auditory and visual tasks (e.g., dichotic listening and
   chimeric faces). However, associations between regional EEG activity and
   neurocognitive function in depression or anxiety remain unclear. The
   present study used matched verbal (Word Finding) and spatial (Dot
   Localization) tasks to compare task-related alpha asymmetries in
   depressed patients grouped according to level of trait anxiety. EEG and
   behavioral performance were recorded from depressed patients with high
   anxiety (n=14) or low anxiety (n=14) and 21 age- and education-matched
   healthy adults during the two tasks, and alpha power was averaged within
   each task. As predicted, the two patient groups exhibited opposite
   patterns of regional hemispheric alpha asymmetry. Greater right than
   left central-parietal activation was seen in the high-anxiety depressed
   group during the spatial task, whereas greater left than right
   frontal-central activation was found in the low-anxiety depressed group
   during the verbal task. Group differences in task performance were in
   the expected direction but did not reach statistical significance. These
   results are consistent with Heller's two-dimensional model of depression
   and anxiety and highlight the sensitivity of task-related EEG alpha in
   discriminating among subgroups of depressed patients differing in trait
   anxiety.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{603-608}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of
   the Young-Burgess classification system to predict mortality,
   transfusion requirements, and nonorthopaedic injuries in patients with
   pelvic ring fractures and to determine whether mortality rates after
   pelvic fractures have changed over time.
   Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: Level I trauma center.
   Patients: One thousand two hundred forty-eight patients with pelvic
   fractures during a 7-year period.
   Intervention: None.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Mortality at index admission, transfusion
   requirement during first 24 hours, and presence of nonorthopaedic
   injuries as a function of Young-Burgess pelvic classification type.
   Mortality compared with historic controls.
   Results: Despite a relatively large sample size, the ability of the
   Young-Burgess system to predict mortality only approached statistical
   significance (P = 0.07, Kruskal-Wallis). The Young-Burgess system
   differentiated transfusion requirements-lateral compression Type 3 (LC3)
   and anteroposterior compression Types 2 (APC2) and 3 (APC3) fractures
   had higher transfusion requirements than did lateral compression Type 1
   (LC1), anteroposterior compression Type 1 (APC1), and vertical shear
   (VS) (P < 0.05)-but was not as useful at predicting head, chest, or
   abdomen injuries. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types
   allowed the system to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and
   transfusion requirements. Overall mortality in the study group was
   9.1\%, unchanged from original Young-Burgess studies 15 years previously
   (P = 0.3).
   Conclusions: The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting
   transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or
   nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1,
   LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of
   injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign
   (overall mortality rate, 8.2\%).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The truncated mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) is
   homologous to nuclear PRs with the exception of an amino terminus
   hydrophobic membrane localization sequence, which localizes PR-M to
   mitochondria. Given the matrilineal inheritance of both spontaneous
   preterm birth (SPTB) and the mitochondrial genome, we hypothesized that
   (a) PR-M is polymorphic and (b) PR-M localization sequence polymorphisms
   could result in variable progesterone-mitochondrial effects and variable
   responsiveness to progesterone prophylaxis. Methods: Secondary analysis
   of DNA from women enrolled in a multicenter, prospective, study of 17
   alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPC) versus placebo for the
   prevention of recurrent SPTB. DNA was extracted from stored saliva.
   Results: The PR-M localization sequence was sequenced on 344 patients.
   Sequences were compared with the previously published 48 base-pair
   sequence, and all were identical. Conclusions: We did not detect genetic
   variation in the mitochondrial localization sequence of the truncated

Abstract = {{Preclinical and clinical investigations have shown hippocampal neuronal
   atrophy and destruction were observed in patients with depression, which
   could be ameliorated by the treatment with antidepressants. Therefore,
   neuroprotection has been proposed to be one of the acting mechanisms of
   antidepressant. Paeoniflorin, a monoterpene glycoside, has been reported
   to display antidepressant-like effects in animal models of behavioral
   despair. The present study aimed to examine the protective effect of
   paeoniflorin on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat
   pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that pretreatment with
   paeoniflorin elevated cell viability, inhibited apoptosis, decreased
   levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and
   enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase in glutamate-treated PC12
   cells. Pretreatment with paeoniflorin also reversed the increased
   intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the reduced Calbindin-D28K mRNA
   level caused by glutamate in PC12 cells. The results suggest that
   paeoniflorin exerts a neuroprotective effect on glutamate-induced
   neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, at least in part, via inhibiting oxidative
   stress and Ca2+ overload. This neuroprotective effect may be one of the
   action pathways accounting for the in vivo antidepressant activity of
   paeoniflorin.}},

Abstract = {{Using scanning electron microscopy we analyzed thrombotic material
   removed from coronary bypass grafts in a 57-year-old woman with

   (AMI). A white thrombotic material removed from the marginal branch
   bypass that contained large amounts of activated platelets displaying
   pseudopodia clearly visible at a higher magnification with a relatively
   low amount of fibrin. The other thrombus obtained from the right
   posterior descendent branch (RPD) bypass showed a highly organized
   fibrin structure composed of thicker fibers with low amounts of cellular
   components. Our findings indicate that the thrombus structure is
   different in AMI patients in whom the infarct-related vessel is vein
   anastomosis compared to those with a native coronary artery occluded.
   These findings help explain resistance of such thrombi to fibrinolysis
   and faster plaque growth related to fibrin accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{Although family reunification migrants form a large proportion of
   migrants, their prevalence of mental disorders is unknown because
   research has focused on mixed groups of first generation immigrants and
   refugees. Our aim was to investigate the risk of mental disorders among
   family reunification migrants compared with that among native Danes.
   Family reunification migrants (n = 31,923) were matched on age and sex
   with native Danes (n = 127,687). Civil registration numbers were linked
   to the Danish Psychiatric Central Register to obtain data on diagnosis
   for all first-time psychiatric hospital contacts for migrants (n = 972)
   and native Danes (n = 5,390) between 1 January 1994 and 31 December
   2003.
   Overall family reunification migrants had a significantly lower risk of
   having a first-time psychiatric contact for mental disorders than did
   native Danes (RR = 0.78; 95\% CI 0.71-0.87); specific risks of
   psychotic, affective and neurotic disorders did not differ except for
   migrant men, who had a higher risk of nervous disorder than that of
   native Danes (RR = 1.59; 95\% CI 1.17; 2.17).
   Overall, family reunification migrants had a similar or lower risk of
   mental disorders compared with native Danes. The results may reflect
   true morbidity patterns or an underestimation of mental illness due to
   problems of access to care.}},

Volume = {{252}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: No therapy except liver transplantation currently exists for
   patients with acute liver failure (ALF). The aim of this study was to
   determine whether pharmacologic mobilization of endogenous hematopoietic
   stem cells (HSCs) can aid in liver repair and improve survival in an
   animal model of ALF.
   Methods: Rodents were treated with a single near-lethal intraperitoneal
   injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). After 12 hours, animals were
   randomized to receive plerixafor and granulocyte colony-stimulating
   factor (G-CSF), agents known to mobilize marrow-derived stem cells, or
   saline vehicle injection. Mice were observed for survival, and serial
   assessment of liver injury by serum transaminase measurements, and
   histologic analysis was performed.
   Results: In our ALF model, 7-day survival after injection of CCl4 was
   25\%. Administration of plerixafor and G-CSF following CCl4 resulted in
   87\% survival (n = 8, P < 0.05). On serial histopathologic analysis,
   animals treated with plerixafor and G-CSF demonstrated less hepatic
   injury compared with control animals. Evaluation of peripheral blood
   demonstrated an increase in circulating HSCs in response to plerixafor
   and G-CSF, and immunostaining suggested the infiltration of HSCs into
   the hepatic parenchyma after stem cell mobilization.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible new treatment strategy for
   patients with ALF, a group for whom either liver transplantation or
   death is frequently the outcome. Pharmacologic agents that mobilize HSCs
   may lead to an infiltration of the injured liver with cells that may
   participate in or expedite liver regeneration. This therapy has the
   potential to avert liver transplantation in some patients with ALF and
   may be of benefit in a wide variety of medical and surgical patients
   with liver injury.}},

Abstract = {{Aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) is potential human carcinogen. Its presence in
   milk and dairy products represents risk for human health. Therefore,
   this study was carried out in order to determine the degree of
   microbiological contamination by mold, and the potential presence of
   aflatoxin M-1 in 60 raw milk samples, randomly taken from individual
   producers from different regions of the continental Croatia. The most
   common genera isolated fungi were Geotrichum (78.3 \%), Aspergillus
   (32.4 \%) and Penicillium (27.0 \%). From total of 60 studied milk
   samples, 86.66 \% were positive for the presence of aflatoxin M-1, and
   6.66 \% of samples were above the prescribed limits. Lactic acid
   bacteria used in fermented dairy products as a starter culture may play
   a role in reduction of aflatoxin in foods and nutrients. In this paper
   the ability of lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC
   53103), Lactobacillus delbrueckii S1 and Lactobacillus plantarum A1 to
   bind aflatoxin M-1 was investigated. Standard strain L. rhamnosus GG
   (ATCC 53103) and L. delbrueckii S1 can significantly (P<0.05) remove
   AFM(1) (>50 \%) compared to L. plantarum A1, which binds AFM(1), between

   humans might be associated with disease severity, progression and
   outcome.
   Methods: Serum ADPN was measured in 82 consecutive acute IS patients.
   Severity at presentation and stroke progression within the first week
   were evaluated according to internationally agreed definitions.
   Disability and functional outcomes were assessed on months 1, 3 and 6
   using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index (BI). Additional
   data included information on infarct size, mortality, recurrent IS and
   mental state.
   Results: Higher ADPN was indicative of greater disability (mRS) on month
   1 (OR=1.141, 95\% CI=1.012-1.286, p=0.031), but this result was not
   replicated using the BI. ADPN was not found to be associated with either
   stroke severity, clinical progression, infarct size, recurrent IS,
   mortality, mental state, disability or functional outcome during the 6
   month follow-up.
   Conclusions: Despite previous experimental evidence, serum ADPN measured
   shortly after an acute IS in humans does not seem to reliably predict
   disease severity, progression or outcome. The concept that circulating
   ADPN may beneficially modify long-term outcome of an acute IS may not be
   the case for human stroke.}},

Abstract = {{This report details the chemical and associated electrical resistance
   changes of silver vanadium phosphorous oxide (Ag(2)VO(2)Pat, SVPO)
   incurred during electrochemical reduction in a lithium based
   electrochemical cell over the range of 0-4 electrons per formula unit.
   Specifically the cathode electrical conductivities and associated cell
   DC resistance and cell AC impedance values vary with the level of
   reduction, due the changes of the SVPO cathode. Initially. Ag+ is
   reduced to Ag-0 (2 electrons per formula unit or 50\% of the calculated
   theoretical value of 4 electrons per formula unit) accompanied by
   significant decreases in the cathode electrical resistance, consistent
   with the formation of an electrically conductive silver metal matrix
   within the SVPO cathode. As Ag+ reduction progresses, V5+ reduction
   initiates; once the SVPO reduction process progresses to where the
   reduction of V5+ to V4+ is the dominant process, both the cell and the
   cathode electrical resistances then begin to increase. If the discharge
   then continues to where the dominant cathode reduction process is the
   reduction of V4+ to V3+, the cathode and cell electrical resistances
   then begin to decrease. The complex cathode electrical resistance
   pattern exhibited during full cell discharge is an important subject of
   this study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To determine whether elements of a standard nutritional screening
   assessment are independently prognostic of survival in patients with
   advanced cancer.
   Patients and Methods
   A prospective nested cohort of patients with metastatic cancer were
   accrued from different units of a Regional Palliative Care Program.
   Patients completed a nutritional screen on admission. Data included age,
   sex, cancer site, height, weight history, dietary intake, 13 nutrition
   impact symptoms, and patient-and physician-reported performance status
   (PS). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted.
   Concordance statistics (c-statistics) were used to test the predictive
   accuracy of models based on training and validation sets; a c-statistic
   of 0.5 indicates the model predicts the outcome as well as chance;
   perfect prediction has a c-statistic of 1.0.
   Results
   A training set of patients in palliative home care (n = 1,164) was used
   to identify prognostic variables. Primary disease site, PS, short-term
   weight change (either gain or loss), dietary intake, and dysphagia
   predicted survival in multivariate analysis (P < .05). A model including
   only patients separated by disease site and PS with high c-statistics
   between predicted and observed responses for survival in the training
   set (0.90) and validation set (0.88; n = 603). The addition of weight
   change, dietary intake, and dysphagia did not further improve the
   c-statistic of the model. The c-statistic was also not altered by
   substituting physician-rated palliative PS for patient-reported PS.
   Conclusion
   We demonstrate a high probability of concordance between predicted and
   observed survival for patients in distinct palliative care settings
   (home care, tertiary inpatient, ambulatory outpatient) based on
   patient-reported information.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of grass were collected at Masaya Volcano (Nicaragua;
   Rhynchelytrum repens and Andropogon angustatus) and the Piton de La
   Fournaise (around the April 2007 eruptive vent, La Reunion; Vetiveria
   zizanioides) to investigate the controls on major and trace element
   concentrations in plants around active volcanic vents. Samples were
   analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for a wide
   range of elements, and atomic absorption spectroscopy for Hg. At Masaya,
   As, Cu, Mo, Tl and K concentrations in both grass species showed a
   simple pattern of variability consistent with exposure to the volcanic
   plume. Similar variability was found in A. angustatus for Al, Co, Cs, Hg
   and Mg. At the Piton de La Fournaise, the patterns of variability in V
   zizanioides were more complex and related to variable exposures to
   emissions from both the active vent and lava flow. These results suggest
   that exposure to volcanic emissions is, for many elements, the main
   control on compositional variability in vegetation growing on active
   volcanoes. Thus, vegetation may be an important environmental reservoir
   for elements emitted by volcanoes and should be considered as part of
   the global biogeochemical cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To (i) identify and describe prevailing infant feeding policy
   documents in five diverse European countries; (ii) analyse types of
   health outcomes for the infant that are associated with feeding breast
   milk rather than formula milk in the documents of different countries;
   and (iii) assess the extent to which documents reflect the WHO global
   recommendation of exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months.
   Design: Documentary review and analysis.
   Setting: Five geographically dispersed countries of Europe (England,
   Finland, Germany, Hungary and Spain).
   Subjects: Policy documents on infant feeding were identified; statements
   that linked choice between breast-and formula-feeding to a health
   outcome for the infant were extracted.
   Results: Twenty-six documents (varied authorships, dates, length and
   character) were identified: four from England; two from Finland; nine
   from Germany; six from Hungary; and five from Spain. There was no
   consistency in the way in which health outcomes were cited as factors in
   the recommendations for breast-rather than formula-feeding. Seven
   documents contained no reference to the health implications of infant
   feeding choice. Of 203 statements in remaining documents citing health
   outcomes, 24.1\% mentioned general health effects, 32.5\% protection
   against infections, 31.5\% long-term conditions (e. g. diabetes, CVD)
   and 11.8\% mentioned allergy. Health outcomes were linked to exclusive
   breast-feeding in only 25\% of statements.
   Conclusions: Policy documents in the study countries varied in the
   extent to which they reflect the health outcomes for the baby of
   breast-feeding, and this may limit effective promotion by health
   professionals. There is scope to improve the process of bringing
   evidence and recommendations into policy documents.}},

Abstract = {{Large basins with relatively wide floors experience heterogeneous
   nocturnal cooling due to the diversity of the topography and the land
   use within the basin. Near mountain ranges the drainage flows prevail,
   but in low areas, river valleys or embedded plateaux, the actual rates
   of cooling differ as does the behaviour of the local flows in the first
   few metres above the surface. In this study, the temporal and spatial
   heterogeneity of the surface cooling is inspected through the analysis
   of satellite radiative surface temperature, data from a meteorological
   network and a tall tower. The organisation of the flow within the basin
   is also studied by means of a high-resolution numerical mesoscale
   simulation. Although the basin cools almost as a unit, there exists a
   large diversity of local regimes. Vertical profiles from the mesoscale
   simulation are analysed and grouped according to their wind structure
   and stratification.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that asymmetries in hurricanes (e. g., spiral
   rainbands, polygonal eyewalls, and mesovortices) have long been observed
   in radar and satellite imagery, many aspects of their dynamics remain
   unsolved, particularly in the formation of the secondary eyewall. The
   underlying associated dynamical processes need to be better understood
   to advance the science of hurricane intensity forecasting. To fill this
   gap, a simple 2D barotropic ``dry{''} model is used to simulate a
   hurricane-like concentric rings vortex. The empirical normal mode (ENM)
   technique, together with Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux calculations, are used
   to isolate wave modes from the model datasets to investigate their
   impact on the changes in the structure and intensity of the simulated
   hurricane-like vortex.
   From the ENM diagnostics, it is shown that asymmetric disturbances
   outside a strong vortex ring with a large vorticity skirt may relax to
   form concentric rings of enhanced vorticity that contain a secondary
   wind maximum. The fact that the critical radius for some of the leading
   modes is close to the location where the secondary ring of enhanced
   vorticity develops suggests that a wave-mean flow interaction mechanism
   based on vortex Rossby wave (VRW) dynamics may explain important
   dynamical aspects of concentric eyewall genesis (CEG).}},

Abstract = {{Aims: An experiment was set up to evaluate the visual assessment of
   ``shoot lip stage{''} as a method to estimate the water status of
   vineyards and its utility in vineyard management. The specific
   objectives were (1) determining the functional relationship of shoot tip
   stage (S) with leaf water potential (psi(1)) at solar noon, a more
   traditional method for evaluating vine water stress, and (2) testing its
   performance and simplicity in field conditions.
   Materials and results: A field study was first conducted in 2009 in a
   vineyard located in the La Rioja wine producing region (Spain). psi(1)
   and S measurements were performed at four different phenological stages
   and the data were collected in a completely randomized design. The
   relationship between the two parameters was established by multiple
   linear regression analyses and was validated with data collected in
   another vineyard during the next year.
   Conclusion: The calculated shoot tip stage can be used reliably to
   estimate vineyard water status and to manage vineyard irrigation.
   Significance and impact of the study: The shoot tip method is fast and
   non-destructive, it does not require any special skill or equipment, it
   is independent of weather conditions, and the calculations are simple.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to determine whether the variations in the
   occurrence of gram-negative enteric rods as detected through a
   longitudinal follow up with three consecutive visits, may be associated
   with the periodontal clinical status.
   Design: Clinical and demographic parameters from 63 untreated chronic
   periodontitis (CP) subjects and 45 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed.
   Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 6 sites in each subject at
   baseline, 1-week, and 1-month visits and processed using culture and
   biochemical tests. Culture findings were categorized taking into account
   the detection frequency of gram-negative enteric rods as persistent
   presence, transient presence, or absence of enteric rods in any sampling
   time.
   Results: Although transient presence of gram-negative enteric rods was
   more prevalent in CP subjects (16.7\%) than HC subjects (9.3\%), the
   difference was not significant (P > 0.05). The majority of subjects
   showed a transient presence of gram-negative enteric rods at
   concentrations <2 x 10(2) CFU/mL. Persistent presence of gram-negative
   enteric rods was not observed in any subject through the entire study
   period. Moreover, differences in both the detection frequencies of
   individual species and the total number of gram-negative enteric rods
   were not statistically significant neither inter- nor intragroups.
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study could indicate that
   gram-negative enteric rods are merely transient microorganisms within
   the subgingival environment and suggest that the periodontal clinical
   status appeared not to be influenced by the presence of these species.

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate contemporary organ dysfunction scoring systems
   for early prediction of severity in acute pancreatitis (AP).
   Methods: In a consecutive cohort of 181 patients with AP, organ
   dysfunction scores (logistic organ dysfunction system {[}LODS] score,
   Marshall organ dysfunction score, and sequential organ failure
   assessment score) were collected at 24 and 48 hours. Acute Physiology
   and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were calculated on
   admission and 24 and 48 hours and C-reactive protein level measured at
   48 hours. Patients who died or used critical care facilities (level 2/3)
   during admission were classed as severe.
   Results: Area under curve for APACHE II score at admission was 0.78
   (95\% confidence interval, 0.69-0.86). At 24 hours, area under curve for
   LODS, Marshall organ dysfunction system, sequential organ failure
   assessment, and APACHE II scores were 0.82, 0.80, 0.80, and 0.82,
   respectively. The LODS score at cutoff of 1 achieved 90\% sensitivity
   and 69\% specificity, corresponding to a positive predictive value of
   38\%. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score as a
   rule-out for selection of mild cases at a test threshold of 9 (scores e
   8 being selected) gives homogeneity of 91\% and efficiency of 79\%.
   Conclusions: Contemporary organ dysfunction scoring systems provides an
   objective guide to stratification of management, but there is no perfect
   score. All scores evaluated here perform equivalently at 24 hours. Acute
   Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II may have practical clinical
   value as a rule-out test.}},

Journal = {{AGING-US}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{731-734}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cdc13 is a single stranded telomere binding protein that specifically
   localizes to the telomere ends of budding yeasts and is essential for
   cell viability. It caps the ends of chromosomes thus preventing
   chromosome end-to-end fusions and exonucleolytic degradation, events
   that could lead to genomic instability and senescence, the hallmark of
   aging. Cdc13 is also involved in telomere length regulation by
   recruiting or preventing access of telomerase to the telomeric overhang.
   Recruitment of telomerase to the telomeres for G-strand extension is
   required for continuous cell division, while preventing its access to
   the telomeres through capping the chromosome ends prevents mitotic
   events that could lead to cell immortality, the hall mark of
   carcinogenesis. Cdc13 and its putative homologues human CTC1 and POT1
   are therefore key to many biological processes directly associated with
   life extension and cancer prevention and can be viewed as an ideal
   target for cancer and age related therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) is an important inflammatory mediator of
   type 2 diabetes. Here we show that oligomers of islet amyloid
   polypeptide (IAPP), a protein that forms amyloid deposits in the
   pancreas during type 2 diabetes, triggered the NLRP3 inflammasome and
   generated mature IL-1 beta. One therapy for type 2 diabetes, glyburide,
   suppressed IAPP-mediated IL-1 beta production in vitro. Processing of
   IL-1 beta initiated by IAPP first required priming, a process that
   involved glucose metabolism and was facilitated by minimally oxidized
   low-density lipoprotein. Finally, mice transgenic for human IAPP had
   more IL-1 beta in pancreatic islets, which localized together with
   amyloid and macrophages. Our findings identify previously unknown
   mechanisms in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and treatment of
   pathology caused by IAPP.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Prospective study of patients with chronic back pain from
   lumbar spine disorders.
   Objective. To evaluate the degree of interchangeability of a 100-mm
   visual analog scale (VAS) and a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) for
   the assessment of pain intensity.
   Summary of Background Data. The fact that VAS and Likert scales are
   highly intercorrelated does not mean that both types of scales can be
   used interchangeably.
   Methods. A total of 151 patients (mean age, 52 +/- 14.6 years)
   undergoing elective spine surgery completed a 100-mm VAS and a discrete
   5-category VRS corresponding to the first item question of the core set
   ({''}How severe was your back pain in the last week?{''}). Pain
   intensity on the VAS was rated using the same question than for the VRS.
   The level of order-consistency (monotonic agreement), disordered pairs
   (D), percentage of agreement, and systematic disagreement (relative
   position), and relative concentration ({[}RC]) were estimated. VAS
   assessments were transformed into a discrete 5-category, with the
   cut-off VAS positions being defined by quintiles and equidistantly.
   Results. For VAS defined equidistantly, monotonic agreement was 0.840, D
   was 0.080, and the percentage of identical pairs was 53\%. The
   corresponding figures for VAS defined by quintiles were 0.809, 0.096,
   and 27.8\%. Inconsistencies between the VAS and the VRS scales were also
   demonstrated by the marginal distributions, with PR values of -0.005
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], -0.011 to -0.002) and RC values of
   0.144 (95\% CI, 0.137-0.152) for VAS defined equidistantly, and PR
   values of 0.391 (95\% CI, 0.384-0.397) and RC values of 0.265 (95\% CI,
   0.255-0.275) for VAS defined by quintiles.
   Conclusion. The order-consistency level was low with overlapping of pain
   records between the 2 scales, indicating that VAS and VRS are not
   interchangeable and, therefore, a results obtained with the use of each
   scale cannot be compared.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of a decision aid (DA) on women's

   make an informed decision.
   Methods: An online randomized controlled trial among 321 women aged
   38-45 years was conducted. Participants were randomized to either
   immediate or delayed access to the online DA which (i) explained the
   benefits and harms, (ii) included a values clarification exercise and a
   worksheet to support decision making. The primary outcome, knowledge of
   benefits and harms of screening, and secondary outcomes, informed choice
   (composite of knowledge, values and intention), anxiety and
   acceptability of the DA were measured using online questionnaires.
   Results: Women in the intervention group were more knowledgeable (mean
   score out of 10, 7.35 vs 6.27, p < 0.001) and were more likely to have
   made a decision (82\% vs 61\% p < 0.001). Of those who made a decision,
   women in the intervention group were less likely to start screening now

   clear, and did not make women anxious.
   Conclusions: The DA increased knowledge and reduced indecision, without
   increasing feelings of anxiety.
   Practice Implications: This decision aid is easy to access online and
   could be an inexpensive way of supporting women aged 40 who are
   considering whether to start screening now, or wait until they are 50.
   The results of this study demonstrate the potential of DAs to help
   inform women about both the benefits and risks of screening at this age
   and to support women and clinicians in this decision making process. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: Respiration-gated irradiation for a moving target requires a
   longer time to deliver single fraction in proton radiotherapy (PRT).
   Ultrahigh dose rate (UDR) proton beam, which is 10-100 times higher than
   that is used in current clinical practice, has been investigated to
   deliver daily dose in single breath hold duration. The purpose of this
   study is to investigate the survival curve and relative biological
   effectiveness (RBE) of such an ultrahigh dose rate proton beam and their
   linear energy transfer (LET) dependence.
   Methods: HSG cells were irradiated by a spatially and temporally uniform
   proton beam at two different dose rates: 8 Gy/min (CDR, clinical dose
   rate) and 325 Gy/min (UDR, ultrahigh dose rate) at the Bragg peak and
   1.75 (CDR) and 114 Gy/min (UDR) at the plateau. To study LET dependence,
   the cells were positioned at the Bragg peak, where the absorbed
   dose-averaged LET was 3.19 keV/mu m, and at the plateau, where it was
   0.56 keV/mu m. After the cell exposure and colony assay, the measured
   data were fitted by the linear quadratic (LQ) model and the survival
   curves and RBE at 10\% survival were compared.
   Results: No significant difference was observed in the survival curves
   between the two proton dose rates. The ratio of the RBE for CDR/UDR was
   0.98 +/- 0.04 at the Bragg peak and 0.96 +/- 0.06 at the plateau. On the
   other hand, Bragg peak/plateau RBE ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for UDR and
   1.18 +/- 0.07 for CDR.
   Conclusions: Present RBE can be consistently used in treatment planning
   of PRT using ultrahigh dose rate radiation. Because a significant
   increase in RBE toward the Bragg peak was observed for both UDR and CDR,
   further evaluation of RBE enhancement toward the Bragg peak and beyond
   is required. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Journal = {{ICARUS}},

Volume = {{209}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{We extend previous work on the global tectonic patterns generated by
   despinning with a self-consistent treatment of the isotropic despinning
   contraction that has been ignored. We provide simple analytic
   approximations that quantify the effect of the isotropic despinning
   contraction on the global shape and tectonic pattern. The isotropic
   despinning contraction of Mercury is similar to 93 m (T/1 day)(-2),
   where T is the initial rotation period. If we take into account both the
   isotropic contraction and the degree-2 deformations associated with
   despinning, the preponderance of compressional tectonic features on
   Mercury's surface requires an additional isotropic contraction >= 1 km
   (T/1 day)(-2), presumably due to cooling of the interior and growth of
   the solid inner core. The isotropic despinning contraction of Iapetus is
   similar to 9 m (T/ 16 h)(-2), and it is not sensitive to the presence of
   a core or the thickness of the elastic lithosphere. The tectonic pattern
   expected for despinning, including the isotropic contraction, does not
   explain Iapetus' ridge. Furthermore, the ridge remains unexplained with
   the addition of any isotropic compressional stresses, including those
   generating by cooling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Skin barrier rupture is one of the main physiopathology
   elements in irritant contact dermatitis. Its treatment involves beside
   specific etiological and drug treatment the use of topical insulating
   creams with specific composition in order to restore and protect the
   damaged skin. Objectives. To assess the efficacy and tolerance of an
   ointment (BARIEDERM Ointment for Fissures, Cracks, Laboratoires
   Dermatologiques d'Uriage) based on non occlusive polymers, in a series
   of patients with occupational, chronic and fissured hands irritant
   contact dermatitis, in the construction and public works sectors.
   Methods. In this observational, descriptive and prospective study were
   included adult patients with the diagnosis of occupational chronic
   irritant contact dermatitis, of the hands with fissures. Investigating
   doctors were 16 specialists in occupational diseases practicing in
   Northern France. The ointment was applied on the affected areas of the
   hands minimum twice per day during 3 weeks, the clinical assessment was
   made at baseline and at week 3.
   Results. Seventy-one building workers with a mean age of 42 (19 63),
   with chronic irritant contact dermatitis of an average evolution (hand
   lesions) of 7 years were included. The professions were bricklayers
   (28\%), roofers (11.3\%), concrete shutters (9.9\%) and labourers
   (8.4\%), working in wet conditions (75\% of cases), in contact with
   cement (65\%). The specific ointment was applied twice per day for :17
   days on average. A daily protection by gloves was associated in 55\% of
   cases. A significant improvement of skin fissures and cracks was seen at
   week 3 compared to baseline (P < 0.001), with a dramatic improvement of
   symptoms (pruritus, pain) and reduction of functional impairment.
   ``Total clearance{''} or ``a very important improvement{''} was seen in
   72.7\% of cases.
   Conclusion. A non-occlusive polymer ointment used in a series of 72
   patients with chronic, fissured, irritant occupational contact
   dermatitis improved skin lesions in 72.7\% of cases. This ointment
   associated with glove protection represented a useful adjuvant treatment
   especially for the building workers population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Patients diagnosed in advanced stages of head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma often show limited response to chemotherapeutic agents.
   Recently, we reported the overexpression of 14-3-3 zeta protein in head
   and neck premalignant and cancer tissues using liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with isotopic labeling and
   revealed its significance as a prognostic marker using
   immunohistochemical analysis. In this study, we determined the potential
   of 14-3-3 zeta as a therapeutic target for head and neck cancer. Small
   interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting 14-3-3 zeta was used to downregulate
   its expression in head and neck cancer cells in culture. Cell cycle
   analysis showed that head and neck cancer cells transfected with siRNA
   targeting 14-3-3 zeta showed G(2)-M arrest. These siRNA transfectants
   also showed increased cell death on treatment with any one of the
   following chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil,
   paclitaxel, or doxorubicin in comparison with the no transfection
   controls. Flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide staining
   showed increased sub-G(0) fraction in siRNA-transfected cells treated
   with any of these chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting cell death; in
   addition, Annexin V staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay revealed increased
   apoptosis. Taken together, our results strongly showed that
   downregulation of 14-3-3 zeta expression may serve to improve the
   sensitivity of head and neck cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

Abstract = {{The N-end rule links the half-life of a protein to the identity of its
   N-terminal residue. Destabilizing N-terminal residues are recognized by
   E3 ubiquitin ligases, termed N-recognins. A conserved structural domain
   called the UBR box is responsible for their specificity. Here we report
   the crystal structures of the UBR boxes of the human N-recognins UBR1
   and UBR2, alone and in complex with an N-end rule peptide,
   Arg-Ile-Phe-Ser. These structures show that the UBR box adopts a
   previously undescribed fold stabilized through the binding of three zinc
   ions to form a binding pocket for type 1 N-degrons. NMR experiments
   reveal a preference for N-terminal arginine. Peptide binding is
   abrogated by N-terminal acetylation of the peptide or loss of the
   positive charge of the N-terminal residue. These results rationalize and
   refine the empirical rules for the classification of type 1 N-degrons.
   We also confirm that a missense mutation in UBR1 that is responsible for
   Johanson-Blizzard syndrome leads to UBR box unfolding and loss of
   function.}},

   Patients and Methods: DNA samples were obtained from 51 subjects with
   cholestasis of undefined etiology and surveyed for mutations in the
   genes SERPINA1, JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 by a high-throughput
   gene chip. Then, the sequence readouts for all 5 genes were analyzed for
   mutations and correlated with clinical phenotypes. Healthy subjects
   served as controls.
   Results: Sequence analysis of the genes identified 14 (or 27\%) subjects

   with disease phenotypes based on the type of mutation and/or biallelic
   involvement in the JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, or ABCB4 genes. These patients
   had no syndromic features and could not be differentiated by biochemical
   markers or histopathology. Among the remaining subjects, 10 (or similar
   to 20\%) had sequence variants in ATP8B1 or ABCB11 that involved only 1
   allele, 8 had variants not likely to be associated with disease
   phenotypes, and 19 had no variants that changed amino acid composition.
   Conclusions: Gene sequence analysis assigned a molecular diagnosis in
   27\% of subjects with idiopathic cholestasis based on the presence of
   variants likely to cause disease phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization scheme based on topology optimization for transient
   response of photonic crystal structures is developed. The system
   response is obtained by a finite-element time-domain analysis employing
   perfectly matched layers as an absorbing boundary condition. As an
   example a waveguide-side-coupled microcavity is designed. The
   gradient-based optimization technique is applied to redistribute the
   material inside the microcavity such that the Q factors of a monopole
   and a dipole mode are improved by 375\% and 285\%, respectively, while
   maintaining strong coupling. This is obtained by maximizing the stored
   energy inside the microcavity in the decaying regime of the transient
   response. Manufacturable designs are achieved by filtering techniques
   capable of controlling minimum length scales of the design features. (C)

Abstract = {{Poor governance and endemic corruption hamper the efforts of some

   the IMF and other IFIs (International Financial Institutions), as
   catalysts for private foreign investments. We demonstrate that the

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is to validate the four-dimensional structure of
   the Drinking Motive Questionnaire Revised Short Form (DMQ-R SF) in a
   sample of Italian adolescents and to investigate associations of these
   motives with frequency of alcohol use and sensation seeking. The data
   were gathered through self-administered questionnaires in classrooms.
   The questionnaires were filled out by a representative sample of 2725
   (56.4\% males; mean age = 16.2) 8th to 13th grade alcohol-using
   students. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models
   were applied. The four-dimensional structure of the DMQ-R SF was
   confirmed in the general sample and among subgroups defined by gender
   and age. Furthermore, enhancement, social and coping motives were found
   to be positively related to sensation seeking and frequency of alcohol
   use. Conformity motives were negatively related to sensation seeking and
   frequency of alcohol use. The results are consistent with previous
   studies from other countries and indicate that the DMQ-R SF is a valid
   instrument to assess drinking motives among Italian adolescents and
   possibly among those from other Mediterranean countries. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The problem of the long-term impact of historical fire on masonry is not
   clearly understood. Much research focuses on the damage that is caused
   by fire in isolation, and omits to investigate the subsequent
   exploitation of weaknesses inherited from fire events. Fire can, for
   example, cause significant physical, chemical and mineralogical change
   to sandstone, which may then be exploited by background environmental
   factors such as salt and freeze-thaw weathering. To explore this
   experimentally, blocks of Peakmoor Sandstone were subjected to a real
   fire (as well as lime rendering/removal and frost cycle pre-treatments),
   and their subsequent response to salt weathering cycles was monitored by
   weight loss and visual assessment of the pattern of surface damage.
   Results illustrate that the post-fire deterioration of sandstone is
   strongly conditioned by fracture networks and soot cover inherited from
   the fire. The exploitation of fractures can lead to spalling during salt
   weathering cycles this takes place as granular dissagregation steadily
   widens cracks and salts concentrate and crystallise in areas of
   inherited weakness. Soot cover can have a profound effect on subsequent
   performance. It reduces surface permeability and can be hydrophobic in
   character, limiting salt ingress and suppressing decay in the short
   term. However, as salt crystals concentrate under the soot crust,
   detachment of this layer can occur, exposing fire-damaged stone beneath.
   Understanding the subsequent exploitation of stone exposed to fire
   damage by background environmental factors (for example, salt
   weathering/temperature cycling) is key to the post-fire management of
   stone decay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Kracauer wrote that the film ``reduces the Revolution to a derivative of

   a politics: they are very much connected to the politics of class,

Abstract = {{Genetic variation was assessed in Atlantic wolffish, Anarhichas lupus,
   across the North Atlantic Ocean using microsatellite and amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Despite unusual life
   history attributes such as large benthic eggs, large larvae, a limited
   pelagic stage and relatively sedentary adults, which suggest potential
   for strong population structure, range-wide F-ST values were comparable
   to other marine fishes (< 0.035). Nevertheless, both significant genetic
   differentiation among regions and isolation by distance were observed,
   suggesting limited dispersal in this species. AFLP loci, evaluated on a
   subset of samples, revealed slightly higher F-ST values, but similar
   patterns of differentiation and isolation-by-distance estimates,
   compared to microsatellites. The genetic structure of Atlantic wolffish
   has likely been shaped by its post-glacial history of recolonization,
   North Atlantic current patterns and continuity of habitat on continental
   shelves.}},

Abstract = {{We present a high spatial resolution Ha survey of 23 cooling flow
   clusters using the Maryland Magellan Tunable Filter, covering 1-2 orders
   of magnitude in cooling rate, dM/dt, temperature, and entropy. We find
   that 8/23 (35\%) of our clusters have complex, filamentary morphologies
   at H alpha, while an additional 7/23 (30\%) have marginally extended or
   nuclear H alpha emission, in general agreement with previous studies of
   line emission in cooling flow cluster brightest cluster galaxies. A weak
   correlation between the integrated near-UV luminosity and the H alpha
   luminosity is also found for our complete sample with a large amount of
   scatter about the expected relation for photoionization by young stars.
   We detect H alpha emission out to the X-ray cooling radius, but no
   further, in several clusters and find a strong correlation between the H
   alpha luminosity contained in filaments and the X-ray cooling flow rate
   of the cluster, suggesting that the warm ionized gas is linked to the
   cooling flow. Furthermore, we detect a strong enhancement in the cooling
   properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) coincident with the H alpha
   emission, compared to the surrounding ICM at the same radius. While the
   filaments in a few clusters may be entrained by buoyant radio bubbles,
   in general, the radially infalling cooling flow model provides a better
   explanation for the observed trends. The correlation of the H alpha and
   X-ray properties suggests that conduction may be important in keeping
   the filaments ionized. The thinness of the filaments suggests that
   magnetic fields are an important part of channeling the gas and
   shielding it from the surrounding hot ICM.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing exerts differential effects on arterial stiffness and wave
   reflections. However, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on
   arterial stiffness and wave reflections and, particularly, how such
   effects are influenced by ageing has not been assessed within a single
   large population, covering a sufficiently wide age range. Therefore, we
   determined the extent to which age alters the impact of traditional
   cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and wave reflections.
   Aortic stiffness and wave reflections were assessed in 4421 individuals
   (age range 18 to 92 years). When treated as continuous variables, clinic
   systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures and glucose levels were
   independently associated with stiffness, and, with the exception of
   diastolic pressure, these associations were more marked in older
   individuals. In contrast, clinic systolic and diastolic pressures and
   smoking were independently associated with wave reflections, with
   stronger associations observed in younger individuals. The impact of
   traditional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and wave
   reflections is strongly dependent on age and is largely driven by blood
   pressure. Additional studies are required to assess the impact of these
   arterial measures on cardiovascular outcome within a single population.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Infants and children with chronic lung disease of
   prematurity (CLDP) are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality
   from respiratory viral infections. Exposure to respiratory viruses may
   be increased in the day care environment. The risk of respiratory
   morbidity from day care attendance in the CLDP population is unknown. We
   therefore sought to determine if day care attendance is a significant
   risk factor for increased respiratory morbidity and symptoms in infants
   and children with CLDP.
   METHODS: Between January 2008 and October 2009, parents of infants and
   children with CLDP were surveyed. Information on perinatal history,
   sociodemographic information, day care attendance, and indicators of
   respiratory morbidity, including emergency department (ED) visits,
   hospitalizations, systemic corticosteroid use, antibiotic use, and
   respiratory symptoms, was collected on children <3 years of age.
   Logistic regression models were constructed to examine associations
   between exposure to day care and respiratory morbidities.
   RESULTS: Data were collected from 111 patients with CLDP. The average
   gestational age was 26.2 +/- 2.0 weeks. Day care attendance was
   associated with significantly higher adjusted odds for ED visits (odds
   ratio {[}OR]: 3.74 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.41-9.91]; P <
   .008), systemic corticosteroid use (OR: 2.22 {[}CI: 1.10-4.49]; P <
   .026), antibiotic use (OR: 2.40 {[}CI: 1.08 -5.30]; P < .031), and days
   with trouble breathing (OR: 2.72 {[}CI: 1.30 -5.69]; P < .008). Although
   there was an increased OR for hospitalization (OR: 3.22 {[}CI:
   0.9710.72]; P < .057), this did not reach statistical significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that day care attendance is associated with
   increased respiratory morbidities in young children with CLDP.
   Physicians should consider screening for and educating caregivers about
   the risks of day care attendance by young children with CLDP. Pediatrics

Abstract = {{Laboratory accreditation is becoming increasingly accepted around the
   world as a means of identifying technically competent laboratories. The
   purpose of this research was to examine the level of preparedness of
   medical and non-medical laboratories for accreditation and investigate
   the challenges experienced by these laboratories in preparing for
   accreditation. A cross-sectional descriptive survey using close-ended,
   28-item(4 pages), self-administered questionnaire that captured
   management and technical information such as documentation, quality
   control aspects of ISO 15189:2007 and ISO 17025:2005 standards was
   carried out. The sample consisted of 29 laboratories: medical, 55.2\%
   and non-medical, 44.8\%. Eleven percent of the laboratories indicated
   that they would be applying for accreditation in less than 3 months.
   Approximately one-sixth (16.7\%) of non-medical laboratories were
   between 90 and 100\% prepared for accreditation compared to 6.3\% of
   medical laboratories. Barriers to accreditation were cost, 72.4\%; lack
   of motivation of staff, 34.5\%; unclear requirements and challenges with
   the interpretation and implementation of ISO 15189:2007 and ISO
   17025:2005 standards, 31.0\%; lack of support from management, 24.1\%;
   and absence of a quality manager, 20.7\%. Laboratories that employed
   quality managers had a greater preparation for accreditation index (34.1
   +/- A 7.7) compared to those who did not employ a quality manager (28.0
   +/- A 2.5, PAI t-test = -3.085, P = 0.006). The preparation for
   accreditation of most of the laboratories in Jamaica is at a
   satisfactory level. The barriers to accreditation highlight the need for
   a collective effort of management, technical staff and all stakeholders
   in addressing these issues to ensure that these laboratories are
   accredited.}},

Abstract = {{We present a second-order analytic solution to the nonlinear
   depth-integrated shallow water equations for free-surface oscillatory
   wind-driven flow in an idealized lake. Expressing the solution as an
   asymptotic expansion in the dimensionless wave amplitude (zeta/h), which
   is considered to be a small parameter, enables simplification of the
   governing equations and permits the use of a perturbation approach to
   solve them.
   This analytic solution provides a benchmark for testing numerical
   models. In particular, the main merit of this solution is that it
   accounts for advective effects, which are typically omitted from
   analytic solutions of two-dimensional free surface flow. In order to
   retain these effects in an analytic solution, we restrict our attention
   to forcing from a monochromatic wind stress, consider a constant depth
   rectangular lake, and simplify the governing equations by omitting the
   Coriolis and eddy viscosity terms and using a linearised friction
   factor. As such, the analytic solution is of limited use for considering
   real world problems. Due to the complexity of the analytic solution
   computer code for this solution is available online.
   Our solution is valid for cases where changes in the water surface level
   are small compared with the depth of the lake, and the advective terms
   in the momentum equations are small compared with acceleration terms. We
   examine the validity of these assumptions for three test cases, and
   compare the second-order analytic solution to numerical results to
   verify an existing hydrodynamic model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{From late December 2007 to February 2008, the number of adverse
   responses to heparin infusions rose noticeably above baseline levels in
   North America, ultimately resulting in a widespread recall of all
   heparin vial products made by Baxter Healthcare. Using various
   analytical techniques and the de novo synthesis of a fully sulfated
   chondroitin sulfate (FSCS) derivative, the authors have confirmed the
   identity of the contaminant as an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate
   (OSCS) and have also defined the heterogeneity and concentration of this
   contaminant in various lots of heparin. Using both contaminated heparin
   products and the synthetically produced derivative, the authors have
   shown that the OSCS produces a dose-dependent hypotension in both pigs
   and rats and that the response in rats can be abrogated with bradyzide,
   a rodent-selective B 2 bradykinin receptor antagonist. The no observed

Abstract = {{Four microsatellite markers and a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment
   were used to investigate two possible explanations for a reported
   decline in productivity of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) in
   Fiji: (i) a decline in genetic diversity (GD) and (ii) genetic
   introgression from feral tilapia populations. Genetic diversity was
   estimated using theta and allelic richness, while Bayesian clustering
   was used to assign individuals to genetic groups (K=2 or 3) to test for
   introgression. Differentiation among groups was estimated using F-ST
   analysis. Results indicate that genetic diversity had declined compared
   with a GIFT reference stock from WorldFish Centre, while there was
   little evidence for introgression from feral tilapia populations. Loss
   of genetic diversity most probably resulted from practices that have not
   actively managed genetic resources in the hatchery. While GIFT is
   considered to be an improved line of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis
   niloticus), mtDNA analysis here revealed haplotypes assigned previously
   to three discrete Oreochromis species (O. niloticus, Oreochromis
   mossambicus and Oreochromis aureus) in both the Fijian strain and the
   WorldFish Centre strain. Possible sources for the three divergent
   lineages are discussed. Results have implications for the management and
   future expansion of the tilapia culture industry in Fiji as well as in
   other Pacific island nations.}},

Abstract = {{We have compared the ability of a number of mu-opioid receptor (MOPr)
   ligands to activate G proteins with their abilities to induce MOPr
   phosphorylation, to promote association of arrestin-3 and to cause MOPr
   internalization. For a model of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
   activation where all agonists stabilize a single active conformation of
   the receptor, a close correlation between signaling outputs might be
   expected. Our results show that overall there is a very good correlation
   between efficacy for G protein activation and arrestin-3 recruitment,
   whereas a few agonists, in particular endomorphins 1 and 2, display
   apparent bias toward arrestin recruitment. The agonist-induced
   phosphorylation of MOPr at Ser(375), considered a key step in MOPr
   regulation, and agonist-induced internalization of MOPr were each found
   to correlate well with arrestin-3 recruitment. These data indicate that
   for the majority of MOPr agonists the ability to induce receptor
   phosphorylation, arrestin-3 recruitment, and internalization can be
   predicted from their ability as agonists to activate G proteins. For the
   prototypic MOPr agonist morphine, its relatively weak ability to induce
   MOPr internalization can be explained by its low agonist efficacy.}},

Title = {{Modelling economic impacts and adaptation to extreme events: Insights
   from European case studies}},
Journal = {{MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{737-762}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to climate change in Europe has only recently become a true
   policy concern with the management of extreme events one priority item.
   Irrespective of future climatic changes increasing the need for
   systematic evaluation and management of extremes, weather-related
   disasters already today pose substantial burdens for households,
   businesses and governments. Research in the ADAM project identified
   substantial direct risks in terms of potential crop and asset losses due
   to combined drought and heatwave, as well as flood hazards in Southern
   and Eastern Europe, respectively. This paper focuses on the indirect,
   medium to longer term economic risks triggered by the direct risks and
   mediated by policy responses. We present a selection of three economic
   impact and adaptation assessments and modelling studies undertaken on
   extreme event adaptation in Europe. Responding to a need for more
   economically based adaptation assessments, we address some relatively
   unresearched issues such as the understanding of past adaptation, the
   role of market response to impacts as well as government's ability to
   plan for and share out extreme event risks. The first analysis
   undertakes an empirical exploration of observed impacts and adaptation
   in the agricultural sector in the UK comparing the impact of consecutive
   extreme events over time in order to determine whether adaptation has
   occurred in the past and whether this can be used to inform future
   estimates of adaptation rates. We find that farmers and the agricultural
   sector clearly have adapted to extreme events over time, but whether
   this rate can be maintained into the future is unclear, as some
   autonomous adaptation enacted seemed rather easy to be taken. Markets
   may mediate or amplify impacts and in the second analysis, we use an
   economic general equilibrium model to assess the economic effects of a
   reduction in agricultural production due to drought and heatwave risk in
   exposed regions in Spain. The analysis suggests that modelled losses to
   the local economy are more serious in a large-scale scenario when
   neighbouring provinces are also affected by drought and heatwave events.
   This is due to the supply-side induced price increase leading to some
   passing on of disaster costs to consumers. The simulation highlights the
   importance of paying particular attention to the spatial and
   distributional effects weather extremes and possibly changes therein
   induced by climate change may incur. Finally, we discuss how national
   governments may better plan their disaster liabilities resulting from a
   need to manage relief and reconstruction activities post event. We do so
   using a risk based economic planning model assessing the fiscal
   consequences associated with the coping with natural extremes. We
   identify large weather-related disaster contingent liabilities,
   particularly in the key flood hot spot countries Austria, Romania, and
   Hungary. Such substantial disaster liabilities ({''}hidden disaster
   deficits{''}) when interacting with weak fiscal conditions may lead to
   substantial additional stress on government budgets and reduced fiscal
   space for funding other relevant public investment projects. Overall,
   our paper suggests the importance of respecting the specific spatial and
   temporal characteristics of extreme event risk when generating
   information on adaptation decisions.
   As our adaptation decisions considered, such as using sovereign risk
   financing instruments are associated with a rather short time horizon,
   the analysis largely focuses on the management of today's extreme events
   and does not discuss in detail projctions of risks into a future with
   climate change. Such projections raise important issues of uncertainty,
   which in some instances may actually render future projections
   non-robust, a constraint to be kept in mind when addressing longer term
   decisions, which at the same time should account for both climate and
   also socioeconomic change.}},

   The analysis shows that the suggested approach could be useful for
   architects to evaluate the degree to which each design variable
   contributes to the variability of the building energy performance.
   Besides, the results may be helpful to support policymakers during the
   elaboration of energy codes by providing adequate information for the

Abstract = {{In vivo and in vitro evidence from animals suggesting that gap junctions
   (GJs) play a role in the spreading of epileptiform activity. We have
   examined the influence of the gap junction opener trimethylamine (TMA)
   and the connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctional blocker, quinine, on
   epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in the rat
   entorhinal cortex (EC) and the CA1 hippocampal region. A cannula and
   surface electrodes were implanted into the brain to administer drugs and
   to monitor electrical activity. Injection of 4-AP (10 nmol) produced
   epileptiform discharge trains of high amplitude and frequency associated
   with seizure behavior rated between 0 and 3 in the Racine scale. In the
   presence of TMA (500 nmol), 4-AP produced distinct epileptiform patterns
   with continuous, long epileptiform discharges of high amplitude and
   frequency associated with seizure behavior of 0, 1,3 and 5 during the
   first 30 min post-drug administration that diminished after 90 min.
   Quinine injection (35 pmol) into the EC of seizing animals decreased the
   amplitude and frequency of the discharge trains in the EC and CA1
   regions, which were completely blocked after 34 min. Indeed, the seizure
   behavior of the animals was completely blocked in five of the six rats
   53.2 s after quinine administration. We suggest that the intensity of
   the proepileptic effect of TMA on epileptiform activity depends on the
   time and route of drug administration, and that neural Cx36-dependent
   G.'s are important structures in the generation of epileptiform
   activity, as well as in the seizure behavior induced by 4-AP. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this paper a non-iterative approach to identifying Wiener and
   Hammerstein models, including model structure and parameters, is
   proposed. A single symmetrical relay test is conducted to determine the
   structure and then the parameters of the block-oriented nonlinear model
   possessing a static nonlinearity and a linear process in cascade. The
   static nonlinearity block is represented by a memoryless and monotonic
   function and the linear process by a second order transfer function
   model. A relay with hysteresis induces the limit cycle output signal and
   one cycle data of the output signal is used to identify the
   block-oriented nonlinear model. The proposed identification method is
   simple and gives better performance than previous methods for processes
   with static nonlinearity. (C) 2010 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dynamic processes in gas turbine (GT) combustors play a key role in
   flame stabilization and extinction, combustion instabilities and
   pollutant formation, and present a challenge for experimental as well as
   numerical investigations. These phenomena were investigated in two gas
   turbine model combustors for premixed and partially premixed CH4/air
   swirl flames at atmospheric pressure. Optical access through large
   quartz windows enabled the application of laser Raman scattering, planar
   laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH, particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) at repetition rates up to 10 kHz and the simultaneous application
   of OH PLIF and PIV at a repetition rate of 5 kHz. Effects of unmixedness
   and reaction progress in lean premixed GT flames were revealed and
   quantified by Raman scattering. In a thermo-acoustically unstable flame,
   the cyclic variation in mixture fraction and its role for the feedback
   mechanism of the instability are addressed. In a partially premixed
   oscillating swirl flame, the cyclic variations of the heat release and
   the flow field were characterized by chemiluminescence imaging and PIV,
   respectively. Using phase-correlated Raman scattering measurements,
   significant phase-dependent variations of the mixture fraction and fuel
   distributions were revealed. The flame structures and the shape of the
   reaction zones were visualized by planar imaging of OH distribution. The
   simultaneous OH PLIF/PIV high-speed measurements revealed the time
   history of the flow field-flame interaction and demonstrated the
   development of a local flame extinction event. Further, the influence of
   a precessing vortex core on the flame topology and its dynamics is
   discussed.}},

Title = {{COMPLEX PATTERNS OF HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN EXOTIC AND NATIVE NORTH
   AMERICAN POPLAR SPECIES}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Poplars and their hybrids are seen as important
   candidates for bioenergy initiatives. However, many concerns have been
   raised about large-scale plantations of new poplar cultivars. The
   deployment of such plants with novel traits brings the risk of potential
   spread of novel genome regions (including exotic genes, transgenes, or
   other heritable modifications) into natural populations of related
   species. The possibility of introgression is especially high in poplars
   because reproductive barriers between species are weak. Knowledge of the
   frequency of hybridization between cultivated trees and natural
   populations is one important step in the risk-assessment process.
   Methods: We studied the rate of spontaneous hybridization from two
   sexually mature poplar plantations into adjacent natural populations of
   Populus deltoides and P. balsamifera. The two plantations, both in
   eastern Canada, contain many different complex hybrid clones with
   components from exotic species, mostly P. nigra, P. trichocarpa, and P.
   maximowiczii. We analyzed 12 species-specific single nucleotide
   polymorphisms from six different genes in 5373 offspring sampled from
   the natural populations.
   Results: Contributions from all three exotics were found in the
   offspring, confirming low reproductive barriers among poplar species in
   these sections. The frequency of hybrid offspring varied among pollen
   donors, recipient populations, and years.
   Conclusions: The remarkably high rate of hybridization that was found in
   the smallest natural population sampled suggests that small peripheral
   populations carry a higher risk of introgression. These results could be
   used as a starting point for developing regulatory guidelines for the
   introduction of plants with novel traits.}},

Abstract = {{This research was conducted to examine the growth profile, growth
   kinetics, and insulin-secretory responsiveness of BRIN-BD11 cells grown
   in optimized medium on different types of microcarriers (MCs).
   Comparisons were made on modified polystyrene (Hillex(A (R)) II) and
   crosslinked polystyrene Plastic Plus (PP) from Solohill Engineering. The
   cell line producing insulin was cultured in a 25 cm(2) T-flask as
   control while MCs based culture was implemented in a stirred tank
   bioreactor with 1 L working volume. For each culture type, the viable
   cell number, glucose, lactate, glutamate, and insulin concentrations
   were measured and compared. Maximum viable cell number was obtained at
   1.47 x 10(5) cell/mL for PP microcarrier (PPMCs) culture, 1.35 x 10(5)
   cell/mL Hillex(A (R)) II (HIIMCs) culture and 0.95 x 10(5) cell/mL for
   T-flask culture, respectively. The highest insulin concentration has
   been produced in PPMCs culture (5.31 mg/L) compared to HIIMCs culture
   (2.01 mg/L) and T-flask culture (1.99 mg/L). Therefore overall
   observation suggested that PPMCs was likely preferred to be used for
   BRIN-BD11 cell culture as compared with Hillex(A (R)) II MCs.}},

   resistivity zones, with values lower than or equal to 50 Omega.m, have
   been associated to contamination by leachate. Thus, it was possible to
   identify two directions for the contamination flows: (1) toward south,
   and (2) toward west. In the results of 2008, the contamination plume was
   more extensive and profound than in 1999. The vertical electrical
   soundings indicated the water table depth and the water flow directions,

Abstract = {{Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in
   wastewater and bioaccumulates in wild-caught fish, especially in brain,
   liver and muscle tissues. Previous studies indicated that FLX is
   pharmacologically active in fish species exerting anorexigenic effects,
   but it is not clear whether waterborne FLX has any potential effects on
   regulating food intake and energy metabolism. In this study, we
   investigated the effect of two doses of FLX, an environmental
   concentration of 540 ng/L, and 100-times this concentration (54 mu g/L),
   on feeding and key metabolic parameters in goldfish. Fish were exposed
   for a period of 28 days and changes in food intake and body mass were
   assessed. Pair-fed groups were maintained to discern primary FLX-induced
   effects from secondary metabolic responses induced by the decreased food
   intake. Additionally, an untreated control group and a fasted group were
   used to further compare physiological changes in the context of
   nutritional status of the animals. Significant decreases in food intake
   and weight gain were recorded in goldfish exposed to 54 mu g/L FLX.
   Furthermore a significant decrease occurred in circulating glucose
   levels in the group exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. To elucidate potential
   mechanisms, we investigated gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in
   the neuroendocrine brain of goldfish as well as gene expression and
   enzymatic activity of glycolytic and gluconeogenetic enzymes in liver
   and muscle tissues. The results confirm brain gene expression patterns
   in line with potential anorexigenic effects in the hypothalamus, with
   increased expression in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and
   decreased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY). With respect to glucose
   metabolism, liver gene expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase decreased and muscle hexokinase activity
   increased in fish exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Overall, this study
   demonstrated anorectic properties of FLX at a dose of 54 mu g/L FLX and
   moderate but significant effects on glucose metabolism in goldfish
   exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Future studies investigating the importance of
   these changes in fish are warranted. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although dyspnoea is the most common cause of admission for acute heart
   failure (AHF), more needs to be known about its clinical course and
   prognostic significance.
   The Pre-RELAX-AHF study randomized 232 subjects with AHF to placebo or
   four doses of relaxin and evaluated early (6-24 h Likert scale) and
   persistent {[}change in visual analogue scale area under the curve (VAS
   AUC) through Day 5] dyspnoea relief. Worsening heart failure (WHF) was
   defined as worsening AHF signs and symptoms requiring additional
   therapy. Patients were followed until Day 180. Early dyspnoea relief was
   observed in only 25\% of all patients, and VAS AUC at 5 days was 45\%
   over baseline values in all patients (32\% placebo; 50\% all
   relaxin-treated patients). Worsening heart failure to Day 5 was observed
   in 16\% of all patients (21\% placebo; 14\% relaxin). Lack of persistent
   dyspnoea relief and WHF were associated with a longer length of initial
   hospital stay and worse 60-day outcomes.
   Dyspnoea relief in patients admitted with AHF is often incomplete, and
   many may show WHF after the initial stabilization. Both lack of
   persistent dyspnoea relief and in-hospital WHF predict a longer length
   of stay and worse outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Epac (Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) is a sensor for cAMP
   and represents a novel mechanism for governing cAMP signalling. Epac is
   a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ras family of small
   GTPases, Rap. Previous studies demonstrated that, in response to a
   prolonged beta-adrenergic stimulation Epac induced cardiac myocyte
   hypertrophy. The aim of our study was to further characterize Epac
   downstream effectors involved in cardiac myocyte growth. Here, we found
   that Epac led to the activation of the small G protein H-Ras in primary
   neonatal cardiac myocytes. A Rap GTPase activating protein (RapGAP)
   partially inhibited Epac-induced H-Ras activation. Interestingly, we
   found that H-Ras activation involved the GEF domain of Epac. However,
   Epac did not directly induce exchange activity on this small GTPase
   protein. Instead, the effect of Epac on H-Ras activation was dependent
   on a signalling cascade involving phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol 1,3,5
   triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and an increase intracellular calcium. In
   addition, we found that Epac activation induced histone deacetylase type
   4 (HDAC4) translocation. Whereas HDAC5 alone was unresponsive to Epac,
   it became responsive to Epac in the presence of HDAC4 in COS cells.
   Consistent with its effect on HDAC cytoplasmic shuttle, Epac activation
   also increased the prohypertrophic transcription factor MEF2 in a CaMKII
   dependent manner in primary cardiac myocytes. Thus, our data show that
   Epac activates a prohypertrophic signalling pathway which involves PLC,
   H-Ras, CaMKII and HDAC nuclear export. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to present functional and anatomical results of
   pars plana vitrectomy without gas tamponade in lamellar macular holes.
   Additionally, the study determines factors influencing final outcome.
   Twenty-six eyes of 26 patients with lamellar macular hole were diagnosed
   using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT). The
   diameters of the lamellar defects were measured. Pars plana vitrectomy
   with epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal and internal limiting membrane
   (ILM) peeling without endotamponade followed. Follow-up examinations
   were conducted with SD- OCT for a period of 12 months after surgery. The
   following factors were examined: maximum and minimum diameter of the
   lamellar defect, maximum diameter of the disruption of the
   photoreceptors, representing the photoreceptor layer, central macular
   thickness, paracentral macular thickness 1000 A mu m from the centre of
   the fovea, and maximum paracentral retinal thickness. Retina thickness
   was measured manually from the inner retina surface to the upper line of
   retinal pigment epithelium.
   Prior to surgery, mean visual acuity was 0.2. Twelve months after
   surgery, the mean visual acuity was 0.51. Lower visual acuity was
   observed in patients with photoreceptor layer defects localized under
   the fovea. Epiretinal membranes and complete or partial posterior
   hyaloid detachment were observed in all cases. The size of the lamellar
   defect had no influence on final visual acuity.
   The results obtained show that intraocular gas tamponade is not a

Abstract = {{Objective: This study investigates the effects of Nd:YAG laser
   irradiation combined with different irrigation protocols on the marginal
   seal of root fillings. Background data: Limited information exists
   regarding the effects of morphologic changes to root canal (RC) walls
   after Nd: YAG laser irradiation after smear-layer removal with EDTA on
   the sealing ability of root fillings. Methods: The 75 root-filled teeth
   (5 x 15 teeth) were analyzed for through-and-through leakage by using
   capillary flow porometry (CFP). The RC cleaning procedure determined the
   assignment to a group: (1) irrigation with NaOCl 2.5\% and EDTA 17\% or
   standard protocol (SP), (2) SP + Nd: YAG lasing (dried RC), (3) NaOCl
   2.5\% + Nd: YAG lasing (dried RC), (4) SP + Nd: YAG lasing (wet RC), or
   (5) NaOCl 2.5\% + Nd: YAG lasing (wet RC). Groups 1r to 5r consisted of
   the same filled teeth with resected apices up to the most apical point
   of the preparation length. Resection was performed after the first CFP
   measurement. Roots were filled with cold lateral condensation. CFP was
   used to assess minimum, mean flow and maximum pore diameters after 48 h,
   and immediately after these measurements, including root resection.
   Statistics were performed by using nonparametric tests (p > 0.05). An
   additional three roots per group were submitted to SEM of the RC wall.
   Results: Through-and-through leakage was observed in all groups.
   Statistically significant differences were observed in maximum pore
   diameter: 1r > 3r, and 1r > 5r; in mean flow pore diameter: 1r > 2r, 2r
   < 4r (p < 0.05). Typical Nd: YAG glazing effects were observed when the
   smear layer was present and exposed to the laser fiber (i.e., in the
   groups without use of EDTA) or when the fiber tip made direct contact
   with a smear-layer free RC wall. Conclusions: The reduction in
   through-and-through leakage is significantly higher with the Nd: YAG
   laser as smear-layer modifier than when smear layer is removed with an
   EDTA rinsing solution.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{There are two major hypotheses regarding the etiology of anxiety and
   depression: the mono-amine hypothesis and the hypothesis of an abnormal
   stress response acting partly via reduced neurogenesis. Association
   studies have focused on genes involved in these processes, but with
   inconclusive results. This study investigated the effect of 45 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for serotonin
   receptors 1A, 1D, 2A, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), tryptophane
   hydroxylase type 2 (TPH2), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
   PlexinA2 and regulators of G-protein-coupled signaling (RGS) 2, 4, 16.
   Anxious depression (A/D) symptoms were assessed five times in 11 years
   in over 11 000 adults with 1504 subjects genotyped and at age 7, 10, 12
   and during adolescence in over 20 000 twins with 1078 subjects
   genotyped. In both cohorts, a longitudinal model with one latent factor
   loading on all A/D measures over time was analysed. The genetic
   association effect modeled at the level of this latent factor was 60\%
   and 70\% heritable in the children and adults, respectively, and
   explained around 50\% of the total phenotypic variance. Power analyses
   showed that the samples contained 80\% power to detect an effect
   explaining between 1.4\% and 3.6\% of the variance. However, no SNP
   showed a consistent effect on A/D. To conclude, this longitudinal study
   in children and adults found no association of SNPs in the serotonergic
   system or core regulators of neurogenesis with A/D. Overall, there has
   been no convincing evidence, so far, for a role of genetic variation in
   these pathways in the development of anxiety and depression.}},

Title = {{Expected Changes in Clinical Measures of Adiposity During Puberty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-366}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinicians use several measures to estimate adiposity. Body
   mass index (BMI), although not a measure of adiposity, is commonly used
   to define weight status. Percent body fat (\%BF) measures total body
   fatness, which is composed of central and peripheral fat, estimated by
   waist circumference (WC) and skinfold thickness, respectively. Abnormal
   increases in fat during puberty may reflect an increased risk of
   developing cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to
   establish the normal patterns of change in clinically relevant measures
   of adiposity.
   Purpose: To describe the normal patterns of change in clinical measures
   of adiposity during puberty.
   Design/Methods: Multilevel modeling and linear regression analyses of
   642 children in Project HeartBeat!, aged 8-18 years (non-black and
   black), who had assessments of BMI, \%BF, WC, sums of 2- and
   6-skinfolds, and pubertal stage (PS) triennially between 1991 and 1995.
   Results: In males, the normal pattern from PSI to PS5 is for \%BF to
   decrease, skinfold thickness to remain stable, and WC to increase.
   However, after adjusting for height, WC does not change. In females,
   \%BF remains stable from PS1 to PS5, whereas skinfold thickness
   increases. As in males waist-height ratio does not change, indicating
   that central adiposity does not normally increase during puberty.
   Although BMI increases in both genders and races from PSI to PS5, mean
   values at PS5 were well below 25 kg/m(2).
   Conclusions: During puberty, increase in \%BF is abnormal in females and
   even more so in males. Likewise, increase in waist-height ratio is also
   abnormal and may suggest an increased risk for adiposity-associated
   morbidity. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All

   impact on pain sensations during light exposure and erythema after PDT.
   The skin of 14 healthy volunteers was preteated with MNs. Equal amounts
   of creams containing 2\%, 8\% and 16\% (w/w) ALA and MAL were applied on
   1 cm(2) areas for 4 h. Additionally, 16\% ALA and MAL creams were
   applied for 24 h. Afterwards, PpIX fluorescence spectra were measured.
   Sixteen percent ALA and MAL spots were exposed to red light (632 nm, 77
   mW/cm(2)). Time for pain to occur was measured in seconds, and erythemal
   response was monitored up to 6 h after the end of the light exposure.
   Use of MNs increased the PpIX fluorescence after 4 h incubation time
   with 2\% and 8\% ALA or MAL, but not with 16\% ALA or MAL. Pretreatment
   with MNs did not increase the pain sensations during light exposure, nor
   did it influence erythema occurrence.
   MNs are a promising tool for improving the efficiency of topical PDT by
   improving the cutaneous delivery of ALA and MAL, without increase in
   side effects.}},

Abstract = {{Chaos theory and its applications are at the cutting edge of
   investigations in environmental sciences (e.g. Environmental Physics,
   Biometeorology and Atmospheric Sciences among many others). However, we
   still need to take advantage of some recent computational efforts for
   nonlinear investigations of empirical meteorological variables. The
   objectives of this work were (i) to quantify the nonlinear variability
   of observed time series of mean daily temperature and dewpoint records
   collected at Babolsar, Iran and (ii) to stimulate the use of recent
   computational tools for investigating environmental data. Positive
   Lyapunov exponents were found for both time series (lambda(max) = 0.0174
   and lambda(max) = 0.0169 for mean daily air temperature and dewpoint
   temperature, respectively). In addition, determinism tests showed that
   both time series masked strong determinist components (vertical
   bar(kappa) over right arrow vertical bar = 0.721 and vertical bar(kappa)
   over right arrow vertical bar = 0.693 for mean daily temperature and
   dewpoint, respectively). That nonlinear test could be of use in future
   research for making decisions in applying deterministic, stochastic or
   combinations of both models with climate data. There were found
   interesting evidences on the existence of empirical attractors in
   univariate climate time series as expressed by reconstructing both phase
   spaces. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal insulin-dependent diabetes has long been associated with
   congenital malformations. As other causes of mortality and morbidity
   have been eliminated or reduced, malformations have become increasingly
   prominent. Although there is not universal agreement, the great majority
   of investigators find a two- to threefold increase in malformations in
   infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. This increase is not seen
   in infants of gestational diabetics. It probably is not present in women
   whose diabetes can be controlled by diet or oral hypoglycemic agents.
   The risk does not appear to be primarily genetic since diabetic fathers
   do not have an increased number of malformed offspring. Most studies
   show a generalized increase in malformations involving multiple organ
   systems. Multiple malformations seem to be more common in diabetic than
   nondiabetic infants. Caudal regression has the strongest association
   with diabetes, occurring roughly 200 times more frequently in infants of
   diabetic mothers than in other infants. The teratogenic mechanism in
   diabetes is not known. Hyperglycemia may be important but human studies
   focusing on the period of organogenesis are lacking. Hypoglycemia has
   also been suggested based mainly on animal experiments. Insulin appears
   unlikely. Numerous other factors including vascular disease, hypoxia,
   ketone and amino acid abnormalities, glycosylation of proteins, or
   hormone imbalances could be teratogenic. None has been studied in
   sufficient detail to make a judgment. A large-scale prospective study is
   required to determine early fetal loss rates, correlate metabolic status
   during organogenesis with outcome, and assess the effect of diabetic
   control on malformation rates.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: With rising consumer awareness of obesity, the food industry
   has a market-driven impetus to develop low-fat or fat-free foods with
   acceptable taste and texture. Fancy buckwheat flour was thus subjected
   to steam jet-cooking and the performance of the resulting product in
   cake-baking was evaluated as a fat replacer.
   RESULTS: Steam jet-cooking caused structural breakdown and starch
   gelatinization of buckwheat flour, thus increasing its water hydration
   properties. In the pasting measurements, steam jet-cooked buckwheat
   flour exhibited high initial viscosity, while no peak viscosity was
   observed. Also, the suspensions of steam jet-cooked buckwheat flour
   exhibited shear-thinning behaviors, which were well characterized by the
   power law model. When shortening in cakes was replaced with steam
   jet-cooked buckwheat gels, the specific gravity of cake batters
   significantly increased, consequently affecting cake volume after
   baking. However, shortening replacement with steam jet-cooked buckwheat
   up to 20\% by weight appeared to be effective in producing cakes as soft
   as the control without volume loss.
   CONCLUSION: When buckwheat flour was thermomechanically modified by
   steam jet-cooking, it was successfully incorporated into cake
   formulations for shortening up to 20\% by weight, producing low-fat
   cakes with comparable volume and textural properties to the control. (C)

Abstract = {{Coxiella burnetii is the bacterial agent of Q fever in humans. Acute Q
   fever generally manifests as a flu-like illness and is typically
   self-resolving. In contrast, chronic Q fever usually presents with
   endocarditis and is often life-threatening without appropriate
   antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, available options for the
   successful treatment of chronic Q fever are both limited and protracted
   (>18 months). Pentamidine, an RNA splice inhibitor used to treat fungal
   and protozoal infections, was shown to reduce intracellular growth of
   Coxiella by ca. 73\% at a concentration of 1 mu M (ca. 0.6 mu g/mL)
   compared with untreated controls, with no detectable toxic effects on
   host cells. Bacterial targets of pentamidine include Cbu.L1917 and
   Cbu.L1951, two group I introns that disrupt the 23S rRNA gene of
   Coxiella, as demonstrated by the drug's ability to inhibit intron RNA
   splicing in vitro. Since both introns are highly conserved amongst all
   eight genotypes of the pathogen, pentamidine is predicted to be
   efficacious against numerous strains of C. burnetii. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report describing antibacterial activity for this
   antifungal/antiprotozoal agent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and the

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to determine the effects of manufacturer
   pre-frying in olive and sunflower oil, as well as domestic cooking
   methods (deep-frying in olive and sunflower oil and baking) on the
   proximate compositions and fatty acid profiles of tuna pasties and ham
   nuggets. The pre-frying processes reduced moisture and carbohydrates and
   increased ash, fat and protein content in both pre-fried products.
   During cooking, the frying processes caused a reduction in moisture
   content and an increase in fat content in relation to pre-fried samples,
   while baking did not modify the proximate composition. The fatty acid
   profiles of products during both the pre-frying and frying processes
   became similar to those of the culinary fat used. Thus, the frying
   processes reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and
   increased the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in the
   foods when olive oil was used. whereas increased the proportion of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in products fried in sunflower oil.
   The fatty acid profiles of fried samples tended to be more similar to
   the frying fat than to the pre-frying fat, whereas the fatty acid
   profiles identified during the pre-frying process for baked products
   were not significantly modified. Thus, samples pre-fried in olive oil
   and subsequently baked showed the best proportion of fat content and
   PUFA/SFA, MUFA + PUFA/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios of the tested products. (C)

Abstract = {{Polymer based carbon aerogels were prepared by synthesis of a resorcinol
   formaldehyde gel followed by pyrolysis at 1073 K under Ar and activation
   of the resultant carbon under CO2 at different temperatures. The
   prepared carbon aerogels were used as active materials in the
   preparation of cathode electrodes for lithium oxygen cells and the
   electrochemical performance of the cells was evaluated by galvanostatic
   charge/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance measurements. It
   was shown that the storage capacity and discharge voltage of a Li/O-2
   cell strongly depend on the porous structure of the carbon used in
   cathode. EIS results also showed that the shape and value of the
   resistance in the impedance spectrum of a Li/O-2 cell are strongly
   affected by the porosity of carbon used in the cathode. Porosity changes
   due to the build up of discharge products hinder the oxygen and lithium
   ion transfer into the electrode, resulting in a gradual increase in the
   cell impedance with cycling. The discharge capacity and cycle life of
   the battery decrease significantly as its internal resistance increases
   with charge/discharge cycling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   telescope measurements for estimation of atmospheric transparency is
   demonstrated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations and experimental
   data. The Monte Carlo simulations are carried out with CORSIKA code
   assuming FLUKA and QCSJET II hadron interaction models. Experimental
   data from Cherenkov telescope are presented. Several physical mechanisms
   related to the influence of cosmic rays on the cloud cover,

Abstract = {{Protein folding is at least a six decade old problem, since the times of
   Pauling and Anfinsen. However, rules of protein folding remain elusive
   till date. In this work, rigorous analyses of several thousand crystal
   structures of folded proteins reveal a surprisingly simple unifying
   principle of backbone organization in protein folding. We find that
   protein folding is a direct consequence of a narrow band of
   stoichiometric occurrences of amino-acids in primary sequences.
   regardless of the size and the fold of a protein. We observe that
   ``preferential interactions{''} between amino-acids do not drive protein
   folding, contrary to all prevalent views. We dedicate our discovery to
   the seminal contribution of Chargaff which was one of the major keys to
   elucidation of the stoichiometry-driven spatially organized double
   helical structure of DNA.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated production of radical oxygen species (ROS) in sorus
   development of sporophyte discs and during zoospore germination of
   Saccharina japonica (Phaeophyceae) using the fluorescent dye
   2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Quantitative analysis of
   ROS showed high intracellular production during the stages of
   zoosporangium formation when paraphyses elongated. In this stage,
   remarkable ROS release was observed. ROS production was also observed
   histologically (under a fluorescence microscope) in the elongating
   paraphyses and the sorus zoosporangia. The sorus had significantly
   higher phenol content, antioxidant capacity and ROS scavenging enzyme
   activities (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase and
   superoxide dismutase) than adjacent non-sorus blade sectors. Thus,
   intracellular ROS scavenging mechanisms are active during ROS production
   in sorus formation. In contrast, iodine content was lower in the sorus
   than in the adjacent non-sorus tissues, suggesting the existence of an
   antioxidant defense mechanism based on iodine efflux. We demonstrated
   that ROS production is an important phenomenon in the reproduction of
   the S. japonica sporophyte. Furthermore, ROS were also observed in the
   zoospore germination processes. We discuss the physiological and
   ecological roles of ROS production in sorus formation and zoospore
   germination.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine the rate and nature of complaints and the
   outcomes of the complaint management at a large heart centre in Tehran.
   Design A retrospective review of all verbal and written complaints
   recorded over 30 months.
   Setting A large heart centre in Tehran, Iran.
   Population All 312 105 admissions (47 041 inpatients, 138 842
   outpatients and 126 222 ambulatory services) between July 2005 and
   January 2007 at Tehran Heart Centre, during which the hospital received
   1642 verbal and written complaints.
   Main outcome measures Proportion of admissions with verbal and written
   complaints, type of complaints and outcomes of the complaint management.
   Results A total of 1642 (5.2 per 1000) complaints were received, of
   which 1457 (4.64 per 1000) were verbal, and 185 (0.56 per 1000) were in
   written format. 34.7\% of the complaints were related to admission
   procedures, followed by 34.1\% communication, 13.8\% waiting time, 6.8\%
   delay and 4.1\% ignoring the standards of clinical care. Over 90\% of
   complaints were resolved by explanation or verbal apology, 2.1\% of them
   led to a change in the process or procedure, and 4.8\% were deemed
   disapproved claims.
   Conclusions The majority of patient complaints in Tehran Heart Centre
   are related to admission procedures or communication; most of them are
   verbal and resolved in the early stage as an explanation or apology. The
   hospital complaint management system has the potential to resolve the
   majority of such complaints in an early stage.}},

Abstract = {{Despite concerted efforts to improve the quality of care provided in the
   intensive care unit, inconsistency continues to characterize physician
   decision making. The resulting variations in care compromise outcomes
   and impose unnecessary decisional regret on clinicians and patients
   alike. Critical care is not the only arena where decisions fail to
   conform to the dictates of logic. Behavioral psychology uses scientific
   methods to analyze the influence of social, cognitive, and emotional
   factors on decisions. The overarching hypothesis underlying this
   ``thought outside the box{''} is that the application of behavioral
   psychology to physician decision making in the intensive care unit will
   demonstrate the existence of cognitive biases associated with classic
   intensive care unit decisions; provide insight into novel strategies to
   train intensive care unit clinicians to better use data; and improve the
   quality of decision making in the intensive care unit as characterized
   by more consistent, patient-centered decisions with reduced decisional
   regret and work-related stress experienced by physicians. (Crit Care Med

Abstract = {{Raised blood pressure (BP) response during exercise independently
   predicts future hypertension. Subjects with higher BP in childhood also
   have elevated BP later in life. Therefore, the factors related to the
   regulation of exercise BP in children needs to be well understood. We
   hypothesized that physiological cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
   factors would influence BP response during exercise in children and
   adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study of 439 Danish third-grade
   children and 364 ninth-grade adolescents. Systolic blood pressure (SBP)
   was measured with sphygmomanometer during a maximal aerobic fitness
   test. Examined CVD risk factors were high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, homeostasis
   model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score, body mass
   index (BMI), waist circumference, and aerobic fitness. A random effect
   model was used to test the hypotheses. In boys, HOMA-IR score and BMI
   were positively related to SBP response during exercise (beta = 1.03, P
   = 0.001, and beta = 0.58, P = 0.017, respectively). The effects sizes of
   HOMA-IR score and BMI and the significance levels only changed slightly
   (beta = 0.91, P = 0.004, and beta = 0.43, P = 0.08, respectively) when
   the two variables were added in the same model. A significant positive
   association was observed between aerobic fitness and SBP response in
   girls (beta = 3.13 and P = 0.002). HOMA-IR score and BMI were found to
   be positively related to the SBP response in male children and youth. At
   least partly, adiposity and insulin sensitivity seem to influence
   exercise SBP through different mechanisms. The positive relationship
   observed between aerobic fitness and SBP response in girls remains
   unexplainable for us, although post hoc analyses revealed that it was
   the case in the ninth graders only.}},

   virologically. West Nile virus strains have been isolated from blood
   samples of one horse and one donkey and from pools of brain, kidneys,
   heart and spleen of a pigeon and three magpies. When compared to the
   strain isolated during the 1998 Tuscany outbreak, the 255 bp sequence of

Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that in the sheep fetus, long-term hypoxia (LTH)
   resulted in elevated basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone
   (ACTH(1-39)) whereas the cortisol levels were not different from
   normoxic controls. We also showed that LTH enhances endothelial nitric
   oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the fetal adrenal. This study was
   designed to determine the effect of NO on cortisol production in
   adrenocortical cells from LTH fetal sheep. Ewes were maintained at high
   altitude (3820 m) from similar to 40 days' gestation (dG) to near term.
   Between 138 and 141 dG, fetal adrenal glands were collected from LTH and
   age-matched normoxic control fetuses. Adrenal cortical cells were
   pretreated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), nitro-L-arginine methyl
   ester (L-NAME), L-arginine, or diethyleneamine NO (DETA-NO) and then
   challenged with 10 nmol/L ACTH. Cortisol responses were compared after 1
   hour. Adrenocorticotropic hormone -induced cortisol secretion was
   significantly higher in LTH versus control (P < .01). Enhancement of NO
   with L-arginine resulted in a significant reduction of ACTH-mediated
   cortisol production in the LTH group. DETA-NO also caused a significant
   decrease in ACTH-mediated cortisol production (P < .05). Inhibition of
   NOS with L-NAME significantly increased cortisol production in the LTH
   group (P < .05 compared to ACTH alone), whereas the effect on the
   control group was not significant. Nitric oxide synthase activity was
   significantly higher in the LTH group compared to control, but this
   difference was eliminated following ACTH treatment. These data indicate
   that LTH enhances adrenal cortical sensitivity to the inhibitory effects
   of NO on cortisol production. Nitric oxide may, therefore, play an
   important role in regulating ACTH-induced cortisol production in the LTH
   fetal adrenal.}},

Abstract = {{Elovl4 is a fatty acyl elongase that participates in the biosynthesis of
   very long-chain fatty acids (>= C24), which are relatively abundant in
   skin (saturated chains), or retina, brain and testes (polyunsaturated
   chains) of mammals. In the present study we characterised two Elovl4
   proteins, Elovl4a and Elovl4b, from zebrafish Danio rerio, and
   investigated their expression patterns during embryonic development.
   Heterologous expression in baker's yeast showed that both zebrafish
   Elovl4 proteins efficiently elongated saturated fatty acids up to C36,
   with 26:0 appearing the preferred substrate as reported for human
   ELOVL4. Interestingly, activity for the elongation of PUFA substrates
   was only shown by Elovl4b, which effectively converted eicosapentaenoic
   (20:5n-3) and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids to elongated polyenoic
   products up to C36. Furthermore, zebrafish Elovl4b may be involved in
   the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) as it had the
   capacity to elongate 22:5n-3 to 24:5n-3 which can be subsequently
   desaturated and chain shortened to DHA in peroxisomes. The distinct
   functional roles of zebrafish Elovl4 proteins were also reflected in
   their spatial-temporal expression patterns during ontogeny. Analyses by
   whole-mount in situ hybridisation in zebrafish embryos showed that
   elovI4a was expressed in neuronal tissues (wide-spread distribution in
   the head area), with elovl4b specifically expressed in epiphysis (pineal
   gland) and photoreceptor cells in the retina. Similarly, tissue
   distribution in adults revealed that elovI4a transcripts were found in
   most tissues analysed, whereas elovl4b expression was essentially
   restricted to eye and gonads. Overall, the results suggest that
   zebrafish elovl4b resembles other mammalian orthologues in terms of
   function and expression patterns, whereas elovI4a may represent an
   alternative elongase not previously described in vertebrates. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{P>We present the results of coupled analogue and numerical models that
   provide new insights into the relationships between volcanoes and
   thrusts. The effects of both upper-crustal magma chambers and the load
   of volcanoes on the geometry of thrust systems were investigated.
   Analogue modelling points to a strong influence exerted by a magma
   chamber on thrust geometry, which, as suggested by the numerical models
   used to rationalize these results, is related to the stress
   redistribution around the weak heterogeneity. The low-viscosity body
   below a volcanic edifice localizes compressional deformation and causes
   a curvature of the thrusts towards the magma chamber, opposite to the
   direction of tectonic transport. In these conditions, the volcanic load
   has a negligible effect on the structural geometry. These results are in
   contrast with those of previous studies, where intrusions or the load of
   major volcanoes generated a curvature of the thrusts away from volcanic
   edifices in the direction of tectonic transport.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare hemodynamic effects in dogs anesthetized with
   remifentanil-isoflurane and with isoflurane alone.
   Animals-6 adult dogs.
   Procedures-Mechanically ventilated, isoflurane-anesthetized dogs
   received increasing constant rate infusions (CRIs) of remifentanil
   (0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 0.90 pg/kg/min) or physiologic saline (0.9\%
   NaCI) solution (control treatment), with a 1-week washout interval
   between treatments. Each CR I of remifentanil or saline solution was
   maintained for 60 minutes with equipotent end-tidal isoflurane
   concentrations that corresponded to 1.3 times the minimum alveolar
   concentration. Hemodynamic measurements and plasma vasopressin
   concentrations were determined before and at the end of each CRI and 60
   minutes after the end of the infusion regimen.
   Results-Compared with the control treatment, remifentanil CRIs
   significantly decreased heart rate (HR) and cardiac index (Cl) and
   significantly increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and
   plasma vasopressin concentration. Greatest differences in mean values
   between treatments were recorded for remifentanil at 0.60 pg/kg/min (HR
   and Cl were 55\% and 47\% lower, respectively, and SVRI was 91\% higher
   than for the control treatment). Mean arterial pressure increased
   significantly during the highest remifentanil CRI (9\% higher than for
   the control treatment). The increase in vascular resistance was
   positively correlated with increases in vasopressin concentrations
   (coefficient of determination, 0.65) during anesthesia with
   remifentanil-isoflurane.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Anesthesia maintained with
   remifentanil-isoflurane may decrease tissue perfusion as a result of a
   decrease in Cl. However, hypotension may not develop because of systemic
   vasoconstriction. An increase in plasma vasopressin concentration was
   associated with the vasoconstriction observed in dogs anesthetized with
   remifentanil-isoflurane. (Am J Vet Res 2010;71:1133-1141)}},

Abstract = {{Braced tubes are efficient structural systems for tall buildings and
   have been continuously used for major tall buildings since their
   emergence in the late 1960s. This paper presents a stiffness-based
   design methodology for determining preliminary member sizes of braced
   tubes for tall buildings. The methodology is applied to a set of
   buildings ranging from 40 to 80 stories tall, and parameters for the
   most economic design in terms of material usage are generated for
   representative design loadings. The impact of different geometric
   configurations of the structural members on the economic design is also
   discussed, and recommendations for the optimal geometries are made. The
   stiffness-based methodology, with a less iterative process, is very
   efficient for the preliminary design of braced tube structures, and will
   contribute to constructing built environments using minimum amounts of
   resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive surgical techniques have grown in prominence in
   humans and this trend is continuing in veterinary surgery, although the
   uptake of many procedures has been slower and the overall number of

   faster patient recovery and better visualisation due to magnification
   and closer access, all of which have already been seen following the use
   of arthroscopy for the management of joint disorders in horses and dogs.
   This article outlines the equipment needed for minimally invasive soft
   tissue surgery and describes the use of laparoscopy for a number of

   significantly heritable in males only (heritability of 60\% and 65\%

Abstract = {{A merged, high-quality waveform dataset from different seismic networks
   has been used to improve our understanding of lateral seismic
   attenuation for Northern Italy. In a previous study on the same region,
   Morasca et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 98: 1936-1946, 2008) were able to
   resolve only a small area due to limited data coverage. For this reason,
   the interpretation of the attenuation anomalies was difficult given the
   complexity of the region and the poor resolution of the available data.
   In order to better understand the lateral changes in the crustal
   structure and thickness of this region, we selected 770 earthquakes
   recorded by 54 stations for a total of almost 16,000 waveforms derived
   from seismic networks operating totally or partially in Northern Italy.
   Direct S-wave and coda attenuation images were obtained using an
   amplitude ratio technique that eliminates source terms from the
   formulation. Both direct and early-coda amplitudes are used as input for
   the inversions, and the results are compared. Results were obtained for
   various frequency bands ranging between 0.3 and 25.0 Hz and in all cases
   show significant improvement with respect to the previous study since
   the resolved area has been extended and more crossing paths have been
   used to image smaller scale anomalies. Quality-factor estimates are
   consistent with the regional tectonic structure exhibiting a general
   trend of low attenuation under the Po Plain basin and higher values for
   the Western Alps and Northern Apennines. The interpretation of the
   results for the Eastern Alps is not simple, possibly because our
   resolution for this area is still not adequate to resolve small-scale
   structures.}},

   and kinetics of phosphorus in tissues obtained by the isotopic dilution
   technique were used for development of the two models. The models
   presented similarity and efficiency in the determination of the
   estimates of the phosphorus flow in the anatomical compartments. Simple

Abstract = {{Maintenance of adequate nutrition is an integral component of the cancer
   treatment process. Numerous factors should be considered when evaluating
   the nutritional status of patients with cancer. A systematic review of
   the literature revealed the importance of nutrition interventions in
   patients with cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. Counseling in
   nutrition has been shown to improve quality of life, strengthen response
   to therapy, and increase survival. Lung cancer presents a significant
   risk as the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the
   United States. In addition, nutritional deficiencies are experienced by
   most adults with lung cancer during the course of their disease and
   treatment. The deficiencies compound the cost of treatment and also
   increase morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Further
   study of nutritional interventions is needed to promote better outcomes
   and quality of life in patients with lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of negative multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
   double-blind clinical trials in patients with critical illness, the last
   decade witnessed the publication of a series of studies demonstrating an
   improved outcome for a variety of interventions. These positive studies
   and interventions have subsequently been brought together into
   ``bundles{''} of care. This rush to change clinicians' practice has
   often been with little regard for the context in which the evidence was
   generated and the problems created by the difference between efficacy
   and effectiveness. This methodology created a bypass mechanism through
   which implementation of a package of interventions could be fast-tracked
   to a much larger group of critically ill patients that differ
   significantly from those in whom the evidence was generated, without
   being validated as a bundle. The risk of this process is that the bundle
   tools will be used for issues such as quality control, performance
   evaluation, and legal and regulatory purposes without the necessary
   background of robust validation studies. This has resulted in a
   ``two-weight, two-measures{''} situation that needs to be resolved to
   avoid the risk of taking interventions completely out of the context in
   which the positive results were generated and putting patients and
   professionals at risk of being harmed by the package of interventions.

   mechanisms. More freedom in contractual conditions between insurers and
   providers and a clearer distinction of responsibilities between federal

   efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency. The focus of this paper is
   an analysis of the effects of market reforms and NPM mechanisms

Abstract = {{High bone mineral density (BMD) is currently not defined by the
   International Society for Clinical Densitometry with a specific Z-score
   cutoff; however, it has been suggested that a Z-score greater than or
   equal to 2.5 is not normal. Institutional Review Board approval was
   obtained. We evaluated a University dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
   database over the previous 24 mo to define Z-score distributions. A
   Z-score greater than or equal to 2.5 was selected as the outcome event
   of interest in a logistic regression for adjusted odds ratio. The
   covariates were height; weight; body mass index (BMI); gender;
   menopausal status; use of female hormones; presence of insufficiency
   fractures after 50 yr of age; previous fractures; previous surgeries
   (back surgeries, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty); transplant history;
   presence of long-term chronic conditions (asthma, lupus, rheumatoid
   arthritis, or cystic fibrosis); eating disorder; current use of
   glucocorticoids; smoking status; and current and past use of
   osteoporosis pharmacological therapies. The study included a total of
   8216 patients; 7212 (87.8\%) were females, and 1044 (12.2\%) were males.
   In the total population, 13.6\% had a Z-score greater than or equal to
   2.5 at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip. Only 0.2\% of the
   males and 0.8\% of the females had a Z-score greater than or equal to
   2.5 at all 3 sites. The 97.5th percentiles for Z-scores in our
   population for men and women, respectively, were 3.4 and 3.9 at the
   lumbar spine, 1.5 and 2.1 at the femoral neck, and 1.6 and 2.2 at the
   total hip. The 99th percentile for Z-scores for men and women,
   respectively, were 4.9 and 4.7 at the lumbar spine, 2.4 and 2.7 at the
   femoral neck, and 2.2 and 2.7 at the total hip. At the lumbar spine,
   female gender and weight were found to be risk factors for a high
   Z-score (>= 2.5). The use of glucocorticoids, bone-active medications,
   BMI, and smoking were significantly less likely to predict a lumbar
   spine Z-score greater than or equal to 2.5. A high total-hip Z-score is
   predicted by increasing weight, whereas those patients using bone-active
   medications were less likely to have high BMD at the total hip. At the
   femoral neck, there were no significant risk factors related to a
   Z-score greater than or equal to 2.5; those taking bone-active
   medications were significantly less likely to have a high Z-score. These
   data suggest that a high Z-score is common at 1 or more sites. Further
   research about the criteria for the diagnosis of high BMD is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Mrp systems are widely distributed and structurally complex
   cation/proton antiporters. Antiport activity requires hetero-oligomeric
   complexes of all six or seven hydrophobic Mrp proteins (MrpA-MrpG).
   Here, a panel of site-directed mutants in conserved or proposed motif
   residues was made in the Mrp Na+(Li+)/H+ antiporter from an alkaliphilic
   Bacillus. The mutant operons were expressed in antiporter-deficient
   Escherichia coli KNabc and assessed for antiport properties, support of
   sodium resistance, membrane levels of each Mrp protein, and presence of
   monomeric and dimeric Mrp complexes. Antiport did not depend on a VFF
   motif or a conserved tyrosine pair, but a role for a conserved histidine
   in a potential quinone binding site of MrpA was supported. The
   importance of several acidic residues for antiport was confirmed, and
   the importance of additional residues was demonstrated (e. g. three
   lysine residues conserved across MrpA, MrpD, and membrane-bound
   respiratory Complex I subunits (NuoL/M/N)). The results extended
   indications that MrpE is required for normal membrane levels of other
   Mrp proteins and for complex formation. Moreover, mutations in several
   other Mrp proteins lead to greatly reduced membrane levels of MrpE.
   Thus, changes in either of the two Mrp modules, MrpA-MrpD and MrpE-MrpG,
   influence the other. Two mutants, MrpB-P37G and MrpC-Q70A, showed a
   normal phenotype but lacked the MrpA-MrpG monomeric complex while
   retaining the dimeric hetero-oligomeric complex. Finally, MrpG-P81A and
   MrpG-P81G mutants exhibited no antiport activity but supported sodium
   resistance and a low {[}Na+](in). Such mutants could be used to screen
   hypothesized but uncharacterized sodium efflux functions of Mrp apart
   from Na+(Li+)/H+ antiport.}},

Abstract = {{Intravenous injection of amiodarone, a class III anti-arrhythmic is
   widely used for persistent refractory arrhythmias. We present a case
   report suggesting the efficacy of amiodarone in refractory ventricular
   fibrillation (Vf) during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A
   66-year-old woman with hypertension had a medical examination as a
   result of an episode of palpitations and syncope. Echocardiography and
   an invasive hemodynamic study revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) with
   left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy because of calcified degeneration in a
   congenital bicuspid aortic valve (AV). Aortic valve replacement (AVR)
   was scheduled under general anesthesia and CPB. Intraoperative diagnosis
   was AS with calcified AV, LV hypertrophy, and aneurysm of ascending
   aorta (Ao). AVR with a biological valve, artificial vessel replacement
   of ascending Ao, and excision of the outflow myocardial septum were
   performed under CPB with intermittent antegrade blood cardioplegia at a
   body temperature (BT) of 24A degrees C. The patient suffered from Vf at
   a BT of 35.3A degrees C. Vf was not responsive to lidocaine 100 mg and
   10 direct current (DC) shocks. After continuous intravenous infusion of
   amiodarone 225 mg/h for 10 min and a single intravenous injection of
   amiodarone 150 mg followed by a single DC shock, she returned to normal
   sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm was maintained by continuous intravenous
   infusion of amiodarone 60 mg/h. Total CPB time was 5 h 43 min. Aortic
   cross-clamping time was 3 h 50 min. Administration of amiodarone is
   effective for refractory Vf resistant to lidocaine and cardioversion
   during weaning from CPB in cardiac surgery for heart diseases with LV
   hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Castration effect: T-0: steers; T-1: bulls and T-2: pseudo
   cryptorchidism) in crossbred commercial cattle was evaluated on
   physical-chemical composition and sensory traits in samples of
   Longissimus lumborum muscle of 50 crossbred animals with 368 +/- 15 kg
   of initial body weight. Variables evaluated were: meat texture (cooked
   and uncooked), and proximal composition (moisture, protein, ash and
   total lipids). Sensory evaluations were analyzed with white light (total
   appearance and color) and red light (flavor intensity, odor, connective
   tissue amount, and juiciness). Data were analyzed by GLM procedure of
   SAS. No differences (P>0.05) were observed in moisture, ash, and total
   lipids. Differences were found (P<0.05) for proteins (T-0: 20.96\%; T-1:
   21.15\%; T-2: 21.32\%), respectively. There were differences (P<0.05)
   for sensory traits: flavor and juiciness. The tenderness in T-0 was
   (P<0.001) lightly soft, juicy, more flavored and less detectable
   connective tissue than T-1 and T-2, which were lightly harder, less
   juicy and more connective tissue. These data suggest that late
   castration is a management tool to beef production because it permits to
   obtain an aggregate commercial value to steers over bulls.}},

Abstract = {{Sea-level fluctuations, particularly those associated with
   glacial-interglacial cycles, can have profound impacts on the flow and
   circulation of coastal groundwater: the water found at present in many
   coastal aquifers may have been recharged during the last glacial period,
   when sea level was over 100 m lower than present(1,2), and thus is not
   in equilibrium with present recharge conditions(3-9). Here we show that
   the geochemistry of the groundwater found in the Floridan Aquifer System
   in south Florida is best explained by a reorganization of groundwater
   flow following the sea-level rise at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum
   approximately 18,000 years ago. We find that the geochemistry of the
   freshwater found in the upper aquifers at present is consistent with
   recharge from meteoric water during the last glacial period. The lower
   aquifer, however, consists of post-sea-level-rise salt water that is
   most similar to that of the Straits of Florida, though with some
   dilution from the residual fresh water from the last glacial period
   circulation. We therefore suggest that during the last glacial period,
   the entire Floridan Aquifer System was recharged with meteoric waters.
   After sea level rose, the increased hydraulic head reduced the velocity
   of the groundwater flow. This velocity reduction trapped the fresh water
   in the upper aquifers and initiated saltwater circulation in the lower
   aquifer.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{As part of the U.S. Department of Energy's Regional Sequestration
   Partnership program, the potential for sequestering CO2 in the largest
   bituminous coal reserve in United States - the Illinois Basin - is being
   assessed at the Tanquary site in Wabash County, southeastern Illinois.
   To accomplish the main project objectives, which are to determine CO2
   injection rates and storage capacity, we developed a detailed coal
   characterization program. The targeted Springfield Coal occurs at 274 m
   (900 ft) depth, is 2.1 m (7 ft) thick, and is of high volatile B
   bituminous rank, having an average vitrinite reflectance (R-o) of
   0.63\%. Desorbed Springfield Coal gas content in cores from four wells
   similar to 15 to similar to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) apart varies from
   4.7-6.6 cm(3)/g (150 to 210 scf/ton, dmmf) and consists, generally, of
   >92\% CH4 with lesser amounts of N-2 and then CO2. Adsorption isotherms
   indicate that at least three molecules of CO2 can be stored for each
   displaced CH4 molecule. Whole seam petrographic composition, which
   affects sequestration potential, averages 76.5\% vitrinite, 4.2\%
   liptinite, 11.6\% inertinite, and 7.7\% mineral matter. Sulfur content
   averages 1.59\%. Well-developed coal cleats with 1 to 2 cm spacing
   contain partial calcite and/or kaolinite fillings that may decrease coal
   permeability. The shallow geophysical induction log curves show much
   higher resistivity in the lower part of the Springfield Coal than the
   medium or deep curves because of invasion by freshwater drilling fluid,
   possibly indicating higher permeability. Gamma-ray and bulk density
   vary, reflecting differences in maceral, ash, and pyrite content.
   Because coal properties vary across the basin, it is critical to
   characterize injection site coals to best predict the potential for CO2
   injection and storage capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is complicated by accelerated
   atherosclerosis, resulting in an increased risk of coronary artery
   disease (CAD) and thrombosis. Despite the proven benefits of aspirin,
   previous studies indicate a reduced cardiovascular protection from
   aspirin in diabetic patients. We aimed to investigate whether diabetes
   mellitus influenced the platelet response to aspirin in patients with
   CAD.
   Materials and Methods: Platelet aggregation and activation were
   evaluated during aspirin treatment in 85 diabetic and 92 non-diabetic
   patients with CAD. Adherence to aspirin was carefully controlled. All
   patients had CAD verified by coronary angiography and were taking 75 mg
   non-enteric coated aspirin daily.
   Results: Diabetic patients showed significantly higher levels of
   platelet aggregation compared to non-diabetic patients evaluated by
   VerifyNow (R) Aspirin (p = 0.03) and Multiplate (R) aggregometry using
   arachidonic acid (AA) 0.5 mM (p = 0.005) and 1.0 mM (p = 0.009). In
   addition, platelet activation determined by soluble P-selectin was
   significantly higher in diabetics compared to non-diabetics (p = 0.005).
   The higher AA-induced aggregation was associated with higher levels of
   HbA(1c). Compliance was confirmed by low levels of serum thromboxane B-2
   (below 7.2 ng/mL). Diabetics had significantly higher levels of serum
   thromboxane B-2 (p<0.0001).
   Conclusions: Diabetic patients with CAD had significantly higher levels
   of both platelet aggregation and activation compared to non-diabetic
   patients with CAD despite treatment with the same dosage of aspirin.
   These findings may partly explain the reduced cardiovascular protection
   from aspirin in diabetic patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim. Hemodynamic effects of compression devices in patients with venous
   insufficiency are still under dispute. The aim of this paper was to
   describe a method which is able to give quantitative results concerning
   an improvement of the venous pumping function by using compression
   devices in patients with venous insufficiency.
   Methods. The ejection fraction (EF) of the calf pump can be measured
   using strain gauge plethysmography proximal to a compression device on
   the leg and the degree of improvement depending on the exerted pressure
   and the elastic property of the material can be assessed. Experiments
   were carried out in 15 normal volunteers and in a total of 68 patients
   with severe superficial venous incompetence and who were investigated
   without compression and with various compression devices measuring
   interface pressure in different body positions.
   Results. Examples demonstrating the usefulness of the plethysmographic
   method are given. The median values of EF were 64.6 (IQR 63.4-68.6) in
   normal subjects and about half in the venous patients. Statistically
   significant improvement was achieved using inelastic bandages, resulting
   in further improvements with increasing pressures between 20 and 60
   mmHg. Elastic stockings led only to a moderate improvement of the
   deficient venous pumping function. Significant correlations were found
   between EF and standing and walking pressure.
   Conclusion. The described plethysmographic method is very useful to
   assess haemodynamic effects of different compression devices in patients
   with venous insufficiency. {[}Int Angiol 2010;29:421-5]}},

   ratio ( proportion of males) in the siblings of 469 individuals with a
   developmental language disorder (DLD) who were consecutively assessed in
   the same clinic during a period of 10 years. Among their 908 live-born
   siblings, 503 were males and 405 females. This yields a sex ratio of
   0.554, which is significantly higher than the Danish live birth sex
   ratio of 0.514 over the same period ( P=0.02). Our findings are

Abstract = {{The rotation period derived by Mueller and Samarasinha (Mueller, B.E.A.,
   Samarasinha, N.H. {[}2002]. Earth Moon Planets 90, 463-471) of the Deep
   Space 1 (DS1) mission target, Comet 19P/Borrelly, using ground-based
   data from July 28 to August 1, 2000, is improved by two orders of
   magnitude. This precision is reached in a multistep process.
   Combining all available ground-based data in 2000 decreases the error by
   an order of magnitude. Next, assuming that the rotation period did not
   change between 2000 and 2001, constraints from the HST 2001 data
   (Weaver, HA., Stern, S.A., Parker, J.Wm. {[}2003]. Astron. J. 126,
   444-451) yield three possible rotation periods: P = 1.088 +/- 0.003
   days, P = 1.108 +/- 0.002 days, and P = 1.135 +/- 0.003 days, which are
   consistent with our initial derivation of P = 1.08 +/- 0.04 days
   (Mueller, B.E.A., Samarasinha, N.H. {[}2002]. Earth Moon Planets 90,
   463-471).
   These three periods are further refined and the error bars further
   improved by another order of magnitude by linking the combined
   ground-based data from 2000 to the nuclear orientation of Borrelly at
   the DS1 encounter in 2001 (see Table 2). Due to aliasing, there are
   seven possible rotation periods around P = 1.088 days, five possible
   periods around P = 1.108 days, and six possible periods around P = 1.135
   days, with precisions of the order of 0.0002 days (approximate to 17 s).

Abstract = {{It is unrealistic to assume that all nodes in an ad hoc wireless network
   would be willing to participate in cooperative communication, especially
   if their desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) is achievable via direct
   transmission. An incentive-based auction mechanism is presented to
   induce cooperative behavior in wireless networks with emphasis on users
   with asymmetrical channel fading conditions. A single-object
   second-price auction is studied for cooperative partner selection in
   single-carrier networks. In addition, a multiple-object bundled auction
   is analyzed for the selection of multiple simultaneous partners in a
   cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) setting.
   For both cases, we characterize equilibrium outage probability
   performance, seller revenue, and feedback bounds. The auction-based
   partner selection allows winning bidders to achieve their desired QoS
   while compensating the seller who assists them. At the local level
   sellers aim for revenue maximization, while connections are drawn to
   min-max fairness at the network level. The proposed strategies for
   partner selection in self-configuring cooperative wireless networks are
   shown to be robust under conditions of uncertainty in the number of
   users requesting cooperation, as well as minimal topology and channel
   link information available to individual users.}},

Abstract = {{The recent and possible future shortages of petroleum-derived
   hydrocarbons for use as starting materials for the synthesis of organic
   chemicals/products have stimulated renewed interest in the use of coal
   as raw material for chemical production. Oxidatively solubilized coal
   and or lignite (OSC) in alcohol is a potential substitute for value
   added carbo-chemicals of the future. Phenomenal increase in the
   solubility of lignite in organic solvent consequent on treatment with
   dilute nitric acid under mild conditions was considered to be an
   expedient pathway for its direct utilization. The primary requirements
   for the solubilization are generation of functional groups like free
   carboxyl groups and size degradation. For the desired product the
   reaction should also be guided in such a manner, so that the
   aromatic/hydroaromatic moieties of the coal/lignite are preserved. The
   present study aims at the selection of the required reaction parameters
   for the conversion of lignite to such a product. Characterization of the
   original lignite and the products have been done chemically and
   spectroscopically. FT-IR, (13)C (solid state) and (1)H NMR spectra have
   shown that substances posses both aromatic and aliphatic
   characteristics. The dominant functional groups which contribute to the
   reactivity of the substances are phenolic and carboxylic acids.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Whether high factor (F)VIII and low free protein S levels
   are risk factors for arterial thrombosis is unclarified.
   Material and Methods: In a post-hoc analysis of a single-centre
   retrospective family cohort, we determined if these two proteins could
   increase the risk of arterial thrombosis. In total, 1399 relatives were
   analysed.
   Results: Annual incidence in relatives with high FVIII levels was 0.29\%
   (95\%CI, 0.22-0.38) compared to 0.13\% (95\%CI, 0.09-0.19) in relatives
   with normal FVIII levels. In relatives with low free protein S levels,
   this risk was 0.26\% (95\%CI, 0.16-0.40), compared to 0.14\% (95\%CI,
   0.10-0.20) in relatives with normal free protein S levels. Mean FVIII
   levels adjusted for age and sex were 11 IU/dL, 18 IU/dL, and 21 IU/dL
   higher in relatives with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity as
   compared to relatives without these arterial thrombotic risk factors.
   Moreover, a dose response relation between increasing FVIII and body
   mass index was found. None of these associations were shown for free
   protein S.
   Conclusions: High FVIII and low free protein S levels seemed to be mild
   risk factors for arterial thrombosis. High FVIII levels were
   particularly observed in relatives with traditional arterial thrombotic
   risk factors. Free protein S levels were not influenced by these
   thrombotic risk factors. This assumes that low free protein S levels
   were genetically determined. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monolayer culture expansion remains as a fundamental step to acquire
   sufficient number of cells for 3D constructs formation. It has been
   well-documented that cell expansion is however accompanied by cellular
   dedifferentiation. In order to promote cell growth and circumvent
   cellular dedifferentiation, we evaluated the effects of Transforming
   Growth Factor Beta-2 (TGF-beta 2), Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I)
   and basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) combination on articular
   chondrocytes culture and `chondrocytes-fibrin' construct formation.
   Chondrocytes were serially cultured in: (1) F12:DMEM + 10\% Foetal
   Bovine Serum (FBS) with growth factors (FD10GFs), (2) F12:DMEM + 2\%FBS
   with the growth factors (FD2GFs) and, (3) F12:DMEM + 10\%FBS without
   growth factors (FD) as control. Cultured chondrocytes were evaluated by
   means of growth kinetics parameters, cell cycle analysis, quantitative
   phenotypic expression of collagen type II, aggrecan core protein sox-9
   and collagen type I and, immunochemistry technique. Harvested
   chondrocytes were incorporated with plasma-derived fibrin and were
   polymerized to form the 3D constructs and implanted subcutaneously at
   the dorsum of athymic nude mice for eight (8) weeks. Resulted constructs
   were assigned for gross inspections and microscopic evaluation using
   standard histochemicals staining, immunochemistry technique and,
   quantitative phenotypic expression of cartilage markers to reassure
   cartilaginous tissue formation. Growth kinetics performance of
   chondrocytes cultured in three (3) types of culture media from the most
   to least was in the following order: FD10GFs > FD2GFs > FD. Following
   growth kinetics analysis, we decided to use FD10GFs and FD (control) for
   further evaluation and `chondrocytes-fibrin' constructs formation.
   Chondrocytes cultured in FD10GFs preserved the normal diploid state (2c)
   with no evidence of aneuploidy, haploidy or tetraploidy. Expression of
   cartilage-specific markers namely collagen type II, aggrecan core
   protein and sox-9 were significantly higher in FD10GFs when compared to
   control. After implantation, `chondrocytes-fibrin' constructs exhibited
   firm, white, smooth and glistening cartilage-like properties. FD10GFs
   constructs formed better quality cartilage-like tissue than FD
   constructs in term of overall cartilaginous tissue formation, cells
   organization and extracellular matrix distribution in the specimens.
   Cartilaginous tissue formation was confirmed by the presence of lacunae
   and cartilage-isolated cells embedded within basophilic ground
   substance. Presence of proteoglycan was confirmed by positive Safranin O
   staining. Collagen type II exhibited immunopositivity at the
   pericellular and inter-territorial matrix area. Chondrogenic properties
   of the construct were further confirmed by the expression of genes
   encoding collagen type II, aggrecan core protein and sox9. In
   conclusion, FD10GFs promotes the proliferation of chondrocytes and
   formation of good quality `chondrocytes-fibrin' constructs which may
   have potential use of matrix-induced cell implantation. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In practically all fields of science, measurements are affected by
   noise, which can sometimes be modeled with an appropriate probability
   distribution function. The results of measurements are therefore known
   only with uncertainties that sometimes can be significant. In many cases
   the noise source is independent of the system to be studied and the
   quantities to be measured. In this paper, a numerical approach to handle
   statistical uncertainties, due to an independent noise source, in a
   fuzzy logic system is developed. Numerical analysis and various tests
   with a benchmark show how statistical error bars can be interpreted as
   an independent ``axis of complexity{''} with respect to the fuzzy
   boundaries of the membership functions. The uncertainties in the inputs
   can be transferred to the output and handled separately from the system
   intrinsic fuzzyness. The main advantages of this independent treatment
   of the measurement errors are shown in the case of a binary
   classification task: the regime confinement identification in
   high-temperature tokamak plasmas. Significant improvements in the
   correct prediction rate have been achieved with respect to the
   classification performed without considering the error bars in the
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Les etudes s'interessant a la mesure du renouvellement global des
   proteines dans l'organisme (WBPT) a la suite d'un exercice physique et
   d'un apport alimentaire traitent generalement du role des exercices de
   force; neanmoins, il y a peu d'etudes sur les effets d'un apport
   alimentaire a la suite d'un exercice aerobie particulierement chez les
   personnes agees. On ne sait pas si un apport proteique apres un exercice
   suscite un effet benefique sur le renouvellement proteique consecutif a
   un exercice d'intensite legere a moderee. Cette etude se propose de
   verifier si, comparativement a un apport de sucres seulement (CHO), un
   apport proteique combine a des sucres (PRO) immediatement apres un bref
   effort aerobie apporte des effets additionnels concernant le WBPT chez
   des personnes agees. On invite en deux occasions douze adultes en bonne
   sante et ages de 59 +/- 4 ans a participer a une seance d'exercice d'une
   duree de 60 min et d'intensite suscitant 50 \% du consommation d'oxygene
   maximale suivie d'une recuperation d'une duree de 4 h. Immediatement
   apres la fin de l'exercice, les sujets consomment soit une boisson
   contenant des sucres (CHO; 60 g) soit une boisson contenant des sucres
   et des proteines (PRO; 40 g de sucres et 20 g de proteines
   lactoseriques) totalisant la meme quantite d'energie. On evalue le
   metabolisme proteique de l'organisme en entier par l'administration de
   {[}1-C-13] leucine (infusion immediate de 60 mg suivie d'une perfusion a
   raison de 75 mg center dot h(-1)) et l'analyse des echantillons de sang
   et des gaz expires. Les taux corporels d'apparition de la leucine, de
   son oxydation et de l'elimination de la fraction non oxydee au cours de
   la 3(e) et de la 4(e) heure de la periode de recuperation postexercice
   sont plus importants dans la condition PRO (2,51 +/- 0,55, 0,78 +/- 0,37

   et 1,47 +/- 0,25 mu mol center dot kg(-1)center dot min(-1)
   respectivement) (p = 0,001). Nos observations revelent qu'un apport de
   proteines a la suite d'un exercice aerobie suscite une plus grande
   augmentation du WBPT que ne le fait un apport de sucres. Un apport
   proteique a la suite d'un exercice semble favorable a l'amelioration de

   de verifier si on peut ameliorer la ROM par l'inclusion de quelques
   exercices d'etirement statique de courte duree au cours de la seance
   d'echauffement, et ce, sans nuire a la performance. Dix participants
   masculins physiquement actifs dans leur loisir participent a 2 seances
   experimentales constituees respectivement d'exercices d'echauffement
   differents afin d'en evaluer l'impact sur la ROM et la performance. Les
   exercices d'echauffement de la seance experimentale portant sur la ROM
   consistent en des etirements statiques (SS), soit 2 efforts d'une duree
   de 6 s; ou une course d'une duree de 10 min avant les SS (AS); ou une
   course d'une duree de 5 min avant et apres les SS (ASA). La seance
   experimentale portant sur la performance comporte une course de controle
   d'une duree de 10 min. Les mesures prises avant l'echauffement puis 1
   min, 10 min, 20 min et 30 min apres l'echauffement pour l'evaluation de
   la ROM sont l'amplitude de flexion de la hanche, la tension passive des
   extenseurs de la jambe et l'activite myoelectrique (EMG) des muscles
   ischiojambiers. Les mesures de performance incluent la hauteur de saut
   precede d'un contre-mouvement (CMJ), le temps de reaction (TR), le temps
   de mouvement (MT) et l'equilibre, et ce, avant l'echauffement puis 1 min
   et 10 min apres l'echauffement. La condition ASA ameliore plus la ROM
   que les conditions SS et AS (p < 0,0001); cet effet dure 30 min. On
   n'observe aucune difference significative de tension musculaire passive
   et d'activite myoelectrique. En ce qui concerne la seance experimentale
   portant sur la performance, on n'observe pas d'effets principaux relies
   a la condition en tant que telle, mais un effet dans le temps : la
   hauteur du CMJ est plus grande 1 min et 10 min apres l'echauffement (p =
   0,0004). Les ratios d'equilibre et le MT sont meilleurs 10 min apres
   l'echauffement (p < 0,0001). D'apres ces observations, la condition ASA
   peut susciter des ameliorations de la ROM durant 30 min tout en
   ameliorant la performance ou en ne lui nuisant pas. Ces observations
   sont pertinentes pour tout athlete s'integrant plus tard dans le match
   et disposant de peu de temps pour un echauffement complet.}},

Abstract = {{We generalize the well-known Laguerre series approach to approximate
   multivariate probability density functions (PDFs) using multidimensional
   Laguerre polynomials. The generalized Laguerre series, which is defined
   around a Gamma PDF, is suited for simulating high complex natural
   phenomena that deviate from Gaussianity. Combining the multivariate
   Laguerre approximation and Bayes theorem, an approximation to the
   conditional PDFs is derived. Numerical results first showed the
   superiority of the Gamma expansion over other numerical methods. The
   ability of the Gamma expansion to tit mixtures of Gaussian ans super
   Gaussian PDFs, univariate and multivariate Lognormal PDFs, and complex
   geologic media is shown through different examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic hybrid sols were synthesized from nano silica
   particles dispersed in water and from organoalkoxysilanes, using the
   sol-gel reaction. This work focuses on the effects of the three
   multifunctional organoalkoxysilanes dimethyldimethoxysilane (DMDMS),
   methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) to form a
   transparent and high-thermal-resistance coating film. The stability of
   the hybrid sol was evaluated as a function of the reaction time for 10 d
   through the variation of the viscosity. The viscosity of the
   silica/DMDMS and silica/MTMS sol was slightly increased for 10 d. The
   multifunctional organoalkoxysilanes formed dense silica networks through
   hydrolysis and condensation reaction, which enhanced the thermal
   resistance of the coating films. No thermal degradation of the
   silica/DMDMS sample occurred up to 600 degrees C, and none of the
   silica/MTMS and silica/TMOS samples occurred either up to 700 degrees C.
   The organic-inorganic hybrid sols were coated on the glass substrate
   using a spin-coating procedure. The organic inorganic hybrid sols formed
   flat coating films without cracks. The transmittance of the hybrid sol
   coating films using MTMS and DMDMS was shown to be over 90\%. The
   transmittance of the silica/TMOS sol coating film reacted for 10 d
   abruptly decreased due to faster gelation. The silica/DMDMS and
   silica/MTMS hybrid sols formed smooth coating films while the surface
   roughness of the silica/TMOS coating film markedly increased when the
   hybrid sol reacted for 10 d. The increase of the surface roughness of
   the silica/TMOS coating film can be attributed to the degradation of the
   stability of the hybrid sol and to the loss of transmittance of the
   coating film. It was confirmed in this study that the use of organic
   inorganic hybrid sol can yield transparent and high-thermal-resistance
   coating films.}},

Abstract = {{Arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the lesser
   toes is a commonly performed procedure for correction of the claw toe
   and hammer toe deformity. Multiple techniques of fixation have been
   described to achieve a solid fusion with variable fusion rates (Coughlin
   and Polk in Operative repair of the fixed hammertoe deformity. Foot
   Ankle Int 21(2):94-104, 2000). The standard technique for many years
   uses a single intramedullary K-wire (Baig and Geary in Fusion rate and
   patient satisfaction in proximal interphalangeal joint fusion of the
   minor toes using Kirschner wire fixation. The Foot 6:120-121, 1996 ). We
   present our technique of fusing the PIP joint with two fine K-wires,
   used to prevent rotational displacement and ensure sound arthrodesis.
   Our series of 36 fusions in 25 patients were assessed independently
   using the American College of foot and ankle surgeons score (ACFAS) and
   the Foot Function Scale (FFS). A fusion rate of 97\% was achieved with
   89\% of patients were satisfied with the appearance of their toes. There
   was a significant reduction in pain levels with 90\% of patients
   reporting no pain with normal activities. We believe our simple
   improvement to the single wire technique results in superior outcomes.}},

   increasing thickness of Ag layer. In the analysis, the dominant thermal
   carriers were found to be the electrons in the Ag layer in the entire

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluated the association of nocturia with fracture and
   death in a large, community based sample of Japanese individuals 70
   years old or older.
   Materials and Methods: The baseline in this population based study was
   determined in 2003 by an extensive health interview with each
   participant. In this study we followed 784 individuals with a mean +/-
   SD age of 76.0 +/- 4.6 years (range 70 to 97). Information on mortality
   and fracture during the study period was provided by the National Health
   Insurance system and details on fractures were collected from medical
   records. We compared the risk of bone fracture and death with or without
   nocturia in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.
   Results: Nocturia (2 or greater voids per night) was present in 359 of
   the 784 participants (45.7\%). Fracture was observed in 41 cases,
   including 32 fall related cases. For all fractures and fall related
   fractures with nocturia the HR was 2.01 (95\% CI 1.04-3.87) and 2.20
   (95\% CI 1.04-4.68, each p = 0.04). Death occurred in 53 cases. The
   mortality rate in individuals with nocturia was significantly higher
   than in those without nocturia. For mortality in patients with nocturia
   the age-gender adjusted HR was 1.91 (95\% CI 1.07-3.43, p = 0.03). Even
   when further adjusted for diabetes, smoking status, history of coronary
   disease, renal disease and stroke, tranquilizers, hypnotics and
   diuretics, the positive relationship was unchanged (HR 1.98, 95\% CI
   1.09-3.59, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: During a 5-year observation period elderly individuals with
   nocturia were at greater risk for fracture and death than those without
   nocturia.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a stator-permanent-magnet reluctance generator
   (PMRG) (Fig. I). The PMRG has a doubly salient pole structure, and has
   permanent magnets embedded in the stator yoke. Concentrated windings are
   arranged individually around each stator pole. On the other hand, the
   rotor has neither permanent magnets nor windings. Therefore, the PMRG
   has a simple and robust structure, and permits a multipolar structure.
   It is expected that the PMRG is applied into a small-scale wind-turbine
   and hydroelectric power generation. However; two major technical
   problems still remain.
   One is the cost of rare-earth magnets, and the other is torque ripple
   due to the doubly salient pole structure. First this paper presents a
   PMRG using ferrite magnets. The ferrite magnet has about three times
   lower residual magnetic flux density as compared to the rare-earth
   magnet, but has about 10 times lower cost. It is demonstrated that the
   proposed PMRG using ferrite magnets has almost the same output power as
   that using rare-earth magnets by employing an outer rotor structure
   (Fig. 4). In addition, its material cost is lower by about 45 \%.
   Next, it is proposed a method for reducing torque ripple of the PMRG by
   stacking two rotors (Fig. 10). One rotor is shifted by 180 degrees in
   electrical angle from the other rotor. In addition, the rotor pole-tips
   are cut off so that the torque waveform consists of only odd-harmonics.
   In such a structure, the torque ripple of the PMRG can be completely
   cancelled in theory.
   Finally, a trial two-stocked outer-rotor PMRG has been manufactured. The
   maximum output power is 777 W at 1000 rpm, and the efficiency at the
   point is 84.5 \%. In addition, the efficiency at less than 1000 rpm is
   improved by over 10 \% in comparison with the present PMRGs with
   rare-earth magnets (Fig. 19).}},

Abstract = {{Marine bacteria residing on local red, green, and brown seaweeds were
   screened for exo-1,3-beta-glucanase (ExoP) activity. Of the 90 bacterial
   species isolated from 32 seaweeds, only one, a Pseudoalteromonas sp.,
   was found to display such activity. It was isolated from a Durvillaea
   sp., a brown kelp known to contain significant amounts of the storage
   polysaccharide laminarin (1,3-beta-D-glucan with some 1,6-beta
   branching). Four chromatographic steps were utilized to purify the
   enzyme (ExoP). Chymotryptic digestion provided peptide sequences for
   primer design and subsequent gene cloning. The exoP gene coded for 840
   amino acids and was located just 50 bp downstream from a putative
   lichenase (endo-1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase) gene, suggesting possible
   cotranscription of these genes. Sequence comparisons revealed ExoP to be
   clustered within a group of bacterial glycosidases with high similarity
   to a group of glycoside hydrolase (GH3) plant enzymes, of which the
   barley exo-1,3/1,4-beta-glucanase (ExoI) is the best characterized. The
   major difference between the bacterial and plant proteins is an extra
   200- to 220-amino-acid extension at the C terminus of the former. This
   additional sequence does not correlate with any known functional domain,
   but ExoP was not active against laminarin when this region was removed.
   Production of recombinant ExoP allowed substrate specificity studies to
   be performed. The enzyme was found to possess similar levels of
   exoglucanase activity against both 1,4-beta linkages and 1,3-beta
   linkages, and so ExoP is designated an exo-1,3/1,4-beta-exoglucanase,
   the first such bacterial enzyme to be characterized. This broader
   specificity could allow the enzyme to assist in digesting both cell wall
   cellulose and cytoplasmic laminarin.}},

Abstract = {{A Phase I/II study of S-1 combined radiation therapy was conducted in
   patients with Stage II (T2N0) glottic cancer. The purpose of the Phase I
   study was to identify the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended dose
   and the dose limiting toxicity. The objectives in the phase II study
   were to estimate the local control and the overall survival, and the
   incidence of adverse events.
   In Phase I, S-1 was administered orally in a split-course fashion as two
   doses of 40 mg/m(2), for a total daily dose of 80 mg/m(2). The course
   involved a 2-week rest after a 2-week administration (Level 1) and a
   1-week rest after a 3-week administration (Level 2). Radiation therapy
   was administered in 2-Gy daily (total 60-Gy) standard fractionation.
   Seven patients were enrolled in the Phase I, and 19 in the Phase II
   study. Mucositis was the most common toxicity encountered. All 26
   patients completed radiation therapy without delay. The overall response
   rate was 100\% (26/26) with all patients showing a complete response.
   One patient developed a local recurrence 28 months after the treatment.
   The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 94.7 and
   85.4\%, respectively (limited to 22 patients from Level 2).
   The use of S-1 at 80 mg/m(2) per day in a split-course with 1-week rest
   during the course of radiation therapy was safe and effective for Stage
   II glottic cancer. The treatment strategy employing orally available S-1
   proved to be beneficial over the conventional injection of antitumor
   agents for maintaining the patients' quality of life.}},

Title = {{Observations on retrieved humeral polyethylene components from reverse
   total shoulder arthroplasty}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Analyses of polyethylene components retrieved at revision of
   total knee, hip, and shoulder replacements have been used to study the
   effect of design, patient, and surgical factors on initial implant
   performance, but no studies have reported similar types of findings in
   retrieved humeral polyethylene components in reverse total shoulder
   arthroplasty. Our hypothesis is that while the conforming surface of the
   humeral polyethylene may predispose it to surface wear modalities, as
   seen in total hip arthroplasty, the presence of clinical instability may
   also increase the occurrence of focal contact stresses leading to
   subsurface fatigue failure
   Materials and methods: Fourteen humeral polyethylene components were
   retrieved from revision surgery at a single institution. Each
   polyethylene was analyzed for 9 modes of damage in each of 4 quadrants
   into which the bearing surface was divided For each implant, the most
   recent radiographs before removal were scored using an adapted
   radiolucency score, and glenosphere positioning was measured.
   Results: Despite the short mean length of implantation (0.46 +/- 0.5
   years), scratching and abrasion were seen in 14 and 13 components,
   respectively, followed by third-body debris and pitting. The modes of
   damage observed were most severe in the inferior quadrant of the humeral
   polyethylene. Scapular notching, glenoid, and humeral radiolucencies
   were prevalent on preoperative radiographs, but their long-term
   significance has not yet been elucidated Increased glenosphere
   inclination was associated with decreased superior and total glenoid
   radiolucency, along with total polyethylene wear scores
   Discussion: Promising early, functional results with the use of reverse
   total shoulder arthroplasty has led to the increased expansion of its
   use, but high complication and revision rates continue to raise concerns
   regarding implant longevity The presence of a clinical, adduction
   deficit may predispose patients to inferior quadrant polyethylene wear.
   Conclusions: Impingement of the humeral polyethylene at the lateral edge
   of the scapula leads to inferior quadrant wear and associated
   polyethylene failure, and implant instability may predispose the
   components to fatigue wear mechanisms Analysis of retrieved humeral
   polyethylene components, along with patient, design, and surgical
   factors, provide important information on the causes of component
   failure.

Abstract = {{Water shortages are anticipated to occur all over the world and are
   likely to have a significant effect on the availability of water for
   water splitting processes, such as photocatalysis and electrolysis, as
   well as for drinking and industrial water. To overcome this problem, it
   has been suggested that seawater could be used as an alternative
   resource for the various water industries, including hydrogen
   production, industrial, and drinking water. Seawater contains a large
   amount of dissolved ion components, thus allowing it to be utilized as
   an electrolyte in PEC systems for producing hydrogen.
   In this study, anodized TiO2 electrodes are prepared and used as the
   photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system designed to convert
   natural seawater into hydrogen with the assistance of an external bias,
   and their electrochemical and morphological properties were
   characterized, and correlated with the hydrogen evolution rate and
   photocurrent.
   In order to prepare light sensitized TiO2 electrodes, titanium was
   anodized in single and mixed chemicals and annealed under various
   conditions. Based on the comparison of their electrical and physical
   properties and hydrogen evolution rate, the TiO2 electrode anodized in a
   mixture of chemicals (NH4F-H2O-C3H8O2 (ethylene glycol)) showed the best
   performance among the other electrodes. The experimental results showed
   that the hydrogen evolution rate obtained using seawater in the PEC
   system is ca. 215 mu mol/cm(2) h, thus confirming that this is an
   effective seawater electrolyte for hydrogen production, and the optimum
   external bias supplied by the solar cell is at least 3.0 V. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A 280 GHz single-channel horizontal millimeter-wave interferometer
   system has been installed for plasma electron density measurements on
   the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) device. This
   system has a triangular beam path that does not pass through the plasma
   axis due to geometrical constraints in the superconducting tokamak. The
   term line density on KSTAR has a different meaning from the line density
   of other tokamaks. To estimate the peak density and the mean density
   from the measured line density, information on the position of the
   plasma is needed. The information has been calculated from tangentially
   viewed visible images using the toroidal symmetry of the plasma.
   Interface definition language routines have been developed for this
   purpose. The calculated plasma position data correspond well to
   calculation results from magnetic analysis. With the position data and
   an estimated plasma profile, the peak density and the mean density have
   been obtained from the line density. From these results, changes of
   plasma density themselves can be separated from effects of the plasma
   movements, so they can give valuable information on the plasma status.

Abstract = {{Redundancy techniques, such as N-tuple modular redundancy (NMR), has
   been widely used to correct faulty behavior of components and achieve
   high reliability. Almost all redundancy-based strategies rely on a
   majority voting. The voter, therefore, becomes a critical unit for the
   correct operation of any NMR system. In this paper, we propose a
   voterless fault-tolerant strategy to implement a robust NMR system
   design. We show that using a novel fault-tolerant communication
   mechanism, namely logic code division multiple access, we can transfer
   data with extremely low error rates among N modules and completely
   eliminate the need for a centralized voter unit. Such a highly reliable
   strategy is vital for future nanosystems in which high defect rate is
   expected. Experimental results are also reported to verify the concept,
   clarify the design procedure, and measure the system's reliability.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To compare the levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and
   progenitors (CEPs) between tumour-bearing mice and healthy controls, in
   human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenograft models. The secondary
   objective was to correlate CEC and CEP levels with tumour variables such
   as tumour volume, weight and vascularity, indicators of disease
   severity.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Two human RCC xenograft models were used. Tumour cells were inoculated
   either subcutaneously or beneath the renal subcapsule (orthotopic).
   Tumour dimensions were recorded and blood samples were taken throughout
   the experiment, as well as at the end of the experiment, upon which
   tumours were excised and prepared for histological examination. All
   blood samples were analysed by flow cytometry.
   RESULTS
   CEC and CEP levels were significantly elevated in tumour-bearing mice
   compared with healthy controls. In particular, there was a divergence in
   CEC levels between RCC-bearing mice and controls during early phases in
   disease, whereas CEP levels were only elevated towards the end.
   Additionally, CEC levels correlated with tumour variables such as tumour
   volume, when tumour volume was < 200 mm3 and with tumour vascularity in
   certain models. CEP levels did not correlate significantly with most
   tumour variables examined.
   CONCLUSION
   In human RCC xenograft models, CEC levels showed promise as an adjuvant
   biomarker in evaluating disease burden. RESULTS
   from correlating CEC levels with tumour variables such as tumour volume,
   weight and vascularity suggested that CEC levels were a better
   prognostic indicator during early phases of tumour growth. CEP levels
   were elevated in tumour-bearing mice compared with controls; however,
   enumerated numbers were small and require further validation in future
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Large wild herbivores are important ecologically and economically, and
   maintaining their populations is a crucial management concern. The
   Ladakh urial Ovis vignei vignei is an endemic and endangered wild sheep
   inhabiting the arid Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh, where its
   population is restricted to narrow tracts along two river valleys. The
   causes of this restricted distribution of the species are not
   understood. We asked if competitive exclusion by the more abundant wild
   ungulate, the blue sheep Pseudois nayaur, could explain the limited
   range of Ladakh urial. To explore this possibility we studied the
   occurrence patterns of these two species at multi-spatial scales
   (regional, landscape and habitat). We found that they occurred
   independently at the regional scale, but co-occurred at the landscape
   scale, facilitated by divergence in seasonal resource use at the habitat
   scale. Although the two species segregated along both habitat and diet
   axes during summer at the habitat scale, there is a high potential for
   competition during winter, the `pinch' period, when they overlap in
   their habitat use due to altitudinal migration. Therefore, the presence
   of blue sheep seems to limit the population growth and range expansion
   of the Ladakh urial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Dysfunctions in Penile Erectile Tissue from Streptozotocin-Diabetic Mice}},

Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Activation of the DNA repair enzyme, poly(adenosine diphosphate
   {[}ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP), in response to hyperglycemia-driven
   oxidative/nitrosative stress, may be an important mechanism in the
   development of vascular and neural complications in diabetes mellitus.
   However, a role for PARP in diabetic erectile dysfunction (ED) has not
   been demonstrated.
   Aim.
   To assess whether treatment with a novel PARP-1 inhibitor, GPI 15427,
   could improve neurovascular dysfunction in corpus cavernosum (CC) from
   diabetic mice.
   Methods.
   Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in male MF1 mice; duration was 6
   weeks. Intervention GPI 15427 treatment (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal
   {[}i.p.]) was given for 2 weeks following 4 weeks of untreated diabetes.
   CC strips were mounted in aerated organ baths for measurement of
   pharmacological or electrical stimulation-evoked changes in smooth
   muscle tension.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   Contractile responses to noradrenergic stimulation and to
   pharmacological agents stimulating endothelium-dependent and
   -independent relaxation, and nerve-mediated relaxations against a
   background precontraction.
   Results.
   Contractions in response to phenylephrine or activation of noradrenergic
   nerves were not significantly altered by diabetes. In contrast, maximum
   nitrergic nerve-mediated relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted CC
   was approximately 28\% reduced by diabetes: GPI 15427 treatment
   completely corrected this diabetic deficit. Similarly, maximal nitric
   oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations
   to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, against phenylephrine
   precontraction, were attenuated approximately 37\% and 23\% by diabetes,
   respectively. These deficits were completely reversed by PARP-1
   inhibition. Furthermore, GPI 15427 corrected a modest diabetic deficit
   in sensitivity to nitroprusside (EC50 reduced by 0.14 log units); a
   similar trend was observed for acetylcholine-induced relaxation.
   Conclusions.
   GPI 15427 treatment provides marked benefits for NO-dependent
   neurovascular function in diabetic mouse CC. Therefore, PARP-1
   inhibition may be worthy of further investigation for
   diabetes-associated ED. Nangle MR, Cotter MA, and Cameron NE.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the diagnostic performance of angle measurements
   from anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images for
   identifying eyes with narrow angles.
   Methods: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study of
   individuals 50 years or older who had phakic eyes and who underwent
   AS-OCT imaging in the dark by a single operator and gonioscopy by an
   ophthalmologist masked to AS-OCT findings. An eye was considered to have
   narrow angles if the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not
   visible for at least 180 degrees on gonioscopy. Horizontal AS-OCT images
   were analyzed for the following measurements using customized software:
   angle opening distance (AOD) at 250, 500, and 750 mu m from the scleral
   spur; trabecular-iris space area (TISA) at 500 and 750 mu m; and angle
   recess area (ARA) at 750 pm. Areas under the receiver operating
   characteristic curves (AUCs) were generated for AOD, TISA, and ARA to
   assess the performance of these measurements in detecting eyes with
   narrow angles.
   Results: Of 2047 individuals examined, 582 were excluded mostly because
   of poor image quality or inability to locate the scleral spur. Of the
   remaining 1465 participants, 315 (21.5\%) had narrow angles on
   gonioscopy. Mean (SD) age was 62.7 (7.7) years, 54.1\% were women, and
   90.0\% were Chinese. The AUCs were highest for AOD750 in the nasal (0.90
   {[}95\% confidence interval, 0.89-0.92]) and temporal (0.91
   {[}0.90-0.93]) quadrants.
   Conclusions: The AOD750 is the most useful angle measurement for
   identifying individuals with gonioscopic narrow angles in gradable
   AS-OCT images. Poor definition of the scleral spur precludes
   quantitative analysis in approximately 25\% of AS-OCT images.}},

Abstract = {{We studied neonatal outcomes of infants of obese mothers in a cohort of
   6,125 deliveries, using logistic multivariate analysis to remove the
   role of potential confounding variables. Although, as in previous
   reports, the crude unadjusted prevalence of several adverse neonatal
   outcomes was higher in these infants, the multivariable analysis
   revealed that only two outcomes remained significantly associated with
   maternal overweight and obesity: neonatal macrosomia (adjusted odds
   ratios aOR 1.4, p < 0.001) and meconium aspiration syndrome (aOR 1.6, p
   = 0.05), indicating that the unadjusted association with the other
   outcomes was caused by confounding factors. Nonetheless, as macrosomia
   is associated with increased health risks both to the mothers and their
   infants, and maternal obesity with considerable maternal morbidity
   during pregnancy, these results should not lead to complacency, but
   instead encourage better prevention of obesity in general and during
   pregnancy in particular.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the recent advances, the clinical approach to persistent
   pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) still represents an
   important challenge for neonatologists. The care of newborns with PPHN
   requires meticulous therapeutic and ventilation strategies including,
   besides the stabilization of the newborn, the use of nitric oxide and
   high-frequency ventilation. However, not all the neonates with PPHH are
   responsive to this clinical approach. Recent studies have proposed the
   use of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, in refractory forms
   of PPHN. The aim of this study is to review the cases and the clinical
   approach of PPHN in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Meyer Children
   Hospital in the year 2009 and to discuss the possible role of sildenafil
   in the management of PPHN.</.}},

Abstract = {{A constitutive model is proposed to describe the mechanical behavior of
   the plantar fascia. The mechanical characterization of the plantar
   fascia regards the role in the foot biomechanics and it is involved in
   many alterations of its functional behavior, both of mechanical and
   nonmechanical origin. The structural conformation of the plantar fascia
   in its middle part is characterized by the presence of collagen fibers
   reinforcing the tissue along a preferential orientation, which is that
   supporting the major loading. According to this anatomical evidence, the
   tissue is described by developing an isotropic fiber-reinforced
   constitutive model and since the elastic response of the fascia is here
   considered, the constitutive model is based on the theory of
   hyperelasticity. The model is consistent with a kinematical description
   of large strains mechanical behavior, which is typical of soft tissues.
   A fitting procedure of the constitutive model is implemented making use
   of experimental curves taken from the literature and referring to
   specimens of human plantar fascia. A satisfactory fitting of the tensile
   behavior of the plantar fascia has been performed, showing that the
   model correctly interprets the mechanical behavior of the tissue in the
   light of comparison to experimental data at disposal. A critical
   analysis of the model with respect to the problem of the identification
   of the constitutive parameters is proposed as the basis for planning a
   future experimental investigation of mechanical behavior of the plantar
   fascia.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To report results of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic
   stroke (AIS) in patients who were not candidates for intravenous
   thrombolysis (IVT) or in whom IVT failed.
   METHODS: Prospectively collected data for patients treated between
   January 2006 and June 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. After careful
   patient and therapy selection, 213 AIS patients with a mean NIHSS score
   of 14.2 at presentation underwent intervention. End points analyzed were
   Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 2/3 reperfusion,
   symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) rates, and 90-day outcomes
   (modified Rankin Scale {[}mRS] and mortality). Multivariate binary
   logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors
   of end points.
   RESULTS: Of 189 patients with anterior circulation occlusions, 135 were
   treated within 0-8 hours, 33 were treated after 8 or more hours, and 21
   were treated after wake-up stroke (WUS). Among 24 patients treated with
   posterior circulation occlusions, 4 had WUS. After treatment, 72.3\%
   patients had TIMI 2/3 reperfusion; SICH rate was 8.7\%; at 90 days,
   36.6\% recovered to mRS 2 or less. SICH rate was higher in patients with
   anterior circulation strokes who received treatment 8 or more hours
   after symptom onset (odds ratio {[}OR] = 3.8) and patients with WUS (OR
   = 4.9). In patients treated within 8 hours of onset of symptoms of
   anterior circulation stroke, SICH rate was only 6.7\%. There was no
   difference in outcomes in patients with WUS compared with patients
   treated less than 8 hours after stroke onset.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first and largest prospective study to the
   authors' knowledge that shows endovascular therapy for AIS patients in a
   real-world setting. High recanalization rates with low SICH rates were
   achieved using careful patient and therapy selection.}},

Abstract = {{High summer conditioning consumption is becoming a tough and critical
   issue and consequently there is a need to provide buildings with new
   technologies for energy saving. Current European and Italian legislation
   is also working in this direction. We present a preliminary experimental
   evaluation of the energy performance of a new technology which is
   capable of canceling conduction gains through walls: ``water-evaporative
   walls{''}, which are not only able to prevent the entrance of energy
   fluxes from the exterior to the interior, but also to reduce wall
   temperatures to below the values found indoors. This solution basically
   suggests equipping standard ventilated facades with a proper
   water-evaporative system, which exploits the latent heat of water
   evaporation, in order to absorb summer cooling loads. From the
   technological point of view, it requires the insertion of a water
   spraying system and a proper insulating layer in the ventilated air
   chamber. The insulation will act not only as a standard insulating
   material, but also as a porous surface to store water sprayed by the
   system and then gradually release it when needed for cooling. The
   experimental analyses showed the effectiveness of this technology, which
   decreases the overall summer energy load in buildings by canceling
   conduction loads. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Scorpion venoms cause a massive release of
   neurotransmitters. Either anti-scorpion venom serum (AScVS) or prazosin
   has been used in the management of severe scorpion envenomation. Aims:
   To compare the time taken for clinical recovery by patients with severe
   scorpion envenomation after AScVS therapy with that following prazosin
   therapy. Settings and Design: A prospective, open-labeled clinical trial
   was undertaken to compare the effects of the AScVS and/or prazosin on
   clinical recovery in scorpion-stung patients. Materials and Methods:
   Eighty-one patients from rural districts of Maharashtra presenting with
   severe scorpion envenomation were assigned to three treatment groups
   (AScVS: n = 28; prazosin: n = 25; AScVS + prazosin: n = 28). Severity of
   scorpion envenomation was graded using a proposed composite clinical
   scoring system to assess the therapeutic efficacy. AScVS was
   administered as an intravenous slow bolus, ranging from 40 to 100 ml,
   depending on the severity of envenomation. Prazosin was given as 1 mg
   every 3 h. Statistical Analysis Used: The non-parametric
   ``Kruskal-Wallis{''} test was used in the statistical analysis and a
   P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean composite
   scores of patients from the three groups at the time of admission were
   comparable. Complete clinical recovery was noted in 4.14 +/- 1.6 h and
   19.28 +/- 5.03 h in the subjects who were administered AScVS and
   prazosin, respectively (P < 0.001). There was no incidence of
   anaphylactic reaction to AScVS. Conclusions: Intravenous slow bolus of
   AScVS given based on the clinical severity of envenomation leads to
   early recovery than prazosin alone and is well tolerated.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the improvement in knowledge and skills amongst
   the trainees of the workshop on ``labour and partograph.{''}
   Methods: Cross sectional study where 100 trainees were evaluated for
   improvement in knowledge and skills after workshops. Assessment tool
   selected for predefined objectives were a) feedback forms b)pre and post
   test questionnaire c)pre and post training assessment of skills. These
   competency based workshops were conducted at Hamdard university hospital
   and attended by 85 graduating final year students, 10 house officers and
   5 labour room nurses. The data was entered and analyzed on SPSS.
   Results: Eighty percent of the trainees strongly agreed that workshop
   had improved their knowledge and skills and appreciated the hands on
   practice session. In assessment of improvement in knowledge by pre and
   post test questionnaire it was found that only 14.9\% scored >80\% in
   pre test whereas in post test 87.8\% scored >80\% with a mean of 89.5
   +/- 9.1. In, overall, assessment of skills only 3.6\% trainees scored
   >80\% in pre-training assessment while in post training assessment
   almost 98.2\% scored > 80\%.
   Conclusion: The overall results showed significant improvement in both
   knowledge and skills of the trainee after the workshop. Objectivity in
   teaching, learning and assessment gives good outcomes. We also feel that
   such training workshops should be done on a larger scale to train the
   staff in order to achieve the targets set under millennium development
   goals (JPMA 60:844; 2010).}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC POLICY}},

Abstract = {{P>This paper examines whether multinational banks have a stabilizing or
   a destabilizing role during times of financial distress. With a focus on
   Europe, it looks at how these banks' foreign affiliates have been faring
   during the recent financial crisis. It finds that retail and corporate
   lending of these foreign affiliates has been stable and even increasing
   between 2007 and 2009. This pattern is related to the functioning of the
   internal capital market through which these banks funnel funds across
   their units. The internal capital market has been an effective tool to
   support foreign affiliates in distress and to isolate their lending from
   the local availability of financial resources, notwithstanding the
   systemic nature of the recent crisis. This effect has been particularly
   large within the EU integrated financial market and for the EMU
   countries, thus showing complementarity between economic integration and
   multinational banks' internal capital markets. In light of these
   findings, this paper supports the call for an integration of the
   European supervisory and regulatory framework overseeing multinational
   banks. The analysis is based on an analytical framework which derives
   the main conditions under which the internal capital market can perform
   this support function under idiosyncratic and systemic stresses. The
   empirical evidence uses both aggregate evidence on foreign claims
   worldwide, and firm-level evidence on the behaviour of banking groups'
   affiliates, compared to stand-alone national banks.

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that women and men tend to have
   different types of mental and physical health problems. Using data from
   the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) of 2001-2003, we
   consider whether the female excess in internalizing disorders
   contributes to the female excess in chronic debilitating conditions and
   whether the male excess in externalizing disorders contributes to the
   male excess in life threatening conditions. We find that women have
   significantly higher odds of meeting the DSM-IV criteria for one or more
   lifetime internalizing disorders and significantly lower odds of meeting
   the DSM-IV criteria for one or more lifetime externalizing disorders. We
   also find that women have higher odds of reporting four of the ten
   chronic debilitating conditions examined, including arthritis, frequent
   or severe headaches, seasonal allergies, and gallbladder removal, and
   lower odds of reporting three of the six life threatening conditions
   examined, including stroke, heart disease, and high blood pressure. We
   conclude that the female excess in internalizing disorders partially
   mediates, or explains, the female excess in arthritis, headaches, and
   gallbladder removal, while the male excess in externalizing disorders
   partially accounts for the male excess in heart disease and high blood
   pressure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleotide excision repair pathway catalyzes the removal of bulky
   adduct damage from DNA and requires the activity of more than 30
   individual proteins and complexes. A diverse array of damage can be
   recognized and removed by the NER pathway including UV-induced adducts
   and intrastrand adducts induced by the chemotherapeutic compound
   cisplatin. The recognition of DNA damage is complex and involves a
   series of proteins including the xeroderma pignnentosum group A and C
   proteins and the UV-damage DNA binding protein. The xeroderma
   pigmentosum group A protein is unique in the sense that it is required
   for both transcription coupled and global genomic nucleotide excision
   repair. In addition, xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein is required
   for the removal of all types of DNA lesions repaired by nucleotide
   excision repair. Considering its importance in the damage recognition
   process, the minimal information available on the mechanism of DNA
   binding, and the potential that inhibition of xeroderma pigmentosum
   group A protein could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of platinum based
   anticancer drugs, we sought to identify and characterize small molecule
   inhibitors of the DNA binding activity of the xeroderma pigmentosum
   group A protein. In silico screening of a virtual small molecule library
   resulted in the identification of a class of molecules confirmed to
   inhibit the xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein-DNA Interaction.
   Biochemical analysis of inhibition with varying DNA substrates revealed
   a common mechanism of xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein DNA binding
   to single-stranded DNA and cisplatin-damaged DNA.}},

Abstract = {{Goals: To evaluate the effectiveness of psychiatric counseling in
   reducing the rate of development of psychiatric side effects of
   antiviral therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin among study
   participants compared with standard clinical monitoring alone.
   Background: Interferon-alpha is used to treat chronic hepatitis C.
   Interferons may induce adverse events that usually, but not always,
   reverse within a few days after the end of therapy.
   Study: Two hundred eleven patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1b
   were treated with peginterferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks in a
   prospective trial. Two groups were randomly created. Group A was
   interviewed by a team of gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and
   psychologists and treated with psychotherapy once a month. Group B was
   monitored once a month according to a conventional protocol that did not
   include psychotherapy. SVR (sustained viral response), severe
   psychiatric symptom onset, and mood progression were assessed (P
   calculated using Fisher exact test, Friedman test, Dunn posttest, and
   Mann-Whitney U-test).
   Results: At baseline, there was no difference in depressive symptoms or
   liver histologic score between the 2 groups. The onset rate of severe
   psychiatric manifestations was 4.7\% (Group A) and 16.1\% (Group B)
   between the 24th and 36th weeks (P < 0.01). Fifteen participants in
   Group A and 39 in Group B required antidepressants and benzodiazepines
   (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Patients can develop depressive symptoms during interferon
   therapy. Multidisciplinary medical treatment with psychiatric counseling
   provided during the treatment of chronic hepatitis C may contribute to
   the decrease or prevent the higher rates of depression associated with
   interferon treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Ambulatory surgery is not commonly practiced in France today.
   The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of
   ambulatory hernia repair in a consecutive series of unselected patients.
   Patients and methods: From June 2008 to October 2009, 257 patients (238
   men and 19 women, median age 65 years) were treated in a same-day
   surgery unit for 270 hernias (244 groin hernias, 25 ventral hernias and
   one Spiegelian hernia).
   Results: For groin hernia, the techniques included the totally
   extraperitoneal repair (TEP) in 108 cases, the transinguinal
   preperitoneal (TIPP) approach in 106 cases and other alternative
   techniques in 30 cases; for ventral hernias, the technique was an open
   suture in 20 cases, an open prosthetic repair in four cases and
   laparoscopic repair in one case. Anesthesia was general in 145 cases,
   local in 121 cases and spinal in four cases. Repair was completed in a
   same-day surgery setting in 242 (89.6\%) cases; hospital stay greater
   than 23 hours was planned for 21 (7.8\%) patients while non-programmed
   hospitalizations were necessary for seven (2.6\%) patients. There were
   two (0.7\%) readmissions and nine (3.3\%) benign postoperative
   complications.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that groin and ventral hernia repair
   can be performed in an outpatient setting in nearly 90\% of unselected
   patients. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

Abstract = {{Context: NRG1 is a schizophrenia candidate gene and plays an important
   role in brain development and neural function. Schizophrenia is a
   complex disorder, with etiology likely due to epistasis.
   Objective: To examine epistasis between NRG1 and selected
   N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate pathway partners implicated in its
   effects, including ERBB4, AKT1, DLG4, NOS1, and NOS1AP.
   Design: Schizophrenia case-control sample analyzed using machine
   learning algorithms and logistic regression with follow-up using
   neuroimaging on an independent sample of healthy controls.
   Participants: A referred sample of schizophrenic patients (n = 296)
   meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorder and a
   volunteer sample of controls for case-control comparison (:1 = 365) and
   a separate volunteer sample of controls for neuroimaging (n=172).
   Main Outcome Measures: Epistatic association between single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) and case-control status; epistatic association
   between SNPs and the blood oxygen level dependent physiological response
   during working memory measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: We observed interaction between NRG1 5' and 3' SNPs rs4560751
   and rs3802160 (likelihood ratio test P=.00020) and schizophrenia, which
   was validated using functional magnetic resonance imaging of working
   memory in healthy controls; carriers of risk-associated genotypes showed
   inefficient processing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P=.015,
   familywise error corrected). We observed epistasis between NRG1
   (rs10503929; Thr286/289/294Met) and its receptor ERBB4 (rs1026882;
   likelihood ratio test P=.035); a 3-way interaction with these 2 SNPs and
   AKT1 (rs2494734) was also observed (odds ratio, 27.13; 95\% confidence
   interval, 3.30-223.03; likelihood ratio test P=.042). These same 2-and
   3-way interactions were further biologically validated via functional
   magnetic resonance imaging: healthy individuals carrying risk genotypes
   for NRG1 and ERBB4, or these 2 together with AKT1, were
   disproportionately less efficient in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   processing. Lower-level interactions were not observed between
   NRG1/ERBB4 and AKT1 in association or neuroimaging, consistent with
   biological evidence that NRG1 X ERBB4 interaction modulates downstream
   AKT1 signaling.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest complex epistatic effects implicating an
   NRG1 molecular pathway in cognitive brain function and the pathogenesis
   of schizophrenia. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2010;67(10):991-1001}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban
   development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide
   these services. In this paper we first address the most important
   ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well
   accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for
   example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a
   high-quality living environment and important for public health.
   Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide
   sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance,
   estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an
   urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon
   sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large
   and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological
   connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks
   and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species
   and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level
   ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in
   urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and
   land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining
   ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in
   planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an
   opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable
   urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban
   regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for
   land-use planning.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study : The density of wood is highly correlated with the
   ability of stems and roots to resist bending or twisting, which is
   important for evaluating the mechanical behavior of trees. It also
   provides a measure of carbon storage, which is an important variable in
   modeling ecosystem processes and tree construction costs. However, most
   measurements of the density and mechanical properties of wood have
   little direct bearing on understanding the biomechanics of living plants
   because they are based on kiln-or air-dried samples.
   Methods : Here, we present and analyze the relationships between four
   important mechanical properties (Young's modulus, the modulus of
   rupture, and the maximum strength in shearing and in compression) and
   the density of green wood (i.e., wood at 50\% moisture content) from a
   worldwide, taxonomically broad spectrum of 161 species.
   Key results : These data indicate that each of the mechanical properties
   disproportionately increases across species with increasing green wood
   density, i.e., stems composed of denser green wood are
   disproportionately stiffer and stronger than stems with equivalent
   cross-sections composed of less dense green wood.
   Conclusions : Although denser wood may have a higher carbon construction
   cost, the mechanical benefits of denser woods likely outweigh the extra
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Impinging stream dryer has proven to be an excellent alternative means
   for removing surface moisture of particulate materials. In this study, a
   coaxial two-impinging stream dryer prototype for paddy, whose surface
   moisture needs to be removed prior to subsequent processing, was
   developed and tested. The effects of various operating and geometric
   parameters, i.e., inlet air temperature, impinging distance, particle
   flow rate and particle feeding characteristics (single-point feeding vs.
   double-point feeding), on the overall performance (in terms of the
   volumetric water evaporation rate and volumetric heat transfer
   coefficient) and energy consumption of the dryer were then studied. It
   was found that the developed impinging stream dryer could reduce the
   moisture content of paddy by 3.4-7.7\% (d.b.) within a very short period
   of time. The maximum value of the volumetric water evaporation rate was
   found to be about 198 kg(water)/m(3) h, while the maximum value of the
   volumetric heat transfer coefficient was about 7013 W/m(3) K. The mean
   residence time of the particles (paddy) in the system was in the range
   of 1.81-2.42 s, leading to average drying rate in the range of 1.52-3.83
   (\% d.b.) s(-1), which is about 250 and 40 times higher than spouted-bed
   and fluidized-bed dryers, respectively. The lowest total specific energy
   consumption of the process was 5.1 MJ/kg(water) when using double-point
   particle feeding at an inlet air temperature of 110 degrees C, an
   impinging distance of 5 cm and particle flow rate of 150 kg(dry)

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - To study mortality in relation to fasting plasma glucose
   (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose levels within the normoglycemic range.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Data from 19 European cohorts comprising
   12,566 men and 10,874 women who had FOG <6.1 mmol/l and 2-h plasma
   glucose <7.8 mmol/l at baseline examination were analyzed.
   Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% Cls for deaths from
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), non-CVD, and all causes were estimated for
   individuals whose 2-h plasma glucose > FPG (group II) compared with
   those whose 2-h plasma glucose <= FPG (group I).
   RESULTS A total of 827 (246) CVD and 611 (351) non-CVD and 1,438 (597)
   all-cause deaths occurred in men (women). Group II was older and had
   higher BMI, blood pressure, and fasting insulin than group I. The
   multivariate-adjusted HRs (95\% CIs) for CVD, non-CVD, and all-cause
   mortality were 1.22 (1.05-1.41), 1.09 (0.92-1.29), and 1.16 (1.04-1.30)
   in men and 1.40 (1.03-1.89), 0.99 (0.79-1.25), and 1.13 (0.94-1.35) in
   women, respectively, for group II as compared with group I. Hits were
   1.25 (1.05.1.50), 1.09 (0.89-1.34), and I 18 (1.03-1.35) in men and 1.60
   (1.03-2.48), 1.05 (0.78-1.42), and 1 18 (0.93-1.51) in women,
   respectively, after additional adjustment for fasting insulin in a
   subgroup of individuals.
   CONCLUSIONS - In individuals with both FOG and 2-h plasma glucose within
   the normoglycemic range, high 2-h plasma glucose was associated with
   insulin resistance and increased CVD mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe variations in anterior chamber width (ACW) and
   investigate its association with the presence of narrow angles.
   Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We recruited 2047 subjects
   aged 50 years or more from a community polyclinic and 111 subjects with
   primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG)
   from an eye hospital in Singapore.
   Methods: All participants underwent gonioscopy, anterior chamber depth
   (ACD) and axial length (AL) measurement (IOLMaster; Carl Zeiss, Jena,
   Germany), and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT,
   Visante, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software was used
   to measure the ACW, defined as the distance between the scleral spurs in
   the horizontal (nasal-temporal) axis of AS-OCT scans. An eye was deemed
   to have narrow angles if the posterior trabecular meshwork was not
   visible for at least 180 degrees on non-indentation gonioscopy with the
   eye in the primary position.
   Main Outcome Measures: Anterior chamber width and narrow angles.
   Results: Data on 1465 community-based subjects were available for
   analysis. Anterior chamber width was significantly smaller in women
   compared with men (11.70 mm vs. 11.81 mm, respectively, P<0.001) and
   decreased significantly with age (P for trend <0.001). Significant
   predictors of smaller ACW were lower educational level, lower body mass
   index, shorter AL, shallower ACD, and Chinese race. Of the 1465
   subjects, 315 (21.5\%) had narrow angles on gonioscopy. Mean ACW was
   smaller in eyes with narrow angles compared with those without narrow
   angles (11.60 mm vs. 11.80 mm, P<0.001). The age- and gender-adjusted
   odds ratio for the highest quartile compared with the lower 3 quartiles
   of ACW with the presence of narrow angles was 3.4 (95\% confidence
   interval, 2.3-5.0; P for trend <0.001). Hospital-based subjects with
   PAC/PACG had even smaller ACW than community subjects with narrow angles
   (11.33 mm vs. 11.60 mm, P<0.001).
   Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, ACW was smaller in women,
   Chinese persons, and older persons, and was associated with narrow
   angles in 2 different study populations. These data suggest that a
   smaller ACW may represent a novel risk indicator for angle closure.}},

Abstract = {{The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops
   gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat,
   this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th
   day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and
   newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during
   prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study
   was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted
   feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN
   of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an
   entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were
   entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under
   conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under
   constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the
   experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their
   resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene
   expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of
   1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept
   under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp
   expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene
   expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers
   maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the
   pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL
   restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the
   SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock
   is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN.
   However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking,
   such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an
   important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal
   ontogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Processes involving the production of D{*} mesons and A(c) baryons in
   electron-positron annihilation at the energies of 10.58 and 91.18 GeV
   are considered. At the energy of 10.58 GeV, the production of pairs of B
   mesons that is followed by their decay to charmed particles is analyzed
   along with direct charm production. The violation of scaling in the
   respective fragmentation functions is taken into account in the
   next-to-leading-logarithmic approximation of perturbative QCD. The
   required nonperturbative fragmentation functions are extracted
   numerically from experimental data obtained at B factories and are
   approximated by simple analytic expressions. It is shown that the
   difference in the nonperturbative fragmentation functions for
   transitions to mesons and baryons can readily be explained on the basis
   of the quark-counting rules.}},

   The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design in split-plot,

   glyphosate effectiveness, hedge re-growth, soybean plant height, pod
   number, first pod height, lodging, harvest difficulty, mass of 100 seeds
   and yield. It was concluded that B. decumbens and B. brizantha provided
   adequate coverage of soil throughout the crop cycle; glyphosate rate of
   1.44 kg i.a. ha(-1) was sufficient to control the two Brachiaria
   species; and soybean yield was not affected significantly by the straw
   of the two species, or by glyphosate rate, while fluazifop-butyl-p +
   fomesafen application as complementary control led to greater yield and

Abstract = {{Fruits and vegetables are among the most nutritious and healthy of
   foods, and are related to the prevention of many chronic diseases. The
   aim of the study was to examine the relationship between intake of
   different plant foods and cognitive performance in elderly individuals
   in a cross-sectional study. Two thousand and thirty-one elderly subjects
   (aged 70-74 years; 55\% women) recruited from the general population in
   Western Norway underwent extensive cognitive testing and completed a
   comprehensive FFQ. The cognitive test battery covered several domains
   (Kendrick Object Learning Test, Trail Making Test - part A, modified
   versions of the Digit Symbol Test, Block Design, Mini-Mental State
   Examination and Controlled Oral Word Association Test). A validated and
   self-reported FFQ was used to assess habitual food intake. Subjects with
   intakes of > 10th percentile of fruits, vegetables, grain products and
   mushrooms performed significantly better in cognitive tests than those
   with very low or no intake. The associations were strongest between
   cognition and the combined intake of fruits and vegetables, with a
   marked dose-dependent relationship up to about 500 g/d. The dose-related
   increase of intakes of grain products and potatoes reached a plateau at
   about 100-150 g/d, levelling off or decreasing thereafter, whereas the
   associations were linear for mushrooms. For individual plant foods, the
   positive cognitive associations of carrots, cruciferous vegetables,
   citrus fruits and high-fibre bread were most pronounced. The only
   negative cognitive association was with increased intake of white bread.
   In the elderly, a diet rich in plant foods is associated with better
   performance in several cognitive abilities in a dose-dependent manner.}},

   No. 10, pp. 1951-1958, 2010. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to
   determine the effectiveness of brief intense interval training as
   exercise intervention for promoting health and to evaluate potential
   benefits about common interventions, that is, prolonged exercise and
   strength training. Methods: Thirty-six untrained men were divided into
   groups that completed 12 wk of intense interval running (INT; total
   training time 40 min.wk(-1)), prolonged running (similar to 150
   min.wk(-1)), and strength training (similar to 150 min.wk(-1)) or
   continued their habitual lifestyle without participation in physical
   training. Results: The improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness was
   superior in the INT (14\% +/- 2\% increase in (V) over dotO(2max))
   compared with the other two exercise interventions (7\% +/- 2\% and 3\%
   +/- 2\% increases). The blood glucose concentration 2 h after oral
   ingestion of 75 g of glucose was lowered to a similar extent after
   training in the INT (from 6.1 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 mM, P < 0.05) and
   the prolonged running group (from 5.6 +/- 1.5 to 4.9 +/- 1.1 mM, P <
   0.05). In contrast, INT was less efficient than prolonged running for
   lowering the subjects' resting HR, fat percentage, and reducing the
   ratio between total and HDL plasma cholesterol. Furthermore, total bone
   mass and lean body mass remained unchanged in the INT group, whereas
   both these parameters were increased by the strength-training
   intervention. Conclusions: INT for 12 wk is an effective training
   stimulus for improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness and glucose
   tolerance, but in relation to the treatment of hyperlipidemia and
   obesity, it is less effective than prolonged training. Furthermore and
   in contrast to strength training, 12 wk of INT had no impact on muscle
   mass or indices of skeletal health.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma cells share two key
   characteristics: pluripotency (the ability to differentiate into
   endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm) and self-renewal (the ability to grow
   without change in an untransformed, euploid state). Much has been done
   to identify and characterize transcription factors that are necessary or
   sufficient to maintain these characteristics. Oct-4 and Nanog are
   necessary to maintain pluripotency; they are down-regulated at the mRNA
   level by differentiation. There may be additional regulatory genes whose
   mRNA levels are unchanged but whose proteins are destabilized during
   differentiation. We generated proteome-wide, quantitative profiles of ES
   and embryonal carcinoma cells during differentiation, replicating a
   microarray-based study by Aiba et al. (Aiba, K., Sharov, A. A., Carter,
   M. G., Foroni, C., Vescovi, A. L., and Ko, M. S. (2006) Defining a
   developmental path to neural fate by global expression profiling of
   mouse embryonic stem cells and adult neural stem/progenitor cells. Stem
   Cells 24, 889-895) who triggered differentiation by treatment with 1 mu
   M all-trans-retinoic acid. We identified several proteins whose levels
   decreased during differentiation in both cell types but whose mRNA
   levels were unchanged. We confirmed several of these cases by RT-PCR and
   Western blot. Racgap-1 (also known as mgcRacgap) was particularly
   interesting because it is required for viability of preimplantation
   embryos and hematopoietic stem cells, and it is also required for
   differentiation. To confirm our observation that RACGAP-1 declines
   during retinoic acid-mediated differentiation, we used multiple reaction
   monitoring, a targeted mass spectrometry-based quantitation method, and
   determined that RACGAP-1 levels decline by half during retinoic
   acid-mediated differentiation. We knocked down Racgap-1 mRNA levels
   using a panel of five shRNAs. This resulted in a loss of self-renewal
   that correlated with the level of knockdown. We conclude that RACGAP-1
   is post-transcriptionally regulated during blastocyst development to
   enable differentiation by inhibiting ES cell self-renewal. Molecular \&
   Cellular Proteomics 9:2238-2251, 2010.}},

Abstract = {{In two studies we investigate how level of surveillance moderates
   followers' responses to leaders with whom they either do or do not share
   identity. Study 1 (N=80) demonstrated that imposing high surveillance
   where identity is shared with a leader undermined perceptions of the
   leader as a team member, reducing levels to that of leaders without a
   shared identity. Study 2 (N=84) replicated this finding, also
   demonstrating that willingness to work for the group declined when
   leaders with shared identity used high surveillance (compared to a low
   surveillance condition). This process was partially explained by
   perceptions that surveillance was an invasion of privacy Together, these
   studies illustrate that the benefits of shared identity are easily
   undermined when a leader uses surveillance in a context where it is
   unnecessary. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   sequence database to facilitate molecular identification of the 69
   Fusarium species associated with human or animal mycoses encountered in
   clinical microbiology laboratories. The database comprises partial
   sequences from three nuclear genes: translation elongation factor 1
   alpha (EF-1 alpha), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB1), and
   the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB2). These three gene
   fragments can be amplified by PCR and sequenced using primers that are
   conserved across the phylogenetic breadth of Fusarium. Phylogenetic
   analyses of the combined data set reveal that, with the exception of two
   monotypic lineages, all clinically relevant fusaria are nested in one of
   eight variously sized and strongly supported species complexes. The
   monophyletic lineages have been named informally to facilitate
   communication of an isolate's clade membership and genetic diversity. To
   identify isolates to the species included within the database, partial
   DNA sequence data from one or more of the three genes can be used as a
   BLAST query against the database which is Web accessible at FUSARIUM-ID
   (http://isolate.fusariumdb.org) and the Centraalbureau voor
   Schimmel-cultures (CBS-KNAW) Fungal Biodiversity Center
   (http://www.cbs.knaw.nl/fusarium). Alternatively, isolates can be
   identified via phylogenetic analysis by adding sequences of unknowns to
   the DNA sequence alignment, which can be downloaded from the two
   aforementioned websites. The utility of this database should increase
   significantly as members of the clinical microbiology community deposit
   in internationally accessible culture collections (e.g., CBS-KNAW or the
   Fusarium Research Center) cultures of novel mycosis-associated fusaria,
   along with associated, corrected sequence chromatograms and data, so
   that the sequence results can be verified and isolates are made
   available for future study.}},

Abstract = {{The construct of work personality has been linked to the development of
   effective work behaviors and overall vocational adjustment for
   individuals with disabilities. One conceptualization of work personality
   that has received consideration in the rehabilitation research
   literature is the construct of developmental work personality (DWP). The
   primary strengths of the DWP model are that it is grounded in
   developmental, learning, and work theories that have been widely
   validated with multiple populations in a variety of contexts and that
   the model is designed to explain components of the work personality,
   described by Neff as being ``semi-autonomous.{''} The purpose of this
   study is to provide evidence of the psychometric properties of the DWP
   scale in samples of persons eligible to receive vocational
   rehabilitation services. The results of this three-phase study reveal
   empirically defined factors of the scale that correspond to the DWP
   model, adequate convergent validity measures, and adequate to good
   internal and temporal reliability coefficients in a sample of students.
   Recommendations for best use of the model and scale are included.}},

   incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles with higher or lower refractive
   index. The paper presents our experimental results regarding the
   preparation of hybrid nanocomposite films with controlled refractive

   characterized using spectroellipsometry, UV-VIS spectroscopy, AFM, TEM
   and the optical properties were correlated with processing parameters.
   Micro/nano pattering techniques based on combination of electron beam
   lithography and replication techniques have been developed to obtain

Abstract = {{The Idaho National Laboratory (INL), under the auspices of the U.S.
   Department of Energy, is conducting research on the Very High
   Temperature Reactor (VHTR) design concept for the Next Generation
   Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project. The reactor design will be a graphite
   moderated, thermal neutron spectrum reactor that will produce
   electricity and hydrogen in a highly efficient manner. The NGNP reactor
   core will be either a prismatic graphite block type core or a pebble bed
   core. The NGNP will use very high-burnup, low-enriched uranium,
   TRISO-coated fuel, and have a projected plant design service life of 60
   years. The VHTR concept is considered to be the nearest-term reactor
   design that has the capability to efficiently produce hydrogen. The
   plant size, reactor thermal power, and core configuration will ensure
   passive decay heat removal without fuel damage or radioactive material
   releases during reactor core-accidents. The objectives of the NGNP
   Project are to: Demonstrate a full-scale prototype VHTR that is
   commercially licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
   Demonstrate safe and economical nuclear-assisted production of hydrogen
   and electricity. The DOE laboratories, led by the INL, perform research
   and development (R\&D) that will be critical to the success of the NGNP,
   primarily in the areas of: high temperature gas reactor fuels behaviour,
   high temperature materials qualification, design methods development and
   validation, hydrogen production technologies energy conversion. This
   paper presents current R\&D work that addresses fundamental thermal
   hydraulics issues that are relevant to a variety of possible NGNP
   designs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   conclusions: t(10; I 7) is associated with poorly differentiated acute
   leukemia subtype {[}90\%; eight cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML MO,
   M1) and one case of acute undifferentiated leukemia], phagocytic
   activity by blasts occurs (30\%), and the survival time was short in
   three of the seven t( I 0;1 7) cases for whom follow-up data were
   available (median, 8 months). More clinical studies concerning the
   prognosis, treatment response, and survival of patients with t(10;17)
   are necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a context-aware food recommendation system for
   well-being care applications. The proposed system, called u-BabSang,
   provides individualized food recommendation lists at the dining table,
   and is based dietary advice in the typical Korean medical text. Our
   proposed system receives a user's profile, physiological signals, and
   environmental information around the dining table in real time. To
   operate our system, we present a method for user specified analysis, and
   also describe time-division layered context integration which integrates
   the multiple contexts obtained from the sensors. Thus, our system
   recommends appropriate foods for each individual's health at the table
   in real time.}},

Abstract = {{P>Although AIMP3/p18 is normally associated with the macromolecular tRNA
   synthetase complex, recent reports have revealed a new role of AIMP3 in
   tumor suppression. In this study, we generated a transgenic mouse that
   overexpresses AIMP3 and characterized the associated phenotype in vivo
   and in vitro. Surprisingly, the AIMP3 transgenic mouse exhibited a
   progeroid phenotype, and the cells that overexpressed AIMP3 showed
   accelerated senescence and defects in nuclear morphology. We found that
   overexpression of AIMP3 resulted in proteasome-dependent degradation of
   mature lamin A, but not of lamin C, prelamin A, or progerin. The
   resulting imbalance in the protein levels of lamin A isoforms, namely
   altered stoichiometry of prelamin A and progerin to lamin A, appeared to
   be responsible for a phenotype that resembled progeria. An increase in
   the level of endogenous AIMP3 has been observed in aged human tissues
   and cells. The findings in this report suggest that AIMP3 is a specific
   regulator of mature lamin A and imply that enhanced expression of AIMP3
   might be a factor driving cellular and/or organismal aging.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrapure soft water (UPSW) is water in which calcium and magnesium ions
   have been replaced with sodium ions using a cation-exchange resin. We
   recently demonstrated that washing with soap and UPSW reduced the
   clinical severity of dermatitis and improved the skin barrier function
   in NC/NgaTnd mice, a murine model for human atopic dermatitis. The
   purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of shampoo
   treatment with UPSW for dogs with pruritus. Eleven dogs with pruritus
   were randomly assigned to two groups depending on whether they received
   weekly shampoo treatment with UPSW or tap water for 4 weeks. After a
   washout period, the treatment protocol was switched such that each dog
   received both treatments. The pre-treatment and post-treatment values of
   the following were compared: pruritus scores assessed by the owners;
   dermatitis scores recorded by an investigator; and transepidermal water
   loss (TEWL). Shampoo treatment with UPSW significantly decreased
   pruritus and dermatitis scores in the dogs, whereas shampoo treatment
   with tap water did not. In addition, shampoo treatment with UPSW, but
   not with tap water, significantly reduced TEWL in the dogs. Adverse
   events due to the treatment were not observed in the dogs. Furthermore,
   we found that topical application of UPSW for barrier-disrupted skin
   caused by tape stripping in healthy dogs decreased TEWL more rapidly
   than topical application of tap water. Our findings suggest that shampoo
   treatment with UPSW promotes skin barrier recovery and thus could be
   considered as a possible therapeutic option in the management of
   pruritus and dermatitis in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the feasibility of self-complementary adeno-associated
   virus (scAAV) vector-mediated knockdown of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
   complex using small interfering RNAs directed against the E1 alpha
   subunit gene (PDHA1). AAV serotype 8 was used to stereotaxically deliver
   scAAV8-si3-PDHA1-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (knockdown) or
   scAAV8-EGFP (control) vectors into the right striatum and substantia
   nigra of rats. Rotational asymmetry was employed to quantify abnormal
   rotation following neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal system. By 20
   weeks after surgery, the siRNA-injected rats exhibited higher
   contralateral rotation during the first 10 min following amphetamine
   administration and lower 90-min total rotations (p Expression of PDC E1
   alpha, E1 beta and E2 subunits in striatum was decreased (p <= 0.05) in
   the siRNA-injected striatum after 14 weeks. By week 25, both PDC
   activity and expression of Eke were lower (p 0.05) in siRNA-injected
   striata compared to controls. E1 alpha expression was associated with
   PDC activity (R-2=0.48; p=0.006) and modestly associated with
   counterclockwise rotation (R-2=0.51; p=0.07). The use of tyrosine-mutant
   scAAV8 vectors resulted in similar to 17-fold increase in transduction
   efficiency of rat striatal neurons in vivo. We conclude that
   scAAV8-siRNA vector-mediated knockdown of PDC Eke in brain regions
   typically affected in humans with PDC deficiency results in a
   reproducible biochemical and clinical phenotype in rats that may be
   further enhanced with the use of tyrosine-mutant vectors. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the results of
   accelerated hyperfractionation for patients with modeletaly advanced (T2
   and T3) laryngeal cancer.
   Between 1998 and 2007, 9 supraglottic carcinomas (6 T2N0M0, 2 T2N2M0, 1
   T3N0M0), 30 glottic carcinomas (25 T2N0M0, 5 T3N0M0), and 1 T2N0M0
   subglottic carcinoma were treated with definitive radiotherapy using
   accelerated hyperfractionation without concurrent chemotherapy. The
   dose-fractionation for 35 patients was 72.8 Gy/56 fractions/5.6 weeks,
   and that for four patients treated between 1998 and 2001 was 72 Gy/60
   fractions/6 weeks. One patient who had been treated with steroid therapy
   for systemic lupus erythematosus was treated by 67.8 Gy/44 fractions/4.4
   weeks.
   The local control and overall survival probabilities at 5 years for
   supraglottic carcinomas were 75\% and 86\%, respectively. Those for
   glottic carcinomas were 80\% and 92\%, respectively. The 5-year local
   control probabilities for T2 and T3 tumors were 85\% and 56\%,
   respectively. This excellent local control rate especially for T2
   laryngeal carcinomas may be attributable to the effect of accelerated
   hyperfractionation. No late toxicities of grade 2 or more was noted
   among the 39 patients treated with 72.8 Gy/56 fractions or 72 Gy/60
   fractions.
   Accelerated hyperfractionation of 72.8 Gy/56 fractions/5.6 weeks using
   1.3 Gy/fraction seems a safe and effective dose-fractionation for
   patients with moderately advanced laryngeal carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are likely to
   develop intracranial events. Due to the spread of highly active
   antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients now survive
   longer, and metastatic non-AIDS-defining carcinoma is increasing. A
   49-year-old man with HIV infection undergoing treatment with HAART
   developed an intratumoral hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe. He was
   diagnosed as having lung adenocarcinoma and was found to have a brain
   metastasis with bleeding. After treatment for intratumoral bleeding, a
   contralateral frontal lobe hemorrhage occurred within a month. The
   patient underwent a second craniotomy and removal of hematoma, followed
   by whole-brain radiotherapy. He was then treated with four cycles of
   cisplatin and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy while receiving
   HAART. A partial response was achieved, though he developed severe
   hematological toxicities for which the doses of chemotherapy needed to
   be decreased. However, as a result of treatment, his activities of daily
   life recovered gradually. This lung cancer patient had been alive for 17
   months despite the coexistence of two disorders with a poor prognosis,
   HIV infection and bleeding brain metastases from lung cancer. This case
   revealed that physicians must include non-AIDS-defining cancer
   metastasis to the brain in the differential diagnosis of HIV-infected
   patients when they show stroke-like symptoms, and such patients may
   respond to treatment as well as non-HIV-infected patients with advanced
   lung cancer.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of total circulation and entrainment of ambient fluid
   during laminar vortex ring formation has been addressed in a number of
   previous investigations. Motivated by applications involving propulsion
   and fluid transport, the present interest is in the momentum evolution
   of entrained and ejected fluid and momentum exchange among the ejected,
   entrained fluid and added mass during vortex ring formation. To this
   end, vortex rings are generated numerically by transient jet ejection
   for fluid slug length-to-diameter (L/D) ratios of 0.5-3.0 using three
   different velocity programs {[}trapezoidal, triangular negative slope
   (NS), and positive slope (PS)] at a jet Reynolds number of 1,000.
   Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) were utilized to identify ejected
   and entrained fluid boundaries, and a Runge-Kutta fourth order scheme
   was used for advecting these boundaries with the numerical velocity
   data. By monitoring the center of mass of these fluid boundaries,
   momentum of each component was calculated and related to the total
   impulse provided by the vortex ring generator. The results demonstrate
   that ejected fluid exchanges its momentum mostly with added mass during
   jet ejection and that the momentum of the entrained fluid at jet
   termination was < 11\% of the total ring impulse in all cases except for
   the triangular NS case. Following jet termination, momentum exchange was
   observed between ejected and entrained fluid yielding significant
   increase in entrained fluid's momentum. A performance metric was defined
   relating the impulse from over-pressure developed at the nozzle exit
   plane during jet ejection to the flow evolution, which increased
   preferentially with L/D over the range considered. An additional benefit
   of this study was the identification of the initial (i.e., before jet
   initiation) location of the fluid to be entrained into the vortex ring.}},

Title = {{Effect of plant neutrophil elastase inhibitor on leucocyte migration,

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{899-910}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   The serine and cysteine peptidase inhibitor, BbCI, isolated from
   Bauhinia bauhinioides seeds, is similar to the classical plant Kunitz
   inhibitor, STI, but lacks disulphide bridges and methionine residues.
   BbCI blocks activity of the serine peptidases, elastase (K-iapp 5.3 nM)
   and cathepsin G (K-iapp 160.0 nM), and the cysteine peptidase cathepsin
   L (K-iapp 0.2 nM). These three peptidases play important roles in the
   inflammatory process.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   We measured the effects of BbCI on paw oedema and on leucocyte
   accumulation in pleurisy, both induced by carrageenan.
   Leucocyte-endothelial cell interactions in scrotal microvasculature in
   Wistar rats were investigated using intravital microscopy. Cytokine
   levels in pleural exudate and serum were measured by ELISA.
   KEY RESULTS
   Pretreatment of the animals with BbCI (2.5 mg.kg(-1)), 30 min before
   carrageenan-induced inflammation, effectively reduced paw oedema and
   bradykinin release, neutrophil migration into the pleural cavity. The
   number of rolling, adhered and migrated leucocytes at the spermatic
   fascia microcirculation following carrageenan injection into the scrotum
   were reduced by BbCI pretreatment. Furthermore, levels of the rat
   chemokine cytokine-induced neutrophil chemo-attractant-1 were
   significantly reduced in both pleural exudates and serum from animals
   pretreated with BbCI. Levels of interleukin-1 beta or tumour necrosis
   factor-alpha, however, did not change.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   Taken together, our data suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties
   of BbCI may be useful in investigations of other pathological processes
   in which human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and cathepsin L play
   important roles.}},

Abstract = {{Subclinical conductive hearing losses (CHLs) can affect otoacoustic
   emissions and therefore limit their potential in the assessment of the
   cochlear function. Theoretical considerations to estimate a minor CHL
   from DPOAE measurements {[}Kummer et al. (2006). HNO 54, 457-467] are
   evaluated experimentally. They are based on the fact, that the level
   difference of the stimulus tones L(1) and L(2) for optimal excitation of
   the inner ear is given by L(1)=aL(2)+b. A CHL is presumed to attenuate
   both L(1) and L(2) to the same extent such that excitation of the inner
   ear is no longer optimal. From the change of L(1) that is necessary to
   restore optimal excitation of the inner ear and thus to produce maximal
   DPOAE levels, the CHL can be estimated. In 10 guinea pig ears an
   experimental CHL was produced, quantified by determination of compound
   action potential (CAP) thresholds at 8 kHz (CHL(CAP)) and estimated from
   DPOAE measurements at 8 kHz (CHL(DPOAE)). CHLs up to 12 dB could be
   assessed. CHL(DPOAE) correlated well with CHL(CAP) (R=0.741, p=0.0142).
   Mean difference between CHL(DPOAE) and CHL(CAP) was 4.2 perpendicular to
   2.6 dB. Estimation of minor CHL from DPOAE measurements might help to
   increase the diagnostic value of DPOAEs. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of

   curves for both pultruded natural fibre reinforced composites at strain
   rates of nearly 1400 s(-1) are illustrated and then compared with
   statically determines stress-strain curve (1.0 x 10(-3) s(-1)). Results
   show that the strain rate does affect the value of dynamic compressive
   properties of both pultruded natural fibre composites. Higher dynamic
   compression modulus and 2.5\% flow stress were recorded for higher
   strain rates as compared to lower strain rate over the range of strain
   rates investigated. Under dynamic loading, jute fibre reinforced
   composites recorded the highest value of dynamic response in terms of
   compression modulus, 2.5\% flow stress and compressive strength than
   that of kenaf fibre reinforced composites. In addition, kenaf fibre
   reinforced composites is more severely damaged as compared to jute fibre
   reinforced composites for all tested strain rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The objective of present study was to assess the simultaneous removal of
   organic pollutants and nutrients by five laboratory scale up-flow
   constructed wetlands (UFCWs). Aerobic and anaerobic regions were well
   developed at the upper and lower beds, respectively, in the UFCW
   reactors with supplementary aeration. The emergent plants employed were
   Phragmites australis and Manchurian wild rice. The COD, T-N, T-P, NH4-N
   and NO3-N removal efficiencies for the UFCW reactors were in the range
   of 90-94\%, 69-92\%, 29-52\%, 59-98\% and 45-100\%, respectively. The
   organic matter and NH4-N removal efficiencies in the aerated wetland
   reactors were better than the non-aerated wetland reactors. The
   supplementary aeration has enhanced the aerobic biodegradation of
   organic matter and nitrification. The Manchurian wild rice outperformed
   P. australis in the removals of T-P, T-N and NH4-N. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
   low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on liver regeneration following
   hepatectomy. Background: LLLT has been found to modulate various
   biological processes. Materials and Methods: Twelve mature male rats
   were used. The liver was exposed, and 70\% of it was excised. The rats
   were assigned randomly to two groups: control, non-laser treated, and
   experimental, laser-treated (diode {[}Ga-Al-As] laser 804 nm) group. For
   determination of newly formed blood vessels and proliferating cells,
   5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally. The rats
   were sacrificed 2 d post hepatectomy, and histological sections from
   each liver were processed for analysis of new blood-vessel formation
   using BrdU immunostaining kit. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were
   assessed using c-kit immunostaining. BrdU-labeled cells were counted as
   for estimation of newly formed hepatic cells. Results: It was found that
   the number of proliferating cells (BrdU positive cells) per area in the
   regenerating regions of the livers were significantly (p<0.01) 2.6-fold
   higher in the laser-treated rats than in the control non-laser-treated
   rats. The density of the newly formed blood vessels and c-kit
   immunopositive cells in the regenerating area of the laser-treated
   livers was significantly (p<0.01) 3.3- and 2.3-fold respectively higher
   than the control non-laser treated livers. Conclusion: It is concluded
   that LLLT following acute hepatectomy most probably stimulates a
   significant enhancement of liver regeneration conducive to both the
   formation of new hepatocytes and MSCs and angiogenesis in the
   regenerating liver.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on patients' accounts of perceptions and experience
   of preoperative home-based interventions to increase health
   professionals' understanding of what is important or not when supporting
   patients preparing for hip replacements.
   Method: A phenomenological approach helped to develop insights into what
   patients found useful or not about preoperative interventions, thus
   developing an understanding of the value of the service from patients'
   perspectives. Data were gathered from 10 participants, using
   semi-structured interviews. Analysis used a seven-step framework for
   phenomenological data analysis.
   Findings: Five main themes emerged: preoperative equipment use increases
   independence, progress and confidence; individual needs are better met
   through timely visits; competent therapist home intervention offers
   reassurance regarding surgery; knowing one's home environment is
   suitable increases confidence in planning hospital discharge after
   surgery; and levels of social support require preoperative assessment.
   The participants identified preoperative home visits as valuable in
   helping to prepare for surgery. Home visits can alleviate preoperative
   anxiety and may contribute to more streamlined discharge planning.
   Visits may help to cut the costs of erroneous equipment provision or
   last-minute equipment deliveries and decrease length of stay.
   Conclusion: This research offers clinicians and managers relevant
   insight into patients' perceptions of home-based services and could work
   alongside quantitative research findings to inform best practice within
   National Health Service resource restrictions.}},

Title = {{Sirius: A web-based system for retinal image analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{722-732}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Retinal image analysis can lead to early detection of several
   pathologies such as hypertension or diabetes. Screening processes
   require the evaluation of a high amount of visual data and, usually, the
   collaboration between different experts and different health care
   centers. These usual routines demand new fast and automatic solutions to
   deal with these situations. This work introduces Sirius (System for the
   Integration of Retinal Images Understanding Services), a web-based
   system for image analysis in the retinal imaging field.
   Methods: Sirius provides a framework for ophthalmologists or other
   experts in the field to collaboratively work using retinal image-based
   applications in a distributed, fast and reliable environment. Sirius
   consists of three main components: the web client that users interact
   with, the web application server that processes all client requests and
   the service module that performs the image processing tasks. In this
   work, we present a service for the analysis of retinal microcirculation
   using a semi-automatic methodology for the computation of the
   arteriolar-to-venular ratio (AVR).
   Results: Sirius has been evaluated in different real environments,
   involving health care systems, to test its performance. First, the AVR
   service was validated in terms of precision and efficiency and then, the
   framework was evaluated in different real scenarios of medical centers.
   Conclusions: Sirius is a web-based application providing a fast and
   reliable work environment for retinal experts. The system allows the
   sharing of images and processed results between remote computers and
   provides automated methods to diminish inter-expert variability in the
   analysis of the images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present the case of a 26 year-old man who developed normally until he
   began having difficulty walking at age 12. He subsequently became unable
   to stand at 15 years old and exhibited mental regression and generalized
   tonic convulsions by age 20. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed
   incomplete myelination of cerebral white matter, which resembled that of
   Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. By sequencing the proteolipid protein 1
   (PLP1) gene, we found a novel mutation (c.352\_353delAG (p.Glyl30fs)) in
   the latter half of exon 3 (exon 3B) that is spliced out in the DM20
   isoform. Exon 3B mutations are known to cause a mild phenotype since
   they do not disturb DM20 production. Mutations that truncate PLP1
   correlate with a mild phenotype by activating the nonsense-mediated
   decay mechanism that specifically detects and degrades mRNAs containing
   a premature termination codon. This attenuates the production of toxic
   mutant PLP1. The very mild presentation in the present case seems to be
   derived from the unique nature of the mutation, which preserves DM20
   production and decreases mutant PLP1. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The azo coupling reaction of N-(2-carboxyethyl)anthranilic acid and
   N,N,N',N'-tetrabis(2-carboxyethyl)-1,3-phenylenediamine with
   diazosulfanilic acid yielded the complexones sodium
   4-N-(2-carboxyethyl)amino-5-carboxyazobenzene-4'-sulfonate (I) and
   2,4-N,N,N',N'-tetrabis(2-carboxyethyl)diaminoazobenzene-4'-sulfonic acid
   (II), respectively. The acidity constants of I and II (20A degrees C, mu
   = 0.1M KCl) were determined to be as follows: for I, pK (00) = 1.29 +/-
   0.13, pK (0) = 2.92 +/- 0.07, pK (1) = 3.92 +/- 0.05, pK (2) = 5.16 +/-
   0.03; for II, pK (00) = 2.35 +/- 0.06, pK (0) = 2.81 +/- 0.09, pK (1) =
   3.21 +/- 0.11, pK (2) = 3.81 +/- 0.09, pK (3) = 4.34 +/- 0.04, pK (4) =
   5.03 +/- 0.06, pK (5) = 6.67 +/- 0.07. The electronic absorption spectra
   of I and II were measured, and acid-base equilibrium scheme for I and II
   in aqueous solutions were suggested. The complexation constants of I and
   II with copper(II) ions were determined to be logK (CuQ) (I) = 5.47 +/-
   0.06 and logK (CuQ) (II) = 5.72 +/- 0.13 (20A degrees C, mu = 0.1 M

Abstract = {{Aims: The rapidly growing industrial and medical use of nanomaterials,
   especially zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, has led to growing concerns
   about their toxicity. Accordingly, the intrinsic genotoxic and cytotoxic
   potential of these nanoparticles have been evaluated. Materials \&
   methods: Using a HEp-2 cell line, cytotoxicity was tested along with
   mitochondrial activity and neutral red uptake assays. The genotoxic
   potential was determined using the Comet and the cytokinesis-blocked
   micronucleus assays. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation events were
   investigated. Results \& conclusion: We found concentration- and
   time-dependent cytotoxicity and an increase in DNA and cytogenetic
   damage with increasing nanoparticle concentrations. Mainly for zinc
   oxide, genotoxicity was clearly associated with an increase in tyrosine
   phosphorylation. Our results suggest that both types of nanoparticles
   can be genotoxic over a range of concentrations without being cytotoxic.}},

Abstract = {{The relevance and use of imaging methods in rheumatology have
   significantly changed in recent decades, especially with regard to the
   diagnosis of inflammatory joint and spinal diseases. Nowadays,
   structural changes in X-ray images are significant outcome parameters
   and end-points for clinical studies, whereas conventional radiology so
   far solely served as a diagnostic tool and to ensure classification
   criteria. Besides achieving clinical remission, the therapeutic goal is
   to stop radiological progression. Stopping radio logical progression
   means functional improvement, quality of life improvement, reduction of
   inability to work, and, last not least, a significant reduction of
   costs. Novel imaging methods like the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   follow this trend and have led to a paradigm shift in diagnosis. Using
   MRI we can detect bony changes, e. g., erosions, inflammatory soft
   tissue changes, e. g., synovitis, and cartilage pathologies (e. g., by
   the dGEMRIC method) much earlier during the course of a disease. Only
   MRI is able to show marrow oedema (osteitis), which is an early sign for
   inflammation and a predictor for erosivity in the joint, as well as new
   bone formation at the spine, e. g., syndesmophytes. The implementation
   of MRI findings as a new parameter for classification criteria is the
   logical consequence of these advantages {[}as it has already been
   performed for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the ASAS criteria]. Imaging
   methods like MRI are becoming increasingly important in therapy control,
   since they allow for a more detailed and more individual monitoring of
   the disease course. Technical advancements of MRI like the low-field MRI
   and the simplified and standardised interpretation of findings with
   scoring methods have led to an expanded use of MRI as well as to new
   indications in clinic and practice.}},

Abstract = {{The ETS variant gene 6 (ETV6) gene is located at 12p13, and is
   frequently involved in translocations in various human neoplasms,
   resulting in the expression of fusion proteins consisting of the
   amino-terminal part of ETV6 and unrelated transcription factors or
   protein tyrosine kinases. Leukemia with t(1;12)(q21;p13) was previously
   described in a 5-year-old boy with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-M2)
   who exhibited a novel ETV6-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
   translocator (ARNT) fusion protein. We herein report the case of a
   2-year-old boy with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) harboring
   t(1;12)(q21;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a ETV6
   dual-color DNA probe revealed that the split signals of the ETV6 gene in
   96.7\% of bone marrow cells, indicating rearrangement of the ETV6 gene.
   Therefore, we performed a FISH analysis with bacterial artificial
   chromosome (BAC) probes containing the ARNT, BCL9, and MLLTI1 genes
   located at 1q21, and these results indicated that the ARNT gene might be
   involved in the t(1;12)(q21;p13). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
   reaction analysis disclosed the existence of a ETV6-ARNT fusion gene. To
   our knowledge, the current report is novel in its report of the
   ETV6-ARNT fusion in childhood T-ALL. The ETV6 ARNT fusion is associated
   not only with AML but also with T-ALL. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   in four different coatings applied by using 5-10-20 \% Al2O3 ratio in
   ZrO2 + Y2O3 and ZrO2 + Y2O3. For this purpose, microstructure images of
   the coated layers were taken in optical microscope and SEM, EDX and XRD
   analyses were performed and their microhardness values were measured. It
   was observed that a porous structure occurred in the coatings containing
   ZrO2 + Y2O3/Al2O3. The coatings containing Al2O3 showed higher
   microhardness values than the one without Al2O3, and depending on the
   increase of Al2O3 amount, the amount of porosity increased and

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been found to adopt two stable conformations in
   vivo: (1) a monomeric form called the PP-fold in which a polyproline
   tail is folded onto an alpha-helix via a beta-turn and (2) a dimeric
   form of the unfolded proteins in which the alpha-helices interact with
   each other via side chains. The transition pathway and rates between the
   two conformations remain unknown and are important to the nature of the
   binding of the protein. Toward addressing this question, the present
   work suggests that the unfolding of the PP-fold is too slow to play a
   role in NPY monomeric binding unless the receptor catalyzes it to do so.
   Specifically, the dynamics and structural changes of the unfolding of a
   monomeric NPY protein have been investigated in this work. Temperature
   accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 500 K under constant
   (N,V,E) conditions suggests a hinge-like unraveling of the tail rather
   than a random unfolding. The free energetics of the proposed unfolding
   pathway have been described using an adaptive steered MD (SMD) approach
   at various temperatures. This approach generalizes the use of
   Jarzynski's equality through a series of stages that allows for better
   convergence along nonlinear and long-distance pathways. Results acquired
   using this approach provide a potential of mean force (PM F) with
   narrower error bars and are consistent with some of the earlier reports
   on the qualitative behavior of NPY binding.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Right-sided arcus aorta (RSAA) is a rare condition and
   usually asymptomatic. However, it may be symptomatic if it causes
   tracheal or esophageal compression. Methods. The authors evaluated
   clinical and radiological features of seven patients with RSAA who had
   the diagnosis between May 2006 and May 2009. Results. The authors found
   that the incidence of RSAA was 0.16\% in patients who had applied to
   their clinic. The age of patients ranged from 17 to 55 years. The male
   to female ratio was 6/1. Four patients were symptomatic due to RSAA.
   Most common symptoms were dyspnea during exercise, which is similar to
   exercise-induced asthma and dysphagia. Two patients were misdiagnosed as
   asthma. The flow-volume curves on spirometry of the patients showed
   intrathoracic upper airway obstruction. Thorax magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) revealed marked narrowing of the tracheal air column due
   to external compression of RSAA in three patients. Conclusions. RSAA
   should be included in the differential diagnosis of asthma. Spirometry
   may help to suspect RSAA. Thorax computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI are
   the best imaging methods for the diagnosis of RSAA.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a medically untreatable
   condition for which stem cells have created hope. Pre-clinical and
   clinical studies have established that these cells are safe for
   transplantation. The dose dependency, survivability, route of
   administration, cell migration to injury site and effect on sensory and
   motor behavior in an SCI-induced paraplegic model were studied. Methods.
   A spinal cord contusion injury model was established in rats. Bone
   marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were tagged to facilitate
   tracing in vivo. Two different doses (2 and 5 million cells/kg body
   weight) and two different routes of infusion (site of injury and lumbar
   puncture) were tested during and after the spinal shock period. The
   animals were tested post-transplantation for locomotor capacity, motor
   control, sensory reflex, posture and body position. Stem cell migration
   was observed 1 month post-transplantation in spinal cord sections.
   Results. The overall results demonstrated that transplantation of BM MSC
   significantly improved the locomotor and sensory behavior score in the
   experimental group compared with the sham control group, and these
   results were dose dependent. All the infused stem cells could be
   visualized at the site of injury and none was visualized at the injected
   site. This indicated that the cells had survived in vivo, were probably
   chemoattracted and had migrated to the lesion site. Conclusions. MSC
   transplanted with a lumbar puncture method migrate to the site of injury
   and are the most suitable for SCI healing. These cells demonstrate a
   dose-dependent effect and promote functional recovery when injected
   during or after the spinal shock period.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term oxidation behaviour of eight ferritic steels with 20-29 wt.\%
   chromium (F 20 T, TUS 220 M, AL 453, Crofer 22 APU, Crofer 22 H, Sanergy
   HT, E-Brite and AL 29-4C) has been studied. The samples were cut into
   square coupons, ground and annealed for 140-1000 h at 1173 K in flowing,
   wet hydrogen, air and pure oxygen. The reaction kinetics was followed by
   mass increase of individual samples over time. Parabolic rate law was
   observed for most measurements. The respective rate constants have been
   evaluated and compared. The chemical composition of the oxide scale was
   investigated by XRD and SEM/EDXS. The major constituent is chromium
   oxide. Other oxides, such as (Mn, Cr)(3)O-4, MnTiO3, SiO2 or Al2O3, are
   also present in different amounts depending on the chemical composition
   of the steel. The oxidation rate increases with increasing oxygen
   partial pressure and decreasing chromium concentration. Chromium
   diffusion coefficients in Cr2O3 and parabolic rate constants are
   compared. The reaction mechanism for the chromia formation is suggested.
   The results are discussed with respect to the applications of the steels
   in a working solid oxide electrolyser cell stack. Furthermore,
   suggestions for the development of a superior alloy composition are
   given. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of the histone genes is tightly coupled to rates of DNA
   synthesis in yeast and histone mRNAs are modulated both
   transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.
   Trf4 and Trf5, poly(A) polymerases, that mediates polyadenylation and
   consequent degradation) and Rrp6, an exosome component, play a role in
   the regulation of histone mRNA levels.
   In this paper we show that in the mRNA degradation mutant Kllsm4 Delta
   1, histone mRNAs are induced early in the S-phase and maintained at high
   level all along the entire cell cycle due to a delay in the exit from
   S-phase and/or entry into M-phase.
   The overexpression of the HIR1 gene (Histone transcriptional repressor),
   previously isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the apoptotic
   phenotypes observed in Kllsm4 Delta 1, can also restore the normal
   cycling of histone genes expression.
   We also found that low doses of hydroxyurea neutralize the onset of the
   apoptotic phenotypes in Kllsm4 Delta 1, as well in another mRNA
   decapping mutants (lsm1) and, in addition, increase the chronological
   lifespan in both strains suggesting that an entry delay into the S phase
   can recover some cellular defects in decapping mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Expanded graphite (EG) shows higher adsorption capacity for oils such as
   salad oil and SD300 oil than polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different MW
   (4000, 10000, 20000). To illustrate their different adsorption
   mechanism, adsorption capacities of EG for these pollutants are firstly
   detected. And then stepwise adsorption for oils is carried out with EG
   which has been saturated first by PEG with different MW. Then difference
   between stepwise adsorbance of oil is checked with deviation analysis.
   Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analysis is used to show structure
   difference of EG adsorbed different adsorbates. It is testified
   adsorption isotherms of PEG are all type I, PEG molecules lay flat on EG
   surface and equilibrium adsorbance decrease with the increase of PEG MW.
   Adsorbance for SD 300 oil and salad oil can reach 131.3 g/g and 127.8
   g/g respectively. Deviation analysis for stepwise adsorbance of oil
   shows no statistical significance. EG saturated firstly by PEG, still
   has an average adsorption capacity of 98 g/g for SD300 oil and 85 g/g
   for salad oil and it does not change with the initial PEG concentration.
   SEM photos illustrate the adsorption of oil on EG is mainly filling. In
   the adsorption of PEG water solution, there is severe breakage of the

Abstract = {{Aim of the study. Firefighting involves quite a number of risks, which
   makes personal protection equipment (PPE) such as self-contained
   breathing apparatus (SCBA) or protective clothing vital. This equipment
   generates extra constraints, which increase those inherent in fire
   extinguishment. Our study aimed to analyse the variations of the
   physiological parameters caused by PPE in hot environments, so as to
   create a course of action for the medical supervision of firefighters
   fighting fires.
   Method. We conducted a survey among 555 firefighters learning to wear
   self-contained breathing apparatus during training sessions carried out
   between January and June 2006 at the Cepari 06 training facility.
   Measurements were made before and immediately after the exercises, and
   then after a ten-minute recovery time period.
   Results. The overall validation rate for the training sessions was 88.5
   \% but the causes of failure varied a lot according to the training
   level. The descriptive analysis of the physiological parameters revealed
   that pulse rate, the body temperature, feeling of fatigue, and
   dehydration dramatically increased after the exercises. We also noticed
   that the range of observed variations increased with the difficulty of
   the exercises for most parameters. There is no strong correlation
   between the various parameters measured.
   Conclusion. From our study, we were able to confirm that working in hot
   environments with PPE generated significant variations in certain
   physiological parameters. The measurements made in our study together
   with data from the literature allowed us to create guidelines for the
   medical supervision of firefighters fighting urban fires. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective. An improvement in perinatal mortality is reported in various
   countries. This is a retrospective analysis of perinatal and neonatal
   mortality in Northwest (NW) Greece.
   Methods. Analysis was made of the births and deaths register in NW
   Greece and records of the regional referral tertiary care center and the
   National Hospitals at the same area for the period 1996-2004. Perinatal
   mortality was analysed according to birthweight (BW) and gestational age
   (GA) for two separate periods, 1996-1999 (I) and 2000-2004 (II),
   corresponding to an increase in antenatal steroid use from 20\% to 63\%.
   Results. Neonatal mortality improved between the two periods in infants
   with very low BW {[}very low birth weight (VLBW), <1500 g] and the very
   preterm infants (<28 weeks GA). Severe respiratory distress syndrome
   (RDS) decreased (p<0.001) for infants with GA <= 34 weeks and those with
   BW 751-1500 g (p<0.02), and perinatal asphyxia is no longer a leading
   cause of death. Intrauterine transfer increased (p<0.001) for infants
   with BW <= 1500 g. The main cause of death as derived from birth records
   and neonatal intensive care unit records is prematurity, alone or with
   complications.
   Conclusions. With the introduction of antenatal steroids and increase in
   intrauterine transfer there has been a decrease in neonatal mortality of
   VLBW infants in NW Greece.}},

Abstract = {{Multidomain traffic engineering (TE) has the potential not only of
   guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) to connections spanning
   multiple domains but also of effectively utilizing intradomain
   resources. The hierarchical Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) External
   Network-to-Network Interface (E-NNI) control plane platform has emerged
   as a promising candidate aiming at guaranteeing multidomain QoS
   provisioning. Recent efforts have been made to extend OIF E-NNI in the
   multicarrier scenario. However, open issues such as confidentiality, the
   choice of TE metric, the routing controller (RC) architecture, the path
   computation method, and the abstraction schemes responsible for
   selecting the appropriate value of the TE metric to be announced have
   not been addressed yet. In this study, what we believe to be a novel RC
   architecture integrating the path computation element (PCE) is proposed
   to enable the efficient provisioning of end-to-end QoS-guaranteed
   services. The key role of the TE metric is analyzed and discussed,
   together with different TE metric abstraction schemes. The end-to-end
   delay is here considered as the most suitable candidate and a novel
   family of such schemes, named delay-bandwidth aware (DBA), are proposed
   and evaluated by means of simulations. Results show the ability of such
   schemes to globally preserve control plane stability and network
   resource utilization while advertising a high service level.}},

Abstract = {{Image restoration attempts to enhance images corrupted by noise and
   blurring effects. Iterative approaches can better control the
   restoration algorithm in order to find a compromise of restoring high
   details in smoothed regions without increasing the noise. Techniques
   based on Projections Onto Convex Sets (POCS) have been extensively used
   in the context of image restoration by projecting the solution onto
   hyperspaces until some convergence criteria be reached. It is expected
   that an enhanced image can be obtained at the final of an unknown number
   of projections. The number of convex sets and its combinations allow
   designing several image restoration algorithms based on POCS. Here, we
   address two convex sets: Row-Action Projections (RAP) and Limited
   Amplitude (LA). Although RAP and LA have already been used in image
   restoration domain, the former has a relaxation parameter (A) that
   strongly depends on the characteristics of the image that will be
   restored, i.e., wrong values of A can lead to poorly restoration
   results. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PS0)-POCS image restoration algorithm, in which the A value is obtained
   by PSO to be further used to restore images by POCS approach. Results
   showed that the proposed PSO-based restoration algorithm outperformed
   the widely used Wiener and Richardson-Lucy image restoration algorithms.

Abstract = {{Explaining pedestrians' crossing behavior along entire trips may
   contribute toward more efficient and targeted planning of pedestrian
   facilities in urban areas and more accurate consideration of pedestrian
   safety. Although existing research on pedestrians' crossing behavior is
   extensive, most related studies examine pedestrians' crossing decisions
   at local level and focus on a particular set of determinants (roadway
   environment, traffic conditions, or human factors). On the contrary,
   crossing behavior along entire trips is seldom explored. This paper
   presents a theoretical framework for modeling pedestrians' crossing
   behavior along a trip, addressing a large part of the difficulties
   involved in collecting the necessary data and setting up a modeling
   framework. First, a topological approach of pedestrian trip
   characteristics and crossing decisions is proposed, allowing
   consideration of distinct patterns of crossing behavior along a trip.
   Moreover, specific techniques from the family of discrete choice models
   are proposed for determining the number and location of pedestrians'
   crossings, accounting for the hierarchical and dynamic nature of
   pedestrians' decisions along a trip. Finally, a field survey method is
   presented, allowing collection of detailed information about
   pedestrians' crossing decisions along urban trips, including data on
   roadway, traffic, and individual characteristics, as well as the
   interactions between pedestrians and motorists. Preliminary results from
   a pilot implementation of the proposed framework are promising, and a
   full-scale application for testing and validation is in progress.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose One pattern of injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex

   to help the surgeon decide how to treat type 1 B lesions in ulnar
   positive patients by directly comparing arthroscopic repair (repair) to
   ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO). The null hypothesis was that repair
   and USO would provide equivalent postoperative improvement with regard
   to motion; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score;
   visual analog scale (VAS) score; and grip strength.
   Methods We tested our hypothesis by retrospectively reviewing
   prospectively collected data from 51 patients treated surgically between
   2000 and 2006 with type 1B tears in the setting of ulnar positive
   variance. Of these 51 patients, 27 were treated with arthroscopic repair
   and 24 with USO. All patients were evaluated before surgery as well as
   at final follow-up for active range of motion measurements, grip
   strength, DASH score, and VAS score. Radiographs were taken of all
   patients before surgery to confirm the presence of ulnar positive
   variance, and after surgery in the USO group to evaluate for bony union.
   Results At the final follow-up, we found no statistically significant
   difference between the repair and USO groups with regard to flexion,
   extension, pronation, supination, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation.
   Likewise, there was no significant difference in grip strength, DASH
   scores, or VAS scores. When analyzing each cohort individually, both
   groups improved significantly after surgery with regard to DASH score,
   VAS score, and wrist extension. There was also a trend toward improved
   motion in all other directions except for an insignificant decrease in
   postoperative pronation in the repair group. Two patients in the USO
   group required additional surgery, with one revision performed for
   nonunion and one for painful hardware, which caused extensor carpi
   ulnaris tendonitis.
   Conclusions The results of our study suggest that type 1B TFCC tears in
   the ulnar positive patient can be managed equivalently well with repair
   or USO. (J Hand Surg 2010;35A:1607-1613. Copyright (C) 2010 by the

Abstract = {{Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)
   is a rare autoimmune disease causing a wide spectrum of autoimmune
   dysfunction potentially including diabetes of an autoimmune etiology. We
   have previously described a pair of discordant APECED siblings and
   pointed to a possible role of 5' insulin variable number of tandem
   repeats (VNTR) locus IDDM2 in the appearance of diabetes within this
   disease. In vitro studies have previously suggested that class I VNTR
   alleles were associated with decreased fetal thymic insulin expression.
   We genotyped the 5' INS VNTR locus and several flanking 11p15.5 markers
   in 5' Finnish APECED subjects and explored the possible contribution of
   IDDM2 in the development of diabetes. The shorter 5' INS VNTR class I
   alleles (<35 repeats) were more prevalent in the diabetic Finnish APECED
   subjects than in non-diabetic APECED subjects. Logistic regression
   analysis revealed that having 1 short (<35) VNTR allele did not increase
   the risk of developing diabetes (95\% CI 0.6-27.0), whereas having 2
   short alleles conferred a 43.5-fold increased risk (95\% CI 3.0-634.6).
   We conclude that short 5' INS VNTR class I alleles play a role in
   susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes in the context of APECED. Genes

Abstract = {{Introduction. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is defined as an
   acute deterioration of a chronic liver disease. The most effective
   treatment in these patients is orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT),
   which is highly limited by the donor shortage. The aim of this study was
   to increase the usefulness of hepatocyte transplantation (HT) as a
   bridge or alternative to OLT.
   Methods. During the last 2 years, we have performed HT in 3 patients
   with ACLF. The diagnosis was graft cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus in
   2 of them, who were already included on waiting lists for
   retransplantation, and the third, unknown alcoholic cirrhosis.
   Results. After the first HT infusion, we observed an improvement in the
   clinical condition in all patients, hyperammonemia, and a partial
   correction of the degree of encephalopathy; 1 patient was retransplanted
   6 days after the first HT.
   Discussion. The main indications for HT are inborn errors of metabolism
   in children. Other indications especially in adults, are acute liver
   failure, ACLF in patients with end-stage-liver disease who are a waiting
   OLT, and acute liver failure after an hepatectomy. HT may be a new
   treatment to improve the clinical condition in patients awaiting OLT.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prostate gland is the most common site of cancer and the
   second leading cause of cancer mortality in American men. It is well
   known that epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation within the
   regulatory (promoter) regions of genes are associated with
   transcriptional silencing in cancer. Promoter hypermethylation of
   critical pathway genes could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic
   targets for prostate cancer.
   Methods: This review discusses current information on methylated genes
   associated with prostate cancer development and progression.
   Results: Over 30 genes have been investigated for promoter methylation
   in prostate cancer. These methylated genes are involved in critical
   pathways, such as DNA repair, metabolism, and invasion/metastasis. The
   role of hypermethylated genes in regulation of critical pathways in
   prostate cancer is reviewed.
   Conclusions: These findings may provide new information of the
   pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Certain epigenetic alterations in
   prostate tumors are being translated into clinical practice for
   therapeutic use.}},

   the data collected from the sampling stations where this species was
   detected with the data from the sampling stations where the species was

   dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, hardness, anionic surfactants,
   tannin, lignin, cyanide, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and soluble reactive
   phosphorus. The preference of the species for a high level of dissolved
   oxygen, the low level of chemical oxygen demand, nitrite and soluble
   reactive phosphorus were the statistically significant results. The low
   levels of ammonia and anionic surfactants and the result regarding
   altitude are also close to the margin for statistical significance. All

   Objective. To describe and apply an optimal classification system for
   the management of subaxial cervical trauma.
   Summary of Background Data. Traumatic injury to the subaxial cervical
   trauma is common yet diagnosis and treatment choices remain
   controversial. The lack of a widely accepted classification system
   contributes to the variation in care.
   Methods. Two clinically relevant questions pertaining to the subaxial
   spine were developed by consensus from a panel of fellowship-trained
   spine trauma surgeons. A literature review identified published
   treatment algorithms for subaxial cervical trauma. Consecutive cases
   presenting to 2 tertiary trauma centers representing a spectrum of
   commonly observed, clinically relevant injury patterns were analyzed and
   the subaxial cervical injury classification system ( SLIC) applied.
   Three representative clinical scenarios of subaxial trauma are presented
   to demonstrate utilization of the treatment algorithm.
   Results. Literature review identified only 1 classification and
   treatment algorithm that met all inclusion criteria. Sixty-five
   consecutive subaxial cervical trauma cases were identified from which 10
   representative injury patterns were selected and described according to
   the SLIC classification system. This was applied to clinical scenarios
   and treatment algorithms derived.
   Conclusion. The SLIC system can be used to reliably and effectively
   classify subaxial cervical trauma. The treatment algorithm described by
   Dvorak et al, Spine 2007; 32: 2620- 9, can be used to guide surgical
   decision-making including surgical approach and the sequence of
   procedures based on injury type.}},

Abstract = {{The composite of wastewater treatment was carried out using activated
   charcoal as adsorbent to remove COD, BOD, color in which various
   parameters like adsorbent dose, contact duration, temperature and
   agitator speed were considered. The adsorbent behavior can be explained
   on the basis of Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model.
   Maximum removal (87.6, 81.0 and 90.0\%) of COD, BOD and color
   respectively was found at adsorbent dosage of 11 g/L. Also, the textile
   mill wastewater was treated with different doses of coagulants like
   alum, ferric sulphate and ferrous sulphate at constant contact duration
   (4 hours) and room temperature (300 K). Percentage reduction (maximum)
   corresponds to 80.2, 74.0 and 84.9\% was obtained for removal of COD,
   BOD and color respectively.}},
