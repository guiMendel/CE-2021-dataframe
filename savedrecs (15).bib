Abstract = {{Human cancer cell lines are an important resource for research and drug
   development. However, the available annotations of cell lines are
   sparse, incomplete, and distributed in multiple repositories.
   Re-analyzing publicly available raw RNA-Seq data, we determined the
   human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and abundance, identified expressed
   viruses and calculated gene expression of 1,082 cancer cell lines. Using
   the determined HLA types, public databases of cell line mutations, and
   existing HLA binding prediction algorithms, we predicted antigenic
   mutations in each cell line. We integrated the results into a
   comprehensive knowledgebase. Using the Django web framework, we provide
   an interactive user interface with advanced search capabilities to find
   and explore cell lines and an application programming interface to
   extract cell line information. The portal is available at
   http://celllines.tron-mainz.de.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant chromatin regulation is a frequent driver of leukemogenesis.
   Mutations in chromatin regulators often result in more stem-like cells
   that seed a bulk leukemic population. Inhibitors targeting these
   proteins represent an emerging class of therapeutics, and identifying
   further chromatin regulators that promote disease progression may result
   in additional drug targets. We identified the chromatin-modifying
   protein CHD8 as necessary for cell survival in a mouse model of BCR-Abl+
   B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease has a poor prognosis
   despite treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-Abl. Although
   implicated as a risk factor in autism spectrum disorder and a tumor
   suppressor in prostate and lung cancer, the mechanism of CHD8's activity
   is still unclear and has never been studied in the context of
   hematopoietic malignancies. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CHD8
   in B-ALL cells leads to cell death. While multiple B cell malignancies
   were dependent on CHD8 expression for survival, T cell malignancies
   displayed milder phenotypes upon CHD8 knockdown. In addition, ectopic
   expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in a T cell malignancy
   partially alleviated the detrimental effect of CHD8 depletion. Our
   results demonstrate that CHD8 has a context-dependent role in cell
   survival, and its inhibition may be an effective treatment for B
   lymphoid malignancies.}},

Title = {{Probability and heritability estimates on primary osteoarthritis of the
   hip leading to total hip arthroplasty: a nationwide population based
   follow-up study in Danish twins}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Primary hip osteoarthritis, radiographic as well as
   symptomatic, is highly associated with increasing age in both genders.
   However, little is known about the mechanisms behind this, in particular
   if this increase is caused by genetic factors. This study examined the
   risk and heritability of primary osteoarthritis of the hip leading to a
   total hip arthroplasty, and if this heritability increased with
   increasing age.
   Methods: In a nationwide population-based follow-up study 118,788 twins
   from the Danish Twin Register and 90,007 individuals from the Danish Hip
   Arthroplasty Register for the period 1995 to 2010 were examined. Our
   main outcomes were the cumulative incidence, proband-wise concordance
   and heritability on age, within-pair correlations in monozygotic and
   dizygotic twin pairs, and the genetic and environmental influence
   estimated in models taking into account that individuals may not have
   had a total hip arthroplasty at the time of follow-up.
   Results: There were 94,063 twins eligible for analyses, comprising 835
   cases of 36 concordant and 763 discordant twin pairs. The probability
   increased particularly from 50 years of age. After sex and age
   adjustment a significant additive genetic component of 47 \% (12:79), a
   shared environmental component of 21 \% (2:76) and a unique environment
   component of 32 \% (21:41) accounted for the variation in population
   liability to total hip arthroplasty. The sex-adjusted proband-wise
   concordance and heritability on age indicated an increasing
   age-associated genetic influence onwards from 60 years of age.
   Conclusion: The cumulative incidence in primary hip osteoarthritis
   leading to total hip arthroplasty increases in particular after the age
   of 50 years in both genders. Family factors of genes and shared
   environment are highly significant and account for 68 \% of the
   variation in the population liability to total hip arthroplasty;
   however, the genetic influence increases significantly from 60 years of
   age onwards.}},

   initial designed parameters of the spectrometer were given and then
   optimized by ZEMAX; with the instruction of the study, a small
   adjustment was made in the actual alignment to obtain the desired final
   spectrometer. The spectrometer successfully measured the last four
   characteristic peaks of the Raman spectrum of CCL4, which demonstrates
   that the research provides important guidance to the design and

Abstract = {{We present new, high-precision Doppler radial velocity (RV) data sets
   for the nearby K3V star HD 219134. The data include 175 velocities
   obtained with the HIRES Spectrograph at the Keck I Telescope and 101
   velocities obtained with the Levy Spectrograph at the Automated Planet
   Finder Telescope at Lick Observatory. Our observations reveal six new
   planetary candidates, with orbital periods of P = 3.1, 6.8, 22.8, 46.7,
   94.2, and 2247 days, spanning masses of M sin i = 3.8, 3.5, 8.9, 21.3,
   10.8, and 108 M-circle plus, respectively. Our analysis indicates that
   the outermost signal is unlikely to be an artifact induced by stellar
   activity. In addition, several years of precision photometry with the
   T10 0.8 m automatic photometric telescope at Fairborn Observatory
   demonstrated a lack of brightness variability to a limit of similar to
   0.0002 mag, providing strong support for planetary-reflex motion as the
   source of the RV variations. The HD 219134 system with its bright (V =
   5.6) primary provides an excellent opportunity to obtain detailed
   orbital characterization (and potentially follow-up observations) of a
   planetary system that resembles many of the multiple-planet systems
   detected by Kepler, which are expected to be detected by NASA's
   forthcoming TESS Mission and by ESA's forthcoming PLATO Mission.}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic cancer is the most aggressive malignant disease, ranking as
   the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in
   the United States. Interferon alpha (IFN alpha) has been used to treat
   pancreatic cancer, but its clinical application has been significantly
   hindered due to the low antitumor activity. We used a ``cDNA in-frame
   fragment library{''} screening approach to identify short peptides that
   potentiate the antitumor activity of interferons. A short positively
   charged peptide derived from the C-terminus of placental growth factor-2
   (PLGF-2) was selected to enhance the activity of IFN alpha. For this, we
   constructed a synthetic interferon hybrid molecule (SIF alpha) by fusing
   the positively charged PLGF-2 peptide to the C-terminus of the human IFN
   alpha. Using human pancreatic cell lines (ASPC and CFPAC1) as a model
   system, we found that SIF alpha exhibited a significantly higher
   activity than did the wild-type IFN alpha in inhibiting the tumor cell
   growth. The enhanced activity of the synthetic SIF alpha was associated
   with the activation of interferon pathway target genes and the increased
   binding of cell membrane receptor. This study demonstrates the potential
   of a synthetic SIF alpha as a novel antitumor agent.}},

Abstract = {{We reported multiferroic ceramics (1-x)PZT +xBiFeO(3) (x = 0.01-0.10,
   Zr/Ti = 95/5-100/0) were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction
   process. The structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD showed that the
   (1-x)PZT+xBiFeO(3) samples formed perovskite structure. SEM indicated
   that the dense ceramics were obtained when the sintering process was
   modified. It is well known that the PZT95/5 system is a typical
   ferroelectric material and BiFeO3 possesses antiferromagnetic property.
   It was found that (1-x)PZT+xBiFeO(3) exhibited both ferroelectric and
   ferromagnetic properties at room temperature. The relationship between
   the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties was discussed.}},

Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Kidney diseases are complicated and can be fatal. Dialysis and
   transplantation are the only survival solutions to the patients
   suffering from kidney failures. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal
   dialysis are risky, due to the possibility of infection and these are
   expensive and time consuming. The development of simple and reliable
   technique for the clearance of creatinine and urea from the body is an
   important part of biotechnology. We have synthesized an iron
   nanoparticle (INP) and studied its binding with creatinine and urea. The
   DLS, TEM, AFM, FT-IR and Powder-XRD studies demonstrate strong binding
   of creatinine and urea to the nanoparticles. This finding may be helpful
   if it is used in the dialysis technologies. The proposed method may
   substantially decrease dialysis time and improve its quality in terms of
   urea and creatinine clearances.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to monitor kinase activity dynamics in live cells greatly
   aids the study of how signaling events are spatiotemporally regulated.
   Here, we report on the adaptability of bimolecular kinase activity
   reporters (bimKARs) as molecular tools to enhance the real-time
   visualization of kinase activity. We demonstrate that the bimKAR design
   is truly versatile and can be used to monitor a variety of kinases,
   including JNK, ERK, and AMPK. Furthermore, bimKARs can have
   significantly enhanced dynamic ranges over their unimolecular
   counterparts, allowing the elucidation of previously undetectable kinase
   activity dynamics. Using these newly designed bimKARs, we investigate
   the regulation of AMPK by protein kinase A (PKA) in the plasma membrane,
   and demonstrate that PKA can both negatively and positively regulate
   AMPK activity in the same cell.}},

   index (PNI) and weight loss on metastasis and long-term mortality in
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 694 newly diagnosed patients with
   non-disseminated, biopsy-proven NPC. Survival analysis was used to
   evaluate the predictive value of PNI and weight loss.
   Results: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a low pre-therapy PNI
   (< 55.0) was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (OS) (P =
   0.012), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P = 0.011) and
   progression-free survival (P = 0.012). High weight loss (HWL, weight
   loss during treatment >= 10 \%) was an independent predictor of poor OS
   (P = 0.001) and DMFS (P = 0.014). Advanced stage disease, female gender,
   chemotherapy, high white blood cell count, high serum globulin
   concentration and pre-therapy body-mass index were predictors of HWL.
   Conclusion: Pre-therapy PNI and weight loss have significant predictive
   value for metastasis and mortality in patients with NPC.}},

Title = {{Aberrant GSTP1 promoter methylation is associated with increased risk
   and advanced stage of breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 19 case-control
   studies}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) has been reported to
   function as a tumor suppressor gene in various types of human cancers.
   Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes at the promoter regions can
   inactivate genes, which is important in the carcinogenesis of breast
   cancer. However, the role of GSTP1 promoter methylation in the
   occurrence of breast cancer and its relationship with tumor stage and
   histological grade has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we carried out a
   meta-analysis to yield a more accurate association.
   Methods: A systematically literature search was made on PubMed, EMBASE
   and Web of Science databases for eligible studies. The odds ratio (OR)
   and 95 \% confidence interval (95 \% CI) were calculated by RevMan 5.2
   software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore
   the source of heterogeneity.
   Results: Eventually, 17 articles involving 19 case-control studies were
   included in the present meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled results
   indicated that aberrant GSTP1 promoter methylation was significantly
   associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR = 7.85, 95 \% CI =
   5.12-12.01; Caucasians OR = 7.23, 95 \% CI = 3.76-13.90 and Asians OR =
   11.71, 95 \% CI = 5.69-24.07). Furthermore, our results revealed that
   GSTP1 promoter methylation was more often observed in late-stage breast
   cancer patients compared with early-stage ones (OR = 1.84, 95 \% CI =
   1.32-2.58). However, no significant association was identified between
   GSTP1 promoter methylation and histological grade (OR = 0.74, 95 \% CI =
   0.43-1.26).
   Conclusions: The results indicated that GSTP1 promoter methylation
   probably plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis, which could
   serve as an effective biomarker for the diagnosis and monitor of breast
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes are important targets for
   areas as diverse as antibiotic development to biofuel production.
   Elucidating the molecular basis of chain length control during fatty
   acid biosynthesis is crucial for the understanding of regulatory
   processes of this fundamental metabolic pathway. In Escherichia coli,
   the acyl carrier protein (AcpP) plays a central role by sequestering and
   shuttling the growing acyl chain between fatty acid biosynthetic
   enzymes. FabA, a beta-hydroxyacyl-AcpP dehydratase, is an important
   enzyme in controlling fatty acid chain length and saturation levels.
   FabA-AcpP interactions are transient in nature and thus difficult to
   visualize. In this study, four mechanistic crosslinking probes mimicking
   varying acyl chain lengths were synthesized to systematically probe for
   modified chain length specificity of 14 FabA mutants. These studies
   provide evidence for the AcpP-interacting ``positive patch,'' FabA
   mutations that alter substrate specificity, and the roles that the FabA
   ``gating residues'' play in chain length control.}},

Abstract = {{In reset control systems, the reset law is a main characteristic of the
   reset controllers. In this study, a model prediction-based framework is
   proposed to determine a suitable reset law for the uncertain linear
   control system. For achieving this goal, first a typical uncertain
   linear plant is considered and then the state space of the closed-loop
   system, which consists of the uncertain plant and a linear controller,
   is formulated. The stability problem of such uncertain system is
   translated into a feasibility assessment of some linear matrix
   inequality sets and then based on the model prediction strategy a reset
   law is derived to minimise a quadratic cost function. When the system
   states enter into a reset set, according to the computed reset law, the
   controller states are reset. This method is applied to a typical
   distillation column to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach
   and is compared with non-reset control system.}},

Title = {{Phylogenetic analysis of higher-level relationships within Hydroidolina
   (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) using mitochondrial genome data and insight into
   their mitochondrial transcription}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Hydrozoans display the most morphological diversity within the phylum
   Cnidaria. While recent molecular studies have provided some insights
   into their evolutionary history, sister group relationships remain
   mostly unresolved, particularly at mid-taxonomic levels. Specifically,
   within Hydroidolina, the most speciose hydrozoan subclass, the
   relationships and sometimes integrity of orders are highly unsettled.
   Here we obtained the near complete mitochondrial sequence of twenty-six
   hydroidolinan hydrozoan species from a range of sources (DNA and RNA-seq
   data, long-range PCR). Our analyses confirm previous inference of the
   evolution of mtDNA in Hydrozoa while introducing a novel genome
   organization. Using RNA-seq data, we propose a mechanism for the
   expression of mitochondrial mRNA in Hydroidolina that can be
   extrapolated to the other medusozoan taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using
   the full set of mitochondrial gene sequences provide some insights into
   the order-level relationships within Hydroidolina, including
   siphonophores as the first diverging clade, a well-supported clade
   comprised of Leptothecata-Filifera III-IV, and a second clade comprised
   of Aplanulata-Capitata s.s.-Filifera I-II. Finally, we describe our
   relatively inexpensive and accessible multiplexing strategy to sequence
   long-range PCR amplicons that can be adapted to most high-throughput
   sequencing platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) and dopamine receptor- 1 (DRD1) are
   coexpressed in hippocampal neurons, yet ghrelin is undetectable in the
   hippocampus; therefore, we sought a function for apo-GHSR1a. Real-time
   single-molecule analysis on hippocampal neurons revealed dimerization
   between apoGHSR1a and DRD1 that is enhanced by DRD1 agonism. In
   addition, proximity measurements support formation of preassembled
   apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:G alpha(q) heteromeric complexes in hippocampal neurons.
   Activation by a DRD1 agonist produced non-canonical signal transduction
   via G alpha(q)-PLC-IP3-Ca2+ at the expense of canonical DRD1 G alpha(s)
   cAMP signaling to result in CaMKII activation, glutamate receptor
   exocytosis, synaptic reorganization, and expression of early markers of
   hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, this pathway is blocked by
   genetic or pharmacological inactivation of GHSR1a. In mice, GHSR1a
   inactivation inhibits DRD1-mediated hippocampal behavior and memory. Our
   findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism essential for DRD1
   initiation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is dependent on
   GHSR1a, and independent of cAMP signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents the results of a combination of isotopic (delta
   N-15 and delta C-13), geochemical (TOC, TN, C/N) and palaeobotanical
   investigations. They were carried out on organic matter (OM) that had
   been deposited from the Younger Dryas to the Subboreal chronozone in
   palaolake sediments (north-eastern Poland). OM from the late Younger
   Dryas consists only a small amount of TOC and TN, which together with
   the lack of aquatic macrophyte macrofossils confirm low primary
   production in the then reservoir. The higher values of C/N ratio (18-27)
   and delta C-13 (ca. -26 parts per thousand) suggest that OM was mainly
   terrestrial in origin. During the Preboreal chronozone (11,450-10,150
   cal. BP), there was a probable deepening of the reservoir through the
   melting of dead ice. This might have been intensified by an increase in
   precipitation and a fall in evapotranspiration during the `Preboreal
   oscillation'. From the early Preboreal chronozone (ca. 11,345 cal. BP),
   a mixed source of OM is indicated by C/N ratio (from 8 to 13). At the
   same time significant increase in TOC and TN probably registered a rise
   in primary production in the palaeolake. From the older part of the
   Boreal chronozone (ca. 9865 cal. BP) algae productivity increased (the
   C/N ratio dropped to ca. 8 and was then constant). At the beginning of
   the Atlantic chronozone (ca. 8650 cal. BP) a probable increase in the
   water level caused the partial relocation of OM from the reed swamp belt
   and/or the adjacent alder carr into deeper sections of the palaeolake
   (an increase in TOC and TN). In the late Atlantic chronozone (ca.
   6965-6650 cal. BP), TOC and TN decreased while delta C-13 had high
   values, which probably reflected a more distinct stratification of the
   water column with anoxic bottom waters. Next, in the late Atlantic and
   early Subboreal chronozone (ca. 6650-5205 cal. BP) the amount of OM in
   palaeolake sediments was still rising. The delta C-13 values dropped,
   suggesting an intensification of processes of water mixing. These
   processes were simultaneous with the constant shallowing of the
   palaeolake and the disappearance of habitats suitable for submerged
   macrophytes. The topmost part of the profile is characteristic of a
   strong decomposition of peat, causing a release of carbon dioxide and
   therefore the depletion of the carbon pool in the peat (a drop in the
   C/N ratio). The concurrent upward trend of the delta N-15 curve is
   probably the effect of a greater anthropogenic impact on the
   palaeolake/mire and its catchment and/or more recent human interference
   in the topmost peat layers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {{The equilibrium morphology of a drop in a horizontal tube can provide
   useful information for two-phase flow in microfluidics devices in which
   the capillary force dominates. A drop-in-tube system is analogous to a
   drop-on-fiber one and two conformations are obtained, adhered drop and
   liquid slug, by the approaches of experiments and surface evolver (SE)
   simulations. The adhered drop conformation tends to exist at small
   volume, whereas the liquid slug conformation is favored at larger
   volume. Around the transition volume between the two conformations, both
   morphologies can coexist. The experimental results are consistent with
   those of simulation outcomes. The morphological phase diagram of the
   drop-in-tube system is constructed via SE simulations by varying the
   drop volume and contact angle. Three regimes can be identified through
   the upper and lower boundary curves: adhered drop only, liquid slug
   only, and coexistence. Compared to the case with negligible gravity, the
   adhered drop is more favored than the liquid slug in the presence of
   gravity. As a result, the coexistence regime expands substantially.}},

Title = {{RIP3 S-nitrosylation contributes to cerebral ischemic neuronal injury}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1627}},
Pages = {{165-176}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion is associated with NMDA receptor-mediated
   calcium influx which activates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and
   consequently induces NO production. NO S-nitrosylates cellular protein
   and aggravates neuronal injury. Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) is
   a sensor molecule regulating cell apoptosis and necrosis. However, the
   roles of RIP3 in cerebral ischemic injury remain elusive. In this study,
   we reported that RIP3 could be S-nitrosylated by the exogenous NO donor
   GSNO in HEK293 cells and the Cys(119) residue was the key nitrosylation
   site. In addition, we found that cerebral ischemia induced RIP3
   S-nitrosylation at different time points of reperfusion, which was
   coupling with RIP3 phosphorylation (which is associated with its
   activation) and its interaction with receptor-interacting protein 1
   (RIP1), and this process facilitated cerebral ischemic injury. Treatment
   with NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, or nNOS inhibitor 7NI, diminished
   RIP3 S-nitrosylation and reduced neuronal damage. Taken together, these
   data demonstrated that NMDAR-dependent RIP3 S-nitrosylation induced by
   ischemia facilitated its activation in the early stages of ischemia,
   blocking this process could reduce the ischemia neuronal injury. (C)

Pages = {{1437-1441}},

Abstract = {{L-RNA aptamers were developed that bind to barnase RNase and thereby
   inhibit the function of the enzyme. These aptamers were obtained by
   first carrying out in vitro selection of D-RNAs that bind to the
   full-length synthetic D-enantiomer of barnase, then reversing the mirror
   and preparing L-RNAs of identical sequence that similarly bind to
   natural L-barnase. The resulting L-aptamers bind L-barnase with an
   affinity of similar to 100 nM and function as competitive inhibitors of
   enzyme cleavage of D-RNA substrates. L-RNA aptamers are resistant to
   degradation by ribonucleases, thus enabling them to function in
   biological samples, most notably for applications in molecular
   diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition to the irony of using RNA to
   inhibit RNase, L-RNA aptamers such as those described here could be used
   to measure the concentration or inhibit the function of RNase in the
   laboratory or in biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{The operation of mobile networks has three basic objectives to fulfil:
   quality-coverage-capacity, at a cost of efficient operation. Quality can
   be expressed as the network's ability to maintain a call or data
   session, which must be terminated at will by users. When the network is
   not able to fulfil this condition, dropped calls occur. To ensure
   quality and user mobility, it is necessary to design a proper neighbour
   cell list to allow transfer between cells. In this sense, the 3GPP
   standard considers the ANR (automatic neighbour relation) technique for
   LTE as an automatic method of defining neighbour lists that optimises
   network performance. Presented is a method to define an optimised
   neighbour cell list, which is designed and implemented in a real UMTS
   network of Telefonica within a high interference scenario, and which is
   easily extrapolated to the LTE network.}},

Title = {{Prevention of bacterial infections in the newborn by pre-delivery
   administration of azithromycin: Study protocol of a randomized efficacy
   trial}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neonatal deaths, estimated at approximately 4 million
   annually, now account for almost 40 \% of global mortality in children
   aged under-five. Bacterial sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal
   mortality. Assuming the mother is the main source for bacterial
   transmission to newborns, the primary objective of the trial is to
   determine the impact of one oral dose of azithromycin, given to women in
   labour, on the newborn's bacterial carriage in the nasopharynx.
   Secondary objectives include the impact of the intervention on bacterial
   colonization in the baby and the mother during the first month of life.
   Methods/design: This is a Phase III, double -blind, placebo controlled
   randomized clinical trial in which 830 women in labour were randomized
   to either a single dose of 2 g oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:
   1). The trial included pregnant women in labour aged 18 to 45 years
   attending study health centres in the Western Gambia. A post-natal check
   of the mother and baby was conducted at the health centre by study
   clinicians before discharge and 8-10 days after delivery. Home follow up
   visits were conducted daily during the first week and then weekly until
   week 8 after delivery. Vaginal swabs and breast milk samples were
   collected from the mothers, and the pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from
   the study samples. For bacterial isolates, susceptibility pattern to
   azithromycin was determined using disk diffusion and E-test. Eye swabs
   were collected from newborns with eye discharge during the follow up
   period, and Chlamydial infection was assessed using molecular methods.
   Discussion: This is a proof-of-concept study to assess the impact of
   antibiotic preventive treatment of women during labour on bacterial
   infections in the newborn. If the trial confirms this hypothesis, the
   next step will be to assess the impact of this intervention on neonatal
   sepsis. The proposed intervention should be easily implementable in
   developing countries.}},

Title = {{Suspended sediment load at the lowermost Ebro River (Catalonia, Spain)}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{388}},
Pages = {{188-198}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Several attempts to estimate the suspended load and the sediment deficit
   caused by the reservoirs have been carried out in the lower Ebro River.
   However, existing data are scarce, scattered along time and space, and
   obtained under different hydrological conditions and methods. This study
   estimate the presently suspended sediment load of the lowermost Ebro
   River, using field data collected during three consecutive years at
   different verticals of a cross-section and covering a large range of
   discharges. In addition, the daily suspended load for the last 30 years
   has been reconstructed and validated. The suspended load for the period
   2007-2010 has been estimated at 84,000 t/y (+/- 9800 t) while 99,500 t/y
   (+/- 18,000 t) accounted for 1981-2010 period. Approximately, 80\% of
   the total suspended load (period 2007-2010) has been transferred as
   inorganic load. A significant seasonal variability in the total (organic
   and inorganic) suspended load is observed. Therefore, two distinct
   cycling phases in the suspended load production and transfer has been
   inferred: an initial phase in which the sediment was prepared into the
   basin followed by a second phase in which most of the load was
   transferred downstream. These two phases are governed by the relative
   temporal location of the natural floods and the river regulation from
   the reservoirs. Nowadays, less than 1\% of suspended load is transferred
   compared to pre-dams construction. The current levels of suspended load
   are very low and not enough to supply the material needed to maintain
   the delta elevation and avoid coastal retreat. The sustainability of the
   lower Ebro River and its delta could only be guaranteed by the
   implementation of a new reservoir management concept with the allocation
   of an appropriate liquid and solid flow regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

Title = {{Comparative immune responses against Psoroptes ovis in two cattle breeds
   with different susceptibility to mange}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The sheep scab mite, Psoroptes ovis, is a major problem in the beef
   cattle industry, especially in Belgian Blue (BB) cattle. This breed is
   naturally more predisposed to psoroptic mange but reasons for this high
   susceptibility remain unknown. Different immune responses could be a
   potential cause; thus in this study, the cutaneous immune response and
   in vitro cellular immune response after antigen re-stimulation were
   examined in naturally infested BB. Cytokine production in the skin and
   in circulating re-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
   demonstrated a mixed pro-inflammatory Th2/Th17 profile, with
   transcription of IL-4, IL-13, IL-6 and IL-17. Strong IL-17 up-regulation
   in the skin of BB was associated with an influx of eosinophils and other
   immune cells, potentially leading towards more severe symptoms.
   Virtually no changes in cutaneous IFN-gamma transcription were detected,
   while there was substantial IFN-gamma up-regulation in re-stimulated
   PBMC from infested and uninfested animals, potentially indicating a role
   of this pro-inflammatory cytokine in the innate immune response. In
   Holstein-Friesian (HF) cattle, generally more resistant to P.ovis
   infection, a largely similar immunologic response was observed.
   Differences between HF and BB were the lack of cutaneous IL-17 response
   in infested HF and low transcription levels of IFN-gamma and high IL-10
   transcription in re-stimulated PBMC from both infested and uninfested
   animals. Further research is needed to identify potential cell sources
   and biological functions for these cytokines and to fully unravel the
   basis of this different breed susceptibility to P. ovis.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW SPECIAL TOPICS-PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a series of item response models of data
   collected using the Force Concept Inventory. The Force Concept Inventory
   (FCI) was designed to poll the Newtonian conception of force viewed as a
   multidimensional concept, that is, as a complex of distinguishable
   conceptual dimensions. Several previous studies have developed
   single-trait item response models of FCI data; however, we feel that
   multidimensional models are also appropriate given the explicitly
   multidimensional design of the inventory. The models employed in the
   research reported here vary in both the number of fitting parameters and
   the number of underlying latent traits assumed. We calculate several
   model information statistics to ensure adequate model fit and to
   determine which of the models provides the optimal balance of
   information and parsimony. Our analysis indicates that all item response
   models tested, from the single-trait Rasch model through to a model with
   ten latent traits, satisfy the standard requirements of fit. However,
   analysis of model information criteria indicates that the five-trait
   model is optimal. We note that an earlier factor analysis of the same
   FCI data also led to a five-factor model. Furthermore the factors in our
   previous study and the traits identified in the current work match each
   other well. The optimal five-trait model assigns proficiency scores to
   all respondents for each of the five traits. We construct a correlation
   matrix between the proficiencies in each of these traits. This
   correlation matrix shows strong correlations between some proficiencies,
   and strong anticorrelations between others. We present an interpretation
   of this correlation matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Advances of optoelectronic devices based on methylammonium lead halide
   perovskites depend on understanding the role of excitons, whether it is
   marginal as in inorganic semiconductors, or crucial, like in organics.
   However, a consensus on the exciton binding energy and its temperature
   dependence is still lacking, even for widely studied methylammonium lead
   iodide and bromide materials (MAPbI(3), MAPbBr(3)). Here we determine
   the exciton binding energy based on an f-sum rule for integrated UV-vis
   absorption spectra, circumventing the pitfalls of least-squares fitting
   procedures. In the temperature range 80-300 K, we find that the exciton
   binding energy in MAPbBr(3) is E-B = (60 +/- 3) meV, independent of
   temperature; for MAPbI(3), in the orthorhombic phase (below 140 K) E-B =
   (34 +/- 3) meV, while in the tetragonal phase the binding energy softens
   to 29 meV at 170 K and stays constant up to 300 K. Implications of
   binding energy values on solar cell and LED workings are discussed.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER}},

Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{The effect of draw ratio, molecular weight, and sea-island conjugated
   spinning with a polystyrene component on the fiber structure development
   of PET during laser drawing was analyzed by in-situ measurements with a
   0.1 ms time resolution using an ultra-high luminance X-ray beam
   generated from a synchrotron equipped with an undulator. The fiber
   temperature increased from 120 degrees C to 160-220 degrees C during the
   structure development process. By drawing the higher molecular weight
   PET to a higher draw ratio, a larger amount of fibrillar smectic
   mesophase formed just after the onset of necking, and a more highly
   oriented crystal formed after the extinction of the smectic mesophase.
   Accordingly, fibers with higher strength and higher thermal shrinkage
   stress were obtained. On the other hand, by conjugated spinning with a
   PS component, the fiber temperature increased along with an increase in
   the drawing stress, but the stress applied to the PET component should
   have decreased. The amount of smectic mesophase formed by the
   conjugated-spinning process was drastically decreased, and no
   crystallization induction time was observed, unlike the other cases.
   Crystallization, particularly the growth of a lamellar crystal, was also
   promoted. Moreover, a higher Young's modulus, a higher yield stress, and
   a higher shrinkage stress were observed for the conjugated-spun and
   drawn fibers. Therefore, the fibrillar smectic mesophase seems to block
   the formation of the lamellar crystal. Furthermore, the resultant
   fibrillar structure tends to result in a higher strength, but a
   relatively lower modulus and yield strength of the fiber. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Problem based learning has emerged as an effective teaching
   learning method. Students taught by the problem based learning method
   have better problem solving skills and better long-term memory than
   those taught by traditional lectures.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of problem based learning with
   that of traditional lecture method.
   METHODOLOGY: First MBBS students (n=127) were divided into two groups.
   One group was taught a topic from Applied Physiology by Problem based
   learning method and other group was taught the same topic by lecture
   method. Later the methods were reversed between the two groups with
   another topic of the same weightage. Finally feedback was obtained and
   post test conducted. The marks obtained in post test were analysed using
   SPSS software.
   RESULTS: The average post test score after Problem based learning
   (12.728) was significantly higher than that after lecture (11.079). Also
   majority of students liked to include Problem based learning method in
   curriculum for teaching Physiology.
   CONCLUSION: Problem based learning is a more effective method in
   teaching applied Physiology when compared to traditional lectures.}},

Title = {{Maternal care in Acanthosomatinae (Insecta: Heteroptera:
   Acanthosomatidae)-correlated evolution with morphological change}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal care (egg-nymph guarding behavior) has been
   recorded in some genera of Acanthosomatidae. However, the origin of the
   maternal care in the family has remained unclear due to the lack of
   phylogenetic hypotheses. Another reproductive mode is found in
   non-caring species whose females smear their eggs before leaving them.
   They possess pairs of complex organs on the abdominal venter called
   Pendergrast's organ (PO) and spread the secretion of this organ onto
   each egg with their hind legs, which is supposed to provide a protective
   function against enemies. Some authors claim that the absence of PO may
   be associated with the presence of maternal care. No study, however, has
   tested this hypothesis of a correlated evolution between the two traits.
   Results: We reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of the subfamily
   Acanthosomatinae using five genetic markers sequenced from 44 species
   and one subspecies with and without maternal care. Eight additional
   species from the other two acanthosomatid subfamilies were included as
   outgroups. Our results indicated that maternal care has evolved
   independently at least three times within Acanthosomatinae and once in
   the outgroup species. Statistical tests for correlated evolution showed
   that the presence of maternal care is significantly correlated with the
   secondary loss or reduction of PO. Ancestral state reconstruction for
   the node of Acanthosoma denticaudum (a non-caring species in which egg
   smearing with developed POs occurs) and A. firmatum (a caring species
   with reduced POs) suggested egg smearing was still present in their most
   recent common ancestor and that maternal care in A. firmatum has evolved
   relatively recently.
   Conclusions: We showed that maternal care is an apomorphic trait that
   has arisen multiple times from the presence of PO within the subfamily
   Acanthosomatinae. The acquisition of maternal care is correlated with
   the reduction or loss of PO, which suggests an evolutionary trade-off
   between the two traits resulting from physiological costs. This
   prediction also implies that presence of maternal care can be highly
   expected for those groups lacking behavioral data, which invariably also
   lack the organ. No secondary loss of maternal care was detected in the
   present tree. We suggest that the loss of maternal care may be
   suppressed due to the vulnerability of the PO-free condition, which thus
   maintains maternal care.}},

Abstract = {{The unique optical properties of semiconductor quantun dots (QDs) are
   highly advantageous for biological imaging and analysis, particularly
   when combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). A recent
   innovation in this area has been concentric FRET (cFRET), wherein QDs
   are assembled with multiple copies of two different types of fluorescent
   label. Although multifunctional biological probes have been developed
   utilizing cFRET, a detailed photophysical analysis of cFRET has not been
   undertaken, and energy transfer in these probes has been understood only
   qualitatively. Here, we characterize a prototypical
   QD-(A555)(M)-(A647)(N) cFRET configuration through photoluminescence
   (PL) intensity, decay, and photobleaching measurements. This cFRET
   configuration combines a central, green-emitting QD with Alexa Fluor 555
   (A555) and Alexa Fluor 647 (A647) dyes that are assembled to QDs through
   peptide linkers, where M and N are the numbers of A555 and A647 per QD.
   Following initial photo excitation of the QD, the energy transfer
   pathways are QD-to-A555 and QD-to-A647, which compete with one another,
   and A555-to-A647, which occurs subsequent to QD-to-A555 energy transfer.
   A rate analysis, calibrated to the conventional QD-(A555)(M) and
   QD-(A647)(N) FRET systems, accurately predicts quenthing efficiencies
   and permits a first approximation of dye/ QD PL intensity ratios in the
   cFRET configurations. CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs and CdSeS/ZnS QDs of different
   sizes but similar emission characteristics are used for these
   experiments, and they demonstrate the general applicability of the
   analysis. The interplay between the three FRET pathways and nonideal
   behavior within this system is discussed with directions for future
   research. Overall, this study provides a framework and predictive power
   for the rational design and optimization of novel cFRET probes and
   biosensors for biological applications.}},

Title = {{Association between sister chromatid exchange and double minute
   chromosomes in human tumor cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Double minute chromosomes (DMs) are the cytogenetic hallmark
   of extra-chromosomal genomic amplification. They can well represent the
   advanced stage of malignancy. However, the mechanisms of DM generation
   are still not fully understood. Here, the sister chromatid exchange
   (SCE) was used to determine whether the occurrence of DMs was related to
   the high genomic instability in human carcinoma cells. We analyzed SCE
   frequencies in two groups of cell lines: the first group contained
   DM-positive cell lines such as UACC-1598, SK-PN-DW, and NCI-N87
   carcinomas, while the second group comprised DM-negative cell lines
   including HO-8910, U251, and MGC-803.
   Results: The data showed that SCE was significantly increased in the
   DM-positive cells as compared to the DM-negative cells. In addition,
   there was a positive correlation between the incidence of DMs and the
   SCE frequency in the UACC-1598, SK-PN-DW, and NCI-N87 carcinoma cells.
   Conclusions: Because SCE can reflect general genome instability, it is
   suggested that the DMs are likely to be closely associated with genomic
   instability in carcinoma cells. Meanwhile, SCE may be involved in the
   malignant progression of DM-positive cancers.}},

   one-hybrid}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus develops acid tolerance
   response when subjected to acid stress conditions, such as the induction
   of enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism. In this study, pyk
   gene encoding pyruvate kinase was over-expressed in heterologous host
   Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the successful
   expression of this gene in NZ9000. The survival rate of
   Pyk-overproducing strain was 45-fold higher than the control under acid
   stress condition (pH 4.0). In order to determine the transcription
   factor (TF) which regulates the expression of pyk by bacterial
   one-hybrid, we constructed a TF library including 65 TFs of L.
   bulgaricus. Western blotting indicated that TFs in this library could be
   successfully expressed in host strains. Subsequently, the promoter of
   pfk-pyk operon in L. bulgaricus was identified by 5'-RACE PCR. The bait
   plasmid pH3U3-p01 carrying the deletion fragment of pfk-pyk promoter
   captured catabolite control protein A (CcpA) which could regulate the
   expression of pyk by binding to a putative catabolite-responsive element
   (5'-TGTAAGCCCTAACA-3') upstream the -35 region. Real-time qPCR analysis
   revealed the transcription of pyk was positively regulated by CcpA. This
   is the first report about identifying the TF of pyk in L. bulgaricus,
   which will provide new insight into the regulatory network.}},

Abstract = {{How might fully saturated benzene polymers of composition {[}(CH)(6)](n)
   form under high pressure? In the first approach to answering this
   question, we examine the stepwise increase in saturation of a
   one-dimensional stack of benzene molecules by enumerating the partially
   saturated polymer intermediates, subject to constraints of unit cell
   size and energy. Defining the number of four-coordinate carbon atoms per
   benzene formula unit as the degree of saturation, a set of isomers for
   degree-two and degree-four polymers can be generated by either thinking
   of the propagation of partially saturated building blocks or by
   considering a sequence of cycloadditions. There is also one 4 + 2
   reaction sequence that jumps directly from a benzene stack to a
   degree-four polymer. The set of degree-two polymers provides several
   useful signposts toward achieving full saturation: chiral versus achiral
   building blocks, certain forms of conformational freedom, and also dead
   ends to further saturation. These insights allow us to generate a larger
   set of degree-four polymers and enumerate the many pathways that lead
   from benzene stacks to completely saturated carbon nanothreads.}},

Title = {{Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Incident Stroke: A Systematic
   Review and Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision
   loss and blindness in people over 65 years old in the United States and
   has been associated with cardiovascular risk and decreased survival.
   There is conflicting data, however, regarding the contribution of AMD to
   the prediction of stroke.
   Aim
   To determine whether AMD is a risk indicator for incident stroke in a
   meta-analysis of available prospective and retrospective cohort studies
   published in the English literature.
   Methods
   We performed a systematic literature search of all studies published in
   English with Pub Med and other databases from 1966 to August 2014,
   reporting stroke incidence in patients with macular degeneration. Two
   investigators independently extracted the data. A random effects model
   was used to report Odds ratios (OR), with corresponding 95\% confidence
   intervals (CI). Meta-regression using a mixed linear model was used to
   understand potential heterogeneity amongst studies.
   Results
   We identified 9 studies that reported stroke incidence in patients with
   and without early AMD (N = 1,420,978). No significant association was
   found between early AMD with incident stroke. Combined, these 9 studies
   demonstrated random effects (OR, 1.12; CI, 0.86-1.47; I-2 = 96\%).
   Meta-regression on baseline covariates of age, sex, and year of
   publication did not significantly relate to heterogeneity.
   Conclusions
   We found no significant relationship between AMD and incident stroke.
   Further studies are needed to clarify other causes of decreased survival
   in patients with AMD.}},

Title = {{Optimizing and benchmarking de novo transcriptome sequencing: from
   library preparation to assembly evaluation}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: RNA-seq enables gene expression profiling in selected
   spatiotemporal windows and yields massive sequence information with
   relatively low cost and time investment, even for non-model species.
   However, there remains a large room for optimizing its workflow, in
   order to take full advantage of continuously developing sequencing
   capacity.
   Method: Transcriptome sequencing for three embryonic stages of
   Madagascar ground gecko (Paroedura picta) was performed with the
   Illumina platform. The output reads were assembled de novo for
   reconstructing transcript sequences. In order to evaluate the
   completeness of transcriptome assemblies, we prepared a reference gene
   set consisting of vertebrate one-to-one orthologs.
   Result: To take advantage of increased read length of >150 nt, we
   demonstrated shortened RNA fragmentation time, which resulted in a
   dramatic shift of insert size distribution. To evaluate products of
   multiple de novo assembly runs incorporating reads with different RNA
   sources, read lengths, and insert sizes, we introduce a new reference
   gene set, core vertebrate genes (CVG), consisting of 233 genes that are
   shared as one-to-one orthologs by all vertebrate genomes examined (29
   species)., The completeness assessment performed by the computational
   pipelines CEGMA and BUSCO referring to CVG, demonstrated higher accuracy
   and resolution than with the gene set previously established for this
   purpose. As a result of the assessment with CVG, we have derived the
   most comprehensive transcript sequence set of the Madagascar ground
   gecko by means of assembling individual libraries followed by clustering
   the assembled sequences based on their overall similarities.
   Conclusion: Our results provide several insights into optimizing de novo
   RNA-seq workflow, including the coordination between library insert size
   and read length, which manifested in improved connectivity of
   assemblies. The approach and assembly assessment with CVG demonstrated
   here would be applicable to transcriptome analysis of other species as
   well as whole genome analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we have determined the intrinsic refractive index
   of anodic aluminium oxide, which is originated by the formation of
   nanoporous alumina templates. Different templates have been fabricated
   by the conventional two-step anodization procedure in oxalic acid. Their
   porosities were modified by chemical wet etching allowing the tuning of
   their effective refractive indexes (air-filled nanopores + anodic
   aluminium oxide). By standard spectroscopic light transmission
   measurements, the effective refractive index for each different template
   was extracted in the VIS-NIR region. The determination of the intrinsic
   anodic aluminium oxide refractive index was performed by using the
   Maxwell-Garnett homogenization theory. The results are coincident for
   all the fabricated samples. The obtained refractive index (similar to
   1.55) is quite lower (similar to 22\%) than the commonly used Al2O3
   handbook value (similar to 1.75), showing that the amorphous nature of
   the anodic oxide structure strongly conditions its optical properties.
   This difference is critical for the correct design and modeling of
   optical plasmonic metamaterials based on anodic aluminium oxide
   nanoporous templates.}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal-catalyzed alkylation reactions of arenes have become a
   central transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first
   general strategy for alkylation of arenes with styrenes and alcohols
   catalyzed by carbon-based materials, exploiting the unique property of
   graphenes to produce valuable diarylalkane products in high yields and
   excellent regioselectivity. The protocol is characterized by a wide
   substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Notably, this
   process constitutes the first general application of graphenes to
   promote direct CC bond formation utilizing polar functional groups
   anchored on the GO surface, thus opening the door for an array of
   functional group alkylations using benign and readily available graphene
   materials. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via a
   tandem catalysis mechanism in which both of the coupling partners are
   activated by interaction with the GO surface.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior and mechanical properties of cells are strongly dependent
   on the biochemical and biomechanical properties of their
   microenvironment. Thus, understanding the mechanical properties of
   cells, extracellular matrices, and biomaterials is key to understanding
   cell function and to develop new materials with tailored mechanical
   properties for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   applications. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged as an
   indispensable technique for measuring the mechanical properties of
   biomaterials and cells with high spatial resolution and force
   sensitivity within physiologically relevant environments and timescales
   in the kPa to GPa elastic modulus range. The growing interest in this
   field of bionanomechanics has been accompanied by an expanding array of
   models to describe the complexity of indentation of hierarchical
   biological samples. Furthermore, the integration of AFM with optical
   microscopy techniques has further opened the door to a wide range of
   mechanotransduction studies. In recent years, new multidimensional and
   multiharmonic AFM approaches for mapping mechanical properties have been
   developed, which allow the rapid determination of, for example, cell
   elasticity. This Progress Report provides an introduction and practical
   guide to making AFM-based nanomechanical measurements of cells and
   surfaces for tissue engineering applications.}},

Title = {{The performance of NLST screening criteria in Asian lung cancer patients}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Screening high-risk individuals with low dose CT decreased
   lung cancer mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), but
   the validity of directly extrapolating these results to an Asian
   population is unclear. Using statistical models on Surveillance,
   Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) data, 27 \% of lung cancer patients
   in the United States were estimated to meet the screening criteria. This
   study aims to evaluate the performance of the NLST criteria in Asian
   lung cancer patients and to examine the characteristics of those who did
   not meet the criteria.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of Asian lung cancer
   patients treated at Maimonides Cancer Center between 1/2008 and 6/2013.
   Data on demographics, smoking history, cancer stage, histology, and
   EGFR/ALK mutation status were collected and analyzed.
   Results: Of 116 eligible patients, 75 patients (65 \%) were smokers
   which included 26 light smokers (22 \%). Thirty-two patients (27.8 \%)
   met the NLST criteria. Extending the age limit to 79 would cover 8 \%
   more patients while removing the lower age limit would only cover 2 \%
   more. None of the female patients met the criteria as they were all
   never or light smokers. Two-thirds of male patients younger than age 55
   were never or light smokers. The EGFR mutation rate was 67 \% in female
   and 28 \% in male patients.
   Conclusion: The percentage of Asian patients meeting the NLST criteria
   is similar to that estimated for the United States population,
   suggesting that extension of the criteria to an Asian population is
   valid. One-third of the patients were non-smokers and an additional
   one-fourth were light smokers, comprised mostly of female and young male
   patients. Further strategies for screening these individuals based on
   non-tobacco factors are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenic role of torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in swine is
   controversial among different studies. The present study intended to
   evaluate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV based on its correlations
   with the histopathological changes, various common concurrently infected
   viral pathogens including porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine
   parvovirus (PPV), as well as changes in the distribution and population
   of host immunocytes such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and
   macrophages by using the superficial inguinal lymph nodes (siLNs) of
   wasting pigs. A tissue microarray consisting of 270 available siLNs
   collected from 262 clinically wasting and 8 healthy pigs, respectively,
   were used for the detection of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV2, PRRSV, and PPV by
   either in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemical (IHC)
   staining, and for the detection of various subsets of immunocytes by IHC
   staining with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, and lysozyme. The
   slides were then subject to digital scanning followed by a
   semi-quantitative positive pixel evaluation for further statistical
   analysis. Although a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuV2 infection
   was noted in both wasting and healthy pigs, the wasting pigs had a
   significantly higher intensity in both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 ISH-positive
   signals than healthy ones did. In the wasting pigs, a significant
   positive correlation in the tissue viral load was noted between TTSuV1
   and TTSuV2 and between TTSuV2 and PCV2, but not between TTSuV1 and PCV2.
   Conversely, a significant negative correlation in the tissue viral load
   was revealed between TTSuV2, but not TTSuV1, and PRRSV. The tissue viral
   load of TTSuV1 was significantly correlated with B cell hyperplasia,
   while the tissue viral load of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with
   increased macrophage population. The ISH positivity of TTSuV2 was
   significantly correlated with lymphoid depletion and granulomatous
   inflammation, which are the characteristic histopathological findings in
   postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs. These findings
   suggest that both TTSuV species may have the potential involving the
   development of porcine circovirus-associated lymphoid lesions via
   alternating the host immune system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{When manufacturing firms increase the share of service revenues,
   managing service provision becomes challenging. This study extends
   previous research on servitisation in individual firms by analysing the
   challenges service provision creates in a value network. The challenges
   are identified both within the firms and in the business relationships
   in the value network. In addition, the paper identifies and describes
   service manoeuvres firms use to address challenges resulting from
   servitisation. This case study of a value network is based on interviews
   carried out at 13 firms in the automotive industry, including suppliers,
   original equipment manufacturers and consultancies. The research shows
   that service manoeuvres, such as new types of resource integration and
   value constellations, are used to overcome challenges in the value

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Two surface analysis techniques, dual polarization interferometry (DPI)
   and analysis by an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation capability (E-QCM-D), were paired to find the deposition
   conditions that give the highest and most stable electrocatalytic
   activity per adsorbed mass of enzyme. Layers were formed by adsorption
   from buffered solutions of bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria
   at pH 6.0 to planar surfaces, under high enzyme loading (>= 1 mg mL(-1))
   for contact periods of up to 2 min. Both unmodified and
   carboxylate-functionalized gold-coated sensors showed that a deposition
   solution concentration of 10-25 mg mL(-1) gave the highest activity per
   mass of adsorbed enzyme with an effective catalytic rate constant
   (k(cat)) of about 60 s(-1). The densification of adsorbed layers
   observed by DPI correlated with reduced bioactivity observed by parallel
   E-QCM-D measurements. Postadsorption changes in thickness and density
   observed by DPI were incorporated into Kelvin-Voigt models of the QCM-D
   response. The modeled response matched experimental observations when
   the adlayer viscosity tripled after adsorption.}},

Number = {{43}},

Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{A photo-electrochemical sensor for the specific detection of guanosine
   monophosphate (GMP) is demonstrated, based on three enzymes combined in
   a coupled reaction assay. The first reaction involves the adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP)dependent conversion of GMP to guanosine diphosphate
   (GDP) by guanylate kinase, which warrants substrate specifi city. The
   reaction products ADP and GDPare co-substrates for the enzymatic
   conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate in a second reaction
   mediated by pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate in turn is the co-substrate for
   lactate dehydrogenase that generates lactate via oxidation of
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) NADH to NAD(+). This
   third enzymatic reaction is electrochemically detected. For this purpose
   a CdS/ZnS quantum dot (QD) electrode is illuminated and the photocurrent
   response under fixed potential conditions is evaluated. The sequential
   enzyme reactions are first evaluated in solution. Subsequently, a sensor
   for GMP is constructed using polyelectrolytes for enzyme immobilization.}},

Title = {{Molecular basis of canalization in an ascidian species complex adapted
   to different thermal conditions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Canalization is a result of intrinsic developmental buffering that
   ensures phenotypic robustness under genetic variation and environmental
   perturbation. As a consequence, animal phenotypes are remarkably
   consistent within a species under a wide range of conditions, a property
   that seems contradictory to evolutionary change. Study of laboratory
   model species has uncovered several possible canalization mechanisms,
   however, we still do not understand how the level of buffering is
   controlled in natural populations. We exploit wild populations of the
   marine chordate Ciona intestinalis to show that levels of buffering are
   maternally inherited. Comparative transcriptomics show expression levels
   of genes encoding canonical chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 do not
   correlate with buffering. However the expression of genes encoding
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones does correlate. We also show that
   ER chaperone genes are widely conserved amongst animals. Contrary to
   previous beliefs that expression level of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) can
   be used as a measurement of buffering levels, we propose that ER
   associated chaperones comprise a cellular basis for canalization. ER
   chaperones have been neglected by the fields of development, evolution
   and ecology, but their study will enhance understanding of both our
   evolutionary past and the impact of global environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{As a novel route to construct fine and abnormally high-aspect-ratio
   electrodes with excellent adhesion and reduced contact resistivity on a
   textured surface, an electrostatic-force-assisted dispensing printing
   technique is reported and compared with conventional dispensing and
   electrohydrodynamic jet printing techniques. The electrostatic force
   applied between a silver paste and the textured surface of a crystalline
   silicon solar cell wafer significantly improves the physical adhesion of
   the electrodes, whereas those fabricated using a conventional dispensing
   printing technique peel off with a silver paste containing 2 wt\% of a
   fluorosurfactant. Moreover, the contact resistivity and dimensionless
   deviation of total resistance are significantly reduced from 2.19 +/-
   1.53 m Omega.cm(2) to 0.98 +/- 0.92 m Omega.cm(2) and from 0.10 to 0.03,
   respectively. By utilizing electrodes with an abnormally
   high-aspect-ratio of 0.79 (the measured thickness and width are 30.4 mu
   m and 38.3 mu m, respectively), the cell efficiency is 17.2\% on a
   polycrystalline silicon solar cell with an emitter sheet resistance of
   60 Omega/sq. This cell efficiency is considerably higher than previously
   reported values obtained using a conventional electrohydrodynamic jet
   printing technique, by +0.48-3.5\%p.}},

Title = {{Identification of key amino acid residues responsible for internal and

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Changes of intracellular and extracellular pH are involved in a variety
   of physiological and pathological processes, in which regulation of the
   Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channel (I-CRAC) by pH has been implicated.
   Ca2+ entry mediated by I-CRAC has been shown to be regulated by acidic
   or alkaline pH. Whereas several amino acid residues have been shown to
   contribute to extracellular pH (pH(o)) sensitivity, the molecular
   mechanism for intracellular pH (pH(i)) sensitivity of Orai1/STIM1 is not
   fully understood. By investigating a series of mutations, we find that
   the previously identified residue E106 is responsible for pH(o)
   sensitivity when Ca2+ is the charge carrier. Unexpectedly, we identify
   that the residue E190 is responsible for pH(o) sensitivity when Na+ is
   the charge carrier. Furthermore, the intracellular mutant H155F markedly
   diminishes the response to acidic and alkaline pH(i), suggesting that
   H155 is responsible for pH(i) sensitivity of Orai1/STIM1. Our results
   indicate that, whereas H155 is the intracellular pH sensor of
   Orai1/STIM1, the molecular mechanism of external pH sensitivity varies
   depending on the permeant cations. As changes of pH are involved in
   various physiological/pathological functions, Orai/STIM channels may be
   an important mediator for various physiological and pathological
   processes associated with acidosis and alkalinization.}},

   immunoassay}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Electrochemical redox-active species play crucial role in
   electrochemically multiplexed immunoassays. A one-pot method for
   synthesizing four kinds of new electrochemical redox-active species was
   reported using HAuCl4 and Na2PdCl4 as dual oxidating agents and aniline
   derivatives as monomers. The synthesized polyaniline derivative-Au/Pd
   composites, namely poly(N-methyl-o-benzenediamine)-Au/Pd,
   poly(N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine)-Au/Pd,
   poly(N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine)-Au/Pd and
   poly(3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine)-Au/Pd, exhibited electrochemical
   redox activity at -0.65 V, -0.3 V, 0.12 V, and 0.5 V, respectively.
   Meanwhile, these composites showed high H2O2 electrocatalytic activity
   because of the presence of Au/Pd. The as-prepared composites were used
   as electrochemical immunoprobes in simultaneous detection of four tumor
   biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9
   (CA199), carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA724), and alpha fetoprotein
   (AFP)). This immunoassay shed light on potential applications in
   simultaneous gastric cancer (related biomarkers: CEA, CA199, CA724) and
   liver cancer diagnosis (related biomarkers: CEA, CA199, AFP). The
   present strategy to the synthesize redox species could be easily
   extended to other polymers such as polypyrrole derivatives and
   polythiophene derivatives. This would be of great significance in the
   electrochemical detection of more analytes.}},

Title = {{Tracing the structural evolution of eukaryotic ATP binding cassette
   transporter superfamily}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters superfamily is one of the
   largest classes of membrane proteins. The core of the ABC transporter
   protein is composed of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and nucleotide
   binding domains (NBD). Eukaryotes ABC transporters are classified into
   seven main families (ABCA to ABCG) based on sequence similarity and
   domain organizations. With different domain number and domain
   organizations, eukaryote ABC transporters show diverse structures: the
   single structure (NBD or TMD), the ABC2 structure (NBD-NBD), the half
   structure (TMD-NBD or NBD-TMD) and the full structure (TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD
   or NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD). However, studies on how various ABC transporter
   gene structures evolved is still absent. Therefore, in this study, we
   comprehensively investigated the structural evolution of eukaryotic ABC
   transporters. The seven eukaryote ABC transporter families (A to G) fell
   into three groups: A\& G group, B, C\& D group and E\& F group. There
   were at least four times the number of NBD and TMD fusion events in the
   origin of the half structure transporter. Two fusion modes were found in
   the full and ABC2 structure origination. Based on these findings, we
   present a putative structural evolutionary path of eukaryote ABC
   transporters that will increase our understanding on their origin,
   divergence and function.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{6733-6743}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{The development of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) thin-film solar cells is
   currently hindered by the large deficit of open-circuit voltage (V-oc),
   which results from the easy formation of Cu-Zn antisite acceptor
   defects. Suppressing the formation of Cu-Zn defects, especially near the
   absorber/buffer interface, is thus critical for the further improvement
   of kesterite solar cells. In this paper, it is shown that there is a
   large disparity between the defects in Cu- and Ag-based kesterite
   semiconductors, i.e., the Cu-Zn or Cu-Cd acceptor defects have high
   concentration and are the dominant defects in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) or
   Cu2CdSnS4, but the Ag Zn acceptor has only a low concentration and the
   dominant defects are donors in Ag2ZnSnS4. Therefore, the Cu-based
   kesterites always show p-type conductivity, while the Ag-based
   kesterites show either intrinsic or weak n-type conductivity. Based on
   this defect disparity and calculated band alignment, it is proposed that
   the V oc limit of the kesterite solar cells can be overcome by alloying
   Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) with Ag2ZnSn(S,Se)(4), and the composition-graded
   (Cu,Ag)(2) ZnSn(S,Se)(4) alloys should be ideal light-absorber materials
   for achieving higher effi ciency kesterite solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is known that evaporated metals can penetrate into films of
   various organic molecules that are a few nanometers thick, there has
   been little work aimed at exploring the interaction of the common
   electrode metals used in devices with fullerene derivatives, such as
   organic photovoltaics (OPVs) or perovskite solar cells that use
   fullerenes as electron transport layers. In this paper, we show that
   when commonly used electrode metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Al, Ca, etc.) are
   evaporated onto films of fullerene derivatives (such as
   {[}6-6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)), the metal
   penetrates many tens of nanometers into the fullerene layer. This
   penetration decreases the effective electrical thickness of
   fullerene-based sandwich structure devices, as measured by the device's
   geometric capacitance, and thus significantly alters the device physics.
   For the case of Au/PCBM, the metal penetrates a remarkable 70 nm into
   the fullerene, and we see penetration of similar magnitude in a wide
   variety of fullerene derivative/evaporated metal combinations. Moreover,
   using transmission electron microscopy to observed cross-sections of the
   films, we show that when gold is evaporated onto poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT)/PCBM sequentially processed OPV quasi-bilayers, Au nanoparticles
   with diameters of similar to 3-20 nm are formed and are dispersed
   entirely throughout the fullerene-rich overlayer. The plasmonic
   absorption and scattering from these nanoparticles are readily evident
   in the optical transmission spectrum, demonstrating that the
   interpenetrated metal significantly alters the optical properties of
   fullerene-rich active layers. This opens a number of possibilities in
   terms of contact engineering and light management so that metal
   penetration in devices that use fullerene derivatives could be used to
   advantage, making it critical that researchers are aware of the
   electronic and optical consequences of exposing fullerene-derivative
   films to evaporated electrode metals.}},

Abstract = {{Excavators are quite expensive vehicles. therefore, there may be huge

   to help decision makers during the purchasing process and to apply three
   different ``data fusion methods{''} instead of the ``theory of
   dominance{''} of the original MULTIMOORA method. the MULTIMOORA method
   is composed of three methods, namely: the ratio analysis as a part of
   MOORA, reference Point theory (the reference point approach as a part of
   MOORA) and the Full Multiplicative Form. it is used to prioritise
   excavator technologies in this study. the MULTIMOORA method combines
   three results obtained from these three methods using the theory of
   dominance. Dominance directed graph, rank position method and Borda
   count method as data fusion methods are also used to combine these three
   results instead of the ``theory of dominance{''}. the results from this
   study show that there is no difference between the data fusion methods

Abstract = {{We examined the growth and quality of young oaks in stands established
   at three different spacings. The three densities were the traditional
   level, that is, 8000seedlingsha(-1) (1.5x0.85m) plus two where the
   initial density was decreased by 50\% and 70\%, achieved by increasing
   the distance between the rows from 1.5 to 3 or 4.5m. The experiment was
   located in central Poland on a moderately fertile site. In the two wider
   spacings, the intention was to use natural regeneration occurring
   between oak rows as a replacement of intraspecific competition for oaks.
   The mean height was only affected in the third and the fourth year after
   establishment. Subsequently, the differences between spacings with
   respect to both growth and quality traits were insignificant and small.
   At lower densities, natural regeneration of willow and aspen was
   abundant and inter-species competition replaced intra-species
   competition, thus explaining the absence of a spacing effect on growth
   and quality properties. In the study period, the wider spacings were
   economically beneficial compared to traditional densities. A strong
   competition affecting height growth caused by natural regeneration
   necessitated extensive tendings. More tendings are likely to be needed
   in the future and they might reduce the initial economical superiority
   of wider spacing. The study indicates that it is possible to decrease
   the initial spacing in oak plantations and simultaneously support good
   growing conditions by means of natural processes, for example, natural
   regeneration. However, economic efficiency of the method has to be
   studied in a longer perspective.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Many preschool children develop recurrent, severe episodes of
   lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Although viral infections are
   often present, bacteria may also contribute to illness pathogenesis.
   Strategies that effectively attenuate such episodes are needed.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate if early administration of azithromycin, started
   prior to the onset of severe LRTI symptoms, in preschool children with
   recurrent severe LRTIs can prevent the progression of these episodes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted across 9 academic US
   medical centers in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's
   AsthmaNet network, with enrollment starting in April 2011 and follow-up
   complete by December 2014. Participants were 607 children aged 12
   through 71 months with histories of recurrent, severe LRTIs and minimal
   day-to-day impairment.
   INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin
   (12mg/kg/d for 5 days; n = 307) or matching placebo (n = 300), started
   early during each predefined RTI (child's signs or symptoms prior to
   development of LRTI), based on individualized action plans, over a
   12-through 18-month period.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the number of
   RTIs not progressing to a severe LRTI, measured at the level of the RTI,
   that would in clinical practice trigger the prescription of oral
   corticosteroids. Presence of azithromycin-resistant organisms in
   oropharyngeal samples, along with adverse events, were among the
   secondary outcome measures.
   RESULTS A total of 937 treated RTIs (azithromycin group, 473; placebo
   group, 464) were experienced by 443 children (azithromycin group, 223;
   placebo group, 220), including 92 severe LRTIs (azithromycin group, 35;
   placebo group, 57). Azithromycin significantly reduced the risk of
   progressing to severe LRTI relative to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.64
   {[}95\% CI, 0.41-0.98], P =.04; absolute risk for first RTI: 0.05 for
   azithromycin, 0.08 for placebo; risk difference, 0.03 {[}95\% CI,
   0.00-0.06]). Induction of azithromycin-resistant organisms and adverse
   events were infrequently observed.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among young children with histories of
   recurrent severe LRTIs, the use of azithromycin early during an apparent
   RTI compared with placebo reduced the likelihood of severe LRTI. More
   information is needed on the development of antibiotic-resistant
   pathogens with this strategy.}},

Abstract = {{H3K9 methylation directs heterochromatin formation by recruiting
   multiple heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-containing complexes that
   deacetylate histones and methylate cytosine bases in DNA. In Neurospora
   crassa, a single H3K9 methyltransferase complex, called the DIM-5,-7,-9,
   CUL4, DDB1 Complex (DCDC), is required for normal growth and
   development. DCDC-deficient mutants are hypersensitive to the genotoxic
   agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), but the molecular basis of
   genotoxic stress is unclear. We found that both the MMS sensitivity and
   growth phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains are suppressed by mutation
   of embryonic ectoderm development or Su-(var)3-9; E(z); Trithorax
   (set)-7, encoding components of the H3K27 methyltransferase Polycomb
   repressive complex-2 (PRC2). Trimethylated histone H3K27 (H3K27me3)
   undergoes genome-wide redistribution to constitutive heterochromatin in
   DCDC- or HP1-deficient mutants, and introduction of an H3K27 missense
   mutation is sufficient to rescue phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains.
   Accumulation of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin does not compensate for
   silencing; rather, strains deficient for both DCDC and PRC2 exhibit
   synthetic sensitivity to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin and
   accumulate gamma H2A at heterochromatin. Together, these data suggest
   that PRC2 modulates the response to genotoxic stress.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience theory has been suggested as a strong framework for research
   on HIV prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among this
   population, literature indicates that African American/Black MSM are
   particularly vulnerable to health and social disparities associated with
   HIV transmission risk. Conceptualizing resilience as a part of one's
   social environment, this qualitative study investigates the specific
   elements of resilience, and the associated contexts and relationships,
   among a sample of 21 substance-using African American/Black MSM. Data
   indicate that (1) elements contributing to resilience are multiple and
   co-occurring, including inner strengths, social relationships, diversity
   of experience, religion/spirituality, altruism, and creativity; (2) as
   an element of resilience, social support was experienced differently
   among men who did and did not have supportive relationships with other
   gay and bisexual men, which has implications for social service
   provision and intervention approaches; and (3) diversity of experiences
   and relationships is an important influencing factor on expressions of
   resilience. Social services or interventions that facilitate the
   development of these elements of resilience will likely be especially
   beneficial for vulnerable African American/Black MSM.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the problem of planning the supply of rewards in coalition
   loyalty programmes considering that the buyer-supplier relationships
   with commercial partners are governed by option contracts rather than
   wholesale price contracts similar to what is commonly used in practice.
   We develop a two-stage stochastic linear programme model with simple
   recourse which considers uncertain demand requirements, limited reward
   purchasing budgets, multiple programme partners of various sizes,
   point-liability control targets and overall profitability. A sampling
   average approximation scheme is used to solve the model. Numerical
   experiments show that option contracts perform better than wholesale
   price contracts when redemption demand uncertainty is high and the
   number of redemption partners is large. The results also suggest that
   the common practice of increasing redemption capacities is not the most
   effective way to cope with demand uncertainties. Programmes that reduce
   redemption demand variability and/or create better contracting
   structures are more promising in improving points-liability, redemption
   budget spending and overall profitability than traditional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand for omega-3 containing fish oils.
   By-products from fish fillet production can be utilized for the
   production of fish oils and be a valuable source of omega-3 for human
   consumption. The aim of this work was to evaluate industrial processes
   for production of quality oil for human consumption made from Norwegian
   spring spawning herring by-products. A mobile production plant was used
   to compare two industrial processes, thermal treatment (wet rendering)
   and enzymatic protein hydrolysis, for production of oil from herring
   by-products immediately after filleting. Results show that high quality
   herring oil can be produced from fresh by-products. The use of
   by-products immediately after filleting resulted in a low amount of free
   fatty acids for all the produced oils (below 0.4\%). Thermal treatment
   at 70 degrees C resulted in an oil with lower oxidation status and
   higher stability compared to the oils produced by enzymatic protein
   hydrolysis. Nevertheless, both processing methods gave a crude oil of
   high quality compared to crude oils on the market.}},

Title = {{Genetic association analysis of miRNA SNPs implicates MIR145 in breast
   cancer susceptibility}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important small non-coding RNA
   molecules that regulate gene expression in cellular processes related to
   the pathogenesis of cancer. Genetic variation in miRNA genes could
   impact their synthesis and cellular effects and single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) are one example of genetic variants studied in
   relation to breast cancer. Studies aimed at identifying miRNA SNPs
   (miR-SNPs) associated with breast malignancies could lead towards
   further understanding of the disease and to develop clinical
   applications for early diagnosis and treatment.
   Methods: We genotyped a panel of 24 miR-SNPs using multiplex PCR and
   chip-based matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
   (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in two Caucasian breast
   cancer case control populations (Primary population: 173 cases and 187
   controls and secondary population: 679 cases and 301 controls).
   Association to breast cancer susceptibility was determined using
   chi-square (X-2) and odds ratio (OR) analysis.
   Results: Statistical analysis showed six miR-SNPs to be non-polymorphic
   and twelve of our selected miR-SNPs to have no association with breast
   cancer risk. However, we were able to show association between rs353291
   (located in MIR145) and the risk of developing breast cancer in two
   independent case control cohorts (p = 0.041 and p = 0.023).
   Conclusions: Our study is the first to report an association between a
   miR-SNP in MIR145 and breast cancer risk in individuals of Caucasian
   background. This finding requires further validation through genotyping
   of larger cohorts or in individuals of different ethnicities to
   determine the potential significance of this finding as well as studies
   aimed to determine functional significance.}},

Title = {{Sample storage conditions significantly influence faecal microbiome
   profiles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Sequencing-based studies of the human faecal microbiota are increasingly
   common. Appropriate storage of sample material is essential to avoid the
   introduction of post-collection bias in microbial community composition.
   Rapid freezing to -80 degrees C is commonly considered to be
   best-practice. However, this is not feasible in many studies,
   particularly those involving sample collection in participants' homes.
   We determined the extent to which a range of stabilisation and storage
   strategies maintained the composition of faecal microbial community
   structure relative to freezing to -80 degrees C. Refrigeration at 4
   degrees C, storage at ambient temperature, and the use of several common
   preservative buffers (RNAlater, OMNIgene. GUT, Tris-EDTA) were assessed
   relative to freezing. Following 72 hours of storage, faecal microbial
   composition was assessed by 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Refrigeration
   was associated with no significant alteration in faecal microbiota
   diversity or composition. However, samples stored using other conditions
   showed substantial divergence compared to -80 degrees C control samples.
   Aside from refrigeration, the use of OMNIgene. GUT resulted in the least
   alteration, while the greatest change was seen in samples stored in
   Tris-EDTA buffer. The commercially available OMNIgene. GUT kit may
   provide an important alternative where refrigeration and cold chain
   transportation is not available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines how Indigenous cultures and their connections to
   country are presented to the public in protected areas through a textual
   analysis of interpretive signage. In protected areas, different
   representational tropes are used to interpret colonial/settler, natural
   heritage and Indigenous landscapes and places. This paper begins by
   exploring the extent to which these contrasting interpretive strategies
   signify to visitors a hierarchy of place value in protected areas. It
   then asks whether the signage at Indigenous places alienates
   contemporary communities from country and history through a distant and
   detached view of culture, authorised via the template of scientific
   objectivity. These questions will be explored through an account that
   concludes with a consideration of the affective registers afforded to
   visitors within the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.}},

Abstract = {{Migration in China is traditionally dominated by unskilled rural-urban
   migrants that find their way into the city through urban villages,
   dormitories or informal housing. However, a remarkable increase in the
   number of skilled migrants has been witnessed with the economic
   restructuring. Reforms in the labour and housing market have shifted the
   spatial arrangement of opportunities, consequently changing migrants'
   access to the cities. Using 2000 Population Census and employing spatial
   regression models, this study shows skilled migrants to have better
   access to the city in the sense that their residences locate in the
   areas with more professional jobs and better houses. It is their
   advantages in the labour market that determines their favoured access to
   the public sector housing, resulting in better residential locations.
   Female skilled migrants are less likely than males to settle in areas
   with a large proportion of urban village housing or shared
   accommodation. These findings reveal the heterogeneity among migrants
   and the concomitant differences in spatial behaviour.}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces Postfix Genetic Programming (GP), a postfix
   notation-based GP, approach to symbolic regression for solving empirical
   modeling problems. The main features of Postfix-GP are presented. These
   features include (1) postfix-based, variable-length
   individual-representation and its stack-based evaluation and (2) subtree
   crossover operator and semantic-aware subtree crossover operator. The
   article also presents two different constant creation approaches to
   evolve useful numeric constants for symbolic regression problems. The
   first approach uses an explicit list of constants and the second allows
   the Postfix-GP algorithm to evolve constants. Use of Postfix-GP as a
   solution modeling tool is demonstrated by solving two function
   identification problems and two deterministic chaotic time series
   modeling problems. Effectiveness of the evolved models is tested by
   statistically analyzing their performance on training and out-of-sample
   datasets of the problems. Experimental results on test problems suggest
   that Postfix-GP offers a new possibility for solving empirical modeling
   problems. We also compared the performance of Postfix-GP with the lil-GP
   system for all four problems. The results suggest that the quality of
   solutions found by Postfix-GP was better than that found by lil-GP, for
   the tested problems.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Regulators of the histone H3-trimethyl lysine-4 (H3K4me3) mark are
   significantly associated with the genetic risk architecture of common
   neurodevelopmental disease, including schizophrenia and autism. Typical
   H3K4me3 is primarily localized in the form of sharp peaks, extending in
   neuronal chromatin on average only across 500-1500 base pairs mostly in
   close proximity to annotated transcription start sites. Here, through
   integrative computational analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data
   based on next-generation sequencing, we investigated H3K4me3 landscapes
   of sorted neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei in human postmortem,
   non-human primate and mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), and blood. To
   explore whether H3K4me3 peak signals could also extend across much
   broader domains, we examined broadest domain cell-type-specific H3K4me3
   peaks in an unbiased manner with an innovative approach on 41+12
   ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data sets. In PFC neurons, broadest H3K4me3
   distribution ranged from 3.9 to 12 kb, with extremely broad peaks
   (similar to 10 kb or broader) related to synaptic function and GABAergic
   signaling (DLX1, ELFN1, GAD1, IGSF9B and LINC00966). Broadest neuronal
   peaks showed distinct motif signatures and were centrally positioned in
   prefrontal gene-regulatory Bayesian networks and sensitive to defective
   neurodevelopment. Approximately 120 of the broadest H3K4me3 peaks in
   human PFC neurons, including many genes related to glutamatergic and
   dopaminergic signaling, were fully conserved in chimpanzee, macaque and
   mouse cortical neurons. Exploration of spread and breadth of lysine
   methylation markings could provide novel insights into epigenetic
   mechanism involved in neuropsychiatric disease and neuronal genome
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoemulsions were investigated as transdermal delivery systems for
   indomethacin. Six formulae were prepared using Triacetin, capryol 90 and
   labrafil as oils; Tween 80 and pluronic F127 as surfactants and
   transcutol and propylene glycol as co-surfactants. The continuous phase
   was that one with the larger volume fraction regardless of the
   hydrophile-lipophile balance of the surfactant/co-surfactant mixture.
   Surfactant type had significant effects on particle size and rheological
   properties of the nanoemulsions. Pluronic-based formulae recorded the
   lowest particle sizes and the highest viscosities. The prepared
   nanoemulsions increased drug solubility up to 610-fold compared with
   water. Refractive index measurements proved the compatibility between
   indomethacin and the used nanoemulsion components. Indomethacin was
   almost completely ionized at the pH values of the prepared
   nanoemulsions, suggesting drug absorption via the hydrophilic pathway of
   the skin upon topical application. Nanoemulsions controlled indomethacin
   release through semipermeable membrane and enhanced its permeation
   through excised newly born albino rat skin. The formulae were stable for
   six months at ambient conditions. Transdermal single application of
   selected formulae resulted in effective plasma levels up to 32h in rats.
   Nanoemulsions were significantly superior to other investigated
   transdermal approaches at solubilizing indomethacin and achieving higher
   plasma levels.}},

Title = {{Cognitive behavioural treatment for mild Alzheimer's patients and their
   caregivers (CBTAC): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: About 90 \% of all persons with mild Alzheimer's disease
   experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, most frequently apathy,
   depression, anxiety and irritability. These symptoms are associated with
   greater morbidity, a reduced quality of life for the patient, an
   increased burden and depression for the caregiver, and higher costs of
   care and nursing home placement. Psychosocial interventions based on
   behaviour therapy represent the most efficacious treatment of
   neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, there is no study, to our knowledge,
   that has evaluated a multicomponent treatment programme based on
   comprehensive, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This randomized
   controlled trial aims to evaluate a CBT-based treatment programme
   consisting of 8 modules and 25 sessions.
   Methods/design: Fifty patients with mild Alzheimer's disease alone or
   with mild mixed dementia (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) who
   have any neuropsychiatric symptom will be included. A caregiver must be
   available. The patients and their caregivers will be randomized to
   either the CBT-based intervention group or to the control condition
   group, which receives treatment as usual. The primary outcome measure is
   depression in the patient with Alzheimer's disease. The secondary
   outcome measures for a person with Alzheimer's disease are other
   neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life and coping strategies. The
   secondary outcome measures for a caregiver are caregiver's burden,
   depression, anxiety, anger, quality of life and coping strategies.
   Neuropsychological testing includes tests of cognitive function and
   activities of daily living and a global clinical assessment of severity.
   Participants in both groups will be assessed before and after the
   treatment phase (lasting approximately 9 months). Follow-up assessments
   will take place 6 and 12 months after treatment. All assessments will be
   conducted by blinded assessors.
   Discussion: This trial has the potential to establish an empirically
   based psychological treatment for non-cognitive symptoms that reduce the
   quality of life of a person with dementia and a caregiver. This
   treatment approach focuses not only on the person with dementia, but
   also on the caregiver and on the dyad. The treatment manual will be
   published and training workshops will be offered, so that the
   information can be widely spread among healthcare professionals.}},

Title = {{BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 mutations and CHEK2 c. 1100delC in different
   South African ethnic groups diagnosed with premenopausal and/or triple
   negative breast cancer}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Current knowledge of the aetiology of hereditary breast
   cancer in the four main South African population groups (black,
   coloured, Indian and white) is limited. Risk assessments in the black,
   coloured and Indian population groups are challenging because of
   restricted information regarding the underlying genetic contributions to
   inherited breast cancer in these populations. We focused this study on
   premenopausal patients (diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of
   50; n = 78) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (n = 30)
   from the four South African ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to
   determine the frequency and spectrum of germline mutations in BRCA1,
   BRCA2 and PALB2 and to evaluate the presence of the CHEK2 c. 1100delC
   allele in these patients.
   Methods: In total, 108 South African breast cancer patients underwent
   mutation screening using a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach in
   combination with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)
   to detect large rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2.
   Results: In 13 (12 \%) patients a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 was
   detected, three of which were novel mutations in black patients. None of
   the study participants was found to have an unequivocal pathogenic
   mutation in PALB2. Two (white) patients tested positive for the CHEK2 c.
   1100delC mutation, however, one of these also carried a deleterious
   BRCA2 mutation. Additionally, six variants of unknown clinical
   significance were identified (4 in BRCA2, 2 in PALB2), all in black
   patients. Within the group of TNBC patients, a higher mutation frequency
   was obtained (23.3 \%; 7/30) than in the group of patients diagnosed
   before the age of 50 (7.7 \%; 6/78).
   Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of evaluating germline
   mutations in major breast cancer genes in all of the South African
   population groups. This NGS study shows that mutation analysis is
   warranted in South African patients with triple negative and/or in
   premenopausal breast cancer.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{We study by numerical methods the phase dynamics in ballistic
   graphene-based short Josephson junctions. A
   superconductor-graphene-superconductor system exhibits superconductive
   quantum metastable states similar to those present in normal
   current-biased Josephson junctions. We investigate the effects of
   thermal and correlated fluctuations on the escape time from these
   metastable states, when the system is driven by an oscillating bias
   current in the presence of Gaussian white and colored noise sources.
   Varying the intensity and the correlation time of the noise source, it
   is possible to analyze the behavior of the escape time, or switching
   time, from a superconductive metastable state in different temperature
   regimes. Moreover, we are able to clearly distinguish dynamical regimes
   characterized by the dynamic resonant activation effect, in the absence
   of noise source, and the stochastic resonant activation phenomenon
   induced by the noise. For low initial values of the bias current, the
   dynamic resonant activation shows double-minimum structures, strongly
   dependent on the value of the damping parameter. Noise-enhanced
   stability is also observed in the system investigated. We analyze the
   probability density function (PDF) of the switching times. The PDFs for
   frequencies within the dynamic resonant activation minima are
   characterized by single peaks with exponential tails. The PDFs for noise
   intensities around the maxima of the switching time, peculiarity of the
   noise-enhanced stability phenomenon, are composed of regular sequences
   of two peaks for each period of the driving current, with exponentially
   decaying envelopes.}},

Title = {{Magnitude and factors associated with institutional delivery service
   utilization among childbearing mothers in Cheha district, Gurage zone,
   SNNPR, Ethiopia: a community based cross sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ethiopia is one of the six countries that contributes' to
   more than 50 \% of worldwide maternal deaths. While it is revealed that
   delivery attended by skilled provider at health facility reduced
   maternal deaths, more than half of all births in Ethiopia takes place at
   home. According to EDHS 2011 report nine women in every ten deliver at
   home in Ethiopia. The situation is much worse in southern region. The
   aim of our study is to measure the prevalence and to identify factors
   associated with institutional delivery service utilization among
   childbearing mothers in Cheha District, SNNPR, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community based cross sectional survey was conducted in Cheha
   District from Dec 22, 2012 to Jan 11, 2013. Multistage sampling method
   was employed and 816 women who gave birth within the past 2 years and
   lived in Cheha district for minimum of one year prior to the survey were
   involved in the study. Data was entered and analyzed using Epi Info
   Version 7 and SPSS Version 16. Frequencies and binary logistic
   regression were done. Factors affecting institutional delivery were
   determined using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 31 \% of women gave birth to their last child at
   health facility. Place of residence, ability to afford for the whole
   process to get delivery service at health facility, traveling time that
   takes to reach to health institution which provides delivery service,
   husband's attitude towards institutional delivery, counseling about
   where to deliver during ANC visit and place of birth of the 2nd youngest
   child were found to have statistically significant association with
   institutional delivery.
   Conclusion: Institutional delivery is low in the study area. Access to
   health service was found to be the most important predictor of
   institutional delivery among others. Accessing health facility within
   reasonable travel time; providing health education and BCC services to
   husbands and the community at large on importance of using health
   institution for delivery service; working to improve women's economic
   status; counseling women to give birth at health institution during
   their ANC visit and exploring the overall quality of ANC service are
   some of the areas where much work is needed to improve institutional
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Extraction of data from the proprietary RAW files generated by Thermo
   Fisher mass spectrometers is the primary step for subsequent data
   analysis. High resolution and high mass accuracy data obtained by
   state-of-the-art mass spectrometers (e.g., Orbitraps) can significantly
   improve both peptide/protein identification and quantification. We
   developed RawConverter, a stand-alone software tool, to improve data
   extraction on RAW files from high-resolution Thermo Fisher mass
   spectrometers. RawConverter extracts full scan and MS n data from RAW
   files like its predecessor RawXtract; most importantly, it associates
   the accurate precursor mass-tocharge (m/z) value with the tandem mass
   spectrum. RawConverter accepts RAW data generated by either
   data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or data-independent acquisition (DIA).
   It generates output into MS1/MS2/MS3, MGF, or mzXML file formats, which
   fulfills the format requirements for most data identification and
   quantification tools. Using the tandem mass spectra extracted by
   RawConverter with corrected m/z values, 32.8\%, 27.1\%, and 84.1\%,
   peptide spectra matches (PSMs) produce 17.4\% (13.0\%), 14.4\% (11.5\%),
   and 45.7\% (36.2\%) more peptide (protein) identifications than
   ProteoWizard, pXtract, and RawXtract, respectively. RawConverter is
   implemented in C\# and is freely accessible at

Title = {{Behavioral effects of mefloquine in tail suspension and light/dark tests}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Mefloquine hydrochloride has been used widely in the past few decades
   for malaria prophylaxis and treatment. However, in recent years, it has
   fallen out of favor due to reports of exposure being linked to numerous
   neuropsychiatric effects, including emotional disturbances. In this
   study we examined the effects of different doses (5, 25, or 100 mg/kg)
   of mefloquine relative to vehicle on male C57BL/6 J mice in two tests of
   emotional behavior, the light-dark box and the tail suspension test. It

Abstract = {{In this work, polycarbonate-TiO2 nanocomposite films were prepared with
   different percentages. The aim was to consider the effect of O-2 LF
   plasma (50Hz) on the hydrophilicity, surface energy, and surface
   morphology of polycarbonate and polycarbonate-TiO2 nanocomposite.
   Structure of samples was determined by using X-ray diffraction analysis.
   In comparison with the reference sample, the samples' structure did not
   change after plasma treatment. Surface properties of polycarbonate and
   polycarbonate-TiO2 nanocomposite films were studied by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement, atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), and Vickers microhardness tester. XPS analysis
   showed that the surface of samples became more oxidized due to plasma
   treatment. The water contact angle significantly decreased from 88
   degrees to 15 degrees after plasma treatment. It was observed that the
   hardness of the nanocomposite films was not modified after plasma
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Prostate cancer incidence in men 75 years and older
   substantially decreased following the 2008 US Preventive Services Task
   Force (USPSTF) recommendation against prostate-specific antigen
   (PSA)-based screening for this age group. It is unknown whether
   incidence has changed since the USPSTF recommendation against screening
   for all men in May 2012.
   OBJECTIVE To examine recent changes in stage-specific prostate cancer
   incidence and PSA screening rates following the 2008 and 2012 USPSTF
   recommendations.
   DESIGN AND SETTINGS Ecologic study of age-standardized prostate cancer
   incidence (newly diagnosed cases/100 000 men aged >= 50 years) by stage
   from 2005 through 2012 using data from 18 population-based Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries and PSA screening rate
   in the past year among men 50 years and older without a history of
   prostate cancer who responded to the 2005 (n = 4580), 2008 (n = 3476),
   2010 (n = 4157), and 2013 (n = 6172) National Health Interview Survey
   (NHIS).
   EXPOSURES The USPSTF recommendations to omit PSA-based screening for
   average-risk men.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prostate cancer incidence and incidence
   ratios (IRs) comparing consecutive years from 2005 through 2012 by age
   (>= 50, 50-74, and >= 75 years) and SEER summary stage categorized as
   local/regional or distant and PSA screening rate and rate ratios (SRRs)
   comparing successive survey years by age.
   RESULTS Prostate cancer incidence per 100 000 in men 50 years and older
   (N = 446 009 in SEER areas) was 534.9 in 2005, 540.8 in 2008, 505.0 in
   2010, and 416.2 in 2012; rates began decreasing in 2008 and the largest
   decrease occurred between 2011 and 2012, from 498.3 (99\% CI,
   492.8-503.9) to 416.2 (99\% CI, 411.2-421.2). The number of men 50 years
   and older diagnosed with prostate cancer nationwide declined by 33 519,
   from 213 562 men in 2011 to 180 043 men in 2012. Declines in incidence
   since 2008 were confined to local/regional-stage disease and were
   similar across age and race/ethnicity groups. The percentage of men 50
   years and older reporting PSA screening in the past 12 months was 36.9\%
   in 2005, 40.6\% in 2008, 37.8\% in 2010, and 30.8\% in 2013. In relative
   terms, screening rates increased by 10\% (SRR, 1.10; 99\% CI, 1.01-1.21)
   between 2005 and 2008 and then decreased by 18\%(SRR, 0.82; 99\% CI,
   0.75-0.89) between 2010 and 2013. Similar screening patterns were found
   in age subgroups 50 to 74 years and 75 years and older.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Both the incidence of early-stage prostate
   cancer and rates of PSA screening have declined and coincide with 2012
   USPSTF recommendation to omit PSA screening from routine primary care
   for men. Longer follow-up is needed to see whether these decreases are
   associated with trends in mortality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for assessing the respective contributions
   of the variations of flow-rate and concentration of any pollution
   parameter to the variations of the mass discharge of the same parameter.
   This method uses a specially designed decomposition of variance, which
   gives a priority to the information provided by flow-rates, either
   directly, or through the correlation between flow-rates and
   concentrations. To demonstrate the potential interest of this method,
   data monitored on two catchments in the city of Paris (France) are
   processed according this method, with turbidity being used as a
   surrogate for suspended solids concentration. Results show that volumes
   provide a fairly good evaluation of masses at the scale of whole events.
   Inside any particular event, concentrations are major contributors to
   the variations of mass discharge, despite the correlations between flow
   rate and concentration which may be observed for many rain events.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We evaluated a large-scale transition of primary care
   physicians to blended capitation models and team-based care in Ontario,
   Canada, to understand the effect of each type of reform on the
   management and prevention of chronic disease.
   Methods: We used population-based administrative data to assess
   monitoring of diabetes mellitus and screening for cervical, breast and
   colorectal cancer among patients belonging to team-based capitation,
   non-team-based capitation or enhanced fee-for-service medical homes as
   of Mar. 31, 2011 (n = 10 675 480). We used Poisson regression models to
   examine these associations for 2011. We then used a fitted nonlinear
   model to compare changes in outcomes between 2001 and 2011 by type of
   medical home.
   Results: In 2011, patients in a team-based capitation setting were more
   likely than those in an enhanced fee-for-service setting to receive
   diabetes monitoring (39.7\% v. 31.6\%, adjusted relative risk {[}RR]
   1.22, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.18 to 1.25), mammography (76.6\%
   v. 71.5\%, adjusted RR 1.06, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.07) and colorectal cancer
   screening (63.0\% v. 60.9\%, adjusted RR 1.03, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.04).
   Over time, patients in medical homes with team-based capitation
   experienced the greatest improvement in diabetes monitoring (absolute
   difference in improvement 10.6\% {[}95\% CI 7.9\% to 13.2\%] compared
   with enhanced fee for service; 6.4\% {[}95\% CI 3.8\% to 9.1\%] compared
   with non-team-based capitation) and cervical cancer screening (absolute
   difference in improvement 7.0\% {[}95\% CI 5.5\% to 8.5\%] compared with
   enhanced fee for service; 5.3\% {[}95\% CI 3.8\% to 6.8\%] compared with
   non-team-based capitation). For breast and colorectal cancer screening,
   there were no significant differences in change over time between
   different types of medical homes.
   Interpretation: The shift to capitation payment and the addition of
   team-based care in Ontario were associated with moderate improvements in
   processes related to diabetes care, but the effects on cancer screening
   were less clear.}},

Abstract = {{As nucleators of the mitotic spindle and primary cilium, centrosomes
   play crucial roles in equal segregation of DNA content to daughter
   cells, coordination of growth and differentiation, and transduction of
   homeostatic cues. Whereas the majority of mammalian cells carry no more
   than two centrosomes per cell, exceptions to this rule apply in certain
   specialized tissues and in select disease states, including cancer.
   Centrosome amplification, or the condition of having more than two
   centrosomes per cell, has been suggested to contribute to instability of
   chromosomes, imbalance in asymmetric divisions, and reorganization of
   tissue architecture; however, the degree to which these conditions are a
   direct cause of or simply a consequence of human disease is poorly
   understood. Here we addressed this issue by generating a mouse model
   inducing centrosome amplification in a naturally proliferative
   epithelial tissue by elevating Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) expression in
   the skin epidermis. By altering centrosome numbers, we observed
   multiciliated cells, spindle orientation errors, and chromosome
   segregation defects within developing epidermis. None of these defects
   was sufficient to impart a proliferative advantage within the tissue,
   however. Rather, impaired mitoses led to p53-mediated cell death and
   contributed to defective growth and stratification. Despite these
   abnormalities, mice remained viable and healthy, although epidermal
   cells with centrosome amplification were still appreciable. Moreover,
   these abnormalities were insufficient to disrupt homeostasis and
   initiate or enhance tumorigenesis, underscoring the powerful
   surveillance mechanisms in the skin.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Nefopam is a widely available analgesic for the management of
   pain. The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of regional
   hyperthermia of the abdominal area on the pharmacokinetics of nefopam.
   Materials and methods: A randomised, single-dose, crossover, open-label
   study was conducted to reveal the effect of hyperthermia using modulated
   electro-hyperthermia on the pharmacokinetics of nefopam. The
   pharmacokinetics of orally administered nefopam without hyperthermia was
   studied in 12 healthy volunteers and then 7 days later they were treated
   with nefopam plus modulated electro-hyperthermia to the abdominal area
   for 1h. Blood samples were collected up to 24h after the drug
   administration. From the blood concentration-time curve, the maxinum
   plasma concentration (C-max), time to C-max (T-max) and the area under
   the curve (AUC) were obtained. The safety and tolerability of these
   treatments were also assessed. Results: The geometric mean ratios (GMRs)
   ((nefopam+modulated electro-hyperthermia)/nefopam) and the associated
   90\% confidence intervals (CIs) for C-max, AUC(last) and AUC(inf) were
   1.2804 (1.1155 approximate to 1.4696), 1.0512 (0.9555 approximate to
   1.1566) and 1.0612 (0.9528 approximate to 1.1819), respectively. The
   increase in C-max was statistically significant, and T-max was
   significantly shortened. Conclusions: The significant increase in C-max
   and decrease in T-max indicated that modulated electro-hyperthermia
   increased the absorption of the orally administered nefopam, thereby
   transitionally increasing the blood concentration of the drug. The AUC
   is an important parameter that contributes to the therapeutic effect of
   drugs. The lack of significant change in AUC suggests that modulated
   electro-hyperthermia may increases the absorption of orally administered
   drugs without increasing the systemic adverse effect of the drugs.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the ability of the human convective boundary
   layer to transport pollution in a quiescent indoor environment. The
   impact of the source location in the vicinity of a human body is
   examined in relation to pollution distribution in the breathing zone and
   the thickness of the pollution boundary layer. The study, in addition,
   evaluates the effects of the room air temperature, table positioning,
   and seated body inclination. The human body is represented by a thermal
   manikin that has a body shape, size, and surface temperature that
   resemble those of a real person. The results show that the source
   location has a considerable influence on the breathing zone pollution
   concentrations and on the thickness of the pollution boundary layer. The
   highest breathing zone concentrations are achieved when the pollution is
   located at the chest, while there is negligible exposure for the
   pollution emitted at the upper back or behind the chair. The results
   also indicate that a decrease in personal exposure to pollutants
   released from or around the human body increases the extent to which the
   pollution spreads to the surroundings. Reducing the room air temperature
   or backward body inclination intensifies the transport of the pollution
   to the breathing zone and increases personal exposure. The front edge of
   a table positioned at zero distance from the human body can reduce the
   pollution transport to the breathing zone, or it can increase transport
   of the clean air from beneath if positioned at a 10-cm (0.33-ft)
   distance.}},

Title = {{Decreasing the Burden of Type 2 Diabetes in South Africa: The Impact of
   Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Type 2 diabetes poses an increasing public health burden in South Africa
   (SA) with obesity as the main driver of the epidemic. Consumption of
   sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is linked to weight gain and reducing
   SSB consumption may significantly impact the prevalence of obesity and
   related diseases. We estimated the effect of a 20\% SSB tax on the
   burden of diabetes in SA.
   Methods and Findings
   We constructed a life table-based model in Microsoft Excel (2010).
   Consumption data from the 2012 SA National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey, previously published own-and cross-price
   elasticities of SSBs and energy balance equations were used to estimate
   changes in daily energy intake and its projected impact on BMI arising
   from increased SSB prices. Diabetes relative risk and prevalent years
   lived with disability estimates fromthe Global Burden of Disease Study
   andmodelled disease epidemiology estimates from a previous study were
   used to estimate the effect of the BMI changes on diabetes burden.
   Diabetes cost estimates were obtained from the South African Council
   forMedical Schemes. Over 20 years, a 20\% SSB tax could reduce diabetes
   incident cases by 106 000 in women (95\% uncertainty interval (UI) 70
   000-142 000) and by 54 000 in men (95\% UI: 33 000-80 000); and
   prevalence in all adults by 4.0\% (95\% UI: 2.7\%-5.3\%). Cumulatively
   over twenty years, approximately 21 000 (95\% UI: 14 000-29 000) adult
   T2DM-related deaths, 374 000 DALYs attributed to T2DM (95\% UI: 299
   000-463 000) and over ZAR10 billion T2DM healthcare costs (95\% UI:
   ZAR6.8-14.0 billion) equivalent to USD860million (95\% UI: USD570
   million-USD1.2 billion) may be averted.
   Conclusion
   Fiscal policy on SSBs has the potential to mitigate the diabetes
   epidemic in South Africa and contribute to the National Department of
   Health goals stated in the National NCD strategic plan.}},

Abstract = {{This is one of the first studies on lightning incidents that take place
   in the neighbourhood of Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake in the
   world that borders Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Lightning accident
   statistics in the region have been documented segment wise. The number
   of lightning occurrences in the north-western shore and that in the
   north-eastern shore were compared. The region has a distinctly
   recognizable season with high lightning accident density which runs from
   May to November and low lightning accident period from December to
   April. August peaks in lightning incidents. Lightning-related incidents
   are very much prevalent during the period between May and August due to
   the dominant south easterlies. The study reveals that the north-western
   part has slightly higher lightning accidents than the north-eastern
   part. North-eastern part records relatively high number of lightning
   accidents in the morning hours whereas the north-western sector
   experiences the same in the afternoon hours. Many features of lightning
   accidents and their locations have features that are in agreement with
   the same observed in other parts of East Africa. Following the
   statistics collected and incidents observed, suitable safety measures
   have been recommended for the communities that reside in the shores and
   nearby areas of Lake Victoria.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding health inequity in India is a challenge, given
   the complexity that characterise the lives of its residents.
   Interpreting constructive action to address health inequity in the
   country is rare, though much exhorted by the global research community.
   We critically analysed operational understandings of inequity embedded
   in convergent actions to address health-related inequalities by
   stakeholders in varying contexts within the country.
   Methods: Two implementer groups were purposively chosen to reflect on
   their experiences addressing inequalities in health (and its
   determinants) in the public sector working in rural areas and in the
   private non-profit sector working in urban areas. A representing
   co-author from each group developed narratives around how they
   operationally defined, monitored, and addressed health inequality in
   their work. These narratives were content analysed by two other
   coauthors to draw out common and disparate themes characterising each
   action context, operational definitions, shifts and changes in
   strategies and definitions, and outcomes (both intended and unintended).
   Findings were reviewed by all authors to develop case studies.
   Results: We theorised that action to address health inequality converges
   around a unifying theme or pivot, and developed a heuristic that
   describes the features of this convergence. In one case, the convergence
   was a single decision-making platform for deliberation around myriad
   village development issues, while in the other, convergence brought
   together communities, legal, police, and health system action around one
   salient health issue. One case emphasized demand generation, the other
   was focussed on improving quality and supply of services. In both cases,
   the operationalization of equity broke beyond a biomedical or clinical
   focus. Dearth of data meant that implementers exercised various
   strategies to gather it, and to develop interventions - always around a
   core issue or population.
   Conclusions: This exercise demonstrated the possibility of constructive
   engagement between implementers and researchers to understand and
   theorize action on health equity and the social determinants of health.
   This heuristic developed may be of use not just for further research,
   but also for on-going appraisal and design of policy and praxis, both
   sensitive to and reflective of Indian concerns and understandings.}},

Abstract = {{Underground thermal energy storage (UTES) use has showed a sharp rise in
   numbers in the last decades, with aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES)
   and borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) most widely used. In many
   urban areas with contaminated aquifers, there exists a desire for
   sustainable heating and cooling with UTES and a need for remediation. We
   investigated the potential synergy between UTES and bioremediation with
   batch experiments to simulate the effects of changing temperature and
   liquid exchange that occur in ATES systems, and of only temperature
   change occurring in BTES systems on cis-DCE reductive dechlorination.
   Compared to the natural situation (NS) at a constant temperature of 10
   degrees C, both UTES systems with 25/5 degrees C for warm and cold well
   performed significantly better in cis-DCE (cis-1,2-dichloroethene)
   removal. The overall removal efficiency under mimicked ATES and BTES
   conditions were respectively 13 and 8.6 times higher than in NS.
   Inoculation with Dehalococcoides revealed that their initial presence is
   a determining factor for the dechlorination process. Temperature was the
   dominating factor when Dehalococcoides abundance was sufficient.
   Stimulated biodegradation was shown to be most effective in the mimicked
   ATES warm well because of the combined effect of suitable temperature,
   sustaining biomass growth, and regular cis-DCE supply.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamical evolution of spatial patterns in a complex system can
   reveal the underlying structure and stability of stationary states. As a
   model system we employ a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate at the

   linear interconversion. Excellent agreement is found between the
   detailed experimental time evolution and the corresponding numerical
   mean-field computations. Analyzing the dynamics of the system, we find
   clear indications of stationary states that we term nonlinear dressed
   states. A steady-state bifurcation analysis reveals a smooth connection
   of these states with dark-bright soliton solutions of the integrable
   two-component Manakov model.}},

Abstract = {{International attention for disability recognises that it plays an
   important role in persistent poverty. Leprosy can cause preventable
   disability. Stigma associated with leprosy often has greater
   implications for people affected than physical impairments. The Stigma
   Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) project in Indonesia employs
   an action research methodology to develop stigma reduction
   interventions. By exploring the different mindsets of the stakeholders
   in the reconnaissance phase of the project, the project identified
   differences in aspirations, attitudes to research, and conflicting
   intrinsic models of disability. The differences in mindsets are not
   symptoms of failure but, rather, should be actively sought out.
   L'attention internationale accordee aux handicaps reconnait qu'ils
   peuvent jouer un role important dans la persistance de la pauvrete. La
   lepre peut entrainer des handicaps evitables. La stigmatisation associee
   a la lepre a souvent des implications plus importantes pour les
   personnes touchees que les handicaps physiques. Le projet Stigma
   Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI Evaluation de la stigmatisation
   et reduction de l'impact) en Indonesie a recours a une methodologie de
   recherche-action pour elaborer des interventions de reduction de la
   stigmatisation. En explorant les differentes mentalites des parties
   prenantes durant la phase de reconnaissance du projet, ce dernier a
   identifie des differences sur le plan des aspirations, des attitudes
   relatives aux recherches et des modeles intrinseques contradictoires des
   handicaps. Les differences de mentalite ne sont pas des symptomes
   d'echec ; il convient en fait de les mettre en evidence. A nivel
   internacional, el discurso sobre las discapacidades reconoce que estas
   desempenan un papel importante en la persistencia de la pobreza. A
   menudo, el estigma asociado a la lepra, mas que las limitaciones fisicas
   que conlleva, es el que genera implicaciones mas significativas para las
   personas afectadas por esta enfermedad. El proyecto de Valoracion del
   Estigma y Reduccion de su Impacto (sari por sus siglas en ingles)
   desarrollado en Indonesia utiliza una metodologia de
   investigacion-accion orientada a disenar intervenciones que permitan
   disminuir el estigma. A partir del analisis de distintas actitudes de
   los actores mas importantes durante la fase de reconocimiento del
   proyecto, se identificaron diferencias en cuanto a aspiraciones, a
   actitudes vinculadas a la investigacion y a modelos intrinsecos de
   discapacidad que se encuentran en disputa. Estas actitudes diferenciadas
   no constituyen un sintoma de fracaso sino que deben ser buscadas
   activamente.}},

Abstract = {{Effective emotion regulation is important for high-quality social
   functioning. Recent laboratory-based evidence suggests that mindfulness
   may enhance emotion regulation in socioemotional contexts; however,
   little is known about mindful emotion regulation during in vivo social
   interactions. In a study of romantic couples, we assessed each partner's
   mindfulness and top-down attentional efficiency (with an Emotional
   Go/No-Go task) prior to sampling emotions and perceived connection with
   others during day-to-day social interactions. Analyses revealed that
   mindfulness-related differences in top-down attentional efficiency on
   the Emotional Go/No-Go predicted positive emotion during daily social
   interactions. In turn, positive emotion and two additional indices of
   social emotion regulation each mediated the relation between actor
   mindfulness and perceived social connection. In corresponding analyses,
   neither trait reappraisal nor suppression use predicted the outcomes,
   and all mindfulness relations held controlling for these strategies.
   Findings support a framework for investigating mindfulness and
   higher-quality social functioning, for which mindful emotion regulation
   may be key.}},

Abstract = {{Experience-driven plasticity of glutamatergic synapses on striatal spiny
   projection neurons (SPNs) is thought to be essential to goal-directed
   behavior and habit formation. One major form of striatal plasticity,
   long-term depression (LTD), has long appeared to be expressed only
   pre-synaptically. Contrary to this view, nitric oxide (NO) generated by
   striatal interneurons was found to induce a post-synaptically expressed
   form of LTD at SPN glutamatergic synapses. This form of LTD was
   dependent on signaling through guanylyl cyclase and protein kinase G,
   both of which are abundantly expressed by SPNs. NO-LTD was unaffected by
   local synaptic activity or antagonism of endocannabinoid (eCb) and
   dopamine receptors, all of which modulate canonical, pre-synaptic LTD.
   Moreover, NO signaling disrupted induction of this canonical LTD by
   inhibiting dendritic Ca2+ channels regulating eCb synthesis. These
   results establish an interneuron-dependent, heterosynaptic form of
   post-synaptic LTD that could act to promote stability of the striatal
   network during learning.}},

Abstract = {{Ultramafic and volcanic soils are exploited for industrial activities
   such as mining due to their high metal content, thus it is important
   that species in these areas are documented before irreversible
   environmental damage sets in. In this study, aerial and ground leaf
   litter, dead vines and twigs from six forest patches on volcanic and
   ultramafic soils in the provinces of Bataan, Pangasinan and Zambales in
   the Philippines were cultured in moist chambers (MC) and assessed for
   myxomycete diversity. From the 77\% positive MC for myxomycetes, a total
   of 40 species from 14 genera were identified. Despite the higher heavy
   metal content, forest patches on ultramafic soils had greater species
   diversity as compared to volcanic soils. In this study, 10 species were
   abundant in both forest patches, namely Arcyria cinerea, Diachea
   leucopodia, Diderma effusum, D. hemisphaericum, Didymium ochroideum,
   Perichaena chrysosperma, P. corticalis, P. depressa, P. dictyonema and
   Physarum melleum. Selected myxomycetes tested for Cr and Mn content had
   equal or higher heavy metal levels than that of their leaf substrate.
   The study hypothesised that the presence of Mn7+ in fruiting bodies of
   myxomycetes was due to the phagocytosis of food bacteria inhabiting the
   substrates on the forest soil laden with heavy metal.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores a particular materialisation of the relationship

   The landscape at the heart of this study is that of the ruined
   blackhouse, an intrinsic part and mnemonic of crofting identity in the
   Scottish Highlands. These quotidian and mundane spaces are constituted
   by routine habits which, together with the material left-behinds' of a
   past way of life, comprise landmarks to place making from below and

Abstract = {{Vetiver essential oil (VEO) has been used in aromatherapy for
   relaxation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of VEO on an
   anxiety-related behavioural model (the elevated plus-maze, EPM) and
   immediate-early gene c-fos in amygdala, known to be involved in anxiety.
   Male Wistar rats were administered diazepam (1mg/kgi.p.) for 30min or
   inhalated with VEO (1\%, 2.5\% or 5\%w/w) for 7min prior to exposure to
   the EPM. Then, the effects of 2.5\% VEO, the anxiolytic dose, on c-fos
   expression in amygdala were investigated. The rats given either 2.5\%
   VEO or diazepam exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in the EPM. VEO and
   diazepam significantly increased c-fos expression in the lateral
   division of the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeL). Therefore, the
   anxiolytic properties of VEO might be associated with altering neuronal
   activation in CeL. However, future studies are needed to investigate the
   precise mechanism of action of VEO.}},

Title = {{Response thresholds for epidemic meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa
   following the introduction of MenAfriVac (R)}},
Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{6212-6217}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Since 2010, countries in the African meningitis belt have
   been introducing a new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine
   (MenAfriVac (R)) through mass campaigns. With the subsequent decline in
   meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) and relative
   increase in meningitis due to other serogroups, mainly N. meningitidis
   serogroup W (NmW), the World Health Organisation (WHO) initiated a
   review of the incidence thresholds that guide response to meningitis
   epidemics in the African meningitis belt.
   Methods: Meningitis surveillance data from African meningitis belt
   countries from 2002 to 2013 were used to construct a single NmW dataset.
   The performance of different weekly attack rates, used as thresholds to
   initiate vaccination response, on preventing further cases was
   estimated. The cumulative seasonal attack rate used to define an
   epidemic was also varied.
   Results: Considerable variation in effect at different thresholds was
   observed. In predicting epidemics defined as a seasonal cumulative
   incidence of 100/10(5) population, an epidemic threshold of 10
   cases/10(5) population/week performed well. Based on this same epidemic
   threshold, with a 6 week interval between crossing the epidemic
   threshold and population protection from a meningococcal vaccination
   campaign, an estimated 17 cases per event would be prevented by
   vaccination. Lowering the threshold increased the number of cases per
   event potentially prevented, as did shortening the response interval. If
   the interval was shortened to 4 weeks at the threshold of 10/10(5), the
   number of cases prevented would increase to 54 per event.
   Conclusions: Accelerating time to vaccination could prevent more cases
   per event than lowering the threshold. Once the meningitis epidemic
   threshold is crossed, it is of critical importance that vaccination
   campaigns, where appropriate, are initiated rapidly. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Early impairment of coronary microvascular perfusion capacity in rats on
   a high fat diet}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR DIABETOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: It remains to be established if, and to what extent, the
   coronary microcirculation becomes compromised during the development of
   obesity and insulin resistance. Recent studies suggest that changes in
   endothelial glycocalyx properties contribute to microvascular
   dysfunction under (pre-) diabetic conditions. Accordingly, early effects
   of diet-induced obesity on myocardial perfusion and function were
   studied in rats under baseline and hyperaemic conditions.
   Methods: Rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and myocardial
   microvascular perfusion was determined using first-pass perfusion MRI
   before and after adenosine infusion. The effect of HFD on
   microcirculatory properties was also assessed by sidestream darkfield
   (SDF) imaging of the gastrocnemius muscle.
   Results: HFD-fed rats developed central obesity and insulin sensitivity
   was reduced as evidenced by the marked reduction in insulin-induced
   phosphorylation of Akt in both cardiac and gastrocnemius muscle. Early
   diet-induced obesity did not lead to hypertension or cardiac
   hypertrophic remodeling. In chow-fed, control rats a robust increase in
   cardiac microvascular perfusion was observed upon adenosine infusion
   (+40 \%; p < 0.05). In contrast, the adenosine response was abrogated in
   rats on a HFD (+8 \%; N.S.). HFD neither resulted in rarefaction or loss
   of glycocalyx integrity in skeletal muscle, nor reduced staining
   intensity of the glycocalyx of cardiac capillaries.
   Conclusions: Alterations in coronary microcirculatory function as
   assessed by first-pass perfusion MRI represent one of the earliest
   obesity-related cardiac adaptations that can be assessed non-invasively.
   In this early stage of insulin resistance, disturbances in glycocalyx
   barrier properties appeared not to contribute to the observed changes in
   coronary microvascular function.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes an evaluation of a theory-based trajectory for

   FeTiP is a multicomponent trajectory for professional development and
   combines several types of interventions. Its goal is to help teachers
   expand their feedback behavior in the classroom to provide more, and
   more effective (i.e. learning-enhancing), feedback. We first describe
   the foundation of FeTiP, with a central focus on how classroom behavior
   can be influenced by a multicomponent trajectory of professional
   development, as this is often a major aim in initiatives for the
   professional development of teachers but is the most difficult to
   establish. We describe the effects of FeTiP on the feedback behavior of
   teachers and attempt to explain why these effects occurred.}},

Abstract = {{In probing the oxygen reactivity of an Enterococcus faecalis NADH
   oxidase (Nox; O-2 -> 2H(2)O) C42S mutant lacking the Cys42-sulfenic acid
   (Cys42-SOH) redox center, we provided direct evidence of a
   C(4a)-peroxyflavin intermediate in the oxidative half-reaction and also
   described a conformational or chemical change that is rate-limiting for
   full reoxidation of the homodimer. In this work, the Nox from
   Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyNox) has been expressed and crystallized, and
   the overoxidized wild-type {[}Cys44-SOH -> Cys44-sulfinic acid
   (Cys44-SO2H)] and C44S mutant enzyme structures have been refined at 2.0
   and 2.15 angstrom, respectively. We show that azide binds to the
   two-electron reduced wild-type (EH2) enzyme and to the mutant enzyme in
   solution, but with a significantly higher affinity for the mutant
   protein. The spectral course of the titration with the SpyNox EH2 form
   clearly indicates progressive displacement of the Cys44-S- -> FAD
   charge-transfer interaction. An azide soak with C44S Nox crystals led to
   the structure of the complex, as refined at 2.10 angstrom. The
   active-site N-3(-) ligand is proximal to the Ser44 and His 11 side
   chains, and a significant shift in the Ser44 side chain also appears.
   This provides an attractive explanation for the azide-induced loss of
   charge-transfer absorbance seen with the wild-type EH2 form and also
   permits accommodation of a C(4a)-peroxyflavin structural model. The
   conformation of Ser44 and the associated helical element, and the
   resulting steric accommodation, appear to be linked to the
   conformational change described in the E. faecalis C42S Nox oxidative
   half-reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were
   expressed in myeloblasts and mature myeloid cells. In this study, we
   further demonstrated that rearranged Ig kappa light chain was also
   frequently expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (6/6), primary
   myeloblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (17/18), and
   mature monocytes (11/12) and neutrophils (3/12) from patients with
   non-hematopoietic neoplasms, but not or only rarely expressed in mature
   neutrophils (0/8) or monocytes (1/8) from healthy individuals.
   Interestingly, myeloblasts and mature monocytes/neutrophils shared
   several restricted IGKV and IGKJ gene usages but with different
   expression frequency. Surprisingly, almost all of the acute myeloid
   leukemia-derived IGKV showed somatic hypermutation; in contrast, mature
   myeloid cells-derived IGKV rarely had somatic hypermutation. More
   importantly, although IGK expression appeared not to affect cell
   proliferation, reduced IGK expression led to a decrease in cell
   migration in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NB4, whereas
   increased IGK expression promoted their motility. In summary, IGK is
   expressed in myeloblasts and mature myeloid cells from patients with
   non-hematopoietic neoplasms, and is involved in cell migration. These
   results suggest that myeloid cells-derived IgK may have a role in
   leukemogenesis and may serve as a novel tumor marker for monitoring
   minimal residual disease and developing target therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of solid and liquid tobacco wastes with high nicotine content
   remains a longstanding challenge. Here, we explored an environmentally
   friendly approach to replace tobacco waste disposal with resource
   recovery by genetically engineering Pseudomonas putida. The biosynthesis
   of 3-succinoyl-pyridine (SP), a precursor in the production of
   hypotensive agents, from the tobacco waste was developed using whole
   cells of the engineered Pseudomonas strain, S16dspm. Under optimal
   conditions in fed-batch biotransformation, the final concentrations of
   product SP reached 9.8 g/L and 8.9 g/L from aqueous nicotine solution
   and crude suspension of the tobacco waste, respectively. In addition,
   the crystal compound SP produced from aqueous nicotine of the tobacco
   waste in batch biotransformation was of high purity and its isolation
   yield on nicotine was 54.2\%. This study shows a promising route for
   processing environmental wastes as raw materials in order to produce
   valuable compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Current research distinguishes between self, directive and social
   function of autobiographical memories (AMs). To date, only few studies
   have investigated these functions across adulthood. The comparison of
   different age groups requires that the functions of AM are measured in
   the same way across groups (measurement invariance, MI). Additionally to
   the average use of AM, the factor variances and factor covariances among
   the three functions were examined across adulthood. In the present
   study, 1290 adults (aged between 17 and 93 years) completed the Thinking
   about Life Experiences Questionnaire (TALE), which measures the overall
   use of AMs for self, directive and social purposes. The sample was
   divided into five age groups and partial strong MI was established using
   multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The results showed an increase
   in the factor associations as well as a decrease in the factor mean
   levels of all three functions across age groups. Both findings could be
   adequately described by linear functions of age. The factor variances
   were on most parts equal across age groups. These results strengthen the
   assumption thatfrom a lifespan developmental perspectivethe use of AM
   may be aligned with relatively normative developmental tasks in a given
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders, which are
   characterized by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc)
   converted from a normal host cellular prion protein (PrPC). Experimental
   studies suggest that PrPC is enriched with alpha-helical structure,
   whereas PrPSc contains a high proportion of beta-sheet. In this study,
   we report the impact of N-glycosylation and the membrane on the
   secondary structure stability utilizing extensive microsecond molecular
   dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the HB (residues 173 to
   194) C-terminal fragment undergoes conformational changes and helix
   unfolding in the absence of membrane environments because of the
   competition between protein backbone intramolecular and protein-water
   intermolecular hydrogen bonds as well as its intrinsic instability
   originated from the amino acid sequence. This initiation of the
   unfolding process of PrPC leads to a subsequent increase in the length
   of the HB-HC loop (residues 195 to 199) that may trigger larger rigid
   body motions or further unfolding around this region. Continuous
   interactions between prion protein and the membrane not only constrain
   the protein conformation but also decrease the solvent accessibility of
   the backbone atoms, thereby stabilizing the secondary structure, which
   is enhanced by N-glycosylation via additional interactions between the
   N-glycans and the membrane surface.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to utilize waste leather buff (WLB) as
   filler in cellulose and make biocomposites for packaging applications
   such as wrappers. Cellulose was dissolved in the environmentally
   friendly ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl). To
   this solution, WLB was added in amounts of 5 to 25wt.\% of cellulose.
   The cellulose and cellulose/WLB composite films were prepared by
   regenerating the corresponding cast solutions in a water coagulation
   bath followed by washing and drying. These films were tested for their
   tensile properties, thermal stability, and morphology. The tensile
   modulus and strength of the composite films were lower than those of the
   matrix. The lowering of the tensile modulus and strength with increasing
   WLB loading was attributed to the random orientation of the leather
   fibers of WLB in the composites. However, the \% elongation at break of
   the composite films was found to be higher than that of the matrix and
   increased with increasing WLB content. The possible interaction between
   the matrix and WLB filler was probed using FT-IR analysis. The thermal
   stability of the composite films was higher than that of the matrix. The
   increase in thermal stability of the composite films was attributed to
   cross-linked collagen protein leather fibers in WLB. The fractographs of
   the composite films indicated good interfacial bonding between cellulose
   and leather fibers of WLB. These composite films may be considered for
   packaging and wrapping applications.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine-based
   therapy as first-line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Randomised
   controlled trials of capecitabine monotherapy or combined treatment were
   included in the meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library
   database and important meeting summaries were searched systematically.
   Outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
   overall response rate (ORR) and grades 3-4 drug-related adverse events.
   Nine trials with 1798 patients were included. The results indicated a
   significant improvement with capecitabine-based chemotherapy compared
   with capecitabine-free chemotherapy in ORR (relative risk {[}RR] 1.14,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.03 to 1.26, P = 0.013) and PFS (hazard
   ratio {[}HR] 0.77, 95\% CI 0.69 to 0.87, P < 0.0001). Overall survival
   favoured capecitabine-based chemotherapy, but this was not significant.
   There were more incidences of neutropenia and neutropenic fever in the
   capecitabine-free chemotherapy group and more vomiting, diarrhoea and
   hand-foot syndrome in the capecitabine-based chemotherapy group. There
   were no significant differences in nausea, fatigue, cardiotoxicity or
   mucositis/stomatitis between the two treatment regimens.
   Capecitabine-based chemotherapy significantly improves ORR and PFS in
   patients with advanced breast cancer, but has no demonstrable impact on
   OS. Capecitabine-based regimens are suitable as first-line treatment for
   patients with advanced breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on dietary changes and their associated factors are limited,
   particularly with respect to younger cardiovascular patients. Our
   objective was to evaluate the factors associated with fruit and
   vegetable intake among adults with premature acute coronary syndrome
   (ACS) 1 year after the event. We used data from GENESIS-PRAXY, a
   multicentre prospective study of adults aged 18-55 years, hospitalised
   for ACS. Participants were 704 adults from 24 centres in Canada, 1 in
   USA and 1 in Switzerland. Data were collected through questionnaires and
   chart reviews at baseline and 1 year post-ACS. Fruit and vegetable
   intake was low among adults with premature ACS, and remained suboptimal
   at 1 year post-ACS, with only 21\% meeting the minimum recommendations
   of at least 5 daily servings. The findings suggest that patient
   lifestyle characteristics, such as the number of hours spent at work and
   baseline intake are factors that may be associated with the intake of
   fruits and vegetables. More research is needed to assess effective
   strategies to increase fruit and vegetable intake among patients with
   premature ACS so that they meet dietary recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Swimming crab reovirus (SCRV) is the causative agent of a serious
   disease with high mortality in cultured Portunus trituberculatus. A
   rapid immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed in a competitive
   assay format and optimized for the detection of SCRV. The gold
   probe-based ICA test comprised SCRV antigen and goat anti-chicken egg
   yolk antibody (IgY) sprayed onto a nitrocellulose membrane as the test
   line and control line, respectively. IgY-gold complexes were deposited
   onto the conjugate pad as detector reagents. The method showed high
   specificity with no cross-reactivity with other related aquatic
   pathogens. The detection limit of the ICA strip was 50 mu g ml(-1). To
   evaluate the performance of the ICA test, the strip and an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to the same samples (n = 90
   crabs). The strip successfully detected SCRV in all of the artificially
   infected samples. Furthermore, the ICA strip and ELISA tests had high
   consistency (98.28\%). The strip assay requires no instruments and has a
   detection time of less than 10 min. It is portable and easy to perform
   in the field. These results indicated that the developed strip could be
   a promising on-site tool for screening pooled crabs to confirm SCRV
   infection or disease outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{The triazine-based trisphosphine,
   2,4,6-tris-(diphenylphosphino)-1,3,5-triazine (1) was prepared in
   improved yield by reacting cyanuric chloride with 3 equiv of
   trimethylsilyldiphenylphosphine. The solid-state structure of 1 showed
   short intermolecular P...P contacts of 3.362 angstrom, which is
   significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of
   phosphorus atoms (3.6 angstrom). The reaction of
   2,4,6-tris(diphenylphosphino)-1,3,5-triazine (1) with copper(I) salts in
   a 2:3 molar ratio yielded various cydophane-type complexes in
   quantitative yield. The solid-state structures of these clusters have
   been found to depend on the size of the halide ions, the solvent
   employed, and the reaction conditions. Copper(I) chloride formed a
   monomeric metallocydophane, whereas copper(I) bromide and copper(I)
   iodide derivatives preferred dimeric and 1D-polymeric structures,
   respectively. The tricationic complexes derived from Cu-I ion and
   2,4,6-tris(diphenylphosphino)-1,3,5-triazine also adopted monomeric
   metallocydophane structures. These complexes have been employed in the
   A(3) coupling reaction under microwave irradiation. The copper(I) iodide
   derivative showed excellent catalytic efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed a geomorphic analysis of the Sierra Nevada, the
   highest range of the Betic Cordillera (SE Spain), with the aim to
   elucidate its late Miocene to present-day exhumation history. The
   qualitative and quantitative analysis is based on filtered topography,
   local relief, swath-profile analysis, anomalies on stream orientation,
   bulk erosion volume, hypsometry, and steepness index (k(sn)). All these
   parameters are intimately linked to river incision and development of
   drainage pattern, having been calculated to assess the role of folding
   and faulting on the evolution of the Sierra Nevada. Moreover, uplift
   rates in the core of the Sierra Nevada have been deduced from an
   extrapolation of the position of Late Tortonian to Pliocene coastline
   deposits. These data have been compared to apatite (U-Th)/He,
   fission-track and Be-10 cosmogenic data from SE Spain in order to
   evaluate the consistency among uplift, thermal histories and denudation
   rates. Our preferred tectonic scenario is one that favors fast
   exhumation of the western Sierra Nevada in a NW SE overall compressive
   setting produced by the convergence between the Nubia and Africa plates.
   Sub-perpendicular to this compression, a westward 4 mm/year extensional
   hanging-wall displacement promotes uplift and unroofing of the western
   part of Sierra Nevada. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study compares one-and two-tiered forecasting systems as represented
   by the South African Weather Service Coupled Model and its
   atmosphere-only version. In this comparative framework, the main
   difference between these global climate models (GCMs) resides in the
   manner in which the sea surface temperature (SST) is represented. The
   models are effectively kept similar in all other aspects. This strategy
   may allow the role of coupling on the predictive skill differences to be
   better distinguished. The result reveals that the GCMs differ widely in
   their performances and the issue of superiority of one model over the
   other is mostly dependent on the ability to a priori determine an
   optimal global SST field for forcing the atmospheric general circulation
   model (AGCM). Notwithstanding, the AGCM's fidelity is reasonably reduced
   when the AGCM is constrained with persisting SST anomalies to the extent
   to which the coupled general circulation model's superiority becomes
   noticeable. The result suggests that the boundary forcing coming from
   the optimal SST field plays a significant role in leveraging a
   reasonable equivalency in the predictive skill of the two GCM
   configurations.}},

Title = {{Knowledge challenges for responsible supply chain management of

Abstract = {{A great number of chemicals many of which are hazardous to human health
   and the environment are used along the complex supply chains of
   textiles. These complexities and hazards make knowledge for
   understanding chemical properties and management practices at multiple
   nodes central to the responsible management of textile supply chains.
   This study investigates the knowledge requirements of, and the knowledge
   strategies used by, textile procuring organisations in response to both
   external stakeholders and internal pressure. Based on a qualitative
   study of small and medium-sized Swedish textile procuring organisations,
   the paper describes these knowledge challenges and analyses how efforts
   to meet them relate to expressed commitments and capabilities for
   responsible supply chain management (RSCM), as well as to organisational
   characteristics (i.e. whether the organisation is private or public,
   small or large, and whether textiles is a core or peripheral activity).
   It was found that several textile procuring organisations expressed
   commitment towards achieving RSCM. However, most organisations felt that
   they lacked capacity to rise to the challenge. There was a poor state of
   knowledge regarding many chemical substances and inherent difficulties
   in gaining knowledge of chemical risks and how to manage these.
   Moreover, the input of knowledge was limited and based on only a few key
   sources. Such factors proved to be obstacles for procuring organisations
   when attempting to facilitate responsible management upstream in complex
   supply chains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We determine the angle and polarization dependent emission from 1.75 mu
   m and 2.50 mu m long InP nanowires by using cathodoluminescence
   polarimetry. We excite the vertical wires using a 5 keV electron beam,
   and find that the 880 nm bandgap emission shows azimuthally polarized
   rings, with the number of rings depending on the wire height. The data
   agree well with a model in which spontaneous emission from the wire
   emitted into the far field interferes with emission reflected off the
   substrate. From the model, the depth range from which the emission is
   generated is found to be up to 400 nm below the top surface of the
   wires, well beyond the extent of the primary electron cloud. This
   enables a probe of the carrier diffusion length in the InP nanowires.

Abstract = {{We show how weak nonlinearities can be used in a device-independent
   quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using generalized two-mode
   Schrodinger cat states. The QKD protocol is therefore shown to be secure
   against collective attacks and for some coherent attacks. We derive
   analytical formulas for the optimal values of the Bell parameter, the
   quantum bit error rate, and the device-independent secret key rate in
   the noiseless lossy bosonic channel. Additionally, we give the filters
   and measurements which achieve these optimal values. We find that, over
   any distance in this channel, the quantum bit error rate is identically
   zero, in principle, and the states in the protocol are always able to
   violate a Bell inequality. The protocol is found to be superior in some
   regimes to a device-independent QKD protocol based on polarization
   entangled states in a depolarizing channel. Finally, we propose an
   implementation for the optimal filters and measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic transmission lines have great potential to serve as direct
   interconnects between nanoscale light spots. The guiding of gap plasmons
   in the slot between adjacent nanowire pairs provides improved
   propagation of surface plasmon polaritons while keeping strong light
   confinement. Yet propagation is fundamentally limited by losses in the
   metal. Here we show a workaround operation of the gap-plasmon
   transmission line, exploiting both gap and external modes present in the
   structure. Interference between these modes allows us to take advantage
   of the larger propagation distance of the external mode while preserving
   the high confinement of the gap mode, resulting in nanoscale confinement
   of the optical field over a longer distance. The performance of the
   gap-plasmon transmission line is probed experimentally by recording the
   propagation of quantum dots luminescence over distances of more than 4
   mu m. We observe a 35\% increase in the effective propagation length of
   this multimode system compared to the theoretical limit for a pure gap
   mode. The applicability of this simple method to nanofabricated
   structures is theoretically confirmed and offers a realistic way to
   combine longer propagation distances with lateral plasmon confinement
   for far field nanoscale interconnects. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Producing hydrogen through aqueous phase reforming (APR) of low-boiling
   fraction (LBF) which is obtained by distilling the crude bio-oil at
   reduced pressure is a promising way to categorize it as resource rather
   than waste. The catalytic conversion of renewable sources using catalyst
   with the best reactivity is essential to make the most of energy. The
   size effect of catalyst on APR of LBF has been studied. A series of
   gamma-Al2O3 supported Pt nano-particles catalysts with average sizes
   ranging from 1.6 nm to 5.7 nm were synthesized. The activity of this
   reaction and selectivity to hydrogen increased as the Pt particle size
   decreased. The full-shell cuboctahedron model was used to explain the
   phenomenon. It was proposed that the reaction activity and selectivity
   were size sensitive. Because particles with different size had different
   constitution of atoms and atoms at edges were the active sites for APR
   of LBF. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Abstract = {{We study the plasmonic resonances of double nanoholes (DNHs) in metal
   films. These apertures exhibit the usual gap-mode Fabry-Perot
   resonances, where the zeroth order resonance is determined by the
   waveguide cut-off and the first order resonance shows sensitivity to the
   film thickness. An additional wedge resonance is observed, which is
   sensitive to the curvature of the cusps in the DNHs, analogous to the
   wedge modes of single wedges. While the gap mode intensity increases
   dramatically with decreasing gap-width, the wedge mode intensity
   saturates since its field enhancement arises from the curvature of the
   metal film, like cylindrical Sommerfeld waves. Experimental transmission
   spectra agree well with finite-difference time-domain simulations
   showing these separate resonances. The controlled design of these
   resonances is critical for applications including optical tweezers,
   nonlinear conversion, sensing and spectroscopy. (C) 2015 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) of Xanthomonas bacteria
   are programmable DNA binding proteins with unprecedented target
   specificity. Comparative studies into TALE repeat structure and function
   are hindered by the limited sequence variation among TALE repeats. More
   sequence-diverse TALE-like proteins are known from Ralstonia
   solanacearum (RipTALs) and Burkholderia rhizoxinica (Bats), but RipTAL
   and Bat repeats are conserved with those of TALEs around the DNA-binding
   residue. We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1
   and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have
   assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We
   found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA
   binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to
   TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1
   repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats.
   Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved
   between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new
   additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for
   future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of
   other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs,
   RipTALs and Bats.}},

Abstract = {{Crustal thickness maps at regional scales are typically compiled using
   estimations inferred from different geophysical datasets providing a
   variable coverage of the investigated area. Consequently, spurious
   effects related to changes in data resolution or artifacts in grid
   interpolation may affect significant zones of those maps. The
   TopoIberia-IberArray broad-band seismic network, covering the Iberian
   Peninsula and Northern Morocco with stations distributed on a regular 60
   x 60 km grid provides a unique opportunity to avoid such technical
   problems and to obtain a crustal thickness map derived from a same
   method sampling evenly all the region. Data from more than 340 stations
   has been gathered and analyzed using the P-to-S conversion phases at the
   Moho discontinuity (receiver functions). The crustal thickness has been
   inferred applying the classical H is stacking technique, though in
   regions of complex crustal structure, we have preferred to estimate the
   thickness directly from the arrival time of the converted phase at some
   sites.
   The topography of the Moho discontinuity is strongly correlated with
   tectonic processes. The investigated area, extending from the Sahara
   platform to the Bay of Biscay, has a great geodynamic diversity,
   including, North to South, crustal imbrication in the Pyrenean and
   Cantabrian range, a large and relatively undisturbed Variscan Massif in
   the center of Iberia and areas of complex and still not completely
   understood geodynamics in the Alboran crust domain and the Atlas range.
   The crustal thickness map reflects this diversity, showing variations
   reaching 30 km between the thickest and thinnest zones of continental
   crust. The final map has an overall similarity with previous estimations
   of the crustal thickness using independent data, as those coming from
   more sparse deep seismic sounding profiles, but provides further
   constraints at regional scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Short sleep duration and circadian misalignment are hypothesized to
   causally contribute to health problems including obesity, diabetes,
   metabolic syndrome, heart disease, mood disorders, cognitive impairment,
   and accidents {[}1-7]. Here, we investigated the influence of morning
   circadian misalignment induced by an imposed short night-time sleep
   schedule on impaired insulin sensitivity, a precursor to diabetes.
   Imposed short sleep duration resulted in morning wakefulness occurring
   during the biological night (i.e., circadian misalignment) a time when
   endogenous melatonin levels were still high indicating the internal
   circadian clock was still promoting sleep and related functions. We show
   the longer melatonin levels remained high after wake time, insulin
   sensitivity worsened. Overall, we find a simulated 5-day work week of
   5-hr-per-night sleep opportunities and ad libitum food intake resulted
   in similar to 20\% reduced oral and intravenous insulin sensitivity in
   otherwise healthy men and women. Reduced insulin sensitivity was
   compensated by an increased insulin response to glucose, which may
   reflect an initial physiological adaptation to maintain normal blood
   sugar {[}8] levels during sleep loss. Furthermore, we find that
   transitioning from the imposed short sleep schedule to 9-hr sleep
   opportunities for 3 days restored oral insulin sensitivity to baseline,
   but 5 days with 9-hr sleep opportunities was insufficient to restore
   intravenous insulin sensitivity to baseline. These findings indicate
   morning wakefulness and eating during the biological night is a novel
   mechanism by which short sleep duration contributes to metabolic
   dysregulation and suggests food intake during the biological night may
   contribute to other health problems associated with short sleep
   duration.}},

Title = {{Trauma team activation varies across Dutch emergency departments: a
   national survey}},
Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION \& EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tiered trauma team response may contribute to efficient
   in-hospital trauma triage by reducing the amount of resources required
   and by improving health outcomes. This study evaluates current practice
   of trauma team activation (TTA) in Dutch emergency departments (EDs).
   Methods: A survey was conducted among managers of all 102 EDs in the
   Netherlands, using a semi-structured online questionnaire.
   Results: Seventy-two questionnaires were analysed. Most EDs use a
   one-team system (68 \%). EDs with a tieredresponse receive more multi
   trauma patients (p < 0.01) and have more trauma team alerts per year (p
   < 0.05) than one-team EDs. The number of trauma team members varies from
   three to 16 professionals. The ED nurse usually receives the
   pre-notification (97 \%), whereas the decision to activate a team is
   made by an ED nurse (46 \%), ED physician (30 \%), by multiple
   professionals (20 \%) or other (4 \%). Information in the
   pre-notification mostly used for trauma team activation are
   Airway-Breathing-Circulation (87 \%), Glasgow Coma Score (90 \%), and
   Revised Trauma Score (85 \%) or Paediatric Trauma Score (86 \%).
   However, this information is only available for 75 \% of the patients or
   less. Only 56 \% of the respondents were satisfied with their current
   in-hospital trauma triage system.
   Conclusions: Trauma team activation varies across Dutch EDs and there is
   room for improvement in the trauma triage system used, size of the teams
   and the professionals involved. More direct communication and more
   uniform criteria could be used to efficiently and safely activate a
   specific trauma team. Therefore, the implementation of a revised
   national consensus guideline is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The complete volume of the protein conformation space is, by many orders
   of magnitude, smaller at the level of secondary structure elements than
   that at the level of amino acid residues; the latter, according to
   Levinthal's estimate, scales approximately as 10(2) (L), with L being
   the number of residues in the chain, whereas the former, as demonstrated
   in this paper, scales no faster than similar to L-N, with N being the
   number of the secondary structure elements, which is approximately equal
   to L/15. This drastic decrease in the exponent (L/15 instead of 2 L)
   explains why sampling of the conformation space does not contradict the
   ability of the protein chain to find its most stable fold.}},

Abstract = {{Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are periodic two-or three-dimensional
   polymeric networks with high surface areas, low density, and designed
   structures. Because COFs are normally prepared based on reversible
   formation of covalent bonds with relatively weak stability, their
   structures can be easily broken or damaged due to changes in the
   surrounding environment. Thus, developing strategies to realize the
   reconstruction of COFs in order to extend their usage lifetime is
   crucial for practical applications. In addition, exploring the kinetics
   of COF growth under varied reaction conditions is important for better
   understanding the nucleation and growth processes of COFs. In this work,
   the reformation mechanism of an imine-based COF using an ex situ
   characterization method was investigated, disclosing an interesting COF
   reconstruction progress from disorder to order. The present study shows
   the regeneration ability of COFs, and the developed method could be
   generalized for broader use in the field.}},

Abstract = {{A combined theoretical and experimental study is performed in order to
   elucidate the effects of linker functional groups on the photoabsorption
   properties of UiO-66-X materials. This study, in which both mono- and
   difunctionalized linkers (with X = OH, NH2, or SH) are investigated,
   aims to obtain a more complete picture of the choice of
   functionalization. Static time-dependent density functional theory
   calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations are performed
   on the linkers, and the results are compared to experimental UV/vis
   spectra in order to understand the electronic effects governing the
   absorption spectra. The disubstituted linkers show larger shifts than
   the monosubstituted variants, making them promising candidates for
   further study as photocatalysts. Next, the interaction between the
   linker and the inorganic part of the framework is theoretically
   investigated using a cluster model. The proposed ligand-to-metal-charge
   transfer is theoretically observed and is influenced by the differences
   in fundtionalization. Finally, the computed electronic properties of the
   periodic UiO-66 materials reveal that the band gap can be altered by
   linker functionalization and ranges from 4.0 down to 2.2 eV. Study of
   the periodic density of states allows the band gap modulations of the
   framework to be explained in terms of a functionalization-induced band
   in the band gap of the original UiO-66 host.}},

Abstract = {{Development of reliable source emission inventories is particularly
   needed to advance the understanding of the origin of Arctic haze using
   chemical transport modeling. This study develops a regional
   anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission inventory for the Russian
   Federation, the largest country by land area in the Arctic Council.
   Activity data from combination of local Russia information and
   international resources, emission factors based on either Russian
   documents or adjusted values for local conditions, and other emission
   source data are used to approximate the BC emissions. Emissions are
   gridded at a resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees and developed into
   a monthly temporal profile. Total anthropogenic BC emission of Russia in
   2010 is estimated to be around 224 Gg. Gas flaring, a commonly ignored
   black carbon source, contributes a significant fraction of 36.2\% to
   Russia's total anthropogenic BC emissions. Other sectors, i.e.,
   residential, transportation, industry, and power plants, contribute
   25.0\%, 20.3\%, 13.1\%, and 5.4\%, respectively. Three major BC hot spot
   regions are identified: the European part of Russia, the southern
   central part of Russia where human population densities are relatively
   high, and the Urals Federal District where Russia's major oil and gas
   fields are located but with sparse human population. BC simulations are
   conducted using the hemispheric version of Community Multi-scale Air
   Quality Model with emission inputs from a global emission database EDGAR
   (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)-HTAPv2 (Hemispheric
   Transport of Air Pollution) and EDGAR-HTAPv2 with its Russian part
   replaced by the newly developed Russian BC emissions, respectively. The
   simulation using the new Russian BC emission inventory could improve
   30-65\% of absorption aerosol optical depth measured at the AERONET
   sites in Russia throughout the whole year as compared to that using the
   default HTAPv2 emissions. At the four ground monitoring sites (Zeppelin,
   Barrow, Alert, and Tiksi) in the Arctic Circle, surface BC simulations
   are improved the most during the Arctic haze periods (October-March).
   The poor performance of Arctic BC simulations in previous studies may be
   partly ascribed to the Russian BC emissions built on out-of-date and/or
   missing information, which could result in biases to both emission rates
   and the spatial distribution of emissions. This study highlights that
   the impact of Russian emissions on the Arctic haze has likely been
   underestimated, and its role in the Arctic climate system needs to be
   reassessed. The Russian black carbon emission source data generated in
   this study can be obtained via http://abci.ornl.gov/download.shtml or

Abstract = {{In addition to the velocity dependence of friction, slip dependence may
   play a major role before and during earthquake slip in fault zones. We
   performed laboratory friction experiments on simulated fault gouges,
   measuring both the velocity and slip dependence of friction in velocity
   step tests. The pure velocity-dependent component of friction measured
   over short displacements shows both velocity strengthening and velocity
   weakening friction, depending on the amount of slip considered. However,
   we observe that increases in sliding velocity can induce slip weakening
   behavior which overwhelms the velocity dependence resulting in large
   overall weakening, especially at rates > 1 mu m/s. On natural tectonic
   faults, this suggests that a velocity perturbation, such as coseismic
   rupture propagating onto a fault patch, could induce instability via
   large slip weakening. Therefore, a fault which is experiencing a
   transient slip or slow earthquakes may be more easily induced to slip
   coseismically if a dynamic rupture from large earthquake propagates onto
   the fault.}},

Abstract = {{We report the nonlinear focusing of ultrasonic waves by an axisymmetric
   diffraction grating immersed in water. In the linear regime, the system
   presents high focal gain (32 dB), with a narrow beam-width and intense
   side lobes as it is common in focusing by Fresnel-like lenses.
   Activating the nonlinearity of the host medium by using high amplitude
   incident waves, the focusing properties of the lens dramatically change.
   Theoretical predictions show that the focal gain of the system
   extraordinary increases in the strongly nonlinear regime (Mach number of
   6.1 x 10(-4)). Particularly, the harmonic generation is locally
   activated at the focal spot, and the second harmonic beam is
   characterized by strongly reduced side-lobes and an excellent beam
   profile as experiments show in agreement with theory. The results can
   motivate applications in medical therapy or second harmonic imaging. (c)

Abstract = {{Ingenol derivatives with varying degrees of oxidation were prepared by

   Complex ingenanes resulting from divergent C-H oxidation of a common
   intermediate were found to interact with protein kinase C in a manner
   that correlates well with the oxidation state of the ingenane core. Even
   though previous work on ingenanes has suggested a strong correlation
   between potential to activate PKC delta and induction of neutrophil
   oxidative burst, the current study shows that the potential to activate
   PKC beta II is of key importance while interaction with PKCd is
   dispensable. Thus, key modifications of the ingenane core allowed PKC
   isoform selectivity wherein PKCd-driven activation of keratinocytes is
   strongly reduced or even absent while PKC beta II-driven activation of

Abstract = {{We demonstrate negative refraction at telecommunication wavelengths
   through plasmon-photon hybridization on a simple microcavity with
   metallic mirrors. Instead of using conventional metals, the plasmonic
   excitations are provided by a heavily doped semiconductor which enables
   us to tune them into resonance with the infrared photon modes of the
   cavity. In this way, the dispersion of the resultant hybrid cavity modes
   can be widely adjusted. In particular, negative dispersion and negative
   refraction at telecommunication wavelengths on an all-ZnO monolithical
   cavity are demonstrated. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of the microvasculature has previously been limited by the
   lack of methods capable of capturing and modelling complete vascular
   networks. We used novel imaging and computational techniques to
   establish the topology of the entire blood vessel network of a murine
   lymph node, combining 63706 confocal images at 2 mu m pixel resolution
   to cover a volume of 3.88 mm(3). Detailed measurements including the
   distribution of vessel diameters, branch counts, and identification of
   voids were subsequently re-visualised in 3D revealing regional
   specialisation within the network. By focussing on critical immune
   microenvironments we quantified differences in their vascular topology.
   We further developed a morphology-based approach to identify High
   Endothelial Venules, key sites for lymphocyte extravasation. These data
   represent a comprehensive and continuous blood vessel network of an
   entire organ and provide benchmark measurements that will inform
   modelling of blood vessel networks as well as enable comparison of
   vascular topology in different organs.}},

Abstract = {{Licorice is an important traditional Chinese medicine with clinical and
   industrial applications. Genetic resources of licorice are insufficient
   for analysis of molecular biology and genetic functions; as such,
   transcriptome sequencing must be conducted for functional
   characterization and development of molecular markers. In this study,
   transcriptome sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform
   generated a total of 5.41 Gb clean data. De novo assembly yielded a
   total of 46,641 unigenes. Comparison analysis using BLAST showed that
   the annotations of 29,614 unigenes were conserved. Further study
   revealed 773 genes related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of
   licorice, 40 genes involved in biosynthesis of the terpenoid backbone,
   and 16 genes associated with biosynthesis of glycyrrhizic acid. Analysis
   of unigenes larger than 1 Kb with a length of 11,702 nt presented 7,032
   simple sequence repeats (SSR). Sixty-four of 69 randomly designed and
   synthesized SSR pairs were successfully amplified, 33 pairs of primers
   were polymorphism in in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Glycyrrhiza
   inflata Bat., Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Glycyrrhiza pallidiflora Maxim.
   This study not only presents the molecular biology data of licorice but
   also provides a basis for genetic diversity research and molecular
   marker-assisted breeding of licorice.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a Cognitive Rehabilitation Protocol in HIV Patients with

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and
   stability over time of a cognitive rehabilitation protocol (restorative
   and compensatory approach) in HIV/AIDS patients with HIV-associated
   Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). At baseline, 32 HIV/AIDS patients (16
   with and 16 without HAND) were assessed with a neuropsychological
   battery (i.e., pre-assessment) consisting of 22 tests covering eight
   cognitive domains. Then, the experimental group was administered over 4
   months a cognitive rehabilitation protocol aimed at improving four
   cognitive domains by means of eight paper and pencil/computer-based
   exercises. The control group received guideline-adherent clinical care
   (i.e., standard of care). At the end of the cognitive treatment, both
   groups were re administered the neuropsychological battery (i.e., post
   assessment) Additionally, 6 months after post-assessment, the
   experimental group was given the same neuropsychological battery (i.e.,
   follow up-assessment). In order to test the efficacy of the cognitive
   rehabilitation protocol, we compared between groups the results of the
   neuropsychological battery at the pre- and post-assessments. In order to
   evaluate the stability over time, the effects of the cognitive
   rehabilitation protocol was examined comparing within the experimental
   group the results of the neuropsychological battery at post- and follow
   up assessments. Our results show that the two groups did not differ at
   the pre-assessment, but differed at post-assessment. Specifically, the
   experimental group showed a significant improvement in five domains
   (Learning and memory, Abstraction/executive functioning, Verbal fluency,
   Attention/working memory, and Functional), whereas the control group
   significantly worsened in the same domains. The improvement of the
   experimental group did not change in the follow up-assessment in two
   domains (Abstraction/executive functioning, Attention/working memory,
   and Functional). Overall, these findings support the efficacy and, to
   some extent, the stability over time of our cognitive rehabilitation
   protocol.}},

Abstract = {{A series of Ni-imidazolate cubic cages, one-dimensional and
   two-dimensional coordination polymers based on the cubic cages, have
   been prepared by solvothermal subcomponent self-assembly of
   5-methyl-4-formylimidazole, m-xylylenediamine, and Ni-II salts with
   varied anions. These compounds have been characterized by single-crystal
   X-ray diffractions, elemental analysis, IR spectra, and powder X-ray
   diffractions. The formation of an oligomerized coordination cage or an
   infinite coordination polymer depends on the anions chosen. An
   oligomerized 8-nuclear Ni-imidazolate cubic cage is formed when the
   anion Cl-, Br-, I-, SCN-, NO2-, or NO3- is utilized in the reactions,
   and a two-dimensional coordination polymer based on the Ni-inlidazolate
   cubic cage will be obtained when N-3(-), (CN)(2)N-, or (CN)(3)C- act as
   the anions. When only ClO4- or both ClO4- and {[}Ni(C4N2S2)(2)](2-)
   (C4N2S2 = dimercaptomaleonitrile) as anions exist in the reaction
   mixture, a ladder-like one-dimensional coordination polymer based on the

Abstract = {{STUDY OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study propofol with sevoflurane and
   propofol alone in evaluating intubating conditions, hemodynamic response
   during induction and intubation and induction side effects in adult
   patients undergoing various elective surgical procedures without muscle
   relaxants.
   DESIGN: Prospective randomized study.
   SETTING: Operation theatre of a teaching institute.
   PATIENTS: The study population consists of 60 ASA I \& II, non-obese,
   adult patients aged between 20-40yrs coming for elective surgical
   procedures under General Anaesthesia and had Mallampatti class I airway
   anatomy, 30 of these patients receive propofol alone-{''}GROUP A{''} and
   30 of who receive propofol with sevoflurane-{''}GROUP B{''}.
   MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
   diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure before and after
   induction and post-intubation at 1, 3 and 5 minutes were recorded. Time
   to induction in seconds (Start of anaesthetic until loss of eye lash
   reflex), induction side effects like breath holding, cough, excitatory
   movements, laryngospasm and others (Bradycardia, hypoxia, hyperthermia,
   hypothermia and injection site pain) were noted. Intubating conditions
   were better in Group-B than in Group-A, Group-B patients had
   significantly had more clinically acceptable intubating conditions than
   Group-A. There was no significant difference in heart rate after
   induction and intubation between the two groups, except 3min after
   intubation in Group-A there is significantly low heart rate. There was
   significant in reduction in systolic blood pressure after induction and
   intubation in Group-A, however there was no significant difference in
   diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure between two groups.
   Induction time is significantly less in Group-A patients when compared
   to Group-B patients and there was no significant difference in induction
   side effects between two groups.
   CONCLUSION: Combination of inhalational 4\% sevoflurane with IV propofol
   1.5mg/kg is superior to IV propofol 3mg/kg with respect to quality of
   intubation and less significance with respect to hemodynamic response
   during induction and intubation in adult patients undergoing various
   elective surgical procedures without muscle relaxants.}},

Abstract = {{The Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on the Mars Atmosphere
   and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) satellite measured the distribution of
   thermal ions (2-150 amu) at ionospheric heights (similar to 130-400 km)
   under midday conditions during the ``Deep-Dip{''} orbit campaign from 17
   to 22 April 2015. Assuming charge neutrality, we use the sum of NGIMS
   ions as a proxy for electron density (N-e) and compare results with a
   new version of the Mars Initial Reference Ionosphere (MIRI) developed
   for this study. At altitudes where the transition between photochemical
   and dynamical processes occurs (130-200 km), the NGIMS results agree
   with the shape of the MIRI-predicted N-e(h) profiles, but the model
   predictions are a factor of 2 higher. Above 200 km, the NGIMS gradients
   of total ions versus height diverge even more from MIRI's N-e(h)
   predictions for reasons that may involve crustal-B field effects,
   ionopause-like boundaries, and horizontal plasma transport away from the
   noon sector-factors not yet included in MIRI.}},

Abstract = {{A new model for numerical analysis of partially coherent x-ray at
   synchrotron beamlines is presented. The model is based on statistical
   optics. Four-dimensional coherence function, Mutual Optical Intensity
   (MOI), is applied to describe the wavefront of the partially coherent
   light. The propagation of MOI through optical elements in the beamline
   is deduced with numerical calculation. The coherence of x-ray through
   beamlines can be acquired. We applied the model to analyze the coherence
   in the STXM beamline at SSRF, and got the coherence length of the beam
   at the endstation. To verify the theoretical results, the diffraction
   experiment of a single slit was performed and the diffraction pattern
   was simulated to get the coherence length, (31 +/- 3.0) mu m x (25 +/-
   2.1) mu m (H x V), which had a good agreement with the theoretical
   results, (30.7 +/- 0.6) mu m x (31 +/- 5.3) mu m (H x V). The model is

Abstract = {{``Click{''} chemistry represents one of the most powerful approaches for
   linking molecules in chemistry and materials science. Triggering this
   reaction by mechanical force would enable site-and stress-specific
   ``click{''} reactions-a hitherto unreported observation. We introduce
   the design and realization of a homogeneous Cu catalyst able to activate
   through mechanical force when attached to suitable polymer chains,
   acting as a lever to transmit the force to the central catalytic system.
   Activation of the subsequent copper-catalyzed ``click{''} reaction
   (CuAAC) is achieved either by ultrasonication or mechanical pressing of
   a polymeric material, using a fluorogenic dye to detect the activation
   of the catalyst. Based on an N-heterocyclic copper(I) carbene with
   attached polymeric chains of different flexibility, the force is
   transmitted to the central catalyst, thereby activating a CuAAC in
   solution and in the solid state.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{The human reference assembly remains incomplete due to the
   underrepresentation of repeat-rich sequences that are found within
   centromeric regions and acrocentric short arms. Although these sequences
   are marginally represented in the assembly, they are often fully
   represented in whole-genome short-read datasets and contribute to
   inappropriate alignments and high read-depth signals that localize to a
   small number of assembled homologous regions. As a consequence, these
   regions often provide artifactual peak calls that confound hypothesis
   testing and large-scale genomic studies. To address this problem, we
   have constructed mapping targets that represent roughly 8\% of the human
   genome generally omitted from the human reference assembly. By
   integrating these data into standard mapping and peak-calling pipelines
   we demonstrate a 10-fold reduction in signals in regions common to the
   blacklisted region and identify a comprehensive set of regions that
   exhibit mapping sensitivity with the presence of the repeat-rich
   targets.}},

   Load Forecasting in VANETs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{In a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the periodic exchange of
   single-hop status information broadcasts (beacon frames) produces
   channel loading, which causes channel congestion and induces information
   conflict problems. To guarantee fairness in beacon transmissions from
   each node and maximum network connectivity, adjustment of the beacon
   transmission power is an effective method for reducing and preventing
   channel congestion. In this study, the primary factors that influence
   wireless channel loading are selected to construct the KF-BCLF, which is
   a channel load forecasting algorithm based on a recursive Kalman filter
   and employs multiple regression equation. By pre-adjusting the
   transmission power based on the forecasted channel load, the channel
   load was kept within a predefined range; therefore, channel congestion
   was prevented. Based on this method, the CLF-BTPC, which is a
   transmission power control algorithm, is proposed. To verify KF-BCLF
   algorithm, a traffic survey method that involved the collection of
   floating car data along a major traffic road in Changchun City is
   employed. By comparing this forecast with the measured channel loads,
   the proposed KF-BCLF algorithm was proven to be effective. In addition,
   the CLF-BTPC algorithm is verified by simulating a section of eight-lane
   highway and a signal-controlled urban intersection. The results of the
   two verification process indicate that this distributed CLF-BTPC
   algorithm can effectively control channel load, prevent channel
   congestion, and enhance the stability and robustness of wireless beacon
   transmission in a vehicular network.}},

Abstract = {{Maritime transport is not only one of the safest ways to move dangerous
   freight it is also one of the most profitable from the economic point of
   view. Despite this, accidents are inevitable and sometimes become in
   catastrophes. There are some geographical locations where these
   accidents or disasters are repeated frequently and then can be
   considered ``black spots{''}, this is the case in the northwest of
   Spain: Galicia, where maritime disasters are frequent. The last one,
   starring the Prestige has involved extensive damage from the
   environmental point of view and has endangered environment
   sustainability and even the population style of life. This study is
   evaluating the effects of disaster and the resilience of the environment
   and the population. The maritime disasters, repeated over time, attack
   the local way of life from the point of view of the economic and
   environmental aspects, and also generate feelings of helplessness and
   lack of confidence in the institutions responsible for general
   environmental safety and particularly for sea. The findings indicate
   that it is necessary to create institutional mechanisms preventive by
   means of clearly specified rules and controls, together with the
   identification of agencies responsible for development and execution of
   proposals, able to generate confidence in the local population and
   respond appropriately to prevent potential disasters. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   Saccades}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Creating datasets for Neuromorphic Vision is a challenging task. A lack
   of available recordings from Neuromorphic Vision sensors means that data
   must typically be recorded specifically for dataset creation rather than
   collecting and labeling existing data. The task is further complicated
   by a desire to simultaneously provide traditional frame-based recordings
   to allow for direct comparison with traditional Computer Vision
   algorithms. Here we propose a method for converting existing Computer
   Vision static image datasets into Neuromorphic Vision datasets using an
   actuated pan tilt camera platform. Moving the sensor rather than the
   scene or image is a more biologically realistic approach to sensing and
   eliminates timing artifacts introduced by monitor updates when
   simulating motion on a computer monitor. We present conversion of two
   popular image datasets (MNIST and Caltech101) which have played
   important roles in the development of Computer Vision, and we provide
   performance metrics on these datasets using spike-based recognition
   algorithms. This work contributes datasets for future use in the field,
   as well as results from spike based algorithms against which future
   works can compare. Furthermore, by converting datasets already popular
   in Computer Vision, we enable more direct comparison with frame-based
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline samples of Mn1-xCuxWO4 (x <= 0.5) have been prepared by
   a solid-state synthesis as well as from a citrate synthesis at moderate
   temperature (850 degrees C). The goal is to study changes in the
   structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of magnetoelectric
   type-II multiferroic MnWO4 caused by replacing Jahn Teller-inactive Mn2+
   (d(5), S = 5/2) ions with Jahn Teller-active Cu2+ (d(9), S = 1/2) ions.
   Combination of techniques including scanning electron microscopy, powder
   X-ray and neutron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that
   the polycrystalline samples with low copper content 0 <= x <= 0.25 are
   solid solution that forms in the monoclinic P2/c space group. Rietveld
   analyses indicate that Cu atoms substitutes for Mn atoms at the Mn
   crystallographic site of the MnWO4 structure and suggest random
   distributions of Jahn Teller-distorted CuO6 octahedra in the solid
   solution. Magnetic susceptibility reveals that only 5\% of Cu
   substitution suppresses the nonpolar collinear AF1 antiferromagnetic
   structure observed in pure MnWO4. Type-II multiferroicity survives a
   weak Cu substitution rate (x < 0.15). Multiferroic transition
   temperature and Neel temperature increase as the amount of Cu increases.
   New trends in some of the magnetic properties and in dielectric
   behaviors are observed for x = 0.20 and 0.25. Careful analysis of the
   magnetic susceptibility reveals that the incorporation of Cu into MnWO4
   strengthens the overall antiferromagnetic interaction and reduces the
   magnetic frustration.}},

Abstract = {{Boron has toxic effects on plant growth and thus its removal is
   necessary from desalinated saline water for irrigation application.
   Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) are a new approach for effective
   desalination but boron removal has not been addressed before. Herein,
   MDCs were studied for boron removal with aid of Donnan Dialysis (DD).
   The alkaline solution generated by the MDC cathode was used to ionize
   boric acid to facilitate boron removal. An MDC system with DD
   pretreatment removed 60 or 52\% of boron with the initial boron
   concentration of 5 or 20 mg L-1. In the absence of DD, direct cathodic
   alkalinization of boron in an MDC was not effective in terms of boron
   removal and had a serious issue of salt accumulation. The MDC with DD
   post-treatment could reduce the boron concentration below 2 mg L-1,
   although the high pH of its final effluent needs to be further
   addressed. Further investigation will consider an MDC system with both
   DD pre-treatment and post-treatment for improving boron removal. (C)

Title = {{Differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis of Penicilliosis
   among HIV-negative patients with or without underlying disease in
   Southern China: a retrospective study}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of Penicillium marneffei infection has
   recently increased. This fungus can cause fatal systemic mycosis in both
   immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients without HIV infection.
   Methods: We retrospectively analysed Penicilliosis patients between
   January 1, 2003 and August 1, 2014 at the First Affiliated Hospital of
   Guangxi Medical University. HIV-negative patients with Penicilliosis
   were divided into two groups: patients with underlying disease (Group D)
   and patients without underlying disease (Group ND). HIV-positive
   patients were excluded. The relationships between overall survival and
   the study variables were assessed using univariate and multivariate
   analyses.
   Results: During 11 years, Penicillium marneffei infection was diagnosed
   in 109 patients. Sixty-six (60.55 \%) patients were HIV-positive and
   excluded from these cases. Forty-three patients were HIV-negative were
   enrolled. Among these patients, 18 (41.86 \%) patients were in Group D,
   and 25 (58.14 \%) were in Group ND. The most common underlying disease
   was diabetes. There were no statistically significant differences
   between the two groups in clinical characteristics, except for immune
   state and prognosis. Group ND had higher lymphocyte cell counts, CD4
   cell counts, and CD4 T-cell percentages than Group D (P < 0.05).
   Patients in Group D had higher recurrence and mortality rates than Group
   ND (P < 0.05). In the univariate analysis, only underlying disease, CD4
   cell percentage, and T lymphocyte cell percentage were significantly
   associated with overall survival.
   Conclusions: Penicillium marneffei can infect HIV-negative patients and
   can cause fatal systemic mycosis. There were no clear differences in
   clinical manifestations among HIV-negative patients with and without
   underlying disease. However, Penicillium marneffei in HIV-negative
   patients in with underlying diseases may cause immune function decline
   and a deficiency in T-cell-mediated immunity. Underlying disease, CD4
   cell percentage, and T lymphocyte cell percentage may be potential risk
   factors affecting prognosis. Timely, effective, and longer courses of
   antifungal treatments are important in improving prognoses.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol was investigated over a series of Ni
   and Cu-Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWNT). The reaction was carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed
   reactor (240 degrees C, 40 atm) with a solution of 1 wt\% glycerol in DI
   water at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. Amongst the catalysts tested,
   bimetallic 1Cu-12Ni/MWNT catalyst gave the higher H-2 selectivity (86\%)
   and glycerol conversion (84\%) than the benchmark 12Ni/MWNT catalyst.
   Irrespective of Cu and Ni ratio, bimetallic Cu-Ni catalysts showed
   higher selectivity and glycerol conversion towards H-2 production than
   the Ni catalyst. The presence of Cu in bimetallic catalysts resulted in
   suppression of undesirable methanation reaction. Catalysts characterized
   by XRD and XPS showed a significant peak shift of Ni in bimetallic Cu-Ni
   catalysts than the Ni catalyst, suggesting a strong interaction between
   Cu and Ni. Also H-2-TPR analysis showed that introducing Cu increased Ni
   reducibility. The bimetallic interaction is thought to be responsible
   for the lowered methane yield and ultimately, higher hydrogen yield
   observed. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Since Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)'s arrival at Mars
   on 21 September 2014, the SEP (Solar Energetic Particle) instrument on

   energies of a few tens of keV up to similar to 200 keV. These ions are
   created in the distant upstream part of the hot atomic oxygen exosphere
   of Mars, via photoionization, charge exchange with solar wind protons,
   and electron impact. Once ionized, atomic oxygen ions are picked up by
   the solar wind and accelerated downstream, reaching energies high enough
   for SEP to detect them. We model the flux of oxygen pickup ions observed
   by MAVEN SEP in the undisturbed upstream solar wind and compare our
   results with SEP's measurements. Model-data comparisons of SEP fluxes
   confirm that pickup oxygen associated with the Martian exospheric hot
   oxygen is indeed responsible for the MAVEN SEP observations.}},

Abstract = {{We study the lifetime of two common fluorescent dye molecules from the
   Alexa Fluor NHS Ester family dissolved in water in an opaque aqueous
   dispersion of dielectric polystyrene nanoparticles. We investigate the
   role of the dispersion composition by varying the particle concentration
   and adding SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) surfactant molecules. The
   observed strong changes in lifetime of Alexa 430 can be attributed to
   the relative contribution of radiative and non-radiative decay channels
   while the lifetime of the Alexa 488 dye depends only weakly on the
   sample composition. For Alexa 430, a dye with a rather low quantum yield
   in aqueous solution, the addition of polystyrene nanoparticles leads to
   a significant enhancement in quantum yield and an associated increase of
   the fluorescent lifetime by up to 55 \%. We speculate that the increased
   quantum yield can be attributed to the hydrophobic effect on the
   structure of water in the boundary layer around the polystyrene
   particles in suspension. Adding SDS acts as a quencher. Over a range of
   particle concentrations the particle induced increase of the lifetime
   can be completely compensated by adding SDS. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Title = {{How should health service organizations respond to diversity? A content
   analysis of six approaches}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Health care organizations need to be responsive to the needs
   of increasingly diverse patient populations. We compared the contents of
   six publicly available approaches to organizational responsiveness to
   diversity. The central questions addressed in this paper are: what are
   the most consistently recommended issues for health care organizations
   to address in order to be responsive to the needs of diverse groups that
   differ from the majority population? How much consensus is there between
   various approaches?
   Methods: We purposively sampled six approaches from the US, Australia
   and Europe and used qualitative textual analysis to categorize the
   content of each approach into domains (conceptually distinct topic
   areas) and, within each domain, into dimensions (operationalizations).
   The resulting classification framework was used for comparative analysis
   of the content of the six approaches.
   Results: We identified seven domains that were represented in most or
   all approaches: organizational commitment, empirical evidence on
   inequalities and needs, a competent and diverse workforce, ensuring
   access for all users, ensuring responsiveness in care provision,
   fostering patient and community participation, and actively promoting
   responsiveness. Variations in the operationalization of these domains
   related to different scopes, contexts and types of diversity. For
   example, approaches that focus on ethnic diversity mostly provide
   recommendations to handle cultural and language differences; approaches
   that take an intersectional approach and broaden their target population
   to vulnerable groups in a more general sense also pay attention to
   factors such as socio-economic status and gender.
   Conclusions: Despite differences in labeling, there is a broad consensus
   about what health care organizations need to do in order to be

Abstract = {{Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) provide an ideal platform for
   achieving multifunction, such as multimodal imaging, sensing, therapy,
   etc., mainly by combining with other nanomaterials to construct
   complicated heterogeneous nanostructures. Multifunctional integration on
   a simple single-phase structure still is an open question and poses a
   big challenge. Here we show that small-sized NaGdF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNPs
   (similar to 7.5 nm) can simultaneously possess upconversion luminescence
   (UCL), temperature sensing, paramagnetic and photothermal conversion
   properties, endowing them great potential for photothermal treatments
   with real-time imaging and temperature monitoring. Effects of Yb3+
   concentrations, nanoparticle sizes and core/shell structures on the
   light-to-heat conversion capability of UCNPs were also investigated, and
   the results were discussed on the basis of the variation in absorption
   rates and non-radiative relaxation probabilities of UCNPs. There is a
   competition between UCL and light-to-heat conversion processes. Higher
   UCL efficiency and enhanced photothermal conversion properties can be
   realized on UCNPs with the active-core/active-shell structure due to
   enhanced absorption rates. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Planar infrared visualization of species in flames is challenging due to
   the severe thermal radiation background and relatively weak fluorescence
   quantum yields from ro-vibration transitions. In this express, we report
   imaging of molecular species in a flame via an absorption-based coherent
   optical method, namely infrared polarization spectroscopy (IRPS).
   Single-shot, planar imaging of hydrogen fluoride (HF) has been achieved
   in a premixed CH4/O-2 Bunsen flame, being seeded with a small amount of
   SF6. The HF molecule was excited through a rovibrational transition at
   around 2.5 mu m, which belongs to the fundamental vibration band. High
   spatial resolution was guaranteed using an orthorgonal pump-probe
   geometry, and an effective suppression of thermal background emission
   was achieved owing to the coherent nature of the demonstrated
   two-dimensional IRPS. Other advantages, e.g. high temporal resolution
   and species-specificity, are also features of this laser-based
   technique, which make it suitable for imaging of non-fluorescent but
   infrared active gaseous molecules in harsh environments. (C) 2015

Title = {{Integrated III-V Photonic Crystal - Si waveguide platform with tailored
   optomechanical coupling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Optomechanical systems, in which the vibrations of a mechanical
   resonator are coupled to an electromagnetic radiation, have permitted
   the investigation of a wealth of novel physical effects. To fully
   exploit these phenomena in realistic circuits and to achieve different
   functionalities on a single chip, the integration of optomechanical
   resonators is mandatory. Here, we propose a novel approach to
   heterogeneously integrate arrays of two-dimensional photonic crystal
   defect cavities on top of silicon-on-insulator waveguides. The
   optomechanical response of these devices is investigated and evidences
   an optomechanical coupling involving both dispersive and dissipative
   mechanisms. By controlling the optical coupling between the waveguide
   and the photonic crystal, we were able to vary and understand the
   relative strength of these couplings. This scalable platform allows for
   an unprecedented control on the optomechanical coupling mechanisms, with
   a potential benefit in cooling experiments, and for the development of
   multi-element optomechanical circuits in the framework of
   optomechanically-driven signal-processing applications.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{We study the conductance of a single electron transistor (SET) with a
   ferroelectric (or dielectric) layer placed in the gate capacitor. We
   assume that the ferroelectric (FE) has a retarded response with
   arbitrary relaxation time. We show that in the case of ``fast{''} but
   still retarded response of the FE (dielectric) layer an additional
   contribution to the Coulomb blockade effect appears leading to the
   suppression of the SET conductance. We take into account fluctuations of
   the FE (dielectric) polarization using Monte Carlo simulations. For
   ``fast{''} FE, these fluctuations partially suppress the additional
   Coulomb blockade effect. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the
   transition from ``fast{''} to ``slow{''} FE. For high temperatures, the
   peak value of the SET conductance is almost independent of the FE
   relaxation time. For temperatures close to the FE Curie temperature, the
   conductance peak value nonmonotonically depends on the FE relaxation
   time. A maximum appears when the FE relaxation time is of the order of
   the SET discharging time. Below the Curie point the conductance peak
   value decreases with increasing the FE relaxation time. The conductance
   shows the hysteresis behavior for any FE relaxation time at temperatures
   below the FE transition point. We show that conductance hysteresis is
   robust against FE internal fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{The NOMAD instrument has been designed to best fulfil the science
   objectives of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission that will be
   launched in 2016. The instrument is a combination of three channels that
   cover the UV, visible and IR spectral ranges and can perform solar
   occultation, nadir and limb observations. In this series of two papers,
   we present the optical models representing the three channels of the
   instrument and use them to determine signal to noise levels for
   different observation modes and Martian conditions. In this first part,
   we focus on the UVIS channel, which will sound the Martian atmosphere
   using nadir and solar occultation viewing modes, covering the 200-650nm
   spectral range. High SNR levels (>1000) can easily be reached for
   wavelengths higher than 300nm both in solar occultation and nadir modes
   when considering binning. Below 300nm SNR are lower primarily because of
   the lower signal and the impact of atmospheric absorption. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The purity of the synthesized orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) light in
   the fiber is inversely proportional to channel crosstalk level in the
   OAM optical fiber communication system. Here the relationship between
   the fiber structure and the purity is firstly demonstrated in theory.
   The graded-index optical fiber is proposed and designed for the OAM
   light propagation with the purity higher than 99.9\%. 16 fiber modes (10
   OAM modes) have been supported by a specific designed graded-index
   optical fiber with dispersion less than 35 ps/(km.nm). Such fiber design
   has suppressed the intrinsic crosstalk to be lower than -30 dB, and can
   be potentially used for the long distance OAM optical communication
   system. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Hot-carrier-induced linear drain current (I-dlin) and threshold voltage
   (V-th) degradations for the thin layer SOI field p-channel lateral
   double-diffused MOS (pLDMOS) are investigated. Two competition
   degradation mechanisms are revealed and the hot-carrier conductance
   modulation model is proposed. In the channel, hot-hole injection induced
   positive oxide trapped charge and interface trap gives rise to the V-th
   increasing and the channel conductance (G(ch)) decreasing, then reduces
   I-dlin. In the p-drift region, hot-electron injection induced negative
   oxide trapped charge enhances the conductance of drift doping resistance
   (G(d)), and then increases I-dlin. Consequently, the eventual I-dlin
   degradation is controlled by the competition of the two mechanisms due
   to conductance modulation in the both regions. Based on the model, it is
   explained that the measured I-dlin anomalously increases while the V-th
   is increasing with power law. The thin layer field pLDMOS exhibits more
   severe V-th instability compared with thick SOI layer structure; as a
   result, it should be seriously evaluated in actual application in
   switching circuit. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we proved that the ionic liquid (IL)
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate
   ({[}emim]{[}FAP]) is a promising candidate for natural gas sweetening.
   The reason is that the absorption capacity for CO2 is high, the
   selectivity for CO2/CH4 is good, and the IL shows low affinity for light
   hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10). In this study, capability of
   this IL for the extraction of aromatics from aliphatic + aromatic
   mixtures via liquid-liquid extraction is evaluated. Therefore, the
   solubilities of the liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons (hexane, heptane) and
   the liquid aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene
   (=BTEX)) in {[}emim]{[}FAP] have been measured at different
   temperatures. The ternary liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data for the
   ternary systems \{hexane + benzene + {[}emim]{[}FAP]\}, \{heptane +
   toluene + {[}emim]{[}FAP]\}, {[}octane + ethylbenzene + {[}emim]{[}FAP]
   and {[}octane + o-xylene + {[}emim]{[}FAP]) have been measured at
   T/K=293.15 and atmospheric pressure. The solute distribution coefficient
   and selectivity have been calculated and analyzed. The influence of the
   chain length (both in the hydrocarbon and in the aromatic) has been
   studied. Moreover, in order to properly evaluate the capability of this
   IL for BTEX recovery, the experimental data have been compared with
   available data in literature. Finally, the experimentally determined LLE
   data have been correlated using the NRTL model. It was found that the
   studied IL show distribution coefficient and selectivities compared to
   other ILs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potassium channel Kv7.1 plays critical physiological roles in both
   heart and epithelial tissues. In heart, Kv7.1 and the accessory subunit
   KCNE1 forms the slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current
   current, which is enhanced by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated
   phosphorylation. The observed current increase requires both
   phosphorylation of Kv7.1 and the presence of KCNE1. However, PKA also
   stimulates Kv7.1 currents in epithelial tissues, such as colon, where
   the channel does not coassemble with KCNE1. Here, we demonstrate that
   PKA activity significantly impacts the subcellular localization of Kv7.1
   in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. While PKA inhibition reduced the
   fraction of channels at the cell surface, PKA activation increased it.
   We show that PKA inhibition led to intracellular accumulation of Kv7.1
   in late endosomes/lysosomes. By mass spectroscopy we identified eight
   phosphorylated residues on Kv7.1, however, none appeared to play a role
   in the observed response. Instead, we found that PKA acted by regulating
   endocytic trafficking involving the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. We show
   that a Nedd4-2-resistant Kv7.1-mutant displayed significantly reduced
   intracellular accumulation upon PKA inhibition. Similar effects were
   observed upon siRNA knockdown of Nedd4-2. However, although Nedd4-2 is
   known to regulate Kv7.1 by ubiquitylation, biochemical analyses
   demonstrated that PKA did not influence the amount of Nedd4-2 bound to
   Kv7.1 or the ubiquitylation level of the channel. This suggests that PKA
   influences Nedd4-2-dependent Kv7.1 transport though a different
   molecular mechanism. In summary, we identify a novel mechanism whereby
   PKA can increase Kv7.1 current levels, namely by regulating
   Nedd4-2-dependent Kv7.1 transport.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative in situ ionoluminescence (IL) experiments using light (H,
   He) and heavy ions (C, Si, Br) at MeV energies have been performed on
   three types of silica with different silanol group content (negligible,
   medium and high). In all cases the IL spectra consist of two predominant
   features: a blue band peaked at 460 nm (2.7 eV) and a red band peaked at
   650 nm (1.9 eV). The relative yields of these two emissions and their
   kinetics as a function of fluence are strongly sensitive to the ion
   stopping power and are, also, moderately dependent on the OH content.
   The IL kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to previous results of
   the silica network compaction obtained from infrared spectroscopy. We
   confirm that the structural disordering induced by irradiation plays a
   crucial role on the migration of self-trapped excitons up to the
   recombination in color centers. The main effect of an increasing OH
   content is to greatly enhance the ratio of the red versus the blue
   emission yield. This can be explained by an additional non-bridging
   oxygen hole center generation channel produced by the scission of
   extrinsic Si-O-H bonds by electronic excitation that competes with the
   scission of strained intrinsic bonds. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   management using a diversity-guided, cyclic-networking particle swarm

Abstract = {{Multiple small-scale, distributed storage facilities have recently
   received much attention owing to their effectiveness for combined sewer
   overflow (CSO) mitigation. In this line of research, designing the
   optimal configuration of storage tanks in a sewer network is very
   challenging, and thus relatively few studies have been made to this day.
   To solve such a large-scale complex multimodal optimal design problem, a
   meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization-based design methodology of
   complex sewer networks for CSO management is developed. This search
   engine includes two mechanisms: a diversity-guided three-phase velocity
   update law and restricted social best searching based on the cyclic
   network structure. It allows regions of the design space to be explored
   efficiently by driving each particle to share information in switching
   the velocity update mechanism only with a set of neighboring particles
   via a fixed near-neighbor interaction structure. Therefore, the movement
   of a particle is no longer driven by the global best position of the
   entire swarm, which enhances the diversification attitude of the scheme.
   Its implementability under an actual environment is demonstrated by
   applying it to a combined sewer network case study of a complex
   large-scale multi-storage network in the Gunja subcatchment area located
   in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The simulation results indicate that the
   developed particle swarm optimization-based design methodology exhibits
   not only superior reliability but also high practicality, simplicity,
   and implementability for optimal planning of real-life CSO storage
   facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the synthesis of polypyrrole-titanium(IV)phosphate
   (PPy-TiP) nanocomposite as a synthetic adsorbent for the adsorptive
   removal of Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. Facile in situ chemical
   oxidative polymerization of pyrrole in presence of titanium(IV)phosphate
   (Tip) formed PPy-TiP nanocomposite. The prepared PPy-TiP nanocomposite
   was characterized by FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, EDAX and BET analysis. A strong
   interaction between PPy and TiP particles was observed, and the
   nanocomposite showed remarkable adsorption of Cr(VI) ions from aqueous
   solutions. In order to optimize the conditions for maximum adsorption of
   Cr(VI) ions, batch process was used and the effects of contact time,
   initial concentration, pH, point of zero charge measurement and
   adsorbent doses were investigated. The equilibrium isotherm data were
   fitted using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The adsorption process
   based on the thermodynamic parameters was spontaneous and endothermic.
   Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm was used to calculate the mean free
   energy, which showed that the adsorption process involves chemical
   forces, hence chemical in nature. The kinetics data were evaluated using
   the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second order kinetics model, and it
   was found that data was best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model for
   adsorption of Cr(VI) supporting that the adsorption mainly consisted of
   chemisorption. The desorption studies were also performed by batch
   process and similar to 100\% desorption of Cr(VI) ions was achieved
   using 0.5 M NaOH solution as eluent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Six different populations of cells were isolated by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting from disaggregated late blastula-
   and gastrula-stage sea urchin embryos according to the regulatory states
   expressed in these cells, as reported by recombineered bacterial
   artificial chromosomes producing fluorochromes. Transcriptomes recovered
   from these embryonic cell populations revealed striking, early
   differential expression of large cohorts of effector genes. The six cell
   populations were presumptive pigment cells, presumptive neurogenic
   cells, presumptive skeletogenic cells, cells from the stomodeal region
   of the oral ectoderm, ciliated band cells and cells from the
   endoderm/ectoderm boundary that will give rise both to hindgut and to
   border ectoderm. Transcriptome analysis revealed that each of these
   domains specifically expressed several hundred effector genes at
   significant levels. Annotation indicated the qualitative individuality
   of the functional nature of each cell population, even though they were
   isolated from embryos only 1-2 days old. In no case was more than a tiny
   fraction of the transcripts enriched in one population also enriched in
   any other of the six populations studied. As was particularly clear in
   the cases of the presumptive pigment, neurogenic and skeletogenic cells,
   all three of which represent precociously differentiating cell types of
   this embryo, most specifically expressed genes of given cell types are
   not significantly expressed at all in the other cell types. Thus, at the
   effector gene level, a dramatic, cell type-specific pattern of
   differential gene regulation is established well before any significant
   embryonic morphogenesis has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to obtain antibacterial active
   chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate macromere (CS/PEGM) semi-IPN
   hydrogels near a neutral pH level by changing their pore size and
   morphology. These hydrogels were prepared from CS and PEGM with
   different molecular weights in the presence of pore-forming agents, poly
   (ethylene glycol) (PEG) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), by using two
   different initiator system, namely chemical or UV. A combination of CS
   with PEG or NaHCO3 in the presence of PEGM could be able to create
   desired pore formation in both initiator systems. The antibacterial
   activity of hydrogels changed with the molecular weight (g/mol) of PEGM
   in the order 2000>400>8000. A chemical initiation system was found more
   suitable than the UV initiation system for antibacterial activity.
   Hydrogels showing the highest antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus
   aureus and Escherichia coli have medium or distributed pore size and
   interconnected pores. Hydrogels prepared with PEGM (M-n: 2000 g/mol)
   were proposed for antibacterial wound dressing and soft tissue
   regeneration applications owing to their antibacterial activity and
   elastic modulus. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

Abstract = {{Ca, Mg, Zn and P bioavailability from two experimental ultrafiltered
   fermented goats' milks (one of them with the probiotic Lactobacillus
   plantarum and another one without it), and fermented goats' milk samples
   available in the market were evaluated. Solubility, dialysability and a
   model combining simulated gastrointestinal digestion and mineral
   retention, transport and uptake by Caco-2 cells were used to assess
   bioavailability. The highest Ca, Mg, Zn and P bioavailability values
   always corresponded to the fermented milk developed by our research
   group, which could be explained by the effect of milk ultrafiltration.
   The fermented milk with L. plantarum showed higher Ca retention than the
   ones without the microorganism, and major Ca uptake when compared to
   commercial products. This fact could be attributed to a positive effect
   exerted by the probiotic strain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Mood-incongruent processing during the recall of a sad life event
   predicts the course and severity of depression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{91-96}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies suggest that mood-incongruent processing
   constitutes an adaptive mood regulation strategy, and that difficulties
   in this process may contribute to the maintenance of depression.
   However, no study has yet examined whether mood-incongruent processing
   predicts the course and severity of clinical depression.
   Methods: To address this question, the present study used a prospective,
   longitudinal design to examine the effects of mood-incongruent
   processing in a sample of 59 clinically depressed patients. At baseline,
   participants were asked to recall and describe a sad and a happy life
   event. Participants' utterances were transcribed and analysed using
   computerized text analysis. Negated emotion words were excluded. The
   proportion of positive emotion words during sad memory recall was used
   as an indicator of mood-incongruent processing. After 6 months,
   participants were re-assessed for symptom levels and the criteria of
   major depressive disorder (MDD) during the follow-up period.
   Results: Higher relative frequency of positive emotion words during sad
   memory recall was associated with less symptoms of depression at
   follow-up and shorter time to recovery from MDD, over and above baseline
   symptoms of depression. The effect was not just due to increased general
   positivity in emotional expression or emotional expressiveness per se.
   Limitations: The sample size and the timeframe for the follow-up
   assessment were limited. Furthermore, it is unknown to which degree word
   use reflects the actual experience of the expressed emotions.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of mood-incongruent
   processing in the maintenance of depression and advocate a stronger
   focus on mood-incongruent processing in the treatment of depression. (C)

Abstract = {{Ocimum basilicum L. (sweet basil) is an essential oil producing crop
   used in culinary and fragrance applications. The objective of this
   controlled environment study was to evaluate the effects of organic and

   kg N/ha) on plant growth, essential oil yield and chemical profile, and
   tissue nutrient accumulation in sweet basil. Overall, basil plants
   fertilized with organic fertilizer at a rate of 150 kg N/ha accumulated
   greater concentrations of potassium (K) and manganese (Mn). The highest
   fresh weight was obtained from the plants grown with conventional
   fertilizer at a rate of 250 kg N/ha. Treatments did not affect the oil
   content in dried biomass (0.23-0.36\% range), oil yields (11.4-20.7
   mg/pot), nor the concentration of eucalyptol, (-)-linalool, bornyl
   acetate, eugenol, alpha-trans-bergamotene, germacrene D, gamma-cadinene

Abstract = {{This experimental study focuses on the behaviour of hollow concrete
   brick masonry walls, especially walls reinforced with composite
   materials under in-plane loading conditions. This work is a step towards
   defining reliable seismic strengthening solutions. Indeed, in France,
   more stringent seismic design requirements for building structures have
   been considered with the replacement of old design codes. Thus, an
   experimental program has been performed at the laboratory scale. Six
   walls have been submitted for shear-compression tests - five walls are
   reinforced by (1) - fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strips using E-glass
   and carbon fabrics and/or (2) a textile-reinforced concrete (TRC), and
   the last wall acts as a reference. It is noted that the composite strips
   are mechanically anchored into the foundations of the walls to improve
   their efficiency. All of the walls share the same boundary and
   compressive loading conditions, which are representative of a seismic
   solicitation. Nevertheless, masonry wall performances and anchor
   efficiency are only evaluated under monotonic lateral loadings. A
   comparative study on global behaviour and on local mechanisms is
   performed and, in particular, highlights that the mechanical anchor
   systems play an important role in improving the behaviour of reinforced
   walls (by FRP and TRC) and that the solutions for strengthening by TRC
   permit the upgrade of the walls' ductility with a lower strength
   compared with the solutions with FRP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Shear failures in reinforced concrete members without transverse
   reinforcement: An analysis of the critical shear crack development on
   the basis of test results}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{157-173}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Shear in concrete members without transverse reinforcement can be
   carried by various potential shear-transfer actions, whose activation
   depends much on the actual cracking pattern and kinematics at failure.
   Failures can occur in a progressive manner (at the end of a stable
   propagation of a critical shear crack) or in a sudden manner (by an
   unstable progression or development of a new crack). In addition, the
   development and shape of the failure crack may also be very different
   from case to case. These differences influence which shear-transfer
   actions may be governing for a given member and loading situation.
   Despite the large number of specimens tested in shear, almost no
   information on the actual crack development during the process of
   failure is yet available. This paper presents the results of an
   experimental programme consisting of thirteen beams. The tests were
   designed to investigate different structural systems and loading
   conditions commonly found in practice (cantilevers with concentrated and
   distributed loading, single span beams with distributed loading and
   continuous beams). The cracking patterns and their associated kinematics
   were tracked in detail by using photogrammetric techniques at high
   frequencies during testing and particularly during the process of
   failure, providing data on the actual crack development leading to shear
   failure. The observations show that very different cracking patterns may
   be found and that they might be also developed in different manners. The
   results are interpreted with reference to the measured crack kinematics
   and related to the various potential shear-transfer actions, with the
   aim of providing a useful material towards the development of rational
   approaches for shear design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Pr doped LaFeO3 are synthesized by the sol-gel citrate method. The
   crystal structure of the samples can be described by the Pbnm space
   group. The Raman spectra of the materials show that the vibrational
   modes are heavily influenced by the magnitude of the orthorhombic
   distortion. The antiferromagnetic nature of the samples is examined by
   temperature dependent magnetisation measurements and the corresponding
   hysteresis loop. A signature of weak ferromagnetic phase is observed in
   the samples at low temperature due to the canting of the iron
   sublattices. The frequency dependent dielectric relaxation of the sample
   has been investigated in the temperature range from 303 K to 513 K in
   the framework of conductivity and electric modulus formalisms. The
   complex impedance plots are explained by an electrical equivalent
   circuit consisting of constant phase element and resistance. A
   significant change of the conductivity is observed with the increase of
   Pr concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thick Cenozoic deposits in the northwestern Qaidam Basin record erosion
   of the Altyn Tagh and high terrain west of that basin and presumably the
   concurrent growth of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. A detailed
   magnetostratigraphic study of the Huatugou section, northwestern Qaidam
   basin, reveals that this section spans the period from similar to 30 to
   similar to 11 Ma. Magnetostratigraphic and sedimentological studies
   indicate that the accumulation rate abruptly increased near similar to
   15 Ma. The acceleration in sedimentation rate suggests enhanced tectonic
   deformation in the Qaidam basin since similar to 15 Ma that may have
   begun simultaneously with accelerated deformation along the Altyn Tagh,
   Kunlun, and Haiyuan faults, which contributed to the growth history of
   the Qaidam basin and its surroundings since similar to 15 Ma. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is the most
   commonly inherited demyelinating polyneuropathy with variable
   phenotypes, affected by several comorbidities, especially diabetes
   mellitus (DM). Previous studies showed that DM exacerbates the clinical
   manifestations of CMT1A.
   Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with CMT1A
   in our hospital, and identified three groups among 12 cases, which
   comprised four patients with CMT1A, four with CMT1A + DM, and four with
   DM. We reviewed the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS), electrophysiological
   data, and histomorphological parameters of the sural nerve, including
   fiber density, myelin thickness, axon diameter, g-ratio, regenerative
   clusters, and regeneration ratio.
   Results: The CMTNS was significantly higher in patients with CMT1A + DM
   (21.5 +/- 2.52) than in those with CMT1A only (10.8 +/- 4.4; p = 0.03).
   Pathological findings in patients with CMT1A + DM included a significant
   decrease of myelinated fiber density (p = 0.02) and reduction in the
   regenerative ratio (p = 0.01), indicating severe degeneration with
   impaired regeneration. In non-parametric analyses, DM was found to play
   a more important role than CMT1A in influencing nerve degeneration and
   regeneration.
   Conclusions: In patients with CMT1A, DM exacerbated clinical and
   pathological manifestations including increased loss of myelinated
   fibers, abnormal axon-myelin interaction, and impaired nerve
   regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Silicon isotope systematics of acidic weathering of fresh basalts,
   Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i}},

Abstract = {{Silicon stable isotopes are fractionated by a host of low-temperature
   aqueous processes, making them potentially useful as a weathering proxy.
   Here we characterize the silicon isotope signature of surficial chemical
   weathering of glassy basaltic lava flows at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.
   Fresh basalt flow surfaces (<40 years old) frequently feature opaque
   amorphous silica surface coatings up to 80 mu m thick. These silica
   coatings and associated silica cements are enriched in the heavier
   isotopes of Si (delta Si-30(NBS-28) = +0.92 parts per thousand to +1.36
   parts per thousand) relative to their basaltic substrate (delta
   Si-30(NBS-28) = -0.3 parts per thousand to -0.2 parts per thousand).
   Secondary clays and opals are typically depleted in Si-30 relative to
   the dissolved reservoirs from which they precipitated, so this sense of
   isotopic fractionation is unusual. Mechanisms capable of producing
   isotopically heavy secondary minerals were explored by conducting batch
   alteration experiments on fresh basaltic glass. Batch acidic alteration
   of basalt glass in HCl, H2SO4, and HF produced silica-rich surface
   layers resembling the Hawaiian surface coatings. Differences in fluid
   chemical composition affected the direction and magnitude of Si isotope
   fractionation. Basalt leaching in HCl or H2SO4 produced Si-30-enriched
   fluids (1000 ln alpha(precip-Si(aq)) congruent to 0.8 parts per
   thousand) and Si-30-depleted secondary silica layers. In contrast,
   HF-bearing experiments produced highly Si-30-depleted fluid compositions
   (1000 ln alpha(precip-Si(aq)) up to + 8 parts per thousand). Larger
   isotopic fractionations were observed in experiments with lower
   fluid-rock ratios. In Hawaii, where altering fluids contain H2SO4 and
   HCl but minimal HF, high delta Si-30 values for the silica coatings were
   likely achieved by Rayleigh fractionation. Aqueous Si-30-enriched silica
   was released during incongruent basalt dissolution then subsequently
   transported and deposited from an evaporating solution at the flow
   surface. Our results indicate that (1) altering fluid chemistry and
   fluid-rock ratio impact the Si isotope signature of chemical weathering
   and (2) delta Si-30 of solids produced by low temperature aqueous
   alteration may diverge sharply from watershed-or landscape-scale
   weathering trends. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The AlCoNiCrFe high-entropy alloy was prepared by mechanical alloying

   sintering process, no grain growth occurs and no intermetallic phases
   present in the AlCoNiCrFe high-entropy alloy in the Cu base composite.
   Compression tests show that the AlCoNiCrFe high-entropy alloy has a
   better strengthening effect than metallic glasses and the yield strength

Abstract = {{The pyrolysis behaviors and kinetics of Eucalyptus leaves (EL),
   Eucalyptus bark (EB) and Eucalyptus sawdust (ESD) were investigated by
   using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. Three stages for EL,
   EB and ESD pyrolysis have been divided using differential derivative
   thermogravimetric (DDTG) method and the second stage is the main
   pyrolysis process with approximately 86.93\% (EL), 88.96\% (EB) and
   97.84\% (ESD) weight loss percentages. Kinetic parameters of Gaussian
   distributed activation energy model (DAEM) for EL, EB and ESD pyrolysis
   are: distributed centers (E-0)of 141.15 kJ/mol (EL), 149.21 kJ/mol (EB),
   175.79 kJ/mol (ESD), standard deviations (sigma) of 18.35 kJ/mol (EL),
   18.37 kJ/mol (EB), 14.41 kJ/mol (ESD) and pre-exponential factors (A) of
   1.15E+10 s(-1) (EL), 4.34E+10 s(-1) (EB), 7.44E+12 s(-1) (ESD). A new
   modified discrete DAEM was performed and showed excellent fits to
   experimental data than Gaussian DAEM. According to the modified discrete
   DAEM, the activation energies are in ranges of 122.67-308.64 kJ/mol,
   118.72-410.80 kJ/mol and 108.39-192.93 kJ/mol for EL, EB and ESD
   pyrolysis, respectively. The pre-exponential factors of discrete DAEM
   have wide ranges of 4.84E+13-6.12E+22 s(-1) (EL), 1.91E+12-4.51E+25
   s(-1) (EB) and 63.43-4.36E+11 s(-1) (ESD). The variation of activation
   energy versus conversion reveals the mechanism change during pyrolysis
   process. The kinetic data would be of immense benefit to model, design
   and develop suitable thermo-chemical systems for the application of
   Eucalyptus residues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plant apyrases are nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) diphosphohydrolases
   (NTPDases) and have been implicated in an array of functions within the
   plant including the regulation of extracellular ATP. Arabidopsis encodes
   a family of seven membrane bound apyrases (AtAPY1-7) that comprise three
   distinct clades, all of which contain the five conserved apyrase
   domains. With the exception of AtAPY1 and AtAPY2, the biochemical and
   the sub-cellular characterization of the other members are currently
   unavailable. In this research, we have shown all seven Arabidopsis
   apyrases localize to internal membranes comprising the cis-Golgi,
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosome, indicating an endo-apyrase
   classification for the entire family. In addition, all members, with the
   exception of AtAPY7, can function as endo-apyrases by complementing a
   yeast double mutant (Delta ynd1 Delta gda1) which lacks apyrase
   activity. Interestingly, complementation of the mutant yeast using well
   characterized human apyrases could only be accomplished by using a
   functional ER endo-apyrase (NTPDase6), but not the ecto-apyrase
   (NTPDase1). Furthermore, the substrate specificity analysis for the
   Arabidopsis apyrases AtAPY1-6 indicated that each member has a distinct
   set of preferred substrates covering various NDPs (nucleoside
   diphosphates) and NTPs. Combining the biochemical analysis and
   sub-cellular localization of the Arabidopsis apyrases family, the data
   suggest their possible roles in regulating endomembrane NDP/NMP
   (nucleoside monophosphate) homoeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Dissociation of gaseous protein complexes produced by native
   electrospray often induces an asymmetric partitioning of charge between
   ejected subunits. We present a simple asymmetric charge partitioning
   factor (ACPF) to quantify the magnitude of asymmetry in this effect.
   When applied to monomer ejection from the cytochrome c dimer and
   beta-amylase tetramer, we found that the similar to 60-70\% of precursor
   charge ending up in the ejected monomers corresponds to ACPFs of 1.38
   and 2.51, respectively. Further, we used site-specific fragmentation
   from electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to identify differences in
   fragmentation and characterize domains of secondary-structure present in
   the dimer, ejected monomers, and monomers obtained directly from
   electrospray ionization (ESI). We found evidence of structural changes
   between the dimer and ejected monomer, but also that the ejected monomer
   had a nearly identical set of fragment ions produced by ETD as the ESI
   monomer with the same charge state. Surprisingly, ACPF values for ETD
   fragment ions generated directly from the dimer revealed that the
   fragments undergo asymmetric charge partitioning at over twice the
   magnitude of that observed for ejection of the monomer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Given a connected graph G of order n and a nonnegative symmetric matrix
   A = {[}a(i,j)] of order n, define the function FA (G) as
   FA(G) - Sigma(1 <= i<j <= n) d(G) (i,j) a(i,j),
   where d(G) (i, j) denotes the distance between the vertices i and j in
   G.
   In this note it is shown that F-A (G) <= F-A (P) for some path of order
   n. Moreover, if each row of A has at most one zero off-diagonal entry,
   then F-A (G) < F-A (P) for some path of order n, unless G itself is a
   path.
   In particular, this result implies two conjectures of Aouchiche and
   Hansen:
   the spectral radius of the distance Laplacian of a connected graph G of
   order n is maximal if and only if G is a path;
   the spectral radius of the distance signless Laplacian of a connected
   graph G of order n is maximal if and only if G is a path. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Bio-composite which is made of wood sawdust (SW) with novel modification
   and gypsum is presented in this paper. Attenuated total
   reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) characterizations
   reveal that the main compositions of sawdust water extractives are
   tannins, acetic acid, hemicellulose, and lignin. Positive effect of
   sawdust water extractives on gypsum was achieved by the addition of
   antifoam agent. Mechanical testing shows that the mechanism of sawdust
   induced reduction of gypsum performance may be attributed to the water
   absorption of sawdust. Subtraction and matching analysis with OMNIC
   software indicates that water-based epoxy (WEP) could be coated on the
   surface of sawdust by using spray coating, which resulted in a reduction
   of the water absorption of sawdust up to 25.6\% and water content inside
   gypsum/sawdust composite up to 35.8\%. Mechanical testing of
   gypsum/sawdust composite shows that the light weight composite with
   promising mechanical performance could be obtained by the WEP treatment;
   for 20\% sawdust addition, the flexural strength and compressive
   strength of composite are 4.59 MPa and 13.25 MPa, respectively; for 30\%
   sawdust addition, the flexural strength and compressive strength of
   composite are 3.36 MPa and 8.73 MPa, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Coupling a water balance model with forest inventory data to predict

Abstract = {{Mechanistic water balance models can be used to predict soil moisture
   dynamics and drought stress in individual forest stands. Predicting
   current and future levels of plant drought stress is important not only
   at the local scale, but also at larger, landscape to regional, scales,
   because these are the management scales at which adaptation and
   mitigation strategies are implemented. To obtain reliable predictions of
   soil moisture and plant drought stress over large extents, water balance
   models need to be complemented with detailed information about the
   spatial variation of vegetation and soil attributes. We designed,
   calibrated and validated a water balance model that produces annual
   estimates of drought intensity and duration for all plant cohorts in a
   forest stand. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as a case study, we coupled
   this model with plot records from two Spanish forest inventories in
   which species identity, diameter and height of plant cohorts were
   available. Leaf area index of each plant cohort was estimated from basal
   area using species-specific relationships. Vertical root distribution
   for each species in each forest plot was estimated by determining the
   distribution that maximized transpiration in the model, given average
   climatic conditions, soil attributes and stand density. We determined
   recent trends (period 1980-2010) in drought stress for the main tree
   species in Catalonia; where forest growth and densification occurs in
   many areas as a result of rural abandonment and decrease of forest
   management. Regional increases in drought stress were detected for most
   tree species, although we found high variation in stress changes among
   individual forest plots. Moreover, predicted trends in tree drought
   stress were mainly due to changes in leaf area occurred between the two
   forest inventories rather than to climatic trends. We conclude that
   forest structure needs to be explicitly considered in assessments of
   plant drought stress patterns and trends over large geographic areas,
   and that forest inventories are useful sources of data provided that
   reasonably good estimates of soil attributes and root distribution are
   available. Our approach coupled with recent improvements in forest
   survey technologies may allow obtaining spatially continuous and precise
   assessments of drought stress. Further efforts are needed to calibrate
   drought-related demographic processes before water balance and drought
   stress estimates can be fully used for the accurate prediction of
   drought impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single
   family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of
   dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and
   limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of
   related individuals and strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure
   (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene flow may be
   disrupted, tree species with strong FSGS are predicted to exhibit
   increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity,
   fitness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of
   dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for
   FSGS provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of
   forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to
   use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of
   FSGS in dipterocarps. We quantify FSGS in 19 dipterocarp species across
   four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We
   detected FSGS in 15 (79\%) of our study species, most of which displayed
   significant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and flower
   size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines
   to allow forest managers to account for FSGS when planning approaches to
   maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The
   integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential
   for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience
   of logged forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NiMgAl mixed oxides promoted with cerium species were synthesized from
   their corresponding hydrotalcite precursors and subsequently
   characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, H-2-TPR, CO2-TPD and N-2
   sorption techniques. The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts
   was tested in the reaction of CO2 methane reforming and compared to the
   performance of two reference catalysts: 10Ni/Al2O3 and 10Ni/CZ
   (ceria-zirconia). The hydrotalcite derived materials showed a
   significant catalytic activity at 550 degrees C towards the dry
   reforming reaction. However, the simultaneous occurrence of undesired
   side reactions was as well observed, mainly CH4 decomposition and RWGS
   reaction. In this sense, the addition of cerium by ion-exchange with
   {[}Ce(EDTA)](-) complexes resulted in higher activity and selectivity,
   due to an increase in the reducibility of nickel species and to the
   introduction of new intermediate and strong basic sites (acid-base pairs
   and low coordinated oxygen species). The reference catalysts showed
   considerable loss of catalytic activity during 5 h experiments, lower
   CO2 conversion (10Ni/CZ) and high excess of CO in the products of the
   reaction (10Ni/Al2O3), pointing to a generally better performance of the
   hydrotalcite derived catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this research application paper, the usefulness of the
   s-metaheuristic neighborhood search technique of simulated annealing
   algorithm when applied to forest management planning problems was
   explored. We concentrated on tactical forest spatial harvest scheduling
   problems where the net present value of management activities over
   thirty 1-yr periods was to be maximized. Constraints mainly included
   those related to the need for an even-flow of scheduled wood products
   and the need for spatial constraint types, i.e., unit restriction model
   and area restriction model, respectively. Four hypothetical grid
   datasets with different age class distributions (i.e., young, normal,
   older and spatially organized) and one real dataset from northeastern
   China were used to illustrate how a 2-opt moves can intensify a search
   within high-quality areas of a solution space and thus produce
   higher-valued solutions as compared to the sole use of 1-opt moves.
   Finally, extreme value theory was employed to estimate the global
   optimum solution and to evaluate the quality of the heuristic solutions.
   We found that the 2-opt technique not only produced consistently better
   solutions than the 1-opt technique in terms of the mean and maximum
   solutions values, but also significantly decreased the standard
   deviations associated with the sets of solutions. The maximum solution
   values were usually more than 98\% of the estimated optimal values. The
   motivation for using a 2-opt technique is found in the generation of
   more efficient solutions that will allow a forestry organization to
   produce higher returns to its owners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
   (PPAR gamma) ligand, is a novel dilator of small airways in mouse
   precision cut lung slices (PCLS). In this study, relaxation to RGZ and
   beta-adrenoceptor agonists were compared in trachea from naive mice and
   guinea pigs and trachea and PCLS from a mouse model of chronic allergic
   airways disease (AAD). Airways were precontracted with methacholine
   before addition of PPAR gamma ligands {[}RGZ, ciglitazone (CGZ), or
   15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15-deoxy-PGJ2)] or
   beta-adrenoceptor agonists (isoprenaline and salbutamol). The effects of
   T0070907 and GW9662 (PPAR gamma antagonists) or epithelial removal on
   relaxation were assessed. Changes in force of trachea and lumen area in
   PCLS were measured using preparations from saline-challenged mice and
   mice sensitized (days 0 and 14) and challenged with ovalbumin (3
   times/wk, 6 wk). RGZ and CGZ elicited complete relaxation with greater
   efficacy than beta-adrenoceptor agonists in mouse airways but not guinea
   pig trachea, while 15-deoxy-PGJ(2) did not mediate bronchodilation.
   Relaxation to RGZ was not prevented by T0070907 or GW9662 or by
   epithelial removal. RGZ-induced relaxation was preserved in the trachea
   and increased in PCLS after ovalbumin-challenge. Although RGZ was less
   potent than beta-adrenoceptor agonists, its effects were additive with
   salbutamol and isoprenaline and only RGZ maintained potency and full
   efficacy in maximally contracted airways or after allergen challenge.
   Acute PPAR gamma-independent, epithelial-independent airway relaxation
   to RGZ is resistant to functional antagonism and maintained in both
   trachea and PCLS from a model of chronic AAD. These novel efficacious
   actions of RGZ support its therapeutic potential in asthma when
   responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor agonists is limited.}},

   the hypodentate ligating resin PS-SO2-H2L. The new resin was
   characterized and the extent of metal adsorption reached maximum at pH
   6.0 for Cu (II), Cd (II) and Ag (I), with an adsorption amount of 43,

   Implications for the volcano dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{41-57}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Remote sensing techniques are applied to retrieve land surface
   temperature (LST), radiative heat flux (RHF), geothermal heat flux
   (GHF), and to map hydrothermal alteration zones around the Damavand
   stratovolcano (Iran). Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) day
   and nighttime images are used and merged to available geological data to
   identify thermal anomaly areas. RHF is determined using the
   Stefan-Boltzmann equation after preprocessing (geometric, radiometric
   and atmospheric correction) and processing (emissivity calculation and
   LST retrieval) of thermal infrared bands. In order to estimate GHF from
   daytime image, solar radiation and albedo maps are generated to minimize
   these effects. The GHF values are derived from nighttime image using the
   background subtraction technique. Using Boolean operation, only those
   pixels with the GHF values greater than 30 W/m(2) obtained from daytime
   image and the GHF values greater than 10 W/m(2) estimated from nighttime
   image are identified as thermal anomalies. The geothermal areas are
   identified by combining the thermal anomaly map and other geological
   information. Thermal anomalies have close spatial correlation to faults,
   thermal springs, and high heat flow measurements from subsurface data
   and lithology. Some of the thermal anomalies and hydrothermal alteration
   areas also overlap active deformation areas. This suggests role of heat
   and hydrothermal alteration on flank instability processes. The thermal
   anomaly areas show an arc-shaped pattern. This pattern and the
   concentration of higher GHF areas in the eastern sector of the volcano
   are consistent with a release of fluids in a transition zone between a
   transpressional and a transtensional tectonic regime. The combination of
   thermal infrared data with other geological information layers can be
   used to detect geothermal areas as well as to analyze the complex
   relationships among geothermal activity, active tectonics, and gravity
   instability processes on volcanoes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{High-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) is a secreted serine protease
   reported to play a role in the development of several cancers and
   neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the mechanism underlying the disease
   processes largely remains undetermined. In age-related macular
   degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision impairment and blindness in
   industrialized societies, two synonymous polymorphisms (rs1049331:C>T,
   and rs2293870:G>T) in exon 1 of the HTRA1 genewere associated with a
   high risk to develop disease. Here, we show that the two polymorphisms
   result in a protein with altered thermophoretic properties upon
   heat-induced unfolding, trypsin accessibility and secretion behavior,
   suggesting unique structural features of the AMD-risk-associated HTRA1
   protein. Applying MicroScale Thermophoresis and protease digestion
   analysis, we demonstrate direct binding and proteolysis of transforming
   growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) by normal HTRA1 but not the
   AMD-risk-associated isoform. As a consequence, both HTRA1 isoforms
   strongly differed in their ability to control TGF-beta mediated
   signaling, as revealed by reporter assays targeting the TGF-beta
   1-induced serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPINE1, alias PAI-1) promoter.
   In addition, structurally altered HTRA1 led to an impaired autocrine
   TGF-beta signaling in microglia, as measured by a strong down-regulation
   of downstream effectors of the TGF-beta cascade such as phosphorylated
   SMAD2 and PAI-1 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the
   effects of two synonymous HTRA1 variants on protein structure and
   protein interaction with TGF-beta 1. As a consequence, this leads to an
   impairment of TGF-beta signaling and microglial regulation. Functional
   implications of the altered properties on AMD pathogenesis remain to be
   clarified.}},

Abstract = {{The improvement in thermal efficiency for coal to power processes is
   increasingly important due to concerns on CO2 emissions. This paper
   presents a systematic study on direct combustion coal to power processes
   with respect to thermodynamic, technical and economic factors.
   Traditional exergy analysis focuses on irreversibilities in existing
   processes, while the new methodology investigates the thermal efficiency
   from its theoretical maximum to practical values by adding
   irreversibilities one by one. As a result of the study presented in this
   paper, various measures for increasing the thermal efficiency are
   investigated and the corresponding improvement potential is presented.
   For a reference power plant, the exergy of the coal feed is calculated
   to be 1.08 times the lower heating value. The actual thermal efficiency
   is 45.5\%. The irreversibilities are caused by the combustion reaction,

Abstract = {{ZrO2 coatings on pre-oxidized stainless steel (304L) surfaces have been
   developed by hydrothermal process and the coating adhesion and corrosion
   resistance properties of the coated specimens have been studied. The

   spinels and alpha-Fe2O3 with different morphologies has been studied.
   The thicknesses of the ZrO2 coatings are in the range of 50 nm to 350 nm
   depending upon the compositions of the pre-oxidized layers. The coating
   is thick and compact when developed on alpha-Fe2O3 with high surface
   roughness and shows the best corrosion resistance properties. ZrO2
   coatings developed on large size spinel oxides are thin and porous. The
   nano-mechanical properties and the local adhesion force have been
   studied by atomic force acoustic microscopy and force-distance
   spectroscopy. The adhesion force of ZrO2 coating on alpha-Fe2O3 is
   around 100 nN while for the coatings developed on other pre-oxidized

   information about gradient profiles of indium and nitrogen contents, as
   well as distinct anisotropy of strain relaxation in GaInNAs epitaxial
   layer, evoked by the asymmetry in formation of interfacial misfit
   dislocation. The obtained results were exploited to calculate the band

Abstract = {{Rationale: Patients with pulmonary hypertension due to left heart
   disease (PH-LHD) and a diastolic pulmonary vascular pressure gradient >=
   7 mm Hg, representing PH out of proportion to pulmonary arterial wedge
   pressure, have pulmonary vascular disease and increased mortality.
   Little information exists on this condition, recently labeled as
   ``combined pre- and post-capillary PH{''} (Cpc-PH).
   Objectives: To investigate epidemiology, risk factors, right ventricular
   function, and outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure and
   Cpc-PH.
   Methods: The study population was identified from a retrospective chart
   review of a clinical database of 3,107 stable patients who underwent
   first diagnostic right heart catheterization and from a prospective
   cohort of 800 consecutive patients at a national university-affiliated
   tertiary center.
   Measurements and Main Results: The retrospective cohort had 664 patients
   with systolic heart failure (SHF) and 399 patients with diastolic heart
   failure (DHF), 12\% of whom were classified as Cpc-PH. The prospective
   cohort had 172 patients with SHF (14\% Cpc-PH) and 219 patients with DHF
   (12\% Cpc-PH). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.034) and the
   tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery
   pressure ratio (P = 0.015) predicted Cpc-PH in SHF. Younger age (P =
   0.004), valvular heart disease (P = 0.046), and the tricuspid annular
   plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure ratio
   predicted Cpc-PH in DHF (P = 0.016). Right ventricular pulmonary
   vascular coupling was worse in Cpc-PH patients (end-systolic elastance
   to effective arterial elastance {[}Ees/Ea.]: SHF: 1.05 +/- 0.25; P =
   0.002; DHF: 1.17 +/- 0.27; P = 0.027) than in those with isolated
   post-capillary PH (Ees/Ea: SHF: 1.52 +/- 0.51; DHF: 1.45 +/- 0.29).
   Conclusions: Cpc-PH is rare in chronic heart failure. Right ventricular
   pulmonary vascular coupling is poor in Cpc-PH and could be one
   explanation for dismal outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon (C) stocks in the forests of Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) participating countries
   have to be estimated and monitored to determine accurate financial
   incentives and compensation. The research estimated the distribution of
   C stock across the different pools and management regimes of tropical
   Sal forest in the Terai Arc Landscape of Nepal. It applied a field
   measurement-based forest inventory method combined with the best
   predictive allometric model available, to increase accuracy and
   precision. Shrub and litter C were estimated by destructive method and
   Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) up to a depth of 30 cm. Biomass data and
   samples were collected from 113 plots distributed throughout four
   different management regimes on 1.1 million ha of forest in the
   landscape. The estimated average C stock in aboveground biomass,
   belowground biomass, shrub, litter, SOC and total were 105.58 +/- 17.05,
   24.92 +/- 4.15, 0.23 +/- 0.06, 1.49 +/- 0.25, 96.53 +/- 8.76 and 228.76
   +/- 19.61 Mg ha(-1) respectively. The mass of total C stock varied from
   291.55 +/- 42.51 Mg ha(-1) in protected areas to 237.15 +/- 32.54 Mg
   ha(-1) in community forests to 189.16 +/- 26.46 Mg ha(-1) in
   government-managed forests and to 126.76 +/- 56.36 Mg ha(-1) in other
   forests. These estimates of carbon stocks differed from earlier
   estimates based on biome-average datasets. They are consistent with
   those from similar forest type and site-specific earlier studies.
   Evidence of strong association of C stock with management regime
   provides valuable information for policy makers to make informed choice
   of management regime for the landscape. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{On-site minimization of excess sludge production is a relevant strategy
   for the operation of small-scale and decentralized wastewater treatment
   plants. In the study, we evaluated the potential of activated sludge
   systems equipped with side-stream reactors (SSRs). This study especially
   focused on how the sequential exposure of sludge to different aeration
   conditions in the side-stream reactors influences the overall
   degradation of sludge and of its specific fractions (active biomass,
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), EPS proteins, EPS
   carbohydrates). We found that increasing the solid retention time from
   25 to 40 and 80 days enhanced sludge degradation for all aeration
   conditions tested in the side-stream reactor. Also, the highest specific
   degradation rate and in turn the lowest sludge production were achieved
   when maintaining aerobic conditions in the side-stream reactors. The
   different sludge fractions in terms of active biomass (quantified based
   on adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) measurements), EPS proteins and EPS
   carbohydrates were quantified before and after passage through the SSR.
   The relative amounts of active biomass and EPS to volatile suspended
   solids (VSS) did not changed when exposed to different aeration
   conditions in the SSRs, which indicates that long SRT and starvation in
   the SSRs did not promote the degradation of a specific sludge fraction.
   Overall, our study helps to better understand mechanisms of enhanced
   sludge degradation in systems operated at long SRTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{CFRP structural elements are prone to failure initiating from defects.
   While defects are expected after damage has occurred, flaws and voids
   can already be present after manufacturing. To study the criticality of
   such defects, CFRP cylinders have been manufactured from a lay-up that
   was designed to predict damage mode and to allow for controlled damage
   growth under torsional load. FEA simulations of defect-free and flawed
   cylinder models were performed to first ply/interface failure. X-ray
   computed tomography revealed that cylinders manufactured with different
   finishing had a completely different void content and distribution.
   Simulations of failure, using finite element models, for the two classes
   of void distribution are corroborated by experimental results for the
   ultimate load, and damage initiation from manufacturing flaws is
   confirmed. Digital speckle pattern interferometry was used to identify
   flaws using thermal and mechanical loading, while infrared thermography
   and thermoelastic stress analysis were used to identify possible failure
   initiation sites and monitor the failure process and damage growth,
   whilst the specimen was loaded in torsion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Despite interesting potential for heat recovery and efficiency
   improvement that supersonic ejectors can bring to energy consuming
   systems, their successful use in industrial applications strongly
   depends on high performing designs. In order to reach this objective, an
   attempt is made to bridge the gap between available performance
   enhancement techniques and the complex physics of supersonic ejector
   internal flow structure. A new methodology, based on CFD simulations is
   thereby developed. It minimises the irreversible energy losses resulting
   from the formation of strong shock waves, the ultimate aim being to
   optimize ejector operation with a minimum number of simulation runs. The
   usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated on two different test
   cases showing under the same operating conditions, the performance of a
   base case ejector tested in the laboratory and an alternative design
   based on the proposed approach. The CFD model used for this purpose was
   previously developed and experimentally validated over a wide range of
   conditions. The results obtained in terms of entrainment and compression
   ratios show improvements of up to 29\% on ejector performance. Crown

Abstract = {{The growth mode, electronic structure, and thermal stability of Ni
   nanoparticles on thin ZrO2(111) film surfaces were investigated using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron
   spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction. Stoichiometric
   ZrO2(111) thin films with thickness of 3 nm were epitaxially grown on a
   Pt(111) single-crystal surface. The results indicate that the growth of
   Ni vapor deposited on thin ZrO2(111) films follows two-dimensional
   growth up to 0.5 ML (monolayer), followed by three-dimensional growth
   (i.e., the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode). The Ni 2p(3/2) binding
   energy (BE) increases with decreasing Ni coverage. We used the Auger
   parameter method to differentiate the contributions to this BE shift
   from the initial-state and final-state effects. The main contribution to
   the Ni 2p core level BE shift is made by the final-state effect.
   However, at low Ni coverages, the initial-state effect also contributes.
   This suggests that at the initial stage of Ni growth on the ZrO2(111)
   surface, Ni and ZrO2 interact strongly, leading to charge transfer from
   Ni to the ZrO2 substrate, with the appearance of partially positively
   charged Ni delta+. Thermal stability studies of Ni/ZrO2(111) model
   catalysts with two different coverages (0.05 and 0.5 ML) indicate
   further oxidation of Ni to Ni2+ and concurrent diffusion of Ni into the
   ZrO2 substrate at elevated temperatures. These findings provide an
   atomic-level fundamental understanding of the interactions between Ni
   with ZrO2, which is essential for identifying the structures of real
   ZrO2-supported Ni catalysts.}},

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{140-148}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Continental crust formed billions of years ago but cannot be explained
   by a simple evolution of primary mantle magmas. A multi-step process is
   required that likely includes re-melting of wet metamorphosed basalt at
   high pressures. Such a process could occur at depth in oceanic crust
   that has been thickened by a large magmatic event. In Central America,
   variations in geologically inferred, pre-existing oceanic crustal
   thickness beneath the arc provides an excellent opportunity to study its
   effect on magma storage, re-melting of meta-basalts, and the potential
   for creating continental crust. We use surface waves derived from
   ambient noise tomography to image 6\% radially anisotropic structures in
   the thickened oceanic plateau crust of Costa Rica that likely represent
   deep crustal melt sills. In Nicaragua, where the arc is forming on
   thinner oceanic crust, we do not image these deep crustal melt sills.
   The presence of these deep sills correlates with more felsic arc outputs
   from the Costa Rican Arc suggesting pre-existing thickened crust
   accelerates processing of primary basalts to continental compositions.
   In the Archean, reprocessing thickened oceanic crust by subsequent
   hydrated hotspot volcanism or subduction zone volcanism may have
   similarly enhanced formation of early continental crust. This mechanism
   may have been particularly important if subduction did not initiate
   until 3 Ga. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A calibration set comprises the multidimensional space that represents
   the samples for prediction. The representative ability of a calibration
   set is a major factor that affects the predictive performance of a
   multivariate regression. A new reference value (YR)-based
   sample-selection algorithm that assembles a dependent value (y-value)
   uniform distribution is presented to assure the representation. The
   existing typical sample-selection algorithm is used for comparison. A
   set of soy sauce data is used as a set of typical samples that have a
   complex solution. Comparing the prediction results, it is shown that YR
   sample-selection has similar prediction performance to that of sample
   set partitioning based on joint x-y distances (SPXY), but with a simpler
   algorithm. The calibration models of the y-reference-included sample
   sets (SPXY and YR) are more accurate than those of y-reference-excluded
   sample sets (RS and KS). After modeling with the selected representative
   samples, the performances of YR and SPXY are comparable to that of full
   sample modeling with fewer samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The mammalian Sorting Nexin 9 (Snx9) family consists of three paralogs:
   Snx9, Snx18 and Snx33. Most of the published literature to date has
   centered on the role of Snx9 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME).
   Snx9 contains an Sh3 domain at its N-terminus and has been shown to
   interact with Dynamin and actin nucleation factors via this domain. In
   addition to the Sh3 domain, Snx9 also contains a C-terminal BAR domain.
   BAR domains are known to sense and/or induce membrane curvature. In
   addition to endocytosis, recent studies have implicated the Snx9 family
   in diverse processes such as autophagy, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis
   and mitosis. The Snx9 family is encoded by a single gene in Drosophila
   called sh3px1. In this report, we present our initial characterization
   of sh3px1. We found that depletion of Sh3px1 from Drosophila Schneider 2
   (S2) cells resulted in defective lamellipodia formation. A similar
   phenotype has been reported upon depletion of Scar, the actin nucleation
   factor implicated in forming lamellipodia. In addition, we demonstrate
   that over-expression of Sh3px1 in S2 cells results in the formation of
   tubules as well as long protrusions. Formation of these structures
   required the C-terminal BAR domain as well as the adjacent Phox homology
   (PX) domain of Sh3px1. Furthermore, efficient protrusion formation by
   Sh3px1 required the actin nucleation factor Wasp. Tubules and
   protrusions were also generated upon over-expressing the mammalian
   orthologs Snx18 and Snx33 in S2 cells. By contrast, over-expressing Snx9
   mostly induced long tubules.}},

Abstract = {{A correct diagnosis and a proper treatment may yield a rapid and simple
   cure for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Although the
   Gufoni maneuver is widely used to treat apogeotropic horizontal-canal
   BPPV (HC-BPPV), few studies have clarified the relationship between the
   speed and intensity of maneuver execution and successful canalith
   reposition. To evaluate the effect of accelerated execution of the
   Gufoni maneuver, a prospective randomized controlled study was conducted
   with HC-BPPV patients in a single dizziness clinic. The patients had
   been diagnosed with apogeotropic HC-BPPV and were undergoing treatment
   at the dizziness clinic of a tertiary university hospital from January
   2013 to August 2014. Two groups were treated with the maneuver performed
   at different speeds and the resolution rate was compared. The
   accelerated maneuver group was subjected to faster position changing
   within 1 s during the reposition maneuver, while the non-accelerated
   maneuver group underwent slower maneuvers. Therapeutic efficacy was
   defined as dizziness relief or resolution of nystagmus within 1 h. Fifty
   patients with apogeotropic HC-BPPV were enrolled and treated with the
   Gufoni maneuver in two groups of 25 patients. The overall resolution
   rate was 48\% (24 of 50; p = 1.00), regardless of acceleration. Our
   results suggest that a faster, more intense execution of the Gufoni
   maneuver provides little benefit in treating apogeotropic HC-BPPV.
   Detachment of the otolith from the cupula or the gravitational force
   when the otolith is in the anterior arm of the HC-may be more important
   contributors to treatment efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Modeling and parametric analysis of nitrogen and sulfur oxide removal
   from oxy-combustion flue gas using a single column absorber}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{178-188}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Oxy-coal combustion has great potential as one of the major CO2 capture
   technologies for power generation from coal. In oxy-coal combustion, the
   oxygen source is a high concentration oxygen stream and the product flue
   gas consists primarily of CO2 and H2O with contaminants like nitrogen
   oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOX) and non-condensable gases like argon,
   oxygen and nitrogen. NOX and SOX removal can be achieved via traditional
   selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and flue gas desulfurization (FGD).
   These traditional methods however result in relatively high capital cost
   and energy requirement and face complex material handling challenges.
   White et al. proposed a different approach to NOX/SOX removal based on
   the nitric acid and lead-chamber chemistry process (White et al., 2010).
   This two-column design utilizes an intermediate and a high-pressure
   reactive absorption column connected in series to respectively remove
   SOX and NOX from the high CO2-concentration flue gas. In this study, we
   propose a modification to this two-column process that achieves the
   complete removal of SOX and NOX from the CO2 stream in a single column.
   We demonstrate by means of pressure sensitivity studies that this new
   design can meet the same separation targets as the two-column process in
   fewer column stages and half the feed water requirement by exploiting
   the pressure dependence of the rate determining NO oxidation reaction.
   Furthermore, we make use of parametric studies to analyze the dependence
   of NOX/SOX removal on key design and operating parameters for the
   proposed system: pressure, vapor hold-upper stage and water flow rate.
   Results show that the process is strongly pressure dependent, with a
   3-order of magnitude decrease in required residence time when the
   operating pressure is varied from 4 bars to 30 bars. Vapor holdup volume
   and feed water flow rate have a significant impact on NOX/SOX removal up
   to a point - about 20 m(3) and 2 kg/s respectively for the case
   analyzed. Beyond these values, column performance shows substantially
   less sensitivity to increasing holdup volume or water flow rate. The
   analysis presented in this paper also shows that recycling bottoms
   liquid can reduce the feed water requirement by up to 40\% without
   significantly affecting the exit gas purity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Missing heritability is a common problem in genome-wide association
   studies in complex diseases/traits. To quantify the unbiased
   heritability estimate, we applied the phenotype correlation-genotype
   correlation regression in psoriasis genome-wide association data in Han
   Chinese which comprises 1139 cases and 1132 controls. We estimated that
   45.7\% heritability of psoriasis in Han Chinese were captured by common
   variants (s.e. = 12.5\%), which reinforced that the majority of
   psoriasis heritability can be covered by common variants in genome-wide
   association data (68.2\%). The results provided evidence that the
   heritability covered by psoriasis genome-wide genotyping data was
   probably underestimated in previous restricted maximum likelihood
   method. Our study highlights the broad role of common variants in the
   etiology of psoriasis and sheds light on the possibility to identify
   more common variants of small effect by increasing the sample size in
   psoriasis genome-wide association studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{339}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stromal cells including those from adipose tissue (MSCs)
   regulate angiogenesis in adult tissues. MicroRNAs (miRs), small
   noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by binding to target mRNAs,
   reducing their stability and/or inhibiting translation, appear to be
   important regulators of blood vessel growth. In this study, we examined
   the impact of angio-miRs on paracrine activities of MSCs. Using Illumina
   microarrays we found that miR-92a is one of the most abundant angio-miRs
   in human MSCs. We transfected MSC with pre-miR-92a or anti-miR-92a which
   led to the coordinated changes of known miR-92a target mRNA levels. Then
   we tested the ability of conditioned medium from transfected cells to
   stimulate tube formation by HUVECs. MSC overexpressing miR-92a
   completely lost the ability to stimulate tubes formation by endothelial
   cells. However, knocking-out miR-92a by transfection with anti-miR-92a
   did not increase the ability of MSC to stimulate tube formation.
   Secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and angiopoetin-1 was
   significantly lower in the medium of miR-92a overexpressing MSC, whereas
   VEGF secretion did not change significantly. The replenishment of HGF
   but not angio-poietin-1 has restored the ability of conditioned medium
   from miR-92a overexpressing MSC to stimulate the tube formation. We
   conclude that overexpression of miR-92a in MSC suppresses angiogenic
   properties of these cells by down-regulation of HGF secretion. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Estrogenic activity of 12 sediment samples from Liaohe River protected
   areas was evaluated by the recombinant yeast bioassays. The
   bioassay-derived 17 beta-estradiol equivalents of crude extracts
   (Bio-EEQ(crude)S) were between 52.2 and 207.6 pg/g dry weight. The most
   concerned estrogenic receptor (ER) agonists including estrone (El), 17
   beta-estsadiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2),
   4-nonylphenols (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), and organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs) were determined. The concentrations of El, E2, E3, EE2, BPA, and
   Sigma-100CPs ranged up to 2033 pg/g, 185.8 pg/g, 237.7 pg/g, 188.5 pg/g,
   51.0 ng/g, and 3.6 ng/g, respectively. Taken together with
   polarity-based fractionation, in vitro bioassay and chemical analysis,
   it indicated that El, E2, and EE2 were the predominant ER agonists and
   were mainly from the discharge of domestic wastewater and breeding
   wastewater. Meanwhile, this study showed that the establishment of
   protected areas had not obviously reduced the ecological risk caused by
   ER agonists in Liaohe River protected areas sediments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There are various synthetic methods known for the synthesis of gold
   nanoparticles (GNPs); however, they possess potential environmental as
   well as biological risks. In addition to this, the methods are
   characterized by very low efficiency. Herein, we report a simple novel
   method for the synthesis of GNPs from chloroauric acid using bromelain
   (a cysteine protease) as a reducing as well as capping agent. GNPs of
   desired sizes were obtained by altering the concentration of bromelain
   and the temperature of incubation. Monodispersed GNPs with low size
   distribution (i.e. 8.59-12.92 nm) were produced using 0.33 mg/mL of
   bromelain at 40 degrees C. On the other hand, the sizes of GNPs
   increased with increase in both the concentration of bromelain and
   incubation temperature. Moreover, GNPs synthesized by this method are
   stable for several months at room temperature of the reaction. Thus,
   this method offers an environmentally friendly, single-step approach for
   fabricating different sizes of stable GNPs which have great potential in
   the commercial-scale manufacturing of nanopartides. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{652-664}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical model is developed for geometrically and materially
   nonlinear analysis of thin rectangular plates subjected to transverse
   mechanical loads and exposed to non-uniform thermal gradients over their
   depth. The geometrical nonlinearity is based on the von Kgrman type of
   large deformation theory. The material nonlinearity arises from
   degradable material behaviour at elevated temperatures. The temperature
   distribution is obtained numerically for two common types of fire
   exposure conditions that could occur in a fire compartment including: an
   exponential ``short hot{''} fire leading to a high temperature over a
   relatively short duration; and an exponential ``long cool{''} fire of
   lower temperature over a longer duration. Two types of support
   conditions are considered for the plate based on assuming that in-plane
   displacements are either restrained or unrestrained against lateral
   translation. Several numerical examples including two examples for
   functionally graded plates are presented to assess the accuracy and
   performance of the proposed method. The evolution of the true shape of
   the compressive zone supporting tensile membrane action in laterally
   unrestrained plates under large displacements is graphically illustrated
   for the two non-uniform thermal gradients, It is shown that the effect
   of the short hot fire on the plate behaviour is more pronounced. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Animal experiment studies have revealed a positive
   association between intake of citrus fruits and bone health. Nomilin, a
   limonoid present in citrus fruits, is reported to have many biological
   activities in mammalian systems, but the mechanism of nomilin on bone
   metabolism regulation is currently unclear.
   Purpose: To reveal the mechanism of nomilin on osteoclastic
   differentiation of mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs)
   and the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line into osteoclasts.
   Study design: Controlled laboratory study. Effects of nomilin on
   osteoclastic differentiation were studied in in vitro cell cultures.
   Methods: Cell viability of RAW 264.7 cells and BMMs was measured with
   the Cell Counting Kit. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted
   as osteoclast cell numbers. The number and area of resorption pits were
   measured as bone-resorbing activity. Osteoclast-specific genes
   expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR; and proteins
   expression was evaluated by western blot.
   Results: Nomilin significantly decreased TRAP-positive multinucleated
   cell numbers compared with the control, and exhibited no cytotoxicity.
   Nomilin decreased bone resorption activity. Nomilin downregulated
   osteoclast-specific genes, NFATc1 and TRAP mRNA levels. Furthermore,
   nomilin suppressed MAPK signaling pathways.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates clearly that nomilin has inhibitory
   effects on osteoclastic differentiation in vitro. These findings
   indicate that nomilin-containing herbal preparations have potential
   utility for the prevention of bone metabolic diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bacterial resistance mediated by metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) is a
   major problem for the treatment of infections. An MBL inhibitor could
   restore the potency of beta-lactam antibiotics. Fragment-based design
   might deliver valuable starting points for the discovery of novel MBL
   inhibitors. In this study, we chose an in silico approach to search for
   fragments able to bind and inhibit NDM-1, VIM-1, and IMP-7. We used
   consensus docking to identify low molecular weight compounds from a
   commercially available library. Most promising compounds were evaluated
   in a sensitive fluorescence-based activity assay and by the orthogonal
   biophysical technique saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR. H-1-N-15
   chemical shift perturbation NMR was used to confirm the reversible
   binding and measure the dissociation constant of the most promising
   compound qualifying it as a high-quality starting point for further
   optimization. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ligand coupling reaction (LCR) of hypervalent pentacoordinate
   antimony compounds (Ar(n)Tol(5-n)Sb; Ar = p-tri-fluoromethylphenyl, Tol
   = p-methylphenyl; n = 0-5) was analyzed via the long-range-corrected
   density functional theory. Although previous experimental or
   computational investigations have suggested apical apical or equatorial
   equatorial coupling of Ar(n)Tol(5-n)Sb compounds, the present results
   lead to apical equatorial coupling. The biased experimental ratios of
   the coupling products, which were grounds for apical apical coupling,
   can be explained by the stability of the transition-state (TS) structure
   for the apical equatorial coupling, where n-pi{*} interaction plays an
   important role to the stabilization. We further investigated the
   potential energy surface of H5Sb, for which the intrinsic reaction
   coordinate (IRC) from the TS structure for LCR indicates the equatorial
   equatorial coupling. It is found that the valley-ridge transition occurs
   along the IRC near the TS structure and the transverse vibrational mode
   with imaginary frequency, orthogonal to the IRC, directs to the reactant
   structure corresponding to the apical equatorial coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Microglial activation is thought to be a key
   pathophysiological mechanism underlying disease activity in all forms of
   MS. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug with
   immunomodulatory properties that is widely used in the treatment of
   rheumatological diseases. In this series of experiments, we explore the
   effect of HCQ on human microglial activation in vitro and on the
   development of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in vivo.
   Methods: We activated human microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and
   measured concentrations of several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines
   in untreated and HCQ pretreated cultures. We investigated the effect of
   HCQ pretreatment at two doses on the development of EAE and spinal cord
   histology.
   Results: HCQ pretreatment reduced the production of pro-inflammatory
   (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-1
   receptor antagonist) cytokines in LPS-stimulated human microglia. HCQ
   pretreatment delayed the onset of EAE, and reduced the number of Iba-1
   positive microglia/macrophages and signs of demyelination in the spinal
   cords of HCQ treated animals.
   Conclusion: HCQ treatment reduces the activation of human microglia in
   vitro, delays the onset of EAE, and decreases the representation of
   activated macrophages/microglia and demyelination in the spinal cord of
   treated mice. HCQ is a plausible candidate for further clinical studies

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine changes in phenolic
   compounds during refining of rapeseed oil. In crude rapeseed oil,
   4-vinylsyringol (canolol) is the dominant phenolic compound, accounting
   for 85\% of total phenolics. Refining decreased the total amount of
   phenolic compounds by 90\%. NMR and MS analyses of edible rapeseed oil
   phenolic extracts identified 4-vinylsyringol dimer as the dominant
   phenolic compound. This phenolic compound appears to form through
   acid-catalyzed dimerization-aromatic substitution of 4-vinylsyringol
   monomers. Analysis of rapeseed oils from different stages of the
   refining process suggest that 4-vinylsyringol dimer forms during the
   neutralization phase, when H3PO4 acts as a catalyst, or during
   bleaching, when acid-activated bleaching earth acts as the catalyst.
   Whether 4-vinylsyringol forms during one or the other phase appears to
   depend on the phospholipid content of the crude oil. These insights may
   be useful for designing rapeseed oil refining processes that maximize
   levels of 4-vinylsyringol dimer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The effect of C-substituents on the topomerization mechanism, inversion

   theoretical study}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the degenerated Z,E-isomerization (topomerization) and
   the electronic structure of the imines R2C=NR' (R = NMe2, CF3, CO2Me,
   SMe, Me, OMe, F, CN, COMe; R' = Me, i-Pr, t-Bu) have been investigated
   with the DFT method (B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)) in terms of NBO. It has been
   established that the topomerization of N-alkylimines passes through the
   inversion mechanism independently of C-substituent type (with the minor
   contribution of rotational component in individual cases). By means of
   the correlation analysis it was shown that interactions of the lone pair
   of the nitrogen atom with orbitals of C-substituents (nN ->
   sigma{*}(C-R) and nN <-> sigma(C-R)) have the main influence on the
   value of the inversion barrier (Delta E-i(not equal)) in the ground
   state. The increase of the energies of nN -> sigma{*}(C-R) interactions
   or the difference between energies of nN -> sigma{*}(C-R) and nN <->
   sigma(C-R) interactions leads to reduction of the Delta E-i(not equal)
   value, shortening of the C=N bond, and promotes the inversion mechanism
   of the topomerization. The charge on the nitrogen atom mainly depends on
   conjugation effect of C-substituents, whereas the charge on the
   imino-carbon atom depends on their electronegativity (inductive effect).
   The increase of electronegativity of groups of the 2nd period elements
   at the imino-carbon atom leads to the raise of the positive charge on
   the imino-carbon atom whereas the increase of electronegativity of
   carbon-containing groups leads to the decrease of the positive charge.
   At the same time, the positive charges on the imino-carbon atoms for the
   imines with the mentioned C-substituents correlate with the values of
   chi-, sigma(i)-, sigma(R)-, sigma(P)-constants according to various
   linear dependences. These dependences differ in the sign and in the
   value of slope. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present work aims to investigate the effects of the addition of
   waste cooking oil (WCO) on heavy crude oil biodegradation and microbial
   enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) using Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4. Growth
   kinetics show Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4 had a maximum dry cell weight of
   1.73 g/L and cellsurface hydrophobicity of 62.4\% against n-hexadecane
   when degraded the crude oil with the addition of WCO. The maximum
   rhamnolipid concentration was 6.87 g/L, and the culture broth exhibited
   a higher emulsification efficiency of 58.3\% on n-hexadecane and reduced
   the surface tension of broth to 22.7 mN/m. Meanwhile, Pseudomonas sp.
   SWP-4 reduced the viscosity of crude oil from 26,300 mPas to 550 mPa s
   (40 degrees C) and successfully degraded most of the n-alkanes.
   Furthermore, the fluidity of oil had been well improved after
   degradation. It can be concluded that not only could WCO stimulate the
   bacterial growth, but also it could enhance the crude oil degradation.
   Core displacement experiment demonstrates the efficiency of water
   flooding was just 5.8\%, but the microbial flooding produced by
   Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4 with the addition of WCO effectively improved the
   oil recovery further with an additional oil recovery efficiency of
   24.4\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   complex systems based on the integration of regulatory network and niche
   construction theories. It is designed to apply equally to cases of
   biological, social and cultural evolution. Within the conceptual
   framework we focus especially on the transformation of complex networks
   through the linked processes of externalization and internalization of
   causal factors between regulatory networks and their corresponding
   niches and argue that these are an important part of evolutionary
   explanations. This conceptual framework extends previous evolutionary
   models and focuses on several challenges, such as the path-dependent
   nature of evolutionary change, the dynamics of evolutionary innovation

Abstract = {{A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is often associated with dilation or
   aneurysm of the ascending aorta (AA) despite of absence of significant
   valve dysfunction. Bicuspid aortopathy and consequent aortic stiffness
   may adversely affect left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. This
   study aimed to investigate the impact of global and regional aortic
   mechanical function on LV diastolic function in subjects with BAY.
   Fifty-six subjects with BAV (45 men, mean age 52 +/- 13 years) without
   significant valve dysfunction and 56 age- and gender-matched controls
   with tricuspid aortic valve were studied. The aortic phenotypes were
   classified into 3 groups: normal shape, predominant dilatation of the
   sinus. of Valsalva, and predominant dilatation of the AA. Structural and
   functional parameters of the AA and LV were measured using 2-dimensional
   echocardiography. Global aortic mechanical function was assessed by
   radial artery tonometry. The subjects with BAV showed a higher incidence
   of a predominant AA phenotype (53.6\% vs 17.9\%, p <0.001), larger
   indexed aortic diameters, increased augmentation index, lower pulse
   pressure amplification, lower early diastolic mitral annular (e')
   velocity, and higher E/e' than those with tricuspid aortic valve. The e'
   velocity and E/e' varied with different aortic phenotypes in subjects
   with BAV. Correlations between e' velocity and parameters of aortic
   stiffness were stronger in subjects with BAY than those in controls.
   Multiple regression analysis revealed that augmentation index normalized
   for a heart rate of 75 beats/min was an independent determinant of e'
   velocity (beta = -0.24, p = 0.044) and E/e' (beta = 0.30, p = 0.018) in
   subjects with BAY even after controlling for confounding factors. LV
   diastolic function is closely related to aortic phenotype and mechanical
   alteration in subjects with BAY. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Evolution of the vertebrate skull is developmentally constrained by the
   interactions among its anatomical systems, such as the dermatocranium
   and the sensory system. The interaction between the dermal bones and
   lateral line canals has been debated for decades but their morphological
   integration has never been tested. An ontogenetic series of 97 juvenile
   and adult Amia calva (Actinopterygii) was used to describe the
   patterning and modularity of sensory lateral line canals and their
   integration with supporting cranial bones. Developmental modules were
   tested for the otic canal and supratemporal commissure by computing
   correlations in the branching sequence of groups of pores. Landmarks
   were digitized on 25 specimens to test a priori hypotheses of
   variational and developmental modularity at the level of canals and
   dermal bones. Branching sequence suggests a specific patterning
   supported by significant positive correlations in the sequence of
   appearance of branches between bilateral sides. Differences in
   patterning between the otic canal and the supratemporal commissure and
   tests of modularity with geometric morphometrics suggest that both
   canals form distinct modules. The integration between bones and canals
   was insufficient to detect a module. However, both components were not
   independent. Groups of pores tended to disappear without affecting other
   groups of pores suggesting that they are quasi-independent units acting
   as modules. This study provides evidence of a hierarchical organization
   for the modular sensory system that could explain variation of pattern
   of canals among species and their association with dermal bones. J. Exp.

Abstract = {{The wide band gap of boron nitride (BN) materials has been a major
   bottleneck for a wider application of BN in electronics. In this work,
   density functional theory computations were used to study the band
   structure of zigzag BN nanoribbons (BNNRs). Due to the ionic origin of
   the BN band gap, a heterogeneous edge decoration is an effective way to
   modulate the electronic band structure of BNNRs. This study demonstrates
   that a metallic behavior and magnetism can be realized by applying a
   NO2-NH2 pair edge decoration. Although the lone electron pair of the NH2
   group is partly responsible for the metallic behavior, the effective
   potential difference induced by the donor-acceptor pair is also crucial
   for metallic behavior. Furthermore, these newly formed BNNRs were found
   to be more stable than H-passivated BNNRs. This simple chemical
   modification method offers great opportunities for the development of
   future BNNR-based electronic devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of activated carbon derived from sargassum (SAC), normally
   disposed as waste, has been examined as potential catalyst for selective
   catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (NH3-SCR) in the temperature range of
   50-250 degrees C. The influence of important process variables, such as
   preparation methods, phosphoric acid impregnation ratios and surface
   nitrogen functional groups, were investigated. The impacts of water
   (H2O) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on the SCR activity of the C/SAC-2/U-6
   catalyst were also discussed. An array of analytical techniques,
   including Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET), Elemental Analysis (EA),
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) were also employed to study the structural
   properties, elemental content, and distribution of nitrogen-containing
   groups of the catalyst prepared. Experimental results suggested that the
   urea modified C/SAC-2/U-6 sample exhibited higher NOx conversion, better
   N-2 selectivity and broader operation temperature window than all the
   SAC samples and the commercial activated carbon sample. Moreover, it has
   good water and sulfur tolerance, making the sargassum derived catalyst
   as a promising NH3-SCR catalyst for NOx emission from fired power plant.

   based on bioelectrocatalysis at molecularly imprinted polymer film

Abstract = {{A new strategy for the sensitive detection of kanamycin (KA) and other
   antibiotics based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and
   bioelectrocatalysis was developed in the present study. The
   KA-polypyrrole MIP films were electropolymerized on the surface of
   pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes, with pyrrole (PY) serving as the
   monomer and KA as the template. Because KA is electro-inactive,
   electroactive K-3{[}Fe(CN)(6)] was used as the probe in the cyclic
   voltammetric (CV) measurements. The difference of the CV reduction peaks
   of K-3{[}Fe(CN)(6)] at electrodes between the MIP films after KA removal
   and KA-rebinding MIP films could thus be used to determine KA
   quantitatively. When horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H2O2 were added
   into the testing solution, the detection sensitivity of the system was
   greatly amplified because the electrochemical reduction of H2O2 could be
   catalyzed by HRP and mediated by K-3{[}Fe(CN)(6)]. With the
   bioelectrocatalysis amplification, the limit of detection (LOD) for KA
   fell as low as 28 nM, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than
   that for the MIP films in the absence of enzymatic catalysis. The
   strategy demonstrated the generality. Not only KA but also other
   antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline (OTC), could be determined by this
   method. More significantly, in addition to the K-3{[}Fe(CN)(6)]-HRP-H2O2
   system, other bioelectrocatalysis systems, such as
   Fc(COOH)(2)-GOD-glucose (Fc (COOH)(2)=ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, GOD =
   glucose oxidase), could also be used to amplify the CV signal and
   realize the sensitive detection of KA for the MIP film system, thereby
   illustrating the great potential and prospects of the strategy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Thin alpha-Fe2O3 films have been grown on vertically aligned titania
   nanotube (VA-TNT) arrays through atomic layer deposition to effectively
   collect charge carriers and meanwhile to enhance light absorption when
   used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Extensive
   electron microscopy analyses reveal that alpha-Fe2O3 was conformally
   deposited on both the inner and outer walls of the TNTs, forming a
   sandwich structure. Impedance spectroscopy measurement shows that the
   series resistance and interface resistance between titania and
   alpha-Fe2O3 are small, only ca. 1.2 and 20.8 Omega cm(-2), respectively.
   Consequently, the VA-TNT array attached to the titanium substrate can
   serve as an efficient current collector to promote the separation of
   photo-generated carriers. A photocurrent of ca. 1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V
   versus RHE and a hole density of ca. 2.3 x 10(19) cm(-3) have been

Abstract = {{The plasma scald damage is the most typical laser damage morphology
   presented on the laser conditioned HfO2/SiO2 mirrors. In order to
   provide guidance for defining the acceptance quantitative specification
   for the plasma scald on these laser conditioned mirrors, the simulations
   about the downstream beam modulations of the plasma scald are
   investigated based on its damage characteristics and the diffraction
   theory. The single plasma scald with the typical size, induced by the
   laser conditioning, can hardly cause damage to the downstream optics and
   its influence on the beam contrast can be reduced easily with the
   increment of the propagation distance. Those with small size and large
   depth, or those with big size and shallow depth can also hardly induce
   downstream damage, but the beam contrasts become worse with the
   increment of the size of the concave part as well as its depth. For a
   maximum plasma scald observed on the laser conditioned mirror, the
   intensity modulation peak is close to 1.3 and the beam contrast reaches
   to 25\% even at 2 m downstream from the mirror. For multi plasma scalds,
   more diffraction rings show up in the downstream beam and further
   decrease the overall uniformity of the beam. The uniformity of the beam
   gets worse as the number of the plasma scald is increased. When the
   density of the plasma scald with the typical size in these 1 omega
   HfO2/SiO2 mirrors reaches 20 per 1 cm(2), the beam contrast is less than
   6\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A screening of direct arylation conditions on a model small molecule
   system is carried out to develop suitable conditions for the direct
   arylation polymerization (DArP) of fluorinated copolymers, which are
   incompatible with conditions previously utilized successfully for
   nonfluorinated systems. The model system features a coupling between a
   2-substituted thiophene and a pentafluorobenzene, where one of the
   partners was brominated. A substantial difference in reactivity is
   observed, demonstrating that the optimal functionalization for direct
   arylation between a thiophene-based donor and a highly fluorinated
   acceptor is a halogenated thiophene and an unfunctionalized fluorinated
   unit, which is opposite of typical cross coupling reactions, where the
   acceptor is typically halogenated. The best conditions are applied to
   the copolymerization of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene and
   2,2'-(2,5-bis((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene. Polymers are
   free of -defects and significant homocoupling. This work further
   underscores the attractive simplicity, relevance, and ease of DArP while
   reconfirming its broad compatibility with increasingly popular
   fluorinated copolymers. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci.,

   morphological, optical and electrochemical properties using the X-ray
   diffraction study (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field
   emission scanning electron microscopy, UV vis spectroscopy and
   electrochemical spectroscopy. Along with these Raman spectroscopy and
   photoluminescence spectroscopy have been studied for understanding the
   characteristics vibrations of ZnSe and luminescence of ZnSe nanorods.
   FE-SEM shows the nanorods like morphology. Photoelectrochemical cell

Abstract = {{Calpain plays an important role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
   injury. PD150606, a nonpeptide, cell-permeable and noncompetitive
   calpain inhibitor, has be2n shown to have protective properties in
   ischemic disease. The aims of the present study were to investigate
   whether PD150606 could alleviate myocardial I/R injury and to examine
   the possible mechanisms involved. The I/R model was established in vivo
   in C57BL/6 mice and in vitro using neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes,
   respectively. To evaluate the protective effects of PD150606 on I/R
   injury, we measured the myocardial infarct area, apoptosis, and
   expression of cleaved caspase-3. We also investigated the underlying
   mechanisms by examining mitochondrial function as reflected by the ATP
   concentration, translocation of cytochrome c, dynamics of mPTP opening,
   and membrane potential (Delta Psi m), coupled with calpain activity.
   Pretreatment with PD150606 significantly reduced the infarct area and
   apoptosis caused by I/R. PD150606 pretreatment also reduced
   mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting calpain activation. Moreover, we
   found that mu-calpain is the main contributor to I/R-induced calpain
   activation. Knockdown of mu-calpain with siRNA significantly reversed
   calpain activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte
   apoptosis caused by I/R in vitro. Our results suggest that PD 150606 may
   protect against I/R injury via preventing mu-calpain-induced
   mitochondrial apoptosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although many strategies exist for fabricating hierarchical zeolite

   zeolite monolith with intracrystalline meso-/macropores and stability

   Here we describe a simple quasi-solid gel crystallization route to
   prepare hierarchical self-standing ZSM-5 zeolite monolith via the use of
   Na+ and OH- as counterions to modify the breaking and remaking of T-O-T
   (T = Si or Al) bonds. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microcopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), laser scan
   confocal microscopy (LSCM), N-2 adsorption desorption, mercury
   porosimetry, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
   compression mechanical testing were applied to elucidate the structure
   and mechanical stability of the obtained monolith. The self-standing
   monolith is composed of self-interconnected meso-/macroporous MFI
   crystals with tunable intracrystalline meso-/macropores and possesses an
   unusually mechanical stability with a crushing strength of 5.01 MPa.
   Combined with controllable structure of the defect-free membrane layer
   on the monolith top, the self-standing zeolite monolith should widen
   their potential applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{308-315}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Primitive meteorites are characteristically formed from an aggregation
   of sub-millimeter silicate spherules called chondrules. Chondrules are
   known to present large three-isotope oxygen variations, much larger than
   shown by any planetary body. We show here that the systematic of these
   oxygen isotopic variations results from open-system gas-melt exchanges
   during the formation of chondrules, a conclusion that has not been fully
   assessed up to now. We have considered Mg-rich porphyritic chondrules
   and have modeled the oxygen isotopic effects that would result from
   high-temperature interactions in the disk between precursor silicate
   dust and a gas enriched in SiO during the partial melting and
   evaporation of this dust. This formation process predicts: (i) a range
   of oxygen isotopic composition for bulk chondrules in agreement with
   that observed in Mg-rich porphyritic chondrules, and (ii) variable
   oxygen isotopic disequilibrium between chondrule pyroxene and olivine,
   which can be used as a proxy of the dust enrichment in the
   chondrule-forming region(s). Such enrichments are expected during shock
   waves that produce transient evaporation of dust concentrated in the
   mid-plane of the accretion disk or in the impact plumes generated during
   collisions between planetesimals. According to the present model,
   gas-melt interactions under high PSiO(gas) left strong imprints on the
   major petrographic, chemical and isotopic characteristics of Mg-rich
   porphyritic chondrules. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   fibroin-poly(3-hydroxybutyric-acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric-acid) (SF-PHBV)
   biodegradable coatings were grown by Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser
   Evaporation on titanium substrates. Their physicochemical properties and
   particularly the degradation behavior in simulated body fluid at 37
   degrees C were studied as first step of applicability in local
   controlled release for tissue regeneration applications.
   SF and PHBV, natural biopolymers with excellent biocompatibility, but
   different biodegradability and tensile strength properties, were
   combined in a composite to improve their properties as coatings for
   biomedical uses.
   FTIR analyses showed the stoichiometric transfer from targets to
   coatings by the presence in the spectra of the main absorption maxima
   characteristic of both polymers. XRD investigations confirmed the FTIR
   results showing differences in crystallization behavior with respect to
   the SF and PHBV content. Contact angle values obtained through
   wettability measurements indicated the MAPLE deposited coatings were
   highly hydrophilic; surfaces turning hydrophobic with the increase of
   the PHBV component. Degradation assays proved that higher PHBV contents
   resulted in enhanced resistance and a slower degradation rate of
   composite coatings in SBF. Distinct drug-release schemes could be
   obtained by adjusting the SF:PHBV ratio to controllably tuning the
   coatings degradation rate, from rapid-release formulas, where SF
   predominates, to prolonged sustained ones, for larger PHBV content. (C)

Title = {{Evaluation of a solar/UV annular pilot scale reactor for 24 h continuous

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{409-416}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A pilot scale single-pass continuous-flow annular photoreactor
   (r(annulus) = 21.3 mm) was designed and manufactured featuring a
   compound parabolic collector (CPC) to capture both direct and diffuse
   solar radiation and, simultaneously, artificial UVA lamps, in order to
   examine the possibility of working continuously day and night. Cheap,
   lightweight and easily shaped cellulose acetate materials, which are
   transparent in the TiO2 activation range, were used as supports, as an
   alternative to classic porous solid monolithic structures. Such
   configuration allows that only 1\% of the reactor volume is filled with
   photoactive material.
   The photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of n-decane (C-dec, (feed) = 10 ppm,
   Q(feed) = 2 L min(-1), tau = 44 s) over cellulose acetate monolithic
   structures coated with different TiO2-based photocatalytic films
   (L-catalytic (bed) = 144 cm) was studied under solar and artificial UVA
   radiation. Gas-phase n-decane conversions up to 100\% were attained
   using P25 or PC500 photocatalytic films under solar irradiances starting
   from 16 W-uv m(-2) in the morning (sunrise, increasing temperature) and
   down to 3 W-uv m(-2) in the afternoon (sunset, decreasing temperature).
   An increase of the UV irradiance at total n-decane conversion promotes
   the formation of CO2. The excess of photons reaching the photocatalytic
   bed favours the direct reaction pathway of CO2 generation. The PCO of
   n-decane enhanced 29\% resulting in 100\% of conversion using PC500 film
   instead of P25 film, under artificial UVA radiation (I = 29W m(-2)).
   Results indicate that combining both radiation sources, a 24 h
   continuous PCO process towards the removal of n-decane can be
   accomplished. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial genes and genomes have long been applied in phylogenetics.
   Current protocols to sequence mitochondrial genomes rely almost
   exclusively on long range PCR or on the direct sequencing. While long
   range PCR includes unnecessary biases, the purification of mtDNA for
   direct sequencing is not straightforward. We used total RNA extracted
   from liver and Illumine HiSeq technology to sequence mitochondrial
   transcripts from three fish (Ancistrus spp.) and assemble their
   mitogenomes. Based on the mtDNA sequence of a close related species, we
   estimate to have sequenced 92\%, 95\% and 99\% of the mitogenomes. Taken
   the sequences together, we sequenced all the 13 protein-coding genes,
   two ribosomal RNAs, 22 tRNAs and the D-loop known in vertebrate
   mitogenomes. The use of transcriptomic data allowed the observation of
   the punctuation pattern of mtRNA maturation, to analyze the
   transcriptional profile, and to detect heteroplasmic sites. The assembly
   of mtDNA from transcriptomic data is complementary to other approaches
   and overcomes some limitations of traditional strategies for sequencing
   mitogenomes. Moreover, this approach is faster than traditional methods
   and allows a clear identification of genes, in particular for tRNAs and
   rRNAs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evolution of stratospheric chemistry in the Saturn storm beacon region}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{149-168}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The giant northern-hemisphere storm that erupted on Saturn in December
   2010 triggered significant changes in stratospheric temperatures and
   species abundances that persisted for more than a year after the
   original outburst. The stratospheric regions affected by the storm have
   been nicknamed ``beacons{''} due to their prominent infrared-emission
   signatures (Fletcher, L.N. et al. {[}2011]. Science 332, 1413). The two
   beacon regions that were present initially merged in April 2011 to form
   a single, large, anticyclonic vortex (Fletcher, L.N. et al. {[}2012].
   Icarus 221, 560). We model the expected photochemical evolution of the
   stratospheric constituents in the beacons from the initial storm onset
   through the merger and on out to March 2012. The results are compared
   with longitudinally resolved Cassini/CIRS spectra from May 2011. If we
   ignore potential changes due to vertical winds within the beacon, we
   find that C2H2, C2H6, and C3H8 remain unaffected by the increased
   stratospheric temperatures in the beacon, the abundance of the
   shorter-lived CH3C2H decreases, and the abundance of C2H4 increases
   significantly due to the elevated temperatures, the latter most notably
   in a secondary mixing-ratio peak located near mbar pressures. The C4H2
   abundance in the model decreases by a factor of a few in the 0.01-10
   mbar region but has a significant increase in the 10-30 mbar region due
   to evaporation of the previously condensed phase. The column abundances
   of C6H6 and H2O above 30 mbar also increase due to aerosol evaporation.
   Model-data comparisons show that models that consider temperature
   changes alone under-predict the abundance of C2Hx species by a factor of
   2-7 in the beacon core in May 2011, suggesting that other processes not
   considered by the models, such as downwelling winds in the vortex, are
   affecting the species profiles. Additional calculations indicate that
   downwelling winds of order -10 cm s(-1) similar to 0.1 mbar need to be
   included in the photochemical models in order to explain the inferred
   C2Hx abundances in the beacon core, indicating that both strong
   subsiding winds and chemistry at elevated temperatures are affecting the
   vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents in the beacon. We (i)
   discuss the general chemical behavior of stratospheric species in the
   beacon region, (ii) demonstrate how the evolving beacon environment
   affects the species vertical profiles and emission characteristics (both
   with and without the presence of vertical winds), (iii) make predictions
   with respect to compositional changes that can be tested against Cassini
   and Herschel data, and higher-spectral-resolution ground-based
   observations of the beacon region, and (iv) discuss future measurements
   and modeling that could further our understanding of the dynamical
   origin, evolution, and chemical processing within these unexpected
   stratospheric vortices that were generated after the 2010 convective
   event. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports for the first time on the role of contaminant sodium
   to neutralize the acidic reaction products during the NOx photocatalytic
   reaction and prevent surface deactivation of TNTs (titanate nanotubes
   and their derived materials). TNTs were synthesized by the hydrothermal
   method and washed under different pH values. The materials were then
   characterized by SEM, TEM, BET, ICP, TPD, and XRD analyses. The
   photocatalytic oxidations of NO and NO2 were tested under the ambient
   condition to evaluate the activity of the materials. The results showed
   that the value of washing pH was an effective control factor for
   achieving TNTs with desired microstructure and physical-chemical
   properties. In the photocatalytic removals of NO and NO2, it revealed
   that both of the Na content and the structure of TNTs materials play
   important roles on the NOx removal pathway, initial efficiency and decay
   rate. The highest efficiencies were achieved by TNTs washed at pH 3-5
   (T-3-5), which may be due to their high amount of crystalline anatase
   for photocatalytic reaction and high sodium content for neutralization
   of acidic products. The mechanism based on the neutralization of the
   HNO3 resultant from the NOx photo-oxidation was also proposed. (C) 2015

   reactions in pyrolysis and combustion}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{339-345}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new kinetic model of thermal decomposition of pine
   branch, with unified kinetic descriptions of the major pyrolytic
   reactions in pyrolysis and combustion. Experiments for pine branch (PB)
   of Pinus sylvestris were performed by dynamic thermogravimetry in
   nitrogen and air atmospheres at heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 degrees
   C/min. The major pyrolytic mass losses in pyrolysis and combustion are
   interpreted as the sum of the volatilization due to consistent parallel
   reactions (1st order) of pseudo-components of cellulose, hemicellulose,
   and lignin. Consistent kinetic schemes with the same proportions of the
   three pseudo-components are used to simulate the pyrolytic reactions in
   pyrolysis and combustion. The oxidation of fixed carbon generated from
   the non-volatilizable component in the original material was simulated
   as the forth reaction in combustion. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and
   non-linear fitting algorithm are combined to optimize a set of kinetic
   parameters to fit the experimental data. The validity and reliability of
   the new kinetic models are verified by the good fit between the
   simulated and experimental derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a specific hybrid energy system was proposed for
   household applications. The hybrid energy system was assembled from a
   HT-PEM fuel cell stack supplied by hydrogen via a steam reformer, where
   finally the majority of produced electricity is used to drive a modified
   split heat pump system with heat recovery (that is enabled via standard
   modified accumulation boilers). The system is able to produce both high
   and low temperature heat output (in the form of hot water), cooling
   thermal output and electricity. Performance analysis was conducted and
   the specific hybrid energy system showed high value for overall energy
   efficiency, for the specific case examined it reached 250\%. Levelized
   Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis was also carried out and the proposed
   hybrid energy system's cost is expected to be between 0.09 (sic)/kW h
   and 0.16 (sic)/kW h, which is certainly competitive with the current
   retail electricity price for households on the EU market. Additionally,
   the system also has environmental benefits in relation to reduced CO2
   emissions, as estimated CO2 emissions from the proposed hybrid energy
   system are expected to be at around 9.0 gCO(2)/kW h or 2.6 times less
   than the emissions released from the utilization of grid electricity.

Abstract = {{Highly organized thick filaments in skeletal muscle cells are formed
   from similar to 300 myosin molecules. Each thick-filament-associated
   myosin molecule is thought to be constantly exchanged. However, the
   mechanism of myosin replacement remains unclear, as does the source of
   myosin for substitution. Here, we investigated the dynamics of myosin
   exchange in the myofibrils of cultured myotubes by fluorescent recovery
   after photo-bleaching and found that myofibrillar myosin is actively
   replaced with an exchange half-life of similar to 3 h. Myosin
   replacement was not disrupted by the absence of the microtubule system
   or by actomyosin interactions, suggesting that known cytoskeletal
   systems are dispensable for myosin substitution. Intriguingly, myosin
   replacement was independent of myosin binding protein C, which links
   myosin molecules together to form thick filaments. This implies that an
   individual myosin molecule rather than a thick filament functions as an
   exchange unit. Furthermore, the myosin substitution rate was decreased
   by the inhibition of protein synthesis, suggesting that newly
   synthesized myosin, as well as preexisting cytosolic myosin, contributes
   to myosin replacement in myofibrils. Notably, incorporation and release
   of myosin occurred simultaneously in myofibrils, but rapid myosin
   release from myofibrils was observed without protein synthesis.
   Collectively, our results indicate that myosin shuttles between
   myofibrils and the nonmyofibrillar cytosol to maintain a dynamic
   equilibrium in skeletal muscle cells.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{355}},
Pages = {{686-697}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic membranes are commonly used in drug release studies and are
   applied mostly in quality control. They contain pores through which the
   drug can be diffused directly into the receptor fluid. Investigation of
   synthetic membranes permits determination of their structure and
   characterization of their properties. We suggest that the preliminary
   characterization of the membranes can be relevant to the interpretation
   of the release results. The aim of this study was to compare eight
   synthetic membranes by using atomic force microscopy in order to predict
   and understand their behavior in the release experiments. The results
   proved that polytetrafluoroethylene membrane was not suitable for the
   release study of tetrapeptide due to its hydrophobic nature, thickness
   and the specific structure with high trapezoid shaped blocks. The
   additional substructures in pores of mixed cellulose esters and nylon
   membranes detected by AFM influenced the diffusion rate of the active
   compound. These findings indicate that the selection of the membrane for
   the release studies should be performed cautiously by taking into
   consideration the membrane properties and by analyzing them prior the
   experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{190-202}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In the last years, a growing interest about increasing the engine
   efficiency has led to the development of new engine technologies. The
   accurate determination of the heat transfer across the combustion
   chamber walls is highly relevant to perform a valid thermal balance
   while evaluating the potential of new engine concepts. Several works
   dealing with heat transfer correlations that consider the swirl motion
   are found in the literature; however, there is a lack of works dealing
   with heat transfer correlations which take into account the effect of
   the tumble movement. In this work, a heat transfer model accounting for
   the tumble motion is presented. A two stroke HSDI Diesel engine with
   high tumble and no swirl is used to perform the theoretical study, the
   model development and its final calibration. Initially, a theoretical
   analysis of the gas movement phenomena is carried out based on CFD
   results and then, a model is developed and calibrated based on a
   skip-fire testing technique. Finally, a sensitivity study focused on
   evaluating the model robustness is performed. The results confirm an
   average RMSE reduction of 70\% with respect to the Woschni model, being
   this consistent improvement qualitatively evidenced in the instantaneous
   heat transfer evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{METHODS}},

Abstract = {{Structural studies of viral proteins most often use high-resolution
   techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance,
   single particle negative stain, or cryo-electron microscopy (EM) to
   reveal atomic interactions of soluble, homogeneous viral proteins or
   viral protein complexes. Once viral proteins or complexes are separated
   from their host's cellular environment, their natural in situ structure
   and details of how they interact with other cellular components may be
   lost. EM has been an invaluable tool in virology since its introduction
   in the late 1940's and subsequent application to cells in the 1950's. EM
   studies have expanded our knowledge of viral entry, viral replication,
   alteration of cellular components, and viral lysis. Most of these early
   studies were focused on conspicuous morphological cellular changes,
   because classic EM metal stains were designed to highlight classes of
   cellular structures rather than specific molecular structures. Much
   later, to identify viral proteins inducing specific structural
   configurations at the cellular level, immunostaining with a primary
   antibody followed by colloidal gold secondary antibody was employed to
   mark the location of specific viral proteins. This technique can suffer
   from artifacts in cellular ultrastructure due to compromises required to
   provide access to the immuno-reagents. Immunolocalization methods also
   require the generation of highly specific antibodies, which may not be
   available for every viral protein. Here we discuss new methods to
   visualize viral proteins and structures at high resolutions in situ
   using correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We discuss the
   use of genetically encoded protein fusions that oxidize diaminobenzidine
   (DAB) into an osmiophilic polymer that can be visualized by EM. Detailed
   protocols for applying the genetically encoded photo-oxidizing protein
   MiniSOG to a viral protein, photo-oxidation of the fusion protein to
   yield DAB polymer staining, and preparation of photo-oxidized samples
   for TEM and serial block-face scanning EM (SBEM) for large-scale volume
   EM data acquisition are also presented. As an example, we discuss the
   recent multi-scale analysis of Adenoviral protein E4-ORF3 that reveals a
   new type of multi-functional polymer that disrupts multiple cellular
   proteins. This new capability to visualize unambiguously specific viral
   protein structures at high resolutions in the native cellular
   environment is revealing new insights into how they usurp host proteins
   and functions to drive pathological viral replication. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{757}},
Pages = {{216-224}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{IrO2 electrodes used as oxygen evolving anodes were studied by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to establish criteria for
   the assessment of their electroactive surface area and their intrinsic
   catalytic activity. Two types of IrO2-coated electrodes were used:
   anodically grown oxides on an It substrate and commercially available
   IrO2 nanoparticles, dispersed in a Nafion (R) polymer electrolyte layer
   on a glassy carbon substrate. EIS data indicate that both formulations
   behave as porous electrodes and their response can be described by
   variants of the classic transmission line model both at potentials
   outside and within the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential range;
   however, in the latter case, useful parameters could also be obtained by
   the use of common Randles models. An alternative approach to obtain
   capacitance values (free from the assumptions and geometric formulations
   of a model) has been based on plots of -1/(omega Z(Im)) vs. Z(re) that
   acquire or approach a limiting total capacitance value C-t at low or
   intermediate frequencies; the latter scales well with the charge
   associated with IrO2 surface electrochemistry and with oxide layer
   thickness or oxide particle loading. C-t can be taken as a measure of
   the catalyst electroactive surface area and the product RctCt (where
   R-ct is the OER charge transfer/polarization resistance) as the
   appropriate parameter to characterise the catalyst intrinsic catalytic
   activity. C-t can also be used to correct direct current vs. electrode
   potential OER data for electroactive surface area effects. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{122-137}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This work reports the results of real-time X-ray radiography of grain
   refined and unrefined Al-Si alloys solidified at the SPring-8
   synchrotron. The nucleation events were observed and the grain density
   and growth rate following nucleation were measured. Nucleation of the
   grain refined alloy samples occurred from the coolest to the hottest
   parts of the field of view in a sequence that mimicked a forward moving
   wave. No additional nucleation events occurred between the first
   nucleated grains and there was no evidence of grains being generated by
   fragmentation. Measurements of both grain density and growth rate show
   the effect of Si content and grain refiner (Al3Ti1B master alloy)
   additions on grain size. While the total number of grains increases in
   the alloys with added Al3Ti1B master alloy, the growth rates Lend to be
   slower. Furthermore, the growth rate for all alloy compositions
   fluctuates between slow and fast velocities during the initial stages of
   growth and then Lends towards a low steady state value. This decreasing
   trend is explained in terms of thermal and solutal field interactions
   between adjacent growing grains and subsequent grain impingement. These
   measurements result in a better understanding of the role of nucleation
   and solute content in influencing further nucleation and the subsequent
   change in the solid-liquid growth rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4220-4234}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a well-studied mechanism to
   internalize plasma membrane proteins; however, to endocytose such cargo,
   most eukaryotic cells also use alternative clathrin-independent
   endocytic (CIE) pathways, which are less well characterized. The budding
   yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a widely used model for studying CME,
   was recently shown to have a CIE pathway that requires the GTPase Rho1,
   the formin Bni1, and their regulators. Nevertheless, in both yeast and
   mammalian cells, the mechanisms underlying cargo selection in CME and
   CIE are only beginning to be understood. For CME in yeast, particular
   alpha-arrestins contribute to recognition of specific cargos and promote
   their ubiquitylation by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Rsp5.
   Here, we show that the same alpha-arrestin-cargo pairs promote
   internalization through the CIE pathway by interacting with CIE
   components. Notably, neither expression of Rsp5 nor its binding to
   a-arrestins is required for CIE. Thus, a-arrestins are important for
   cargo selection in both the CME and CIE pathways, but function by
   distinct mechanisms in each pathway.}},

   possesses several medicinal applications such as American taxa of
   Rhamnaceae species are toxic to insects, fungi and several bacteria

   alkaloids, phenolics and terpenes. A methanolic extract from the roots
   afforded 9 triterpenes belonging to lupane, oleanane, ursane, sterol and
   ceanothane groups. Our results indicate that these compounds are
   involved in interference of sclerotization and moulting. They showed
   selective effects on pre-emergence metabolism of selected insects
   including lepidoptera and diptera, but not to coleoptera. The results
   were fully comparable to known natural insect growth inhibitors such as
   azadirachtin, gedunin and Cedrela extract and have a possible role as
   natural insecticidal agents. To the best our knowledge, this is the
   first report of the isolation of ceanothane-type triterpenes from this
   plant species. The level of activity achieved by the assayed compounds

Abstract = {{Taphonomic analysis and X-ray micro-tomography (mu CT) were applied to
   Clypeaster specimens from the Miocene of Fuente del Jarro (Valencia,
   Spain). This enabled the identification of various preservational
   features, including encrustation, bioerosion, abrasion and
   post-depositional cracking. Approximately 15\% of the studied specimens
   were affected by encrusters and/or borers. Of particular interest was a
   single intensely-bored specimen preserving numerous cross-cutting
   bioerosion structures. These structures exhibit a distinctive morphology
   consisting of clavate or flask-shaped chambers with a circular to oval
   cross-section, a narrow neck region near the figure-of-eight-shaped
   aperture and a chimney extending outside the Clypeaster test. The
   excellent preservation and characteristic morphology, as revealed by the
   mu CT scan, coupled with the observation that (in some cases)
   articulated bivalve shells are still present within the chambers, allows
   for the identification of the tracemaker as the boring bivalve
   Rocellaria, reaffirming these tube-dwelling animals as borers, burrowers
   and crypt-builders. The trace fossils described herein are
   semi-endoskeletal dwellings, representing a combination of bioerosion
   through the plates of the echinoids, bioturbation in the form of
   burrowing into the sediment infill of the Clypeaster specimen and
   carbonate secretion resulting in a crypt. The morphologies of the
   different dwellings are influenced by the limited available space within
   the echinoid tests. This study confirms the importance of the relatively
   stable and thick Clypeaster shells as benthic islands in Cenozoic sandy
   littoral settings. The high degree of multiple colonizations, as well as
   the uniform orientation of the burrows, suggests a long-term stable
   position of this secondary substrate at or near the sediment surface.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with comparison of modified carbon electrodes prepared
   from Pt- and Ag-doped carbon microspheres using cyclic voltammetry of
   {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/{[}Fe(CN)(6)](4-) redox pair as a probe under various

   in average as evidenced by SEM showed slight influence of dopant nature
   onto their microstructure. FTIR analysis revealed that the involvement
   of metal species in the carbon structure was followed by their
   subsequent reduction and rising of oxidized carbon functionalities in
   the spectra. Electrochemical study showed that all the examined
   electrodes performed reversible processes with chemically stable
   generated products and no side chemical reactions. Among them, Pt-doped
   electrode showed superior electrocatalytic behavior in terms of
   heterogeneous transfer rate constant and other kinetic parameters. Since
   minimal addition of Pt in the hydrothermal synthesis resulted in
   powerful electrocatalytic effect as precious advantage, benevolent
   impact of carbon microspheres as catalyst support was put into focus of
   this research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a residential energy hub model for a smart
   multi-carrier energy home consisting of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
   (PHEV), combined heat and power (CHP), solar panels, and electrical
   storage system (ESS). The energy hub inputs are electricity and natural
   gas that provide electrical and heat demands at the output ports. In
   this paper, an optimization-based program is proposed to determine the
   optimal operation mode of the energy hub, to manage the energy
   consumption of responsive appliances, to schedule charging/discharging
   of PHEV and the storage system, and to coordinate solar panels operation
   with household responsive demand in response to day-ahead time-varying
   tariffs of electricity. The objective function is to minimize customer
   payment cost considering vehicle to grid (V2G) capability. Different
   case studies are conducted to probe the effectiveness of the proposed
   method and study the impacts of different electrical time-differentiated
   tariffs on the optimization results on daily and yearly basis. (C) 2015

   MnIn2Se4 the nature of its fundamental absorption edge is established.
   It is found that the lowest-energy-gap of this compound is

   eV in the temperature range from 10 K to room temperature. In addition,
   two allowed direct band-to-band transitions beginning at 1.72 and 1.85

   optical absorption processes between the uppermost Gamma(4)(z) and the
   middle Gamma(5)(x) valence bands and the conduction band respectively,
   are observed in the high energy range It is also found that the crystal
   field splitting parameter (Delta(cf)) of MnIn2Se4 is of about 0.15 eV
   nearly independent of the temperature. At energies around 2.2 eV a
   photoluminescence band related to internal transitions between d-excited

Abstract = {{The Drosophila oskar (osk) mRNA is unusual in having both coding and
   noncoding functions. As an mRNA, osk encodes a protein which is deployed
   specifically at the posterior of the oocyte. This spatially-restricted
   deployment relies on a program of mRNA localization and both repression
   and activation of translation, all dependent on regulatory elements
   located primarily in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA. The
   3' UTR also mediates the noncoding function of osk, which is essential
   for progression through oogenesis. Mutations which most strongly disrupt
   the noncoding function are positioned in a short region (the C region)
   near the 3' end of the mRNA, in close proximity to elements required for
   activation of translation. We show that Bicoid Stability Factor (BSF)
   binds specifically to the C region of the mRNA. Both knockdown of bsf
   and mutation of BSF binding sites in osk mRNA have the same
   consequences: Osk expression is largely eliminated late in oogenesis,
   with both mRNA localization and translation disrupted. Although the C
   region of the osk 3' UTR is required for the noncoding function, BSF
   binding does not appear to be essential for that function. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Pre-formed titanium dioxide nanoparticles were deposited onto hexagonal
   mesoporous supports in order to enhance the efficiency of these
   photocatalysts in oxidation reactions. To do so, well-calibrated TiO2
   nanoparticles synthesized by an acid sol-gel process (ACSG) were
   introduced using either incipient wetness impregnation method or a
   ``one-pot{''} procedure. The structure and texture of the resulting
   materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen
   adsorption-desorption measurements and TEM imaging. Detailed information
   on the nature and morphology of the TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by
   diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy, high angle XRD and TEM
   imaging. Most of the materials prepared displayed well-structured
   porosities with a good dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles with average
   diameters varying between 5 and 7 nm.
   The liquid phase photocatalytic oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde
   was selected in order to test the activity of the obtained materials.
   Newly prepared solids described here, especially the one based on the
   introduction of TiO2 colloids in the SBA-15 synthesis gel, showed a
   higher catalytic activity per titanium atom compared to the fresh TiO2
   colloids or the commercially available P-25 photocatalyst. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of persons living with
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased immensely. In parallel,
   rates of noncommunicable diseases, especially cardiovascular disease,
   are rising rapidly in resource-limited settings. This study aims to
   evaluate the relation between subclinical atherosclerosis and
   HIV-related and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-infected
   patients in rural South Africa.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed among HIV-infected
   patients visiting a health center in Limpopo, South Africa. Demographic
   and HIV-related information was collected, and cardiovascular risk was
   assessed. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) was measured and the
   prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis (CIMT >0.78 mm) was
   calculated. The association between cardiovascular or HIV-related
   determinants with CIMT was analyzed using linear and logistic regression
   models adjusted for age and sex.
   Results. The median CIMT in 866 subjects (median age {[}interquartile
   range], 41 {[}35-48] years; 69\% female) was 0.589 mm (interquartile
   range, 0.524-0.678 mm), and values seemed higher than in healthy Western
   reference populations. In fact 12\% of subjects (106 of 866) had
   subclinical atherosclerosis. Hypertension, high body mass index,
   previous cardiovascular event, diabetes mellitus, total and low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, metabolic
   syndrome, and the Framingham Heart Risk score were independently
   associated with CIMT. No HIV-related determinants were associated with
   CIMT.
   Conclusions. In a predominantly female HIV-infected population in South
   Africa, CIMT values are considerably high and associated with
   cardiovascular risk factors, rather than HIV-related factors. This
   finding emphasizes the need to screen for cardiovascular disease among
   persons with HIV infection in resource-limited settings. Ideally, this
   screening would be integrated into care for chronic HIV infection,
   posing a major challenge for the future.}},

Title = {{Differential contributions of the globus pallidus and ventral thalamus
   to stimulus-response learning in humans}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{233-245}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The ability to learn associations between stimuli, responses and rewards
   is a prerequisite for survival. Models of reinforcement learning suggest
   that the striatum, a basal ganglia input nucleus, vitally contributes to
   these learning processes. Our recently presented computational model
   predicts, first, that not only the striatum, but also the globus
   pallidus contributes to the learning (i.e., exploration) of
   stimulus-response associations based on rewards. Secondly, it predicts
   that the stable execution (i.e., exploitation) of well-learned
   associations involves further learning in the thalamus.
   To test these predictions, we postoperatively recorded local field
   potentials (LFPs) from patients that had undergone surgery for deep
   brain stimulation to treat severe movement disorders. Macroelectrodes
   were placed either in the globus pallidus or in the ventral thalamus.
   During recordings, patients performed a reward-based stimulus-response
   learning task that comprised periods of exploration and exploitation. We
   analyzed correlations between patients' LFP amplitudes and model-based
   estimates of their reward expectations and reward prediction errors.
   In line with our first prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during the
   presentation of rewards and reward omissions correlated with patients'
   reward prediction errors, suggesting pallidal access to reward-based
   teaching signals. Unexpectedly, the same was true for the thalamus. In
   further support of this prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during
   stimulus presentation correlated with patients' reward expectations
   during phases of low reward certainty -suggesting pallidal participation
   in the learning of stimulus-response associations. In line with our
   second prediction, correlations between thalamic stimulus-related LFP
   amplitudes and patients' reward expectations were significant within
   phases of already high reward certainty, suggesting thalamic
   participation in exploitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{BackgroundTranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has rapidly
   evolved to the standard-of-care for inoperable patients with severe,
   symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, and to an alternative treatment
   option for high-risk patients. However, the randomized PARTNER trial
   excluded patients with conditions frequently encountered in daily
   clinical practice.
   MethodsFrom 2006 to 2011, 467 high-risk patients, who underwent
   transfemoral TAVI (Edwards Sapien n = 166; Medtronic CoreValve n = 301)
   at two German centers were divided into a PARTNER-like (n = 227) and a
   Real-World cohort (n = 240), based on the original PARTNER trial in- and
   exclusion criteria. Differences in 30-day and 2-year mortality and
   morbidity were assessed.
   ResultsMean age of patients was 808 years with a logistic EuroSCORE of
   22 +/- 16\%. The most frequent exclusion criteria were previous PCI
   (15.4\%), prior valve surgery (13.7\%), chronic renal failure (12.0\%),
   and severe mitral regurgitation (10.8\%). Despite significant
   differences in baseline data, estimated perioperative mortality in terms
   of STS and logistic EuroScore was identical between both groups.
   However, patients in the Real-World cohort had a non-significant trend
   towards a higher 30-day mortality (10.0\% vs. 6.7\%, P = 0.088) and a
   significantly higher 2-year mortality (23.3\% vs. 14.5\%, P = 0.016)
   compared with patients of the PARTNER-like cohort.
   ConclusionPatients meeting PARTNER study exclusion criteria had an
   acceptable outcome at 30 days and 2 years, however, with significant
   differences to PARTNER-like patients. Still, our results indicate that
   also real-life patients with relevant comorbidities, who would have been
   excluded from the randomized PARTNER trials, benefit from TAVI with
   acceptable short- and long-term outcome. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The wetting of (0 0 0 1) 6H-SiC single crystals by molten Al was
   investigated using a dispensed sessile drop method in a high vacuum at
   973-1173 K. The wettability and reactivity in this system are sensitive
   to the surface polarity of SiC. The interfacial reaction on the
   Si-terminated surface is rapid. The formation of a continuous Al4C3
   product layer at the interface leads to an equilibrium contact angle of
   56 +/- 1 degrees at 1173 K. In comparison, the interfacial reaction on
   the C-terminated surface is sluggish. The interface is only partially
   covered by discrete Al4C3 platelets even after dwelling at 1173 K for 2
   h. The final wettability, however, is much better (theta(F) = 41 +/- 1
   degrees) than that of the Si-terminated surface which was covered by a
   dense Al4C3 layer, suggesting that the formation of Al4C3 should not
   always contribute to the wetting in the Al/SiC system. A plausible
   explanation is that the clean (i.e., deoxidized) C-terminated surface
   should be well wetted by molten Al in nature, owing to the strong
   chemical interactions between liquid Al and the surface atoms of the
   C-terminated SiC. It is likely that the presence of the oxide film at
   the surface of the molten Al drop or the SiC substrate and the rapid
   formation of Al4C3, which prevent the establishment of a real Al/SiC
   interface, conceal the intrinsic wettability of this system. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Oxidation and interdiffusion behaviors of Ni-based single crystal
   superalloy DD98M with nominal compositions
   Ni-5.0Co-6.0Cr-6.3Al-6.0W-2.0Mo-6.0Ta-1.0Ti (in wt.\%) and two types of
   MCrAlY coatings at 1000 degrees C and 1050 degrees C were investigated.
   Complex oxides formed on the surface of DD98M alloy when oxidized at
   1000 degrees C and 1050 degrees C, which stratified, cracked and
   spalled. The faceted-like AlN and the particle-like and strip-like TiN
   formed in the alloy. The application of the NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlYHfSi
   coatings greatly improved the oxidation resistance of DD98M alloy. After
   500 h oxidation, alpha-Al2O3 was still the dominate phase in the oxide
   scales formed on the coated specimens. The adhesion of the oxide scale
   on the NiCoCrAlYHfSi coating was much better than that on the NiCrAlY
   coating. Inter-diffusion occurred between the coatings and the
   substrate, which led to the formation of the IDZ and SRZ. The IDZ of the
   NiCrAlY coated specimen was composed of gamma phase and Al- and Ta-rich
   gamma' phase. The gamma' phase in the IDZ accommodated most of the
   inward diffusing aluminum, so the SRZ formation was suppressed when
   oxidized at 1050 degrees C. However the formation of SRZ with m-TCP
   still occurred when oxidized at 1000 degrees C probably due to the low
   solubility and slow diffusion rate of the alloying elements at lower
   temperature. The IDZ of the NiCoCrAlYHfSi coated specimen was a single g
   phase. A large amount of m-TCP precipitated in the SRZ of the
   NiCoCrAlYHfSi coated specimen when oxidized at 1000 degrees C and 1050
   degrees C. It can be concluded coating composition has a significant
   effect on the development of the IDZ and SRZ. Thermal exposure
   temperature also has influences on the formation of the SRZ. The
   mechanism of SRZ formation and TCP precipitation are discussed. (C) 2015

Title = {{Preventive conservation of historic buildings in temperate climates. The
   importance of a risk-based analysis on the decision-making process}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Historic buildings are usually characterized by a particular
   microclimate due to their high thermal inertia that may require the use
   of mechanical systems to control the environment. The guidelines used to
   define the indoor climate have evolved in recent years, with new methods
   and deepening the knowledge of the behaviour of materials, resulting in
   the publication of several risk-based methods.
   Despite the risk-based methods, the use of guidelines continue to play a
   leading role on the science of preventive conservation with the
   progressive assumption of less demanding targets. However these
   guidelines were usually defined for specific climates so that when
   extrapolated to other locations their application may not be positive.
   This research aims to analyze the hygrothermal behaviour of an unheated
   historic building in a temperate climate (Lisbon, Portugal) using a
   long-term monitoring and applying a risk-based analysis to the natural
   climate and to the climate limited by the historic set-point of 20
   degrees C -50\% and the targets defined by the standards EN 15757 and
   PAS 198. Finally a classification was defined to assist in the
   decision-making processes and to verify if it is safe to impose less
   demanding targets in temperate climates, improving therefore energy
   economy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi of the Ascomycota phylum were isolated from oil-soaked sand
   patties collected from beaches following the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill. To examine their ability to degrade oil, fungal isolates were
   grown on oiled quartz at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C.
   Consistent trends in oil degradation were not related to fungal species
   or temperature and all isolates degraded variable quantities of oil
   (32-65\%). Fungal isolates preferentially degraded short (<C-18;
   90-99\%) as opposed to long (C-19-C-36; 7-87\%) chain n-alkanes and
   straight chain C-17- and C-18-n-alkanes (91-99\%) compared to their
   branched counterparts, pristane and phytane (70-98\%). Polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds were also degraded by the fungal
   isolates (42-84\% total degraded), with a preference for low molecular
   weight over high molecular weight PAHs. Overall, these findings
   contribute to our understanding of the capacity of fungi to degrade oil
   in the coastal marine environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{RationaleThe search for the conditions which must have prevailed in the
   long-distant past during the conversion of inanimate matter into animate
   matter is a fascinating area of research and it continues to draw the
   attention of the scientific community. The initiation of life on this
   planet must have been preceded by the development of biomolecules,
   amongst which amino acids have unique importance. Formation of amino
   acids under a certain set of conditions is shown in the present
   experiments.
   MethodsSolutions of ammonium carboxylates or the mixture of two such
   salts were prepared in 3:6.9:0.1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/water/formic acid
   at a concentration of 50 M. The studies were performed using a
   quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer. The formation of
   different amino acids was detected with high-resolution mass
   spectrometry.
   ResultsHere, we show the formation of amino acids when a solution of
   ammonium salts was injected into an electrospray ionization
   (ESI)-QqTOF-MS instrument. The ammonium salts were the source of NH3 and
   CO2 and H2O was available in the medium. It seems that the combination
   of NH3, CO2, and H2O leads to the formation of amino acids.
   ConclusionsFurther to the literature reports of formation of amino acids
   under the reduced atmosphere represented by gases such as NH3, CH4, H-2
   and H2O, here we demonstrate the formation of amino acids by the
   combination of NH3/NO2, CO2 and water vapours in the ESI source of the
   mass spectrometer. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Ti2Ni/alpha(Ti) dual-phase coating reinforced by TiB and TiC was
   fabricated on the Ti6Al4V substrate by laser cladding. Phase
   constituents were confirmed by a theoretical prediction combined with
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. From the surface to the bottom of the
   coating, a regular evolution of the reinforcements' microstructure,
   namely TiCp+(TiBi-TiC)(e), (TiB+TiC)(e) and TiBp+(TiB+TiC)(e) (p and e
   were the abbreviations of primary and eutectic, respectively), was
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The coating
   possessed the higher microhardness than that of the substrate. An in
   situ dynamic method (in situ continuing tests at different time
   intervals) was designed to reveal wear behaviors at different wear
   stages. A quantitative calculation formula was established by a
   mathematic model to predict wear losses under different sliding time and
   applied loads in a definite precision. The wear mechanism was
   transformed from brittle debonding (at 10N) to the joint action of
   brittle debonding and micro-cutting (at 20 N and 30 N) due to the
   microstructural evolution across the depth from the surface of the
   coating. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on quantification of attenuation coefficient of
   fundamental anti-symmetric (A(o)) Lamb wave when it propagates through
   hybrid structural composites with nanomaterials. Investigations were
   carried out on nanosilica and carbon nanofiber hybridized-glass and

   respective control composite laminates with no nanofillers. Composite
   specimens were fabricated through Resin Film Infusion (RFI), ensuring
   near zero void fractions. Effective and actual attenuation
   characteristics of A(o) mode were evaluated at three different
   frequencies -100 kHz, 200 kHz and 500 kHz in hybrid glass and carbon
   based composites. It is observed that effect of the nanomaterials
   (nanofillers) on attenuation of A(o) mode is more significant at high
   frequencies. Furthermore, attenuation behavior of A(o) mode depends on
   the type of nanomaterial. It is also observed that Ao mode undergoes
   more attenuation in glass fiber reinforced composites compared to their
   carbon fiber based counterparts, irrespective of the nanomaterials. (C)

Abstract = {{It is well-known that for a given H-matrix A there exists a diagonal
   nonsingular matrix that scales A (by multiplying it from the right) to a
   strictly diagonally dominant (SDD) matrix. There are subclasses of
   H-matrices that can be fully characterised by the form of the
   corresponding diagonal scaling matrices. However, for some applications,
   it is not necessary to have such full characterisation. It is sufficient
   to find at least one scaling matrix that will do the job. The aim of
   this paper is to present a way of constructing a diagonal scaling matrix
   for one special subclass of H-matrices called Partition-Nekrasov
   matrices. As an application of this scaling approach, we obtain
   eigenvalue localisation for the corresponding Schur complement matrix,
   using only the entries of the original matrix. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion
   (AESD) at onset manifests an early seizure (ES) usually lasting more
   than 30 min. Following ES, some patients exhibit almost clear
   consciousness with no neurological symptoms, and no MRI abnormality for
   a few days, which may lead to an initial misdiagnosis of prolonged
   febrile seizures (PFS). To allow an early diagnosis of AESD, we
   retrospectively analyzed clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and
   radiologic and EEG findings in patients with AESD (n = 62) having ES of
   over 30 min, and ones with PFS (n = 54), using logistic regression
   analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an age
   below 1.5 years and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 or less than 14
   (Japan Coma Scale score of 1 or higher) were high risk factors of
   developing AESD. We proposed an AESD prediction score system consisting
   of consciousness level, age, duration of convulsions, enforcement of
   mechanical intubation, and aspartate aminotransferase, blood glucose and
   creatinine levels (full score: 9), the mean scores in AESD and PFS being
   5.9 and 1.8, which were significantly different (p < 0.001). We herein
   propose a scoring system for differentiating patients with AESD and PFS
   around the time of ES (score of 4 or more than 4 suggesting AESD), which
   may contribute to early therapeutic intervention and an improved
   neurologic outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aspiration is a common cause of lung injury, but it is unclear why some
   cases are self-limited while others progress to acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS). Sporadic exposure to more than one insult
   could account for this variable progression. We investigated whether
   synergy between airway acid and endotoxin (LPS) amplifies injury
   severity in mice and whether LPS levels in human patients could
   corroborate our experimental findings. C57BL/6 mice aspirated acid (pH
   1.3) or normal saline (NS), followed by LPS aerosol or nothing.
   Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained 2 to 49 h later. Mice
   were injected with FITC-dextran 25 h after aspiration and connected to a
   ventilator, and lung elastance (H) measured periodically following deep
   inflation (DI). Endotracheal and gastric aspirates were also collected
   from patients in the intensive care unit and assayed for pH and LPS.
   Lung instability (Delta H following DI) and pressure-volume hysteresis
   in acid- or LPS-exposed mice was greater than in controls but markedly
   greater in the combined acid/LPS group. BALF neutrophils, cytokines,
   protein, and FITC-dextran in the acid/LPS mice were geometrically higher
   than all other groups. BALF from acid-only mice markedly amplified
   LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in cultured macrophages. Human subjects
   had variable endotracheal LPS levels with the highest burden in those at
   higher risk of aspiration. Acid aspiration amplifies LPS signaling in
   mice to disrupt barrier function and lung mechanics in synergy. High
   variation in airway LPS and greater airway LPS burden in patients at
   higher risk of aspiration could help explain the sporadic progression of
   aspiration to ARDS.}},

Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{Permeability and pressure are two important parameters for
   characterizing coal reservoirs and for evaluating coalbed methane (CBM)
   production potential. In this study, the reservoir pressure and
   permeability of six steel-cased CBM wells at Yuwu Coal Mine (Luan coal
   mining area, Qinshui Basin, China) were studied using new injection
   falloff testing (IFOT) methodology. The tested reservoir represents coal
   \#3 of the lower Permian Shanxi Formation, the main target coal seam for
   coalbed methane exploration and production in Qinshui Basin. The results
   show that on average coal \#3 has an ultra-low permeability (0.001-0.043
   mD) and a low pressure gradient (4.0 kPa/m). These values are
   significantly lower than those of previously collected data from open
   holes in adjacent wells. However, the validity of the new results was
   confirmed using two additional lines of evidence: (1) analysis of 10 CBM
   production wells adjacent the current test area and; (2) data from a
   long-term monitoring well in an Ordovician limestone aquifer, located
   below coal \#3. On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that
   (1) using the IFOT method in cased wells, in which shut-in times were
   extended by 7-11 times that of the injection time, provides reliable
   data on reservoir parameters (including pressure and permeability); (2)
   coal \#3 is characterized by very low permeability and very low
   pressure; (3) the low reservoir pressure is related to the Xinan Spring
   Group, located on the eastern edge of the Qinshui Basin, which
   discharges reservoir ground-water to the surface hydrological system;
   and (4) low permeability may be caused by low reservoir pressure and by
   a cleat system filled with post-structural mineralization. These
   conclusions were used to further optimize stimulation design and
   production management for this CBM play. As a result, there has been a
   good production rate for these wells since 2011. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nanofluid exhibits great potential in enhancing thermal performance of
   cooling devices. From the second-law point of view, we investigate the
   entropy generation of nanofluid flow in asymmetrically heated porous
   microchannels with solid-phase heat generation. Based on
   two-energy-equation model, the closed-form temperature distributions of
   porous medium solid phase and nanofluid are obtained. The thermal
   non-equilibrium entropy generation function is derived by using
   differential method. The results show that the thermal asymmetries
   significantly affect the temperature distribution and hence the heat
   transfer irreversibility in the system. However, the fluid friction
   irreversibility is barely affected by the thermal asymmetries. For the
   case without solid-phase heat generation, the entropy generation can be
   minimized when the wall heat flux ratio is 1/2. Besides, there is an
   optimum Reynolds number at Re = 22 which further reduces the entropy
   generation. For the case with solid-phase heat generation, the entropy
   generation is minimized at wall heat flux ratio of 3/4, but the optimum
   Reynolds number vanishes. The solid-phase heat generation
   irreversibility dominates other irreversibilities and intensifies the
   entropy generation conspicuously. The second-law performance of
   nanofluid can be enhanced only when the internal heat generation is
   relatively low. When the suspended nanoparticle is smaller than the
   threshold size, the entropy generation can be reduced as much as 42\%.
   The intensification of solid-phase heat generation significantly reduces
   the discrepancy between the thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium
   models to less than 1\%. This signifies the importance of considering
   thermal asymmetries and internal heat generation in the performance
   characterization of nanofluid flow in porous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The SuperConducting Fault Current Limiter (SCFCL) appears as one of the
   most promising SC applications for the electrical grids. Despite its
   advantages and many successful field experiences the market of SCFCL has
   difficulties to take off even if the first orders for permanent
   operation in grids are taken. The analytical design of resistive SCFCL
   will be discussed with the objective to reduce the quantity of SC
   conductor (length and section) to be more cost-effective. For that the
   SC conductor must have a high resistivity in normal state. It can be
   achieved by using high resistivity alloy for shunt, such as Hastelloy.
   One of the most severe constraint is that the SCFCL should operate
   safely for any faults, especially those with low prospective
   short-circuit currents. This constraint requires to properly design the
   thickness of the SC tape in order to limit the hot spot temperature. An
   operation at 65 K appears as very interesting since it decreases the SC
   cost at least by a factor 2 with a simple LN2 cryogenics. Taking into
   account the cost reduction in a near future, the SC conductor cost could
   be rather low, half a dollar per kV A. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA is prone to damage by various intrinsic as well as
   environmental stressors. DNA damage can in turn cause problems for
   replication, resulting in replication stalling and double-strand breaks,
   which are suspected to be the leading cause of pathological mtDNA
   rearrangements. In this study, we exposed cells to subtle levels of
   oxidative stress or UV radiation and followed their effects on mtDNA
   maintenance. Although the damage did not influence mtDNA copy number, we
   detected a massive accumulation of RNA: DNA hybrid-containing
   replication intermediates, followed by an increase in cruciform DNA
   molecules, as well as in bidirectional replication initiation outside of
   the main replication origin, OH. Our results suggest that mitochondria
   maintain two different types of replication as an adaptation to
   different cellular environments; the RNA: DNA hybrid-involving
   replication mode maintains mtDNA integrity in tissues with low oxidative
   stress, and the potentially more error tolerant conventional
   strand-coupled replication operates when stress is high.}},

Title = {{Experimental methodology for assessing the environmental fate of organic

Abstract = {{Automobile tires require functional rubber additives including curing
   agents and antioxidants, which are potentially environmentally available
   from tire and road wear particles (TRWP) deposited in soil and sediment.
   A novel methodology was employed to evaluate the environmental fate of
   three commonly-used tire chemicals
   (N-cyclohexylbenzothiazole-2-sulfenamide (CBS),
   N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (6-PPD) and
   1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG)), using a road simulator, an artificial
   weathering chamber, column leaching tests, and OECD 308 sediment/water
   incubator studies. Environmental release factors were quantified for
   curing (f(C)), tire wear (f(W)), terrestrial weathering (f(S)), leaching
   from TRWP (f(L)), and environmental availability from TRWP (f(A)) by
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) analyses.
   Cumulative fractions representing total environmental availability (F-T)
   and release to water (F-R) were calculated for the tire chemicals and 13
   transformation products. F-T for CBS, DPG and 6-PPD inclusive of
   transformation products for an accelerated terrestrial aging time in
   soil of 0.1 years was 0.08, 0.1, and 0.06, respectively (equivalent to 6
   to 10\% of formulated mass). In contrast, a wider range of 5.5 x 10(-4)
   (6-PPD) to 0.06 (CBS) was observed for F-R at an accelerated age of 0.1
   years, reflecting the importance of hydrophobicity and solubility for
   determining the release to the water phase. Significant differences (p <
   0.05) in the weathering factor, f(S), were observed when chemicals were
   categorized by boiling point or hydrolysis rate constant. A significant
   difference in the leaching factor, f(L), and environmental availability
   factor, f(A), was also observed when chemicals were categorized by log
   K-ow. Our methodology should be useful for lifecycle analysis of other
   functional polymer chemicals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mapping structural connectivity in healthy adults for the Human
   Connectome Project (HCP) benefits from high quality, high resolution,
   multiband (MB)-accelerated whole brain diffusion MRI (dMRI). Acquiring
   such data at ultrahigh fields (7 T and above) can improve intrinsic
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but suffers from shorter T-2 and T-2.
   relaxation times, increased B-1(+) inhomogeneity (resulting in signal
   loss in cerebellar and temporal lobe regions), and increased power
   deposition (i.e. specific absorption rate (SAR)), thereby limiting our
   ability to reduce the repetition time (TR). Here, we present recent
   developments and optimizations in 7 T image acquisitions for the HCP
   that allow us to efficiently obtain high quality, high resolution whole
   brain in-vivo dMRI data at 7 T. These data show spatial details
   typically seen only in ex-vivo studies and complement already very high
   quality 3 T HCP data in the same subjects. The advances are the result
   of intensive pilot studies aimed at mitigating the limitations of dMRI
   at 7 T. The data quality and methods described here are representative
   of the datasets that will be made freely available to the community in
   2015. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent high-precision isotopic measurements show that the isotopic
   similarity of Earth and Moon is unique among all known planetary bodies
   in our Solar System. These observations provide fundamental constraints
   on the origin of Earth-Moon system, likely a catastrophic Giant Impact
   event. However, in contrast to the isotopic composition of many elements
   (e.g., O, Mg, Si, K, Ti, Cr, and W), the Fe isotopic compositions of all
   lunar samples are significantly different from those of the bulk
   silicate Earth. Such a global Fe isotopic difference between the Moon
   and Earth provides an important constraint on the lunar formation - such
   as the amount of Fe evaporation as a result of a Giant Impact origin of
   the Moon. Here, we show through high-precision Fe isotopic measurements
   of one of the oldest lunar rocks (4.51 +/- 0.10 Gyr dunite 72415),
   compared with Fe isotope results of other lunar samples from the Apollo
   program, and lunar meteorites, that the lunar dunite is enriched in
   light Fe isotopes, complementing the heavy Fe isotope enrichment in
   other lunar samples. Thus, the earliest olivine accumulation in the
   Lunar Magma Ocean may have been enriched in light Fe isotopes. This new
   observation allows the Fe isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Moon
   to be identical to that of the bulk silicate Earth, by balancing light
   Fe in the deep Moon with heavy Fe in the shallow Moon rather than the
   Moon having a heavier Fe isotope composition than Earth as a result of
   Giant Impact vaporization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)
   stabilized palladium nanoparticle catalyst was prepared for the
   hydrodechlorination (HDC) of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and the reduction of
   4-nitrophenol (4-NP) at mild conditions in aqueous solution. The
   catalyst was synthesized by NaBH4 reduction method and characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Visible spectroscopy and gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC). TEM characterization indicates the
   highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles (similar to 3 nm) on the surface of
   PNIPAM. UV-Visible spectroscopy exhibits a low critical solution
   temperature (LCST) of 34 degrees C for PNIPAM and the cloud-point
   temperature of 34.5 degrees C for PNIPAM-Pd catalyst in aqueous
   solution. The catalytic HDC of 4-CP and reduction of 4-NP followed the
   pseudo-first-order kinetics and the dynamic data were measured. High
   conversion (>95\%) of 4-CP (4-NP) was obtained at the substrate/Pd molar
   ratio of 100:1 in the homogeneous catalytic system. After reaction, the
   catalyst could be precipitated and separated from reaction system by
   slightly increasing the temperature of aqueous solution. The PNIPAM-Pd
   catalyst can be reused three times with little reduction of HDC
   activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distilled fraction of bio-oil can be converted into aromatic
   hydrocarbons via co-cracking with ethanol over the catalyst of Hydrogen
   Zeolite Socony Mobile-Five (HZSM-5). To further improve the selectivity
   of aromatics, the influences of different metal oxides loaded onto
   HZSM-5 were investigated and a range of model compounds were selected
   and mixed to simulate the distilled fraction of bio-oil. Two model
   compound mixtures (MCM) were used for co-cracking with ethanol: (1)
   MCM-1 that contains hydroxypropanone, cyclopentanone and acetic acid and
   (2) MCM-2 that contains hydroxypropanone, cyclopentanone, acetic acid,
   phenol and guaiacol. Co-cracking of MCM-1 and ethanol over ZnO/HZSM-5
   and Ga2O3/HZSM-5 generated higher selectivities of oil phases than that
   found using HZSM-5 and CuO/HZSM-5. However, during the co-cracking of
   MCM-2 and ethanol, ZnO/HZSM-5 and CuO/HZSM-5 were seriously deactivated
   resulting in low selectivities of the oil phases. The characterization
   of the spent catalysts showed that the inner pores in these two
   catalysts were completely blocked. Meanwhile, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 still showed
   better performance than HZSM-5 for the co-cracking of MCM-2 and ethanol.

Volume = {{458}},
Pages = {{315-322}},

Abstract = {{Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a positively charged polymer with
   hydrogen-bonding sites and hydrophobic chains. Therefore, it has been
   clearly established as an efficient adsorbent by means of these native
   properties in the literatures. However, there is apparently no good
   reason to disregard the use of PEI as a desired desorbent. Herein, using
   methyl orange as a model anionic dye, we investigated the desorption
   performances of PEI toward anionic dyes adsorbed on the surface of
   CO3-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in a wide range of pH values. The
   experiment results showed that the positively charged PEI had very
   strong desorption capacity for anionic dyes at low pH values (<9.5)
   through electrostatic attraction between PEI and methyl orange because
   of the high degree of protonation of PEI. At high pH values (>9.5). PEI
   existed as neutral molecule, it could desorb methyl orange via hydrogen
   bonding between the amino groups of it and sulfonate group of methyl
   orange; simultaneously, the anion-exchange process occurred between
   abundant hydroxyl anions and anionic methyl orange. The adsorption
   capacity of the used LDH adsorbent was about 80\% after five cycles of
   adsorption-desorption-regeneration, which was much higher than that
   conducted by 0.1 M NaOH solution. These findings suggested that PEI
   could be regarded as a promising desorbent for enriching anionic dyes in
   wastewater and regenerating LDHs through surface adsorption-desorption
   cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{415}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Ferrihydrite is commonly associated with silicate (Si) and manganese
   (Mn) in various geological settings. Here, we examined the effects of
   Fe(III) hydrolysis rate and dissolved Si concentration on ferrihydrite
   formation, as well as the effects of aqueous Mn(II) on the
   transformation of two-line ferrihydrite (2LFh). Results indicate that
   with decreasing Fe(III) hydrolysis rate, the products transition from
   2LFh to six-line ferrihydrite (6LFh) and goethite. When the hydrolysis
   rate is very low, lepidocrocite is formed in addition to 6LFh and
   goethite. This can be attributed to a decrease in the concentration of
   hydrolyzed Fe(III) species as the hydrolysis rate decreases. With
   increasing Si concentration, the products of Fe(II) oxidation transition
   from an assemblage of lepidocrocite and goethite to a mixture of 6LFh
   with minor poorly crystalline lepidocrocite and goethite, and finally to
   2LFh. The strong adsorption and polymerization of Si limit the
   nucleation and growth of hydroxychloride green rust during Fe(II)
   oxidation and precipitation, thereby hindering the formation of
   lepidocrocite and goethite. With aging at 60 degrees C and various pHs,
   2LFh converts into goethite and hematite within 20-140 days, with the
   conversion rate increasing with increasing pH. In addition, a small
   amount of pre-formed goethite converts into hematite at pH 7, 9 and 12.
   The aging of 2LFh in 8 mM Mn(II) at pH 4, 5.5, and 7 overwhelmingly
   favors the formation of goethite over hematite. However, the
   transformation of 2LFh is largely inhibited in 24 mM Mn(II) due to the
   limited accessibility of surface sites caused by increasing Mn(II)
   adsorption. These data provide evidence that the formation and secondary
   mineralization of ferrihydrite largely depend on pH, coexisting
   silicate, and Mn(II). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   electrocaloric effect of EuTiO3 nanowires under the same applied
   electric filed. Giant adiabatic temperature changes (Delta T = 15-20 K)
   are achieved near room temperature by controlling the radius of EuTiO3

   tetracycline concentrations between 2.0 x 10(-5) and 3.1 x 10(-4) mol
   L-1, sensitivity of 1.2 x 10(4) mu A L mol(-1), and a detection limit of
   3.6 x 10(-7) mol L-1. The incorporation of GO and MWCNT-COOH in the
   carbon paste improved the sensitivity, selectivity, and stability of the
   device. The MWCNT-COOH-GO/CPE sensor was successfully applied for the
   detection of tetracycline in river water, artificial urine, and
   pharmaceutical samples, without any need for sample pretreatment. The
   relative standard deviation (RSD) of the electrochemical measurements
   was less than 6.0\% (n = 3). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Broad-clawed shrews of the Cryptotis goldmani group (Mammalia:
   Eulipotyphla: Soricidae) are discontinuously distributed in temperate
   highlands from southern Tamaulipas, Mexico, to Honduras. The group
   represents a clade within the small-eared shrews (genus Cryptotis Pomel,
   1848) that is characterized by modifications of the forelimb, including
   broadened fore-feet, elongated and broadened fore-claws, and a massive
   humerus with enlarged processes. Two species of C. goldmani group shrews
   have been recorded previously from Honduras: C. magnimanus Woodman and
   Timm, 1999, is endemic to the Cordillera de Montecillos, and C. goodwini
   Jackson, 1933, which also occurs in the Sierra Madre of southern
   Guatemala, has been recorded from three isolated highland regions with
   remnant forest in western Honduras. Morphological and morphometrical
   analyses of variation in the skull and postcranial skeleton within and
   among the three Honduran populations of C. goodwini reveal that each
   represents a distinct species of broad-clawed shrew. These are described
   herein as three new species of the C. goldmani group: Cryptotis celaque,
   Cryptotis mccarthyi, and Cryptotis cavatorculus, and their locomotory
   ability and substrate use are characterized relative to other
   small-eared shrews.}},

Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{125-132}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic wood has been created using a combination of O-2 plasma
   etching and plasma deposition of thin films to achieve the necessary
   combination of surface roughness and chemistry. Inherently hydrophobic
   fluorocarbon films (from pentafluoroethane (PFE) precursor) and
   hydrophilic diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings (from acetylene
   precursor) were both used to create highly water repellent substrates.
   The effect of O-2 plasma etching on surface roughness was investigated
   using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Confocal
   Microscope (LSCM) profilomeny. The wetting behavior of the resulting
   wood was determined by static water contact angle and droplet sliding
   angle measurements. Wood samples subjected to O-2 plasma etching prior
   to fluorocarbon deposition exhibited ``roll-off{''} superhydrophobicity
   with low sliding angles; the sample in this study with the most extreme
   wetting properties has the highest water contact angle and lowest
   sliding angle reported to date for modified wood substrates (WCA 161.2
   degrees +/- 1.5 degrees and sliding angle similar to 15 degrees),
   without affecting visual appearance of the wood. Due to our ability to
   control roughness, etched samples that were coated with hydrophilic DLC
   films displayed superhydrophobic behavior (WCA), although the surface
   was ``sticky{''} in that water droplets did not slide or dislodge from
   vertically-held substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Excitatory commissural V3 interneurons (INs) of the ventral spinal cord
   have been shown to balance locomotor rhythm regularity and robustness in
   vivo. Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of these cells in the spinal
   cord, in vitro studies of dissociated V3 INs have yet to be reported. In
   this study, we developed an induction protocol for V3 INs from mouse
   embryonic stem cells. The effect of the concentration of a strong sonic
   hedgehog (Shh) agonist (smoothened agonist {[}SAG]) and retinoic acid
   (RA) on expression of progenitor p3 and postmitotic V3 IN transcription
   factor markers (ie, Nkx2.2 and Sim1) was examined. Cells were
   differentiated toward a more ventral fate by increasing the duration of
   SAG exposure from 4 days in a previously established motoneuron
   induction protocol to 6 days. At the end of the induction period,
   transcription factor expression was assessed using quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, in situ
   hybridization, and flow cytometry. Lower concentrations of RA and a
   longer duration of SAG exposure led to increased levels of p3 and V3
   marker expression. This novel induction protocol reveals the importance
   of Shh signaling duration in the dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural
   tube, and it provides a method to obtain V3 INs for future studies to
   allow better understanding their role in rewiring and regeneration after
   spinal cord injury.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},

Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{335-344}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation of green spaces in cities helps to reduce thermal stress and
   building energy consumption in hot seasons, but requires an intricate
   balance between energy and water resource usage. While the objective for
   agricultural irrigation is focused on the yield of produces, urban
   irrigation needs a new paradigm. In this study, a cutting-edge urban
   canopy model is applied to assess the impact of a variety of controlled
   irrigation schemes for Phoenix. Results show that by increasing surface
   moisture availability for evapotranspiration, urban irrigation has a
   cooling effect on the built environment throughout the year. Maximum
   reduction in canyon air temperature can be more than 3 degrees C in
   summer as compared to the condition without irrigation. Among all
   investigated schemes, the soil-temperature-controlled irrigation is the
   most efficient in reducing the annual building energy consumption and
   the total cost. The total annual saving depends on the controlling soil
   temperature for irrigation activation, and can be up to about \$1.19
   m(-2) wall area as compared to the current irrigation practice. In
   addition, the scheme can substantially enhance outdoor thermal comfort
   of pedestrians in summers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   variable importance based on the results of a classical GA. Three
   statistical parameters are proposed for the quantitative definition of
   variable importance based on the SFC. The proposed method was applied to
   three benchmarking datasets obtained from previous works. This was done
   in conjunction with the use of different regression and classification
   methods, and the results were compared with those of a classical GA. The
   results revealed the robustness and superiority of the combination of GA

Abstract = {{Ficus drupacea is a widely distributed species with ethnopharmacological
   applications. Despite the large body of literature on its antioxidant
   and phenolic contents, several aspects of its biological activities
   remain unexplored. In this study, the antimicrobial (fungi and bacteria)
   and antiproliferative activities of crude extracts of the plant's stem
   bark and isolated compounds were investigated. Seven biochemical
   compounds from stem bark extracts including beta-amyrin (1),
   beta-sitosterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 5-O-methyllatifolin (3),
   oleanolic acid (4), epifriedelanol (5), friedelin (6) and epilupeol
   acetate (7) were isolated and identified. Of all the seven compounds,
   the compounds 3 and 7 exhibited the highest antifungal and antibacterial
   activities against screened microorganisms. Aspergillus versicolor and
   A. ochraceus were the most sensitive microorganisms to the isolated
   compounds whereas Candida albicans was the most resistant fungus.
   Compounds 4, 5, and 6 did not exhibit much variation in their
   antibacterial activities except against Staphylococcus aureus and
   Escherichia coli. The most sensitive bacterium to isolated compounds was
   Bacillus cereus whereas the most resistant one was Enterobacter cloacae.
   However, compounds 4, 6 and 7 exhibited the highest antiproliferative
   activities against most cancer cells. The study reveal that F. drupacea
   stem barks contain several compounds that have antimicrobial activities
   against diverse human pathogenic, food and agricultural microbes as well
   as anticancer activities against human cancer cells of HeLa, MCF-7,
   Jurkat, HT-29 and T24. These results may guide the search for new
   natural products with chemotherapeutic attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nanoporous carbon materials co-doped with both nitrogen and sulfur have
   been synthesized via a sulfuric acid-assisted straightforward
   carbonization method, in which p-nitrobenzenamine serves as both carbon
   and nitrogen source, whereas sulfuric acid as sulfur source and
   catalyst. It is revealed that the nanoporous carbon material named as
   carbon-RT takes on amorphous features with low crystallinity. More
   importantly, it possesses high nitrogen content (15.95\%) and sulfur
   content (3.36\%) in carbon matrix. And the synthesis time is so short
   that the carbon-RT sample could be obtained within just a few minutes.
   To improve the electrochemical performance of material, the carbon-RT
   sample has been further heated at 800 degrees C, resulting in the
   carbon-800 sample. As a result, it has delivered a high specific
   capacitance of 73 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1) when
   measured in a three-electrode system, using 6 mol L-1 KOH as
   electrolyte. The present synthesis method has been conveniently
   implemented to produce nanoporous carbon materials co-doped with high
   content of nitrogen and sulfur, using inexpensive starting materials,
   thereby it has broad prospects and potentials for producing carbon
   materials in a simple and scalable manner. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Ethylene glycol (EG) plays an important role as coolant in sub-artic and
   artic regions owing to its low freezing point. However one of the
   limitations of ethylene glycol for energy management is its low thermal
   conductivity, which can be improved by addition of nanoparticles. In the
   present work, cupric oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized followed
   by dispersion in ethylene glycol through extended probe ultrasonication
   without addition of chemical dispersing agent. Temperature dependency of
   thermal conductivity of 1 vol\% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid exhibited
   a minimum at a critical temperature corresponding to lower thickness of
   interfacial layers and negligible Brownian motion. The influence of
   liquid layering on thermal conductivity was predominant at temperatures
   below critical temperature leading to higher thermal conductivity at
   lower temperature. Brownian motion-induced microconvection resulted in
   thermal conductivity increase with temperature above the critical
   temperature. About 14.1\% enhancement in thermal conductivity was
   obtained at 50 degrees C for 1 vol\% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid. The
   viscosity of CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid was lower than the viscosity
   of ethylene glycol at temperatures below 50 degrees C and 120 degrees C
   for 1 vol\% and 0.5 vol\% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluids. Our data
   reveal that the CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluids are better coolants than
   ethylene glycol for transient cooling under constant heat flux
   conditions with 11.8\% enhancement in heat transfer rate for 1 vol\%
   CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid. Hence the use of ethylene glycol-based
   nanofluids is a promising approach for energy management. (C) 2015

   production under nitrogen-limited condition}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) is an important factor influencing
   curdlan fermentative production by Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749.
   Therefore, optimization of dissolved oxygen profile is crucial to
   improve curdlan production. In this study, an unstructured mathematical
   models that consider nitrogen source as growth-limiting substrates were
   developed to estimate the kinetic parameters of cell growth, curdlan
   formation, and glucose consumption during Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749
   fermentation at various DOTs (5-75\%). The estimated kinetic parameters
   were used to establish models with Origin 8.0. All models of kinetic
   parameters were coupled with the kinetic model derived from
   Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749 fermentation to determine the effect of DOT
   on curdlan fermentation. The combined kinetic models satisfactorily fit
   the experimental data. The optimal dissolved oxygen profile was obtained
   using genetic algorithms coupled with iterative dynamic programming
   algorithms in MATLAB 10b. The optimal dissolved oxygen during curdlan
   production (20-120 h) was approximately 52\% DOT, and the maximum
   curdlan concentration of 48.5 g/L was obtained at this DOT profile. To
   our knowledge, this study is the first to optimize DOT for curdlan
   fermentation under nitrogen-limited conditions. This report
   significantly contributes to the improvement of curdlan production on an
   industrial scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the effect of carbon dioxide treatment of
   recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) on the performance of RCA and RCA
   mortar. The results indicated that carbonation increased the apparent
   density, and reduced both water absorption and the crushing value of the
   RCA. The flowability and compressive strength of the RCA mortar were
   lower than those of natural sand mortar. However, the properties of
   mortar made with carbon dioxide treated RCA were very similar to those
   of natural sand mortar. Compared with the mortar made of un-carbonated
   RCA, the mortar made with carbonated RCA showed increased autogenous
   shrinkage, reduced drying shrinkage, water absorption, and chloride
   migration coefficient. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination on
   the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) in the RCA and RCA mortar found
   that carbonation treatment of RCA not only improved the original ITZ in
   the RCA, but also improved the newly formed ITZ in the RCA mortar. (C)

Abstract = {{Dynamic optimization of the state constrained chemical and biochemical
   engineering problems has always been the research hotspot due to the
   difficulties of handling constraints. In this paper, a novel approach,
   CVP-IMOPSO, is presented to tackle this kind of problems, where the
   original optimization problem is firstly converted into a
   multi-objective dynamic optimization problem based on a method of
   handling state constraint; and control vector parameterization (CVP) is
   then applied to transform the resulting infinite dimensional problem
   into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem; finally, an efficient
   iterative multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO), embedded
   with an region reduction strategy, is proposed to tackle this MOO
   problem. This strategy reduces the search space gradually during the
   iteration process so as to further promote the convergence rate and
   diversity of MOPSO. Three well-known classic optimization problems for
   chemical and biochemical engineering processes have been tested as
   illustration, and the detailed comparisons among IMOPSO, MOPSO and
   NSGA-II are carried out for seven benchmark problems. The research
   results not only show that the proposed IMOPSO is an efficient algorithm
   for MOO problems, but also reveal the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mesoscale model for thermal conductivity of concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{8-16}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity of coarse aggregate, cement mortar as well as
   concrete were measured by means of a guarded hot plate apparatus and/or
   a transient plane source. Influences of sand ratio, type and volume
   fraction of aggregate, water-cement ratio, saturation degree and load
   level on thermal conductivity of concrete were investigated. By using
   the theoretical model for thermal conductivity of composite materials,
   interfacial thermal resistance between cement mortar and coarse
   aggregate were studied further. The results show that thermal
   conductivity of concrete increases with the increasing saturation
   degree, volume fraction and thermal conductivity of aggregate, but
   decreases with the increasing water-cement ratio and load level. And
   interfacial thermal resistance coefficient decreases with the increasing
   saturation degree; therefore, interfacial thermal resistance must be
   considered when calculating thermal conductivity of concrete. Finally,
   mesoscale models were established for thermal conductivity of undamaged
   concrete in dry and unsaturated states based on the Maxwell's model. In
   addition, a mesoscale model was proposed for thermal conductivity of
   damaged concrete; this model is based on the assumption that damaged
   concrete was isotropic and damaged phase was served as an insulator.
   Mesoscale models can be used to predict the effective thermal
   conductivity of concrete under different states and the predicted values
   were all in acceptable agreement with the experimental values. (C) 2015

   which T is epsilon-orthogonality preserving, and then derive an exact
   formula for (epsilon) over cap (T) in terms of parallel to Th parallel

   preserving mappings (for some epsilon < 1) are exactly the operators

   with other dopant cases, N-doped WS2 monolayer owns the lowest formation

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of sensor management for target
   tracking in a wireless sensor network (WSN). To determine the set of
   sensors with the most informative data, we develop a probabilistic
   sensor management scheme based on the concepts developed in compressive
   sensing. In the proposed scheme where each sensor transmits its
   observation with a certain probability via a coherent multiple access
   channel (MAC), the observation vector received at the fusion center
   becomes a compressed version of the original observations. In this
   framework, the sensor management problem can be cast as the problem of
   finding the probability of transmission at each node so that a given
   performance metric is optimized. Our goal is to determine the optimal
   values of the probabilities of transmission so that the trace of the
   Fisher information matrix (FIM) is maximized at any given time instant
   with a constraint on the available energy. We consider two cases, where
   the fusion center has i) complete information and ii) only partial
   information, regarding the sensor transmissions. The expression for FIM
   is derived for both cases and the optimal values of the probabilities of
   transmission are found accordingly. With nonidentical probabilities, we
   obtain the results numerically while under the assumption that each
   sensor transmits with equal probability, we obtain the optimal values
   analytically. We provide numerical results to illustrate the performance
   of the proposed probabilistic sensor management scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Bilirubin is thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
   vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-dependent leukocyte migration
   and by suppressing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase
   (iNOS). As VCAM-1 and iNOS are important mediators of tissue injury in
   the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) murine model of inflammatory colitis,
   we examined whether bilirubin prevents colonic injury in DSS-treated
   mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered 2.5\% DSS in the drinking
   water for 7 days, while simultaneously receiving intraperitoneal
   injections of bilirubin (30 mg/kg) or potassium phosphate vehicle.
   Disease activity was monitored, peripheral blood counts and serum
   nitrate levels were determined, and intestinal specimens were analyzed
   for histological injury, leukocyte infiltration, and iNOS expression.
   The effect of bilirubin on IL-5 production by HSB-2 cells and on Jurkat
   cell transendothelial migration also was determined. DSS-treated mice
   that simultaneously received bilirubin lost less body weight, had lower
   serum nitrate levels, and exhibited reduced disease severity than
   vehicle-treated animals. Concordantly, histopathological analyses
   revealed that bilirubin-treated mice manifested significantly less
   colonic injury, including reduced infiltration of eosinophils,
   lymphocytes, and monocytes, and diminished iNOS expression. Bilirubin
   administration also was associated with decreased eosinophil and
   monocyte infiltration into the small intestine, with a corresponding
   increase in peripheral blood eosinophilia. Bilirubin prevented Jurkat
   migration but did not alter IL-5 production. In conclusion, bilirubin
   prevents DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes
   across the vascular endothelium and by suppressing iNOS expression.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clozapine is widely prescribed and, although effective, can
   cause weight gain and dysglycemia. The dysmetabolic effects of clozapine
   are thought to be more prevalent in women with this gender on average
   attaining 17 \% higher plasma clozapine concentrations than men.
   Methods: We investigated the relationship between dose, body mass index
   (BMI), plasma glucose concentration, and plasma clozapine and
   N-desmethylclozapine (norclozapine) concentrations in 100 individuals
   with a severe enduring mental illness.
   Results: Mean (10th/90th percentile) plasma clozapine concentrations
   were higher for women {[}0.49 (0.27-0.79) mg/L] compared with men
   {[}0.44 (0.26-0.70) mg/L] (F = 2.2; p = 0.035). There was no significant
   gender difference in the prescribed clozapine dose. BMI was
   significantly higher in women {[}mean (95 \% CI) = 34.5 (26.0-45.3)] for
   females compared with 32.5 (25.2-41.0) for males. Overall, BMI increased
   by 0.7 kg/m(2) over a mean follow-up period of 210 days. A lower
   proportion, 41 \% of women had a fasting blood glucose <= 6.0 mmol/L
   (<6.0 mmol/L is defined by the International Diabetes Federation as
   normal glucose handling), compared with 88 \% of men (chi(2) = 18.6, p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusions: We have shown that mean BMI and blood glucose
   concentrations are higher in women prescribed clozapine than in men.
   Women also tended to attain higher plasma clozapine concentrations than
   men. The higher BMI and blood glucose in women may relate to higher
   tissue exposure to clozapine, as a consequence of sex differences in
   drug metabolism.}},

   virus replication}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)
   is one of the most important pathogens in the swine industry and causes
   important economic losses. No effective antiviral drugs against it are
   commercially available. We recently reported that the culture
   supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the porcine
   pleuropneumonia causative agent, has an antiviral activity in vitro
   against PRRSV in SJPL cells. Objectives of this study were (i) to
   identify the mechanism behind the antiviral activity displayed by A.
   pleuropneumoniae and (ii) to characterize the active molecules present
   in the bacterial culture supernatant.
   Methods: Antibody microarray analysis was used in order to point out
   cellular pathways modulated by the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant.
   Subsequent, flow cytometry analysis and cell cycle inhibitors were used
   to confirm antibody microarray data and to link them to the antiviral
   activity of the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Finally, A.
   pleuropneumoniae supernatant characterization was partially achieved
   using mass spectrometry.
   Results: Using antibody microarray, we observed modulations in
   G2/M-phase cell cycle regulation pathway when SJPL cells were treated
   with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. These modulations were
   confirmed by a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase when cells were
   treated with the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. Furthermore,
   two G2/M-phase cell cycle inhibitors demonstrated the ability to inhibit
   PRRSV infection, indicating a potential key role for PRRSV infection.
   Finally, mass spectrometry lead to identify two molecules (m/z 515.2 and
   m/z 663.6) present only in the culture supernatant.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time that A. pleuropneumoniae
   is able to disrupt SJPL cell cycle resulting in inhibitory activity
   against PRRSV. Furthermore, two putative molecules were identified from
   the culture supernatant. This study highlighted the cell cycle
   importance for PRRSV and will allow the development of new prophylactic
   or therapeutic approaches against PRRSV.}},

   process development, along with selection of appropriate target
   molecules, crucial to the integrated biorefinery. Succinic acid (SA), a
   high-value target molecule, can be biologically produced from sugars and
   has the potential to serve as a platform chemical for various chemical
   and polymer applications. However, the feasibility of microbial SA
   production at industrially relevant productivities and yields from
   lignocellulosic biorefinery streams has not yet been reported.
   Results: Actinobacillus succinogenes 130Z was immobilised in a custom
   continuous fermentation setup to produce SA on the xylose-enriched
   fraction of a non-detoxified, xylose-rich corn stover hydrolysate stream
   produced from deacetylation and dilute acid pretreatment. Effective
   biofilm attachment, which serves as a natural cell retention strategy to
   increase cell densities, productivities and resistance to toxicity, was
   accomplished by means of a novel agitator fitting. A maximum SA titre,
   yield and productivity of 39.6 g L-1, 0.78 g g(-1) and 1.77 g L-1 h-1
   were achieved, respectively. Steady states were obtained at dilution
   rates of 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 h(-1) and the stirred biofilm
   reactor was stable over prolonged periods of operation with a combined
   fermentation time of 1550 h. Furthermore, it was found that a gradual
   increase in the dilution rate was required to facilitate adaptation of
   the culture to the hydrolysate, suggesting a strong evolutionary
   response to the toxic compounds in the hydrolysate. Moreover, the two
   primary suspected fermentation inhibitors, furfural and HMF, were
   metabolised during fermentation with the concentration of each remaining
   at zero across all steady states.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that immobilised A. succinogenes
   has the potential for effective conversion of an industrially relevant,
   biomass-derived feed stream to succinic acid. Furthermore, due to the
   attractive yields, productivities and titres achieved in this study, the
   process has the potential to serve as a means for value-added chemical
   manufacturing in the integrated biorefinery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The nucleophilic substitution reaction CN- + CH3I allows for two
   possible reactive approaches of the reactant ion onto the methyl halide,
   which lead to two different product isomers. Stationary point
   calculations predict a similar shape of the potential and a dominant
   collinear approach for both attacks. In addition, an H-bonded
   pre-reaction complex is identified as a possible intermediate structure.
   Submerged potential energy barriers hint at a statistical formation
   process of both CNCH3 and NCCH3 isomers at the experimental collision
   energies. Experimental angle-and energy differential cross sections show
   dominant direct rebound dynamics and high internal excitation of the
   neutral product. No distinct bimodal distributions can be extracted from
   the velocity images, which impedes the indication of a specific
   preference towards any of the product isomers. A forward scattering
   simulation based on the experimental parameters describes accurately the
   experimental outcome and shows how the possibility to discriminate
   between the two isomers is mainly hindered by the large product internal
   excitation. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content, except where

Journal = {{MOLECULAR VISION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{1272-1280}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the association between polymorphisms of RASGRF1
   rs8027411 and high myopia in Chinese and Japanese populations.
   Methods: All eligible studies investigating the association between the
   RASGRF1 gene and high myopia listed in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane
   Library, Web of Science, and the China Biologic Medical Database were
   retrieved. The effects were assessed with the pooled odds ratio (OR) and
   95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was
   evaluated with the Q-statistic test. Publication bias was tested with
   Begg's and Egger's linear regression tests. Subgroup analysis and
   sensitivity analysis were performed to identify the sources of
   heterogeneity.
   Results: In the present meta-analysis, 2,529 individuals with high
   myopia and 3,127 controls from four studies were included and divided
   into seven groups. The results indicated that RASGRF1 rs8027411 was
   significantly associated with high myopia in Chinese and Japanese
   populations. Carriers of the rs8027411 G allele had a lower risk of high
   myopia compared to carriers with the T allele (G versus T, OR=0.83, 95\%
   CI=0.77-0.89; p<0.001). Low but not significant heterogeneity was found
   in a recessive model. No heterogeneity was found in other genetic
   models. The subgroup analysis indicated that the protective effect of
   rs8027411 variants was more prominent in Chinese populations (G versus
   T, OR=0.80 in Chinese and OR=0.86 in Japanese; GG versus TT, OR=0.65 in
   Chinese and OR=0.77 in Japanese; GT versus TT, OR=0.76 in Chinese and
   OR=0.81 in Japanese; (GG+GT) versus TT, OR=0.73 in Chinese and OR=0.80
   in Japanese; and GG versus (GT+TT), OR=0.77 in Chinese and OR=0.87 in
   Japanese). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the study results were
   stable in allelic, homozygote, heterozygote, and dominant models but
   were not stable in the recessive model. No evidence of publication bias
   was found.
   Conclusions: Carriers of the rs8027411 G allele in the RASGRF1 gene may
   be at a lower risk of high myopia in Chinese and Japanese populations.
   The RASGRF1 gene may play a role in the development of high myopia,
   especially in Asians. Additional studies are required to validate these
   results.}},

Title = {{Health care utilization and costs among medical-aid enrollees, the poor

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although government has implemented medical-aid policy that
   provides assistance to the poor with almost free medical services, there
   are low-income people who do not receive necessary medical services in
   Korea. The aim of this study is to highlight the characteristics of
   Medical-Aid enrollees, the poor not enrolled in Medical-Aid, and the
   near poor and their utilization and costs for health care.
   Methods: This study draws on the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study
   (KOWEPS), a nationally representative dataset. We divided people with
   income less than 120\% of the minimum cost of living (MCL) into three
   groups (n = 2,784): the poor enrolled in Medical-Aid, the poor not
   enrolled in Medical-Aid (at or below 100\% of MCL), and the near poor
   (100-120\% of MCL). Using a cross-sectional design, this study provides
   an overview of health care utilization and costs of these three groups.
   Results: The findings of the study suggest that significantly lower
   health care utilization was observed for the poor not enrolled in
   Medical-Aid compared to those enrolled in Medical-Aid. On the other
   hand, two groups (the poor not enrolled in Medical-Aid, the near poor)
   had higher health care costs, percentage of medical expenses to income
   compared to Medical-Aid.
   Conclusion: Given the particularly low rate of the population enrolled
   in Medical-Aid, similarly economically vulnerable groups are more likely
   to face barriers to needed health services. Meeting the health needs of
   these groups is an important consideration.}},

Abstract = {{The development of sensitive assays to detect small amounts of hepatitis
   B virus (HBV) DNA has favored the identification of occult hepatitis B
   infection (OBI), a virological condition characterized by a low level of
   HBV replication with detectable levels of HBV DNA in liver tissue but an
   absence of detectable surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) in serum. The gold
   standard to diagnose OBI is the detection of HBV DNA in the hepatocytes
   by highly sensitive and specific techniques, a diagnostic procedure
   requiring liver tissue to be tested and the use of non-standardized
   non-commercially available techniques. Consequently, in everyday
   clinical practice, the detection of anti-hepatitis B core
   antibody(anti-HBc) in serum of HBsAg-negative subjects is used as a
   surrogate marker to identify patients with OBI. In patients with chronic
   hepatitis C (CHC), OBI has been identified in nearly one-third of these
   cases. Considerable data suggest that OBI favors the increase of liver
   damage and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients
   with CHC. The data from other studies, however, indicate no influence of
   OBI on the natural history of CHC, particularly regarding the risk of
   developing HCC.}},

   virulence factors}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: S. aureus is an important agent of colonization and
   infection in liver transplant patients. It harbors several virulence
   factors that can increase its pathogenicity. However, studies of
   virulence and molecular typing of MRSA in cirrhotic and liver
   transplantation patients are scarce.
   Results: Here we use SCCmec, PFGE, spa typing, MLST and virulence
   factors to characterize MRSA isolates in pre and post liver
   transplantation patients. Sixteen (13 \%) of 126 cirrhotic and 15 of the
   64 liver-transplanted patients (23 \%) were colonized by MRSA (p =
   0.091). SCCmec types I, II and III that are generally associated with
   nosocomial infections were identified in 91 \% of the isolates. None of
   the isolates carried PVL, adhesion factors and fib gene. Only three MRSA
   colonized isolates carried tst gene and were characterized as SCCmec
   type I and t149. Ten spa types and five STs were identified; t002 and
   ST105 were the most frequent profiles. Spa types and ST1510 never
   described in Brazil and a new spa type t14789 were identified. Nineteen
   PFGE subtypes were found and grouped into nine types. There was a
   predominant cluster, which was related to the New York/Japanese epidemic
   clone and harboured SCCmec type II identified in both cirrhotic and
   post-transplantation patients. Based on SCCmec and virulence factors the
   MRSA isolates belonged to NY/Jpn clone seen be more similar to the
   USA100 MRSA isolates.
   Conclusions: Although without significance, liver-transplantation was
   more frequently colonized by MRSA than cirrhotic patients. The most
   frequent SCCmec was type II, and the predominant cluster was related to
   the New York/Japanese clone. A new spa t14789, and ST1510 never reported
   in Brazil were identified.}},

Title = {{A subcarrier-slot partition scheme with first-last fit spectrum
   allocation for elastic optical networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{700-711}},

Abstract = {{Bandwidth fragmentation refers to the existence of non-aligned and
   non-contiguous available subcarrier slots in elastic optical networks.
   Since spectrum for a connection must be allocated to contiguous slots
   and aligned along the routing path, non-contiguous and non-aligned
   available slots could cause call blocking. This paper proposes a
   subcarrier-slot partition scheme with first-last fit spectrum allocation
   for elastic optical networks in order to increase the number of
   contiguous aligned available slots, and hence the blocking probability
   in the network is suppressed. The partition approach creates more
   aligned available slots by separating the spectrum allocation of the
   non-disjoint connections. The first-last fit allocation policy creates
   more contiguous aligned available slots between two partitions.
   Simulation results show that the partition approach with first-last fit
   allocation policy provides lower blocking probability than that of the
   non-partition approach and the partition approach with other spectrum
   allocation-policies. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that the
   blocking probability in the network using the proposed scheme improves
   as the number of partitions is reduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   controlled trial of the OsteoACTIVE programme}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exercise programmes have shown to be important for the
   prevention of fractures in patients with established osteoporosis.
   However, few studies have evaluated the effect of such programmes for
   women with low bone mineral density (BMD) (osteoporosis or osteopenia)
   who have already suffered a fracture. Studies have indicated that
   exercise programmes concentrating on muscular strength and dynamic
   balance have a positive effect on significant risk factors for falls
   such as quadriceps strength and balance. The aim of the present study
   was to assess the effect of a 6-month exercise programme and a patient
   education component (OsteoACTIVE) on quadriceps strength, BMD, dynamic
   balance, walking capacity, physical activity level and quality of life
   in postmenopausal women with osteopenia and a previous wrist fracture.
   Methods: Eighty postmenopausal women with low BMD and a healed wrist
   fracture were randomized to OsteoACTIVE (n = 42) (age 65.5, range
   51.2-79.2 years) or patient education only (control group) (n = 38) (age
   63.9, range 52.7-86.8 years). Follow-up was conducted after 6 months
   (end of intervention) and 1 year. Outcome measures included quadriceps
   strength, BMD, dynamic balance, walking capacity, physical activity
   level and quality of life.
   Results: Thirty-five participants (83 \%) completed the OsteoACTIVE
   programme. Mean adherence to OsteoACTIVE was 87 \% (range 48-100 \%).
   Twenty-five participants (72 \%) met the a priori goal of 80 \%
   adherence to the program. No adverse events were reported. There were no
   significant differences between the two groups over the 1-year follow-up
   for any of the outcome measures.
   Conclusion: The OsteoACTIVE rehabilitation programme revealed no
   significant effect on quadriceps strength, BMD, dynamic balance, walking
   capacity or self-reported functional outcomes over the 1-year follow-up.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autophagy is demonstrated to be involved in acute ischemic
   stroke(AIS), which, however, is confined to cells and/or animals levels.
   The aim of this study was to determine two autophagy biomarkers, Beclin1
   and LC3B, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with AIS,
   and to evaluate a possible correlation between levels of Beclin1 and
   LC3B and severity of neurological deficit and clinical outcome of stroke
   patients.
   Methods: Levels of Beclin1 and LC3B were quantified by ELISA in CSF and
   serum collected from 37 AIS patients and 21 controls. The clinical
   severity at stroke onset was determined by the National Institute of
   Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the neurological outcome was determined
   by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRs) and the improvement in NIHSS between
   stroke onset and 3 months later. Associations between autophagy
   biomarkers and infarct volume, NIHSS and mRs were assessed using Pearson
   analysis.
   Results: The levels of Beclin1 and LC3B were increased both in CSF and
   serum of AIS patients relative to controls. In CSF, they were positively
   correlated with infarct volume and NIHSS scores, and negatively
   correlated with mRs scores, but no significant association was observed
   in serum. Moreover, AIS patients with higher levels of Beclin1 and LC3B
   in CSF had significantly higher improvement in NIHSS.
   Conclusion: CSF and serum levels of autophagy biomarkers are altered in
   AIS patients. CSF levels of autophagy biomarkers are associated with
   infarct volume, clinical severity of and neurological outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and
   deadly cancers worldwide; its incidence has been rising in the United
   States due to the increase in hepatitis C associated cirrhosis and the
   growing epidemic of obesity. There have been no effective therapeutic
   options in the advanced disease setting beyond sorafenib, a
   multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that showed significant
   survival benefit. Because of this, there is an urgent need to search for
   novel pathways in sorafenib experienced patients. This review will focus
   on the role of hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1 alpha)
   in cancer development, specifically in HCC. We will discuss the biology
   of HIF-1 alpha, the pathways with which it interacts, and the function
   of HIF-1 alpha in HCC. Furthermore, we will review studies highlighting
   the relevance of HIF-1 alpha in the clinical setting, as well as the
   pre-clinical data supporting its further investigation. Finally, we will
   conclude with a discussion of the potential role of a HIF-1 alpha mRNA
   antagonist for the treatment of HCC, and hypothesize the ways in which
   such an inhibitor may be best utilized in the management of advanced
   HCC. Hypoxia plays a significant role in the development of HCC. HIF-1
   alpha is a key transcription factor involved in the hypoxic response of
   cancer cells. It activates transcription of genes responsible for
   angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, proliferation, invasion and metastasis
   in HCC. Its involvement in multiple, essential tumor pathways makes it
   an attractive potential therapeutic target in HCC.}},

Title = {{Linearly scaling and almost Hamiltonian dielectric continuum molecular
   dynamics simulations through fast multipole expansions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Hamiltonian Dielectric Solvent (HADES) is a recent method {[}S. Bauer et
   al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 104103 (2014)] which enables atomistic
   Hamiltonian molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of peptides and proteins
   in dielectric solvent continua. Such simulations become rapidly
   impractical for large proteins, because the computational effort of
   HADES scales quadratically with the number N of atoms. If one tries to
   achieve linear scaling by applying a fast multipole method (FMM) to the
   computation of the HADES electrostatics, the Hamiltonian character
   (conservation of total energy, linear, and angular momenta) may get
   lost. Here, we show that the Hamiltonian character of HADES can be
   almost completely preserved, if the structure-adapted fast multipole
   method (SAMM) as recently redesigned by Lorenzen et al. {[}J. Chem.
   Theory Comput. 10, 3244-3259 (2014)] is suitably extended and is chosen
   as the FMM module. By this extension, the HADES/SAMM forces become exact
   gradients of the HADES/SAMM energy. Their translational and rotational
   invariance then guarantees (within the limits of numerical accuracy) the
   exact conservation of the linear and angular momenta. Also, the total
   energy is essentially conserved-up to residual algorithmic noise, which
   is caused by the periodically repeated SAMM interaction list updates.
   These updates entail very small temporal discontinuities of the force
   description, because the employed SAMM approximations represent
   deliberately balanced compromises between accuracy and efficiency. The
   energy-gradient corrected version of SAMM can also be applied, of
   course, to MD simulations of all-atom solvent-solute systems enclosed by
   periodic boundary conditions. However, as we demonstrate in passing,
   this choice does not offer any serious advantages. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Optimal virtual network embedding: Energy aware formulation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{184-195}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Network Virtualization is a key component of the Future Internet,
   providing the dynamic support of different networks with different
   paradigms and mechanisms in the same physical infrastructure. A major
   challenge in the dynamic provision of virtual networks is the embedding
   approach taking energy efficiency into account, while not affecting the
   overall Virtual Network (VN) acceptance ratio. Previous research focused
   on either designing heuristic-based algorithms to address the efficient
   embedding problem or to address the energy impact.
   This paper proposes an integer linear programming formulation, Energy
   Aware-Virtual Network Embedding-Node-Link Formulation (EA-VNE-NLF), that
   solves the online virtual network embedding as an optimization problem,
   striving for the minimum energy consumption and optimal resource
   allocation per VN mapping. Two different objective functions are
   proposed: (i) addressing primarily the resource consumption problem -
   Bandwidth Consumption Minimization (BCM); (ii) addressing primarily the
   energy consumption problem - Energy Consumption Minimization (ECM).
   The performance of each objective function is evaluated by means of
   simulation and compared with an existing objective function, Weighted
   Shortest Distance Path (WSDP), that is considered state of the art of
   the resource allocation problem. The simulation results show that the
   objective function BCM reduces the energy consumption of the physical
   network by 14.4\%, and improves the embedding factor by 4.3\%, consuming
   almost the same amount of resources as requested, and slightly worsening
   the VN acceptance ratio by 2.3\%. ECM reduces the energy consumption of
   the physical network by 31.4\% and improves the embedding factor by
   4.1\%, without affecting the VN acceptance ratio when compared to WSDP.

   appearing in early 2011. The disease affected 23,152 people and killed
   843, with the South West Region registering 336 cases and 13 deaths.
   Hence, we assessed the risk factors of cholera epidemic in the Buea
   Health District to provide evidence-based cholera guidelines.
   Methods: We conducted an unmatched case-control study. Cases were
   identified from health facility records and controls were neighbours of
   the cases in the same community. We interviewed 135 participants on
   socio-economic, household hygiene, food and water exposures practices
   using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using STATA.
   Fisher exact test and logistic regression were computed. P < 0.05 was
   considered to be statistically significant.
   Results: The 135 participants included 34 (25.2 \%) cholera cases and
   101 (74.8 \%) controls. More females {[}78 (57.8 \%)] participated in
   the study. Ages ranged from 1 year 3 months to 72 years; with a mean of
   29.86 (+/- 14.51) years. The cholera attack rate was 0.03 \% with no
   fatality. Most participants {[}129 (99.2 \%)] had heard of cholera. Poor
   hygienic practices {[}77 (59.2 \%)] and contaminated water sources {[}54
   (41.5 \%)] were the main reported transmission routes of cholera. Good
   hygienic practices {[}108 (83.1 \%)] were the main preventive methods of
   cholera in both cases {[}23 (76.6 \%)] and controls {[}85 (85.0 \%)].
   Logistic regression analysis showed age below 21 years (OR = 1.72, 95 \%
   CI: 0.73-4.06, p = 0.251), eating outside the home (OR = 1.06, CI:
   0.46-2.43, p = 1.00) and poor food preservation method (OR = 9.20, CI:
   3.67-23.08, p < 0.0001) were independent risk factors of cholera. Also,
   irregular water supply (OR = 0.66, 95 \% CI: 0.30-1.43, p = 0.320), poor
   kitchen facility (OR = 0.60, CI: 0.16-2.23, p = 0.560), lack of home
   toilet (OR = 0.69, CI: 0.25-1.86, p = 0.490), and education below
   tertiary (OR = 0.87, 95 \% CI: 0.36-2.11, p = 0.818) were independent
   protective factors for the occurrence of cholera.
   Conclusion: There was a good knowledge of cholera among participants.
   Poor food preservation method was a significant independent risk factor
   of cholera. Improvement in hygiene and sanitation conditions and water
   infrastructural development is crucial to combating the epidemic.}},

Title = {{Reduction in deep sternal wound infection with use of a peristernal
   cable-tie closure system: a retrospective case series}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deep sternal wound infections are a rare but serious
   complication after median sternotomy. We evaluated the incidence of deep
   sternal wound infection associated with two techniques for sternal
   closure.
   Methods: In this retrospective case series, we recorded the method of
   sternal closure in consecutive patients undergoing a variety of
   cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Sternal closure in the historical
   control group was performed using trans-sternal, stainless-steel wire
   sutures; subsequent patients were closed using wire sutures in
   conjunction with a novel, peristernal cable-tie closure system to
   reinforce the corpus sterni. Perioperative care was standardized between
   groups. Demographics, risk factors, and postoperative outcomes were
   analyzed.
   Results: Between July 2010 and July 2014, 609 consecutive adult patients
   underwent sternal closure following open median sternotomy at a single
   hospital in Mobile, Alabama. Sternal closure was accomplished with wire
   sutures in the first 309 patients and with cable-tie reinforcement in
   the subsequent 300 patients. Baseline characteristics were comparable
   between groups, except that the cable-tie group exhibited greater
   preoperative comorbidity. Mean body mass index was comparable between
   groups (30.2 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2) wire suture versus 30.5 +/- 7.7 cable-tie,
   p = 0.568). Deep sternal wound infection occurred in 2.6 \% (8/309)
   patients in the wire-suture group, whereas no deep sternal wound
   infections were observed in the cable tie group (p = 0.008).
   Conclusions: The peristernal cable-tie system was a simple and reliable
   method for sternal closure after open median sternotomy, and was
   associated with a reduced risk of deep sternal wound infection, even in
   an obese and comorbid population.}},

Title = {{Electromagnetic diagnostic techniques for hypervelocity projectile
   detection, velocity measurement, and size characterization: Theoretical
   concept and first experimental test}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{A new measurement technique is suggested to augment the characterization
   and understanding of hypervelocity projectiles before impact. The
   electromagnetic technique utilizes magnetic diffusion principles to
   detect particles, measure velocity, and indicate relative particle
   dimensions. It is particularly suited for detection of small particles
   that may be difficult to track utilizing current characterization
   methods, such as high-speed video or flash radiography but can be
   readily used for large particle detection, where particle spacing or
   location is not practical for other measurement systems. In this work,
   particles down to 2mm in diameter have been characterized while focusing
   on confining the detection signal to enable multi-particle
   characterization with limited particle-toparticle spacing. The focus of
   the paper is on the theoretical concept and the analysis of its
   applicability based on analytical and numerical calculation. First
   proof-of-principle experimental tests serve to further validate the
   method. Some potential applications are the characterization of
   particles from a shaped-charge jet after its break-up and investigating
   debris in impact experiments to test theoretical models for the
   distribution of particles size, number, and velocity. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Privacy violation caused by third-party tracking has become a serious
   problem, and the most effective defense against it is blocking. However,
   as the core part of blocking, the blacklist is usually manually curated
   and is difficult to maintain. To make it easier to generate a blacklist
   and reduce human work, we propose an effective system with high
   accuracy, named Tracker-Detector, to detect third-party trackers
   automatically. Intuitively, the behaviors of trackers and non-trackers
   are different, which leads to different JavaScript API sets being
   called. Thus, an incremental classifier is trained from JavaScript files
   crawled from a large number of websites to detect whether a website is a
   third-party tracker. High accuracy of 97.34\% is obtained with our
   dataset and that of 93,56\% is obtained within a 10-fold cross

Title = {{Dynamical effects in electron spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{One of the big challenges of theoretical condensed-matter physics is the
   description, understanding, and prediction of the effects of the Coulomb
   interaction on materials properties. In electronic spectra, the Coulomb
   interaction causes a renormalization of energies and change of spectral
   weight. Most importantly, it can lead to new structures, often called
   satellites. These can be linked to the coupling of excitations, also
   termed dynamical effects. State-of-the-art methods in the framework of
   many-body perturbation theory, in particular, the widely used GW
   approximation, often fail to describe satellite spectra. Instead,
   approaches based on a picture of electron-boson coupling such as the
   cumulant expansion are promising for the description of plasmon
   satellites. In this work, we give a unified derivation of the GW
   approximation and the cumulant expansion for the one-body Green's
   function. Using the example of bulk sodium, we compare the resulting
   spectral functions both in the valence and in the core region, and we
   discuss the dispersion of quasi-particles and satellites. We show that
   self-consistency is crucial to obtain meaningful results, in particular,
   at large binding energies. Very good agreement with experiment is
   obtained when the intrinsic spectral function is corrected for extrinsic
   and interference effects. Finally, we sketch how one can approach the
   problem in the case of the two-body Green's function, and we discuss the
   cancellation of various dynamical effects that occur in that case. (C)

Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Conventional superconductivity is inevitably suppressed in ultra-small
   metallic grains for characteristic sizes smaller than the Anderson
   limit. Experiments have shown that above the Anderson limit the critical
   temperature may be either enhanced or reduced when decreasing the
   particle size, depending on the superconducting material. In addition,
   there is experimental evidence that whether an enhancement or a
   reduction is found depends on the strength of the electronphonon
   interaction in the bulk. We reveal how the strength of the e-ph
   interaction interplays with the quantum-size effect and theoretically
   obtain the critical temperature of the superconducting nanograins in
   excellent agreement with experimental data. We demonstrate that strong
   e-ph scattering smears the peak structure in the electronic
   density-of-states of a metallic grain and enhances the electron mass,
   and thereby limits the highest T-c achievable by quantum confinement.}},

Abstract = {{The Hanani-Tutte theorem is a classical result proved for the first time
   in the 1930s that characterizes planar graphs as graphs that admit a
   drawing in the plane in which every pair of edges not sharing a vertex
   cross an even number of times. We generalize this result to clustered
   graphs with two disjoint clusters, and show that a straightforward
   extension to flat clustered graphs with three or more disjoint clusters
   is not possible. For general clustered graphs we show a variant of the
   Hanani-Tutte theorem in the case when each cluster induces a connected
   subgraph.
   Di Battista and Frati proved that clustered planarity of embedded
   clustered graphs whose every face is incident to at most five vertices
   can be tested in polynomial time. We give a new and short proof of this
   result, using the matroid intersection algorithm.}},

Title = {{Quantum entanglement at high temperatures? Bosonic systems in
   nonequilibrium steady state}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{This is the second of a series of three papers examining how viable it
   is for entanglement to be sustained at high temperatures for quantum
   systems in thermal equilibrium (Case A), in nonequilibrium (Case B) and
   in nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) conditions (Case C). The system we
   analyze here consists of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators each
   interacting with its own bath described by a scalar field, set at
   temperatures T-1 > T-2. For constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling
   studied here (Case C1) owing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be
   solved exactly at arbitrary temperatures even for strong coupling. We
   find that the valid entanglement criterion in general is not a function
   of the bath temperature difference, in contrast to thermal transport in
   the same NESS setting {[}1]. Thus lowering the temperature of one of the
   thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard the entanglement
   between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will disappear if
   any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the critical
   temperature T-c, defined as the temperature above which quantum
   entanglement vanishes. With the Langevin equations derived we give a
   full display of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on T-1,
   T-2, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling
   strengths. For weak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature
   T-c is about the order of the inverse oscillator frequency, but for
   strong oscillator-bath coupling it will depend on the bath cutoff
   frequency. We conclude that in most realistic circumstances, for bosonic
   systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling, `hot entanglement' is
   largely a fiction.}},

Title = {{A simplified, data-constrained approach to estimate the permafrost
   carbon-climate feedback}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{373}},

Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{We present an approach to estimate the feedback from large-scale thawing
   of permafrost soils using a simplified, data-constrained model that
   combines three elements: soil carbon (C) maps and profiles to identify
   the distribution and type of C in permafrost soils; incubation
   experiments to quantify the rates of C lost after thaw; and models of
   soil thermal dynamics in response to climate warming. We call the
   approach the Permafrost Carbon Network Incubation-Panarctic Thermal
   scaling approach (PInc-PanTher). The approach assumes that C stocks do
   not decompose at all when frozen, but once thawed follow set
   decomposition trajectories as a function of soil temperature. The
   trajectories are determined according to a three-pool decomposition
   model fitted to incubation data using parameters specific to soil
   horizon types. We calculate litterfall C inputs required to maintain
   steady-state C balance for the current climate, and hold those inputs
   constant. Soil temperatures are taken from the soil thermal modules of
   ecosystem model simulations forced by a common set of future climate
   change anomalies under two warming scenarios over the period 2010 to
   2100. Under a medium warming scenario (RCP4.5), the approach projects
   permafrost soil C losses of 12.2-33.4 Pg C; under a high warming
   scenario (RCP8.5), the approach projects C losses of 27.9-112.6 Pg C.
   Projected C losses are roughly linearly proportional to global
   temperature changes across the two scenarios. These results indicate a
   global sensitivity of frozen soil C to climate change (gamma
   sensitivity) of -14 to -19 PgC degrees C-1 on a 100 year time scale. For
   CH4 emissions, our approach assumes a fixed saturated area and that
   increases in CH4 emissions are related to increased heterotrophic
   respiration in anoxic soil, yielding CH4 emission increases of 7\% and
   35\% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, which add an
   additional greenhouse gas forcing of approximately 10-18\%. The
   simplified approach presented here neglects many important processes
   that may amplify or mitigate C release from permafrost soils, but serves
   as a data-constrained estimate on the forced, large-scale permafrost C
   response to warming.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the hydrodynamic study of oxygen and hydrogen bubbles flow
   generated in an electroflotation column working in batch and continuous
   mode was performed. The method of video recording and image processing
   was used to determine the diameter and the rise velocity of bubbles and
   also the gas retention. The effect of current density applied at the
   electrodes of the electroflotation column, the liquid phase
   physicochemical parameters, and the variation of the liquid phase flow
   has been studied. The overall results were modeled in order to describe
   the bubble flow regime. These models have been implemented in a code
   programmed in Visual Basic and allowed the development of an executable
   application. This application was then used successfully in order to
   determine the optimum operating conditions for treating industrial
   wastewaters by electroflotation process.}},

Abstract = {{We obtain the exceptional part of the eigenspectrum of the generalized
   Rabi model, also known as the driven Rabi model, in terms of the roots
   of a set of algebraic equations. This approach provides a product form
   for the wavefunction components and allows an explicit connection with
   recent results obtained for the wavefunction in terms of truncated
   confluent Heun functions. Other approaches are also compared. For
   particular parameter values the exceptional part of the eigenspectrum
   consists of doubly degenerate crossing points. We give a proof for the
   number of roots of the constraint polynomials and discuss the number of
   crossing points.}},

Abstract = {{Many glycoside hydrolases involved in deconstruction of cellulose and
   xylan from the excellent plant cell wall polysaccharides-degrader
   Caldicellulosiruptor bescii have been cloned and analyzed. However, far
   less is known about the enzymatic breakdown of mannan, an important
   component of hemicellulose. We herein cloned, expressed and purified the
   first B-mannosidase CbMan2A from C. bescii. CbMan2A is thermophilic,
   with an optimal temperature of 80 degrees C. CbMan2A hydrolyzes
   mannooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from 2 to 6 mainly
   into mannose and shows strong synergy with CbMan5A, an endo-mannanase
   from the same bacterium, in releasing mannose from beta-1,4-mannan. Thus
   CbMan2A forms the missing link in enzymatic conversion of mannan into
   the ready-to-use mannose by C Based on these observations, a model
   illustrating how CbMan2A may assist C bescii in mannan utilization is
   presented. In addition, CbMan2A appeared to bind to insoluble
   galactomannan in a pH-dependent fashion. Although the relation of this
   feature to mannan utilization remains elusive, CbMan2A represents an
   excellent model for investigation of the binding of GH2
   beta-mannosidases to galactomannan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine by micellar electrokinetic
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: Application to the analysis of
   drug-drug interaction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},

Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{To-date, there has been no effective chiral capillary
   electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method reported for the
   simultaneous enantioseparation of the antidepressant drug, venlafaxine
   (VX) and its structurally-similar major metabolite,
   O-desmethylvenlafaxine (O-DVX). This is mainly due to the difficulty of
   identifying MS compatible chiral selector, which could provide both high
   enantioselectivity and sensitive MS detection. In this work, poly-sodium
   N-undecenoyl-L,L-leucylalaninate (poly-L,L-SULA) was employed as a
   chiral selector after screening several dipeptide polymeric chiral
   surfactants. Baseline separation of both O-DVX and VX enantiomers was
   achieved in 15 min after optimizing the buffer pH, poly-L,L-SULA
   concentration, nebulizer pressure and separation voltage. Calibration
   curves in spiked plasma (recoveries higher than 80\%) were linear over
   the concentration range 150-5000 ng/mL for both VX and O-DVX. The limit
   of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 30 ng/mL and 21 ng/mL for
   O-DVX and VX, respectively. This method was successfully applied to
   measure the plasma concentrations of human volunteers receiving VX or
   O-DVX orally when co-administered without and with indinivar therapy.
   The results suggest that micellar electrokinetic chromatography
   electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MEKC-ESI-MS/MS) is an
   effective low cost alternative technique for the pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics studies of both O-DVX and VX enantiomers. The technique
   has potential to identify drug-drug interaction involving VX and O-DVX
   enantiomers while administering indinivar therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Absence of DAB2IP promotes cancer stem cell like signatures and
   indicates poor survival outcome in colorectal cancer}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Metastasis is a critical factor for the high mortality of colorectal
   cancer (CRC), but its mechanism is not completely understood.
   Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to play a key role in
   metastasis and also increases the cancer stem cell (CSC) feature that
   facilitates metastatic colonization. In this study, we investigated the
   biological roles of DAB2IP regulating EMT and stem cell-like features in
   human CRC. We demonstrate that DAB2IP suppresses NF-kappa B-mediated EMT
   and CSC features in CRC cells. In DAB2IP knockout mice, we discovered
   the hyperplasia in colonic epithelium which aberrantly represents the
   mesenchymal feature and NF-kappa B pathway activation. In clinic CRC
   tissue, we also reveal that reduced DAB2IP can enrich the CD133(+)
   subpopulation. DAB2IP expression was inversely correlated with tumor
   differentiation and metastasis, and patients with lower DAB2IP
   expression had shorter overall survival time. Taken together, our study
   demonstrates that DAB2IP inhibits NF-kappa B-inducing EMT and CSC to
   suppress the CRC progression, and also suggests that DAB2IP is a
   beneficial prediction factor for CRC patient prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing diversifies mRNA transcripts in human cells. This
   sequence-driven process can be influenced greatly by mutations, even
   those that do not change the protein coding potential of the transcript.
   Synonymous mutations have been shown to alter gene expression through
   modulation of splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Using a
   synonymous position mutation library in SMN1 exon 7, we show that 23\%
   of synonymous mutations across the exon decrease exon inclusion,
   suggesting that nucleotide identity across the entire exon has been
   evolutionarily optimized to support a particular exon inclusion level.
   Although phylogenetic conservation scores are insufficient to identify
   synonymous positions important for exon inclusion, an alignment of
   organisms filtered based on similar exon/intron architecture is highly
   successful. Although many of the splicing neutral mutations are observed
   to occur, none of the exon inclusion reducing mutants was found in the
   filtered alignment. Using the modified phylogenetic comparison as an
   approach to evaluate the impact on pre-mRNA splicing suggests that up to
   45\% of synonymous SNPs are likely to alter pre-mRNA splicing. These
   results demonstrate that coding and pre-mRNA splicing pressures
   co-evolve and that a modified phylogenetic comparison based on the
   exon/intron architecture is a useful tool in identifying splice altering
   SNPs.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission
   have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing
   and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections
   like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral
   isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed
   whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to
   enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial
   transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in
   Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were
   initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with
   Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These
   analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired
   infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the
   hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences
   were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general
   inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of
   patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have
   originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital
   staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that
   used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into
   specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple
   hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited
   number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional
   epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage
   between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections
   and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission,
   which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique
   introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We
   have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in
   nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich
   traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation
   by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more
   accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of cardiovascular research have shown that variable and flexible
   levels of protein phosphorylation are necessary to maintain cardiac
   function. A delicate balance between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated
   states of proteins is guaranteed by a complex interplay of protein
   kinases (PKs) and phosphatases. Serine/threonine phosphatases, in
   particular members of the protein phosphatase (PP) family govern
   dephosphorylation of the majority of these cardiac proteins. Recent
   findings have however shown that PPs do not only dephosphorylate
   previously phosphorylated proteins as a passive control mechanism but
   are capable to actively control PK activity via different direct and
   indirect signaling pathways. These control mechanisms can take place on
   (epi-)genetic, (post-)transcriptional, and (post-)translational levels.
   In addition PPs themselves are targets of a plethora of proteinaceous
   interaction partner regulating their endogenous activity, thus adding
   another level of complexity and feedback control toward this system.
   Finally, novel approaches are underway to achieve spatiotemporal
   pharmacologic control of PPs which in turn can be used to fine-tune
   misleaded PK activity in heart disease. Taken together, this review
   comprehensively summarizes the major aspects of PP-mediated PK
   regulation and discusses the subsequent consequences of deregulated PP
   activity for cardiovascular diseases in depth.}},

Abstract = {{Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) is highly expressed in many solid tumors and
   associated with metabolism reprogramming and proliferation of tumors.
   Here, we report that PKM2 can bind to DNA Damage-Binding Protein 2
   (DDB2), which is necessary for global nucleotide excision repair of UV
   induced DNA damage. The binding is promoted by UV irradiation and K433
   acetylation of PKM2. Over expression of PKM2 facilitates phosphorylation
   of DDB2 and impairs DDB2-DDB1 binding. Furthermore, knocking down of
   PKM2 increases cell survival upon UV irradiation, while over expression
   of PKM2 reduces cell survival and over expression of DDB2-DDB1 reverts
   this effect. These results reveal a previously unknown regulation of
   PKM2 on DDB2 and provide a possible mechanism for UV induced
   tumorigenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cr is one of common alloying elements that improve the oxidation
   resistance of Cu. Its content and distribution are the two important
   factors that influence the oxidation resistance of alloys. In this
   paper, the cluster structure model of stable solid solutions was used
   for designing Cu-Cu-12-{[}Crx/(12+x)Ni12/(12+x)](5) (x = 1, 2, 4, 6 or
   8) alloys. The insoluble antioxidative Cr was uniformly distributed in
   the Cu matrix with the help of Ni element. The solid solution and
   precipitation of alloys were effectively controlled by changing the
   Cr/Ni ratio, and the effects of the distribution of alloying elements on
   the oxidation resistance of Cu alloy were discussed. The studies on
   isothermal oxidation at 850 degrees C show that element Cr of the
   Cu-Ni-Cr alloys designed using cluster model can be dispersed in the Cu
   matrix, and a continuous protective Cr-rich oxide layer can be formed
   when the Cr content dispersed in the alloys reaches 9.26 at\% during
   isothermal oxidation. 1/2 of Cr in the Cu-Ni-Cr alloys is replaced by
   Fe, forming Cu-Ni-(Cr + Fe) alloys; oxide precipitates exhibit a
   columnar structure revealing the orientation of growth perpendicular to
   the matrix, thereby forming a lot of O diffusion channels and resulting
   in a sharp decline in its oxidation resistance. Therefore, the growth
   morphology of the oxide precipitates may significantly affect the
   oxidation resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis
   (TB), has inflicted about one third of mankind and claims millions of
   deaths worldwide annually. Signalling plays an important role in Mtb
   pathogenesis and persistence, and thus represents attractive resource
   for drug target candidates. Here, we show that protein tyrosine kinase A
   (PtkA) can be phosphorylated by Mtb endogenous eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr
   protein kinases (eSTPKs). Kinase assays showed that PknA, PknD, PknE,
   and PknK can phosphorylate PtkA in dose- and time-dependent manner.
   Enzyme kinetics suggests that PknA has the highest affinity and
   enzymatic efficiency towards PtkA. Furthermore, protein protein
   interaction assay in surrogate host showed that PtkA interacts with
   multi-eSTPKs in vivo, including PknA. Lastly, we show that PtkA
   phosphorylation by eSTPKs occurs on threonine residues and may effect
   tyrosine phosphorylation levels and thus PtkA activity in vitro. These
   results demonstrate that PtkA can serve as a substrate to many eSTPKs
   and suggests that's its activity can be regulated. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Phosphaplatins, platinum(II) and platinum(IV) complexes coordinated to a
   pyrophosphate moiety, exhibit excellent antitumor activities against a
   variety of cancers. To determine whether phosphaplatins trigger
   resistance to treatment by engaging DNA damage repair genes, a yeast
   genome-wide fitness assay was used. Treatment of yeast cells with
   pyrodach-2 (D2) or pyrodach-4 (D4) revealed no particular sensitivity to
   nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination repair, or
   postreplication repair when compared with platin control compounds.
   Also, TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS) protein was overexpressed
   in phosphaplatin-treated ovarian tumor cells, and platinum colocalized
   with FAS protein in lipid rafts. An overactivation of sphingomyelinase
   (ASMase) was noted in the treated cells, indicating participation of an
   extrinsic apoptotic mechanism due to increased ceramide release. Our
   results indicate that DNA is not the target of phosphaplatins and
   accordingly, that phosphaplatins might not cause resistance to
   treatment. Activation of ASMase and FAS along with the colocalization of
   platinum with FAS in lipid rafts support an extrinsic apoptotic
   signaling mechanism that is mediated by phosphaplatins.}},

   Shoulder Flexion Movements of Different Amplitudes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate if trunk muscle activation
   patterns during rapid bilateral shoulder flexions are affected by
   movement amplitude. Eleven healthy males performed shoulder flexion
   movements starting from a position with arms along sides (0 degrees) to
   either 45 degrees, 90 degrees or 180 degrees. EMG was measured
   bilaterally from transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus (OI)
   with intra-muscular electrodes, and from rectus abdominis (RA), erector
   spinae (ES) and deltoideus with surface electrodes. 3D kinematics was
   recorded and inverse dynamics was used to calculate the reactive linear
   forces and torque about the shoulders and the linear and angular
   impulses. The sequencing of trunk muscle onsets at the initiation of arm
   movements was the same across movement amplitudes with ES as the first
   muscle activated, followed by TrA, RA and OI. All arm movements induced
   a flexion angular impulse about the shoulders during acceleration that
   was reversed during deceleration. Increased movement amplitude led to
   shortened onset latencies of the abdominal muscles and increased level
   of activation in TrA and ES. The activation magnitude of TrA was similar
   in acceleration and deceleration where the other muscles were specific
   to acceleration or deceleration. The findings show that arm movements
   need to be standardized when used as a method to evaluate trunk muscle
   activation patterns and that inclusion of the deceleration of the arms
   in the analysis allow the study of the relationship between trunk muscle
   activation and direction of perturbing torque during one and the same
   arm movement.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing an explicit connection between the long distance physics of
   confinement and the dynamical interactions of quarks and gluons at short
   distances has been a long-sought goal of quantum chromodynamics. Using
   holographic QCD, we derive a direct analytic relation between the scale
   kappa which determines the masses of hadrons and the scale Lambda(s)
   which controls the predictions of perturbative QCD at very short
   distances. The resulting prediction Lambda(s) = 0.341 +/- 0.032 GeV in
   the (MS) over bar scheme agrees well with the experimental average 0.339
   +/- 0.016 GeV. We also derive a relation between Lambda(s) and the QCD
   string tension sigma. This connection between the fundamental hadronic
   scale underlying the physics of quark confinement and the perturbative
   QCD scale controlling hard collisions can be carried out in any
   renormalization scheme. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   presence of spatially inhomogeneous fields}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Molecular high-order harmonic generation from the H-2(+) ion driven by
   spatial inhomogeneous fields consisting of the chirped pulse and a
   terahertz pulse has been theoretically investigated by numerically
   solving the non-Born-Oppenheimer time-dependent Schrodinger equation. It
   shows that with the introduction of the chirp as well as the spatial
   inhomogeneity of the pulse, not only the harmonic cutoff is remarkably
   extended, but also the single short quantum path is selected to
   contribute to the harmonic spectra. Moreover, through investigation the
   effects of the laser and the molecular parameters on the inhomogeneous
   harmonic generation, we found 1.92- and 3.3-dB enhanced fields for the
   chirp-free and chirped inhomogeneous pulses, respectively. Isotopic
   effect shows that intense harmonics can be generated from the lighter
   molecule. Furthermore, with the enhancement of the initial vibrational
   state and by properly adding a terahertz controlling pulse, the harmonic
   yield is enhanced by almost five orders of magnitude compared with the
   initial single chirped case. As a result, a 362-eV supercontinuum (which
   corresponds to a 4.0-dB laser field enhancement) with five orders of
   magnitude improvement is obtained. Finally, by properly superposing the
   harmonics, a series of intense extreme ultraviolet pulses with durations
   from 22 to 52 as can be produced.}},

Title = {{Liquids with permanent porosity}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{216+}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Porous solids such as zeolites(1) and metal-organic frameworks(2,3) are
   useful in molecular separation and in catalysis, but their solid nature
   can impose limitations. For example, liquid solvents, rather than porous
   solids, are the most mature technology for post-combustion capture of
   carbon dioxide because liquid circulation systems are more easily
   retrofitted to existing plants. Solid porous adsorbents offer major
   benefits, such as lower energy penalties in adsorption-desorption
   cycles(4), but they are difficult to implement in conventional flow
   processes. Materials that combine the properties of fluidity and
   permanent porosity could therefore offer technological advantages, but
   permanent porosity is not associated with conventional liquids(5). Here
   we report free-flowing liquids whose bulk properties are determined by
   their permanent porosity. To achieve this, we designed cage
   molecules(6,7) that provide a well-defined pore space and that are
   highly soluble in solvents whose molecules are too large to enter the
   pores. The concentration of unoccupied cages can thus be around 500
   times greater than in other molecular solutions that contain
   cavities(8-10), resulting in a marked change in bulk properties, such as
   an eightfold increase in the solubility of methane gas. Our results
   provide the basis for development of a new class of functional porous
   materials for chemical processes, and we present a one-step, multigram
   scale-up route for highly soluble `scrambled' porous cages prepared from
   a mixture of commercially available reagents. The unifying design
   principle for these materials is the avoidance of functional groups that
   can penetrate into the molecular cage cavities.}},

Title = {{Nondestructive nanofabrication on Si(100) surface by
   tribochemistry-induced selective etching}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{A tribochemistry-induced selective etching approach is proposed for the
   first time to produce silicon nanostructures without lattice damage.
   With a similar to 1 nm thick SiOx film as etching mask grown on Si(100)
   surface (Si(100)/SiOx) by wet-oxidation technique, nano-trenches can be
   produced through the removal of local SiOx mask by a SiO2 tip in humid
   air and the post-etching of the exposed Si in potassium hydroxide (KOH)
   solution. The material removal of SiOx mask and Si under low load is
   dominated by the tribochemical reaction at the interface between SiO2
   tip and Si/SiOx sample, where the contact pressure is much lower than
   the critical pressure for initial yield of Si. High resolution
   transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) observation indicates that
   neither the material removal induced by tribochemical reaction nor the
   wet etching in KOH solution leads to lattice damage of the fabricated
   nanostructures. The proposed approach points out a new route in
   nondestructive nanofabrication.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{The role of contingency awareness in simple associative learning
   experiments with human participants is currently debated. Since prior
   work suggests that eye movements can index mnemonic processes that occur
   without awareness, we used eye tracking to better understand the role of
   awareness in learning aversive Pavlovian conditioning. A complex
   realworld scene containing four embedded household items was presented
   to participants while skin conductance, eye movements, and pupil size
   were recorded. One item embedded in the scene served as the conditional
   stimulus (CS). One exemplar of that item (e.g. a white pot) was paired
   with shock 100 percent of the time (CS+) while a second exemplar (e.g. a
   gray pot) was never paired with shock (CS-). The remaining items were
   paired with shock on half of the trials. Participants rated their
   expectation of receiving a shock during each trial, and these expectancy
   ratings were used to identify when (i.e. on what trial) each participant
   became aware of the programmed contingencies. Disproportionate viewing
   of the CS was found both before and after explicit contingency
   awareness, and patterns of viewing distinguished the CS+ from the CS-.
   These observations are consistent with `` dual process{''} models of
   fear conditioning, as they indicate that learning can be expressed in
   patterns of viewing prior to explicit contingency awareness.}},

Abstract = {{The (KI)(n)(-) (n = 1-4) and K(KI)(n)(-) (n = 1-3) clusters were studied
   by negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.
   Comparison between the theoretical vertical detachment energies and the
   experimental values revealed that multiple isomers may coexist in the
   experiments. The existence of two isomers for K(KI)(-) and K(KI)(2)(-)
   were confirmed directly by isomer-depletion experiments, in which the
   low adiabatic detachment energy isomers were depleted by a 1064 nm laser
   beam before the anions were photodetached by a 532 nm laser beam. Our
   results show that the most stable structures of the K(KI)(-),
   (KI)(2)(-), and K(KI)(2)-anions are chain structures, while those of
   their neutral counterparts are planar. Threedimensional structures start
   to appear at n = 3 for (KI)(n)(-/0) and K(KI)(n)(-/0). In the K(KI)n(-)
   cluster anions, the excess electron is localized on the extra K atom and
   forms an electron pair with the existing s electron of the K atom; the
   resulting negatively charged K prefers to interact with the other
   positively charged K atoms rather than with the I atoms. Both the
   anionic and neutral (KI)(4) clusters have cuboid structures, which may
   be regarded as the smallest structural motif of KI crystal.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the five most significant angular coefficients, A(0)
   through A(4), for Z bosons produced in pp collisions at root S = 8 TeV
   and decaying to mu(+)mu(-) are presented as a function of the transverse
   momentum and rapidity of the Z boson. The integrated luminosity of the
   dataset collected with the CMS detector at the LHC corresponds to 19.7
   fb(-1). These measurements provide comprehensive information about the Z
   boson production mechanisms, and are compared to the QCD predictions at
   leading order, next-to-leading order, and next-to-next-to-leading order
   in perturbation theory. (C) 2015 CERN for the benefit of the CMS

Abstract = {{The existence of tumor initiating cells (TICs) has been emerged as a
   good therapeutic target for treatment of glioblastoma that is the most
   aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis. However, the molecular
   mechanisms that regulate the phenotypes of TICs still remain obscure. In
   this study, we found that PKC delta, among PKC isoforms, is
   preferentially activated in TICs and acts as a critical regulator for
   the maintenance of TICs in glioblastoma. By modulating the expression
   levels or activity of PKC delta, we demonstrated that PKC delta promotes
   self-renewal and tumorigenic potentials of TICs. Importantly, we found
   that the activation of PKC delta persists in TICs through an autocrine
   loop with positive feedback that was driven by PKC delta/STAT3/IL-23/JAK
   signaling axis. Moreover, for phenotypes of TICs, we showed that PKC
   delta activates AKT signaling component by phosphorylation specifically
   on Ser473. Taken together, we proposed that TICs regulate their own
   population in glioblastoma through an autocrine loop with positive
   feedback that is driven by PKC delta-dependent secretion of cytokines.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a facile method for preparing Ag nanoparticle
   (NP)-loaded superamphiphobic surfaces on an Al substrate with efficient
   anticorrosion and antibacterial properties. A hierarchical steplike
   microstructure with nanopores is fabricated on an Al surface through
   facile chemical etching and anodization; subsequent fluorination confers
   superhydrophobic and superoleophobic properties to this surface. Ag NPs
   are loaded on the surface nanopores and stabilized by a self-assembled
   aminopropyltriethoxysilane monolayer through amino-group bonding to
   prevent aggregation and loss of Ag NPs. Compared with Ag NP-loaded
   pristine Al substrates, the Ag NP-coated superamphiphobic surface can
   effectively prevent corrosion of the Al substrate and bacterial
   absorption, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   Tafel plot measurement, and bactericidal tests. This study provides
   novel insights into functional superamphiphobic materials with

Title = {{Combined ultra-low input mRNA and whole-genome sequencing of human
   embryonic stem cells}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Next Generation Sequencing has proven to be an exceptionally
   powerful tool in the field of genomics and transcriptomics. With recent
   development it is nowadays possible to analyze ultra-low input sample
   material down to single cells. Nevertheless, investigating such sample
   material often limits the analysis to either the genome or
   transcriptome. We describe here a combined analysis of both types of
   nucleic acids from the same sample material.
   Methods: The method described enables the combined preparation of
   amplified cDNA as well as amplified whole-genome DNA from an ultra-low
   input sample material derived from a sub-colony of in-vitro cultivated
   human embryonic stem cells. cDNA is prepared by the application of
   oligo-dT coupled magnetic beads for mRNA capture, first strand synthesis
   and 3'-tailing followed by PCR. Whole-genome amplified DNA is prepared
   by Phi29 mediated amplification. Illumina sequencing is applied to short
   fragment libraries prepared from the amplified samples.
   Results: We developed a protocol which enables the combined analysis of
   the genome as well as the transcriptome by Next Generation Sequencing
   from ultra-low input samples. The protocol was evaluated by sequencing
   sub-colony structures from human embryonic stem cells containing 150 to
   200 cells. The method can be adapted to any available sequencing system.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report where
   sub-colonies of human embryonic stem cells have been analyzed both at
   the genomic as well as transcriptome level. The method of this proof of
   concept study may find useful practical applications for cases where
   only a limited number of cells are available, e.g. for tissues samples
   from biopsies, tumor spheres, circulating tumor cells and cells from
   early embryonic development. The results we present demonstrate that a
   combined analysis of genomic DNA and messenger RNA from ultra-low input
   samples is feasible and can readily be applied to other cellular systems
   with limited material available.}},

Abstract = {{Wobbler mutant mice suffer from progressive motoneuron degeneration and
   glial cell reactivity in the spinal cord. To prevent development of
   these abnormalities, we employed Nestorone, a high-affinity progesterone
   receptor agonist endowed with neuroprotective, promyelinating and
   anti-inflammatory activities in experimental brain ischemia, preventing
   neuroinflammation and chemical degeneration. Five-month-old Wobbler mice
   (wr-/wr-) received s.c. injections of 200 mu g/day/mouse of Nestorone in
   vegetable oil or vehicle for 10 days. Control NFR/NFR mice (background
   strain for Wobbler) received vehicle only. Vehicle-treated Wobblers
   showed typical spinal cord abnormalities, such as vacuolated
   motoneurons, decreased immunoreactive choline-acetyltransferase,
   decreased expression of glutamine synthase (GS), increased glial
   fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP) astrogliosis and curved digits
   in forelimbs. These cell-specific abnormalities were normalized in
   Nestorone-treated Wobblers. In addition, vehicle-treated Wobblers showed
   lba1 + microgliosis, high expression of the microglial marker CD11b mRNA
   and up-regulation of the proinflammatory markers TNF alpha and iNOS
   mRNAs. In Nestorone-treated Wobblers, lba1 + microgliosis subsided,
   whereas CD11b, TNFa and iNOS mRNAs were down-regulated. NF kappa B mRNA
   was increased in Wobbler spinal cord and decreased by Nestorone, whereas
   expression of its inhibitor I kappa B alpha was increased in
   Nestorone-treated Wobblers compared to control mice and vehicle-treated
   Wobblers. In conclusion, our results showed that Nestorone restraining
   effects on proinflammatory mediators, microgliosis and astrogliosis may
   support neurons in their resistance against degenerative processes. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{We derive shape-independent limits to the spectral radiative heat
   transfer rate between two closely spaced bodies, generalizing the
   concept of a blackbody to the case of near-field energy transfer.
   Through conservation of energy and reciprocity, we show that each body
   of susceptibility chi can emit and absorb radiation at enhanced rates
   bounded by vertical bar chi vertical bar(2)/Im chi, optimally mediated
   by near-field photon transfer proportional to 1/d(2) across a separation
   distance d. Dipole-dipole and dipole-plate structures approach
   restricted versions of the limit, but common large-area structures do
   not exhibit the material enhancement factor and thus fall short of the
   general limit. By contrast, we find that particle arrays interacting in
   an idealized Born approximation (i.e., neglecting multiple scattering)
   exhibit both enhancement factors, suggesting the possibility of
   orders-of-magnitude improvement beyond previous designs and the
   potential for radiative heat transfer to be comparable to conductive
   heat transfer through air at room temperature, and significantly greater
   at higher temperatures.}},

Title = {{Fine-grained information extraction from German transthoracic
   echocardiography reports}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Information extraction techniques that get structured
   representations out of unstructured data make a large amount of
   clinically relevant information about patients accessible for semantic
   applications. These methods typically rely on standardized terminologies
   that guide this process. Many languages and clinical domains, however,
   lack appropriate resources and tools, as well as evaluations of their
   applications, especially if detailed conceptualizations of the domain
   are required. For instance, German transthoracic echocardiography
   reports have not been targeted sufficiently before, despite of their
   importance for clinical trials. This work therefore aimed at development
   and evaluation of an information extraction component with a
   fine-grained terminology that enables to recognize almost all relevant
   information stated in German transthoracic echocardiography reports at
   the University Hospital of Wurzburg.
   Methods: A domain expert validated and iteratively refined an
   automatically inferred base terminology. The terminology was used by an
   ontology-driven information extraction system that outputs attribute
   value pairs. The final component has been mapped to the central elements
   of a standardized terminology, and it has been evaluated according to
   documents with different layouts.
   Results: The final system achieved state-of-the-art precision (micro
   average .996) and recall (micro average .961) on 100 test documents that
   represent more than 90\% of all reports. In particular, principal
   aspects as defined in a standardized external terminology were
   recognized with f(1) = .989 (micro average) and f(1) = .963 (macro
   average). As a result of keyword matching and restraint concept
   extraction, the system obtained high precision also on unstructured or
   exceptionally short documents, and documents with uncommon layout.
   Conclusions: The developed terminology and the proposed information
   extraction system allow to extract fine-grained information from German
   semi-structured transthoracic echocardiography reports with very high
   precision and high recall on the majority of documents at the University
   Hospital of Wurzburg. Extracted results populate a clinical data
   warehouse which supports clinical research.}},

   TEGDME-based electrolytes have the best stability with the predominant
   yield of NaO2 upon discharge and the largest electrical energy
   efficiency (approaching 90\%). Both EC/PC- and PP13TFSI-based
   electrolytes severely decompose during discharge, forming a large amount
   of side products. Analysis of the acid dissociation constant (pK(a)) of
   these electrolyte solvents reveals that the TEGDME has the relatively
   large value of pKa, which correlates with good stability of the
   electrolyte and high round-trip energy efficiency of the battery.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the properties of the outflowing matter from an advective
   accretion disc around a spinning black hole. During accretion, rotating
   matter experiences centrifugal pressure-supported shock transition that
   effectively produces a virtual barrier around the black hole in the form
   of post-shock corona (hereafter PSC). Due to shock compression, PSC
   becomes hot and dense that eventually deflects a part of the inflowing
   matter as bipolar outflows because of the presence of extra thermal
   gradient force. In our approach, we study the outflow properties in
   terms of the inflow parameters, namely specific energy (epsilon) and
   specific angular momentum (lambda) considering the realistic outflow
   geometry around the rotating black holes. We find that spin of the black
   hole (a(k)) plays an important role in deciding the outflow rate
   R-(m)over dot (ratio of mass flux of outflow to inflow); in particular,
   R-(m)over dot is directly correlated with a(k) for the same set of
   inflow parameters. It is found that a large range of the inflow
   parameters allows global accretion-ejection solutions, and the effective
   area of the parameter space (epsilon, gamma) with and without outflow
   decreases with black hole spin (a(k)). We compute the maximum outflow
   rate (R-(m)over dot(max)) as a function of black hole spin (a(k)) and
   observe that (R-(m)over dot(max)) weakly depends on a(k) that lies in
   the range similar to 10-18 per cent of the inflow rate for the adiabatic
   index (gamma) with 1.5 >= gamma >= 4/3. We present the observational
   implication of our approach while studying the steady/ persistent jet
   activities based on the accretion states of black holes. We discuss that
   our formalism seems to have the potential to explain the observed jet
   kinetic power for several Galactic black hole sources and active
   galactic nuclei.}},

Title = {{Help-Seeking Behavior for Children with Acute Respiratory Infection in
   Ethiopia: Results from 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Acute respiratory infection is a major contributor to morbidity and
   mortality among children under five years of age in Ethiopia. While
   facilities have been implemented to address this problem they are
   underused due to a lack in help-seeking behavior. This study
   investigates factors related to the help-seeking behavior of mothers for
   children with acute respiratory infection using data from the 2011
   Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey.
   Methods
   Data on 11,030 children aged 0-59 months obtained through interviewing
   women aged 1549 years throughout Ethiopia was available. Descriptive
   statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine
   which factors are related to help-seeking behavior for acute respiratory
   infection.
   Results
   In the two weeks prior to the survey, 773(7\%) of the children were
   reported to have symptoms of acute respiratory infection while treatment
   was sought for only 209 (27.2\%). The odds ratio for acute respiratory
   infection was 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.2-2.0) for rural residence with only
   25.2\% of these mothers seeking help compared to 46.4\% for mothers with
   an urban residence. Smaller family size, younger mothers' age and having
   had prenatal care had a statistically significant odds ratio greater
   than 1 for both urban and rural residences. Highest wealth index had a
   statistically significant odds ratio greater than 1 for rural residence
   only, whereas primary education or higher had a statistically
   significant odds ratio greater than 1 for urban residence.
   Conclusions
   Children from rural areas are more at risk for acute respiratory
   infection while their mothers are less likely to seek help.
   Nevertheless, there is also underuse of available services in urban
   areas. Interventions should target mothers with less education and
   wealth and older mothers. Expanding prenatal care among these groups
   would encourage a better use of available facilities and subsequently
   better care for their children.}},

Abstract = {{A cost-effective, robust and reliable computational strategy is applied

Abstract = {{Surface functionalization of orthopedic implants is being intensively
   investigated to strengthen bone-to-implant contact and accelerate bone
   healing process. A hybrid coating, consisting of 45S5 bioactive glass
   (BG) individually wrapped and interconnected with fibrous cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNCs), is deposited on 316L stainless steel from aqueous
   suspension by a one-step electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process. Apart
   from the codeposition mechanism elucidated by means of zeta-potential
   and scanning electron microscopy measurements, in vitro characterization
   of the deposited CNCs-BG coating in simulated body fluid reveals an
   extremely rapid mineralization of BG particles on the coating (e.g., the
   formation of hydroxyapatite crystals layer after 0.5 day). A series of
   comparative trials and characterization methods were carried out to
   comprehensively understand the mineralization process of BG interacting
   with CNCs. Furthermore, key factors for satisfying the applicability of
   an implant coating such as coating composition, surface topography, and
   adhesion strength were quantitatively investigated as a function of
   mineralization time. Cell culture studies (using MC3T3-E1) indicate that
   the presence of CNCs-BG coating substantially accelerated cell
   attachment, spreading, proliferation, differentiation, and
   mineralization of extracellular matrix. This study has confirmed the
   capability of CNCs to enhance and regulate the bioactivity of BG
   particles, leading to mineralized CNCs-BG hybrids for improved bone
   implant coatings.}},

Title = {{A Non-Invasive Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) Assay to Detect Paternal CFTR
   Mutations in the Cell-Free Fetal DNA (cffDNA) of Three Pregnancies at
   Risk of Cystic Fibrosis via Compound Heterozygosity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) makes use of cell-free fetal DNA
   (cffDNA) in the mother's bloodstream as an alternative to invasive
   sampling methods such as amniocentesis or CVS, which carry a 0.5-1\%
   risk of fetal loss. We describe a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay
   designed to inform the testing options for couples whose offspring are
   at risk of suffering from cystic fibrosis via compound heterozygosity.
   By detecting the presence or absence of the paternal mutation in the
   cffDNA, it is possible to predict whether the fetus will be an
   unaffected carrier (absence) or whether further invasive testing is
   indicated (presence).
   Methods
   We selected a family in which the parents were known to carry different
   mutated CFTR alleles as our test system. NIPD was performed for three of
   their pregnancies during the first trimester (at around 11-12 weeks of
   gestation). Taqman probes were designed against an amplicon in exon 11
   of the CFTR gene, to quantify the proportion of mutant (Delta F508-MUT;
   FAM) and normal (Delta F508-NOR; VIC) alleles at position c.1521\_1523
   of the CFTR gene.
   Discussion
   The assay correctly and unambiguously recognized the Delta F508-MUT CFTR
   allele in the cffDNA of all three proband fetuses and none of the six
   unaffected control fetuses. In conclusion, the Bio-Rad QX100 was found
   to be a cost-effective and technically undemanding platform for
   designing bespoke NIPD assays.}},

Title = {{Genomic dissection and prediction of heading date in perennial ryegrass}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genomic selection (GS) has become a commonly used technology
   in animal breeding. In crops, it is expected to significantly improve
   the genetic gains per unit of time. So far, its implementation in plant
   breeding has been mainly investigated in species farmed as homogeneous
   varieties. Concerning crops farmed in family pools, only a few
   theoretical studies are currently available. Here, we test the
   opportunity to implement GS in breeding of perennial ryegrass, using
   real data from a forage breeding program. Heading date was chosen as a
   model trait, due to its high heritability and ease of assessment. Genome
   Wide Association analysis was performed to uncover the genetic
   architecture of the trait. Then, Genomic Prediction (GP) models were
   tested and prediction accuracy was compared to the one obtained in
   traditional Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) methods.
   Results: Several markers were significantly associated with heading
   date, some locating within or proximal to genes with a well-established
   role in floral regulation. GP models gave very high accuracies, which
   were significantly better than those obtained through traditional MAS.
   Accuracies were higher when predictions were made from related families
   and from larger training populations, whereas predicting from unrelated
   families caused the variance of the estimated breeding values to be
   biased downwards.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that there are good perspectives for
   GS implementation in perennial ryegrass breeding, and that problems
   resulting from low linkage disequilibrium (LD) can be reduced by the
   presence of structure and related families in the breeding population.
   While comprehensive Genome Wide Association analysis is difficult in
   species with extremely low LD, we did identify variants proximal to
   genes with a known role in flowering time (e. g. CONSTANS and
   Phytochrome C).}},

Abstract = {{In vitro gut modeling is a useful approach to investigate some factors
   and mechanisms of the gut microbiota independent of the effects of the
   host. This study tested the use of immobilized fecal microbiota to
   develop different designs of continuous colonic fermentation models

   fermentation mimicking the proximal, transverse and distal colon. Models
   2 and 3 were based on the new PolyFermS platform composed of an inoculum
   reactor seeded with immobilized fecal microbiota and used to
   continuously inoculate with the same microbiota different second-stage
   reactors mounted in parallel. The main gut bacterial groups, microbial
   diversity and metabolite production were monitored in effluents of all
   reactors using quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene 454-pyrosequencing, and
   HPLC, respectively. In all models, a diverse microbiota resembling the
   one tested in donor's fecal sample was established. Metabolic stability
   in inoculum reactors seeded with immobilized fecal microbiota was shown
   for operation times of up to 80 days. A high microbial and metabolic
   reproducibility was demonstrated for downstream control and experimental
   reactors of a PolyFermS model. The PolyFermS models tested here are
   particularly suited to investigate the effects of environmental factors,
   such as diet and drugs, in a controlled setting with the same microbiota

Abstract = {{Zn-Mn oxides supported on gamma-Al2O3 are experimentally evaluated as an
   adsorbent for removing H2S from gas streams in the temperature range of
   350-4600 degrees C. Experimental results indicate that zinc and
   manganese oxide can be integrated to form a good solid solution for
   effective adsorption of H2S. With an operating temperature of 600
   degrees C and 200 ppm of H2S on the gas stream, the adsorption capacity
   of H2S achieved with 10 wt \% Zn-Mn/gamma-Al2O3 (ZMA) reaches 52 mg S/g
   at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 20 000 h(-1). Additionally,
   kinetic study is conducted to evaluate the activation energy. Results
   indicate that the activation energy. of ZMA IS 51 kJ/mol and that the
   reaction rate constant increases with increasing temperature. In
   addition, the H2S adsorption capacity of ZMA would be significantly
   increased as CO2, H-2, and CO are added into the gas stream
   individually. In the regeneration process, the activity of ZMA can be
   completely recovered with air at the low regeneration temperature of 300
   degrees C. Furthermore, the, durability test results indicate that the
   sulfur:adsorption capacity achieved with ZMA is maintained at about 52
   mg S/g at 600 degrees C for at least 6 cycles. Overall, the Zn-Mn-based
   adsorbent shows good performance and stability for H2S removal.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution studies of pollen in laminated sediments deposited in
   Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) core SPR0901-02KC reflect decadal-scale
   fluctuations in precipitation spanning the interval from AD 800-1600.
   From AD 800-1090 during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) SBB sediments
   were dominated by xeric vegetation types (drought-resistant coastal
   sagebrush and chaparral) implying reduced precipitation in the southern
   California region. Drought-adapted vegetation abruptly decreased at AD
   1090 and was rapidly replaced by mesic oak (Quercus) woodlands
   associated with an increased pollen flux into the basin. After a mesic
   interval lasting similar to 100 years, pollen flux and the relative
   abundance of Quercus pollen dropped abruptly at AD 1200 when the rapid
   rise of chaparral suggests a significant drought similar to that of the
   MCA (similar to AD 800-1090). This brief resurgence of drought-adapted
   vegetation between AD 1200-1270 marked the end of the MCA droughts. A
   gradual increase in mesic vegetation followed, characterizing cool
   hydroclimates of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in coastal southern
   California.
   The presence of xeric vegetation in SBB coincides with major drought
   events recorded in tree rings and low lake levels elsewhere in
   California except for the brief drought between AD 1130-1160.
   Correlative diatom and terrigenous sediment input proxy records from SBB
   are largely supportive of the pollen record predominantly linking the
   MCA with drought and La Nina-like conditions and the LIA with wetter
   (more El Nino-like) conditions. Differences between paleoclimate proxies
   (pollen, diatoms, and terrigenous sediment) in SBB exist, however,
   possibly reflecting the temporal and spatial differences in the
   generation of each proxy record, as well as their individual sensitivity
   to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gay and bisexual men (GBM) with undiagnosed HIV are
   believed to contribute disproportionately to HIV transmission in
   Australia but national prevalence estimates have been lacking.
   Methods: From November 2013 to November 2014, we recruited men at gay
   venues and events in six Australian states and territories. Of 7291
   survey participants, 3071 men also provided an oral fluid sample for
   testing and decided whether to receive their test results or not. We
   calculated raw and population-weighted prevalence estimates and
   identified associations with undiagnosed infection using logistic
   regression.
   Results: Of 3071 participants, 213 men tested HIV-positive (6.9\%, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 6.0 to 7.8\%), of whom 19 (8.9\%, 95\% CI 5.8
   to 13.5\%) were previously undiagnosed. After weighting for the size of
   the gay and bisexual male population in each state or territory,
   national HIV prevalence was estimated to be 7.2\% (95\% CI 6.3 to 8.1),
   of which 9.1\% (95\% CI 6.0 to 13.6\%) were estimated to be undiagnosed.
   Compared with HIV-negative participants, men with undiagnosed HIV were
   more likely to report meeting partners at sex venues, using
   antiretroviral drugs as pre-exposure prophylaxis, condomless anal
   intercourse with casual partners, using party drugs for sex, injecting
   drugs and using amyl nitrite, crystal methamphetamine or gamma
   hydroxybutyrate in the six months prior to the survey.
   Discussion: The results indicate that the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV
   is relatively low among Australian GBM but is higher among men who
   report riskier sex and drug practices.
   Conclusions: The results underline the importance of targeted HIV
   prevention and frequent testing for men at increased risk of infection.}},

Abstract = {{The ground-state magnetic phase diagram is investigated within the
   single-band Hubbard model for square and different cubic lattices. The
   results of employing the generalized non-correlated mean-field
   (Hartree-Fock) approximation and generalized slave-boson approach by
   Kotliar and Ruckenstein with correlation effects included are compared.
   We take into account commensurate ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and
   incommensurate (spiral) magnetic phases, as well as phase separation
   into magnetic phases of different types, which was often lacking in
   previous investigations. It is found that the spiral states and
   especially ferromagnetism are generally strongly suppressed up to
   non-realistically large Hubbard U by the correlation effects if nesting
   is absent and van Hove singularities are well away from the paramagnetic
   phase Fermi level. The magnetic phase separation plays an important role
   in the formation of magnetic states, the corresponding phase regions
   being especially wide in the vicinity of half-filling. The details of
   non-collinear and collinear magnetic ordering for different cubic
   lattices are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into a b (b) over bar quark
   pair and produced in association with at least one additional b quark is
   presented. This signature is sensitive to the Higgs sector of the
   minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with large values of the
   parameter tan beta. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton
   collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS
   detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7
   fb(-1). The results are combined with a previous analysis based on 7 TeV
   data. No signal is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section
   times branching fraction are derived for Higgs bosons with masses up to
   900 GeV, and the results are interpreted within different MSSM benchmark
   scenarios, m(h)(max), m(h)(mod+), m(h)(mod-), light-stau and light-stop.
   Observed 95\% confidence level upper limits on tan beta, ranging from 14
   to 50, are obtained in the m(h)(mod+) benchmark scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The inefficient delivery of proteins into mammalian cells remains a
   major barrier to realizing the therapeutic potential of many proteins.
   We and others have previously shown that superpositively charged
   proteins are efficiently endocytosed and can bring associated proteins
   and nucleic acids into cells. The vast majority of cargo delivered in
   this manner, however, remains in endosomes and does not reach the
   cytosol. In this study we designed and implemented a screen to discover
   peptides that enhance the endosomal escape of proteins fused to
   superpositively charged GFP (+36 GFP). From a screen of peptides
   previously reported to disrupt microbial membranes without known
   mammalian cell toxicity, we discovered a 13-residue peptide, aurein 1.2,
   that substantially increases cytosolic protein delivery by up to similar
   to 5-fold in a cytosolic fractionation assay in cultured cells. Four
   additional independent assays for nonendosomal protein delivery
   collectively suggest that aurein 1.2 enhances endosomal escape of
   associated endocytosed protein cargo. Structure function studies
   clarified peptide sequence and protein conjugation requirements for
   endosomal escape activity. When applied to the in vivo delivery of +36
   GFP-Cre recombinase fusions into the inner ear of live mice, fusion with
   aurein 1.2 dramatically increased nonendosomal Cre recombinase delivery
   potency, resulting in up to 100\% recombined inner hair cells and 96\%
   recombined outer hair cells, compared to 0-4\% recombined hair cells
   from +36-GFP-Cre without aurein 1.2. Collectively, these findings
   describe a genetically encodable, endosome escape-enhancing peptide that
   can substantially increase the cytoplasmic delivery of cationic proteins
   in vitro and in vivo.}},

   incorporate curvature effects to analyze the combined influence of SOC
   and curvature on the band structure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The
   extended model then reproduces the chirality-dependent asymmetric
   electron-hole splitting for semiconducting CNTs and in the band
   structure for metallic CNTs shows an opening of the band gap and a
   change of the Fermi wave vector with spin. For chiral semiconducting
   CNTs with large chiral angle we show that the spin-splitting
   configuration of bands near the Fermi energy depends on the value of
   mod(2n + m, 3).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Axial spondyloarthropathy typically has its onset in early
   adulthood and can impact significantly on quality of life. In the UK,
   biologic anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy is recommended for patients
   who are unresponsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There
   remain several unresolved issues about the long-term safety and quality
   of life outcomes of biologic treatment in axial spondyloarthropathy.
   Long-term ``real-world{''} surveillance data are required to complement
   data from randomised controlled trials.
   Methods/Design: We are conducting a UK-wide prospective cohort study of
   patients with axial spondyloarthropathy who are naive to biologic
   therapy at the time of recruitment. Those about to commence anti-tumour
   necrosis factor biologic therapy will enter a ``biologic{''} sub-cohort
   with other patients assigned to a ``non-biologic{''} sub-cohort. The
   primary objective is to determine whether the use of biologic therapy is
   associated with an increased risk of serious infection, while secondary
   objectives are to assess differences in malignancy, serious comorbidity,
   all-cause mortality but also assess impact on specific clinical domains
   (physical health, mental health and quality of life) including work
   outcomes between biologic and non-biologic patient cohorts. Patients
   will be followed-up for up to 5 years. Data are obtained at baseline and
   at standard clinical follow-up visits - at 3, 6 and 12 months and then
   annually for the biologic cohort and annually for the non-biologic
   cohort. This study will also collect biological samples for genetic
   analysis.
   Discussion: Although biologic therapy is widely used for ankylosing
   spondylitis patients who are unresponsive to non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs, the majority of the available safety
   information comes from rheumatoid arthritis, where increased infection
   risk has consistently been shown. However, given the typical demographic
   differences between rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthropathy
   patients, it is important to develop an epidemiologically rigorous
   cohort of patients receiving biologic therapy to effectively evaluate
   outcomes with regard not only to safety but also to quantify benefits
   across clinical, psychosocial and work outcomes.
   Clinical trial registration: This is an observational cohort study and
   clinical trial registration was not required or obtained}},

   studied thermophysical properties of Ge-NWs from Raman spectra, measured
   by varying excitation laser power at ambient condition. We derived the
   laser-induced temperature rise during Raman measurements by analyzing
   the Raman peak position for both the NWs, and for a comparative study we
   performed the same for bulk Ge. The frequency of the Ge-Ge phonon mode
   softens for all the samples with the increase in temperature, and the
   first-order temperature coefficient (chi(T)) for defected NWs is found
   to be higher than normal NWS and bulk We demonstrated that apart from
   the size, the lamellar twinning and polytype phase drastically affect
   the heat transport properties of NWs.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation and habitat loss are detrimental to top carnivores,
   such as jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), but effects
   on mesocarnivores, such as ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), are less clear.
   Ocelots need native forests, but also might benefit from the local
   extirpation of larger cats such as pumas and jaguars through
   mesopredator release. We used a standardized camera trap protocol to
   assess ocelot populations in six protected areas of the Atlantic forest
   in southeastern Brazil where over 80\% of forest remnants are < 50 ha.
   We tested whether variation in ocelot abundance could be explained by
   reserve size, forest cover, number of free-ranging domestic dogs and
   presence of top predators. Ocelot abundance was positively correlated
   with reserve size and the presence of top predators (jaguar and pumas)
   and negatively correlated with the number of dogs. We also found higher
   detection probabilities in less forested areas as compared to larger,
   intact forests. We suspect that smaller home ranges and higher movement
   rates in smaller, more degraded areas increased detection. Our data do
   not support the hypothesis of mesopredator release. Rather, our findings
   indicate that ocelots respond negatively to habitat loss, and thrive in
   large protected areas inhabited by top predators.}},

Abstract = {{This research work studies the effect of combined Ti and B
   microadditions and the solidification route on the hot ductility
   behavior of a high-Mn austenitic Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP)
   steel. For this purpose, uniaxial hot tensile tests were carried out at
   different temperatures between 700 and 1100 degrees C under a constant
   strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1). The hot ductility was determined by
   measuring the reduction of transverse area (\%RA) after specimen
   rupture. Characterization was performed by SEM-EBSD and TEM techniques
   in order to identify the relationship between microstructural features
   and cracking phenomena. Results indicate that the early occurrence of
   dynamic recrystallization (DRX) at the intermediate temperature range
   (800-900 degrees C) is the favorable mechanism that enhances the
   ductility, achieving RA values up to 82\%. These high RA values are
   discussed in terms of the boron effect on the improvement of the
   grain-boundaries cohesion through non-equilibrium segregation, and
   Ti(C,N) precipitation, which reduces the formation of harmful
   precipitates such as BN and AIN. Additionally, the Fe-23(B,C)(6) and B4C
   compounds were identified, which are less detrimental to hot ductility
   than boron-nitride compounds. Finally, the fracture surfaces of the
   present TWIP steels in the temperature range of the highest ductility
   indicate that the failure mode is of the ductile type as evidenced by
   the presence of many dimples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report the detection of steady radio emission from the known X-ray
   source X9 in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. With a double-peaked C IV
   emission line in its ultraviolet spectrum providing a clear signature of
   accretion, this source had been previously classified as a cataclysmic
   variable. In deep ATCA (Australia Telescope Compact Array) imaging from
   2010 and 2013, we identified a steady radio source at both 5.5 and 9.0
   GHz, with a radio spectral index (defined as S-v alpha v(alpha)) of a =
   -0.4 +/- 0.4. Our measured flux density of 42 +/- 4 mu Jy beam(-1) at
   5.5 GHz implies a radio luminosity (vL(v)) of 5.8 x 10(27) erg s(-1),
   significantly higher than any previous radio detection of an accreting
   white dwarf. Transitional millisecond pulsars, which have the highest
   radio-to-X-ray flux ratios among accreting neutron stars (still a factor
   of a few below accreting black holes at the same L-X), show distinctly
   different patterns of X-ray and radio variability than X9. When combined
   with archival X-ray measurements, our radio detection places 47 Tuc X9
   very close to the radio/X-ray correlation for accreting black holes, and
   we explore the possibility that this source is instead a quiescent
   stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary. The nature of the donor star is
   uncertain; although the luminosity of the optical counterpart is
   consistent with a low-mass main-sequence donor star, the mass transfer
   rate required to produce the high quiescent X-ray luminosity of 10(33)
   erg s(-1) suggests the system may instead be ultracompact, with an
   orbital period of order 25 min. This is the fourth quiescent black hole
   candidate discovered to date in a Galactic globular cluster, and the
   only one with a confirmed accretion signature from its
   optical/ultraviolet spectrum.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sex differences, which may be an important variable for
   determining anesthetic requirements, have not been well investigated in
   the aspect of local anesthetic. This investigation aimed to compare the
   minimum local analgesic concentration (MLAC) of ropivacaine for
   ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block (US-SCB) between
   men and women.
   Material/Method: Patients aged 18-45 years undergoing elective forearm,
   wrist, or hand surgeries under US-SCB were divided into 2 groups
   according to sex. The initial concentration was 0.375\% ropivacaine 20
   mL and the concentration for the next patient was determined by the
   up-down technique at 0.025\% intervals. Success was defined as the
   absence of any pain in response to a pinprick in the region of all 4
   terminal nerves and the skin incision within 45 min. The primary outcome
   was the MLAC of ropivacaine, which was estimated by the Dixon and Massey
   method. The analgesia duration, which was defined as the time from the
   end of the US-SCB injection to the time of feeling discomfort and need
   for additional analgesics, was observed for each patient.
   Results: The MLAC of ropivacaine 20 mL for US-SCB was 0.2675\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 0.2512-0.2838\%) in men and 0.2675\% (95\%
   CI, 0.2524-0.2826\%) in women. There was no significant difference in
   MLAC or the analgesia duration between the 2 groups (P>0.05).
   Conclusions: We found no significant sex-related differences in MLAC or
   analgesia duration of ropivacaine for US-SCB.}},

Abstract = {{The instantaneous HI content of galaxies is thought to be governed by
   recent accretion and environment. We examine these effects within a
   cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic galactic
   outflow model that reproduces basic observed trends of HI in galaxies.
   We show that this model reproduces the observed HI mass function in bins
   of stellar mass, as well as the HI richness (M-HI / M-{*}) versus local
   galaxy density. For satellite galaxies in massive (greater than or
   similar to 10(12)M(circle dot)) haloes, the HI richness distribution is
   bimodal and the median drops towards the largest halo masses. The
   depletion time-scale of HI entering a massive halo is more rapid, in
   contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows little
   variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests that,
   up to the halo mass scales probed here (less than or similar to
   10(14)M(circle dot)), star formation is mainly attenuated by starvation,
   but HI is additionally removed by stripping once a hot gaseous halo is
   present. In low-mass haloes, the HI richness of satellites is
   independent of radius, while in very massive haloes they become gas-poor
   towards the centre, confirming the increasing strength of the stripping
   with halo mass. Mergers somewhat increase the HI richness and its
   scatter about the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way
   consistent with it arising from inflow fluctuations, while star
   formation is significantly boosted relative to HI.}},

Abstract = {{Spectropolarimetric observations have been used to map stellar magnetic
   fields, many of which display strong bands of azimuthal fields that are
   toroidal. A number of explanations have been proposed to explain how
   such fields might be generated though none are definitive. In this
   paper, we examine the toroidal fields of a sample of 55 stars with
   magnetic maps, with masses in the range 0.1-1.5M(circle dot). We find
   that the energy contained in toroidal fields has a power-law dependence
   on the energy contained in poloidal fields. However the power index is
   not constant across our sample, with stars less and more massive than
   0.5M(circle dot) having power indices of 0.72 +/- 0.08 and 1.25 +/-
   0.06, respectively. There is some evidence that these two power laws
   correspond to stars in the saturated and unsaturated regimes of the
   rotation-activity relation. Additionally, our sample shows that strong
   toroidal fields must be generated axisymmetrically. The latitudes at
   which these bands appear depend on the stellar rotation period with fast
   rotators displaying higher latitude bands than slow rotators. The
   results in this paper present new constraints for future dynamo studies.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{The Roseobacter clade is a key group of bacteria in the ocean exhibiting
   diverse metabolic repertoires and a wide range of symbiotic life-styles.
   Many Roseobacters possess remarkable capabilities of attachment to both
   biotic and abiotic surfaces. When attached to each other, these bacteria
   form multi-cellular structures called rosettes. Phaeobacter inhibens, a
   well-studied Roseobacter, exhibits various cell sizes and morphologies
   that are either associated with rosettes or occur as single cells. Here
   we describe the distribution of P. inhibens morphologies and rosettes
   within a population. We detect an N-acetylglucosamine-containing
   polysaccharide on the poles of some cells and at the center of all
   rosettes. We demonstrate that rosettes are formed by the attachment of
   individual cells at the polysaccharide-containing pole rather than by
   cell division. Finally, we show that P. inhibens attachment to abiotic
   surfaces is hindered by the presence of DNA from itself, but not from
   other bacteria. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that cell
   adhesiveness is likely to play a significant role in the life cycle of
   P. inhibens as well as other Roseobacters.}},

Abstract = {{Allergy against birch pollen is among the most common causes of spring
   pollinosis in Europe and is diagnosed and treated using extracts from
   natural sources. Quality control is crucial for safe and effective
   diagnosis and treatment. However, current methods are very difficult to
   standardize and do not address individual allergen or isoallergen
   composition. MS provides information regarding selected proteins or the
   entire proteome and could overcome the afore-mentioned limitations. We
   studied the proteome of birch pollen, focusing on allergens and
   isoallergens, to clarify which of the 93 published sequence variants of
   the major allergen, Bet v 1, are expressed as proteins within one
   sourcematerial in parallel. The unexpectedly complex Bet v 1 isoallergen
   composition required manual data interpretation and a specific design of
   databases, as current database search engines fail to unambiguously
   assign spectra to highly homologous, partially identical proteins. We
   identified 47 non-allergenic proteins and all 5 known birch pollen
   allergens, and unambiguously proved the existence of 18 Bet v 1
   iso-allergens and variants by manual data analysis. This highly complex
   isoallergen composition raises questions whether isoallergens can be
   ignored or must be included for the quality control of allergen
   products, and which data analysis strategies are to be applied.}},

Abstract = {{The family of the superconducting quasiskutterudites
   (CaxSr1-x)(3)Rh4Sn13 features a structural quantum critical point at
   x(c) = 0.9, around which a dome-shaped variation of the superconducting
   transition temperature Tc is found. Using specific heat, we probe the
   normal and the superconducting states of the entire series straddling
   the quantum critical point. Our analysis indicates a significant
   lowering of the effective Debye temperature on approaching x(c), which
   we interpret as a result of phonon softening accompanying the structural
   instability. Furthermore, a remarkably large enhancement of 2
   Delta/k(B)T(c) and Delta C/gamma T-c beyond the
   Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer values is found in the vicinity of the
   structural quantum critical point. The phase diagram of (CaxSr
   (1-x))(3)Rh4Sn13 thus provides a model system to study the interplay
   between structural quantum criticality and strong electron-phonon
   coupling superconductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Mg Ni mixed metal oxide photocathodes have been prepared by a mixed
   NiCl2/MgCl2 sol-gel process. The MgO/NiO electrodes have been
   extensively characterized using physical and electrochemical methods.
   Dye-sensitized solar cells have been prepared from these films, and the
   higher concentrations of MgO improved the photovoltage of these devices;
   however, there was a notable drop in photo current with increasing Mg2+.
   Charge extraction and XPS experiments revealed that the cause of this
   was a positive shift in the energy of the valence band, which decreased
   the driving force for electron transfer from the NiO film to the dye
   and, therefore, the photocurrent. In addition, increasing concentrations
   of MgO increases the volume of pores between 0.500 and 0.050 mu m, while
   reducing pore volumes in the mesopore range (less than 0.050 mu m) and
   lowering BET surface area from approximately 41 down to 30 m(2) g(-1). A
   MgO concentration of 5\% was found to strike a balance between the
   increased photovoltage and decreased photocurrent, possessing a BET
   surface area of 35 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume in both the meso-
   and macropore range, which lead to a higher overall power conversion
   efficiency than NiO alone.}},

Title = {{Anoctamin Calcium-Activated Chloride Channels May Modulate Inhibitory
   Transmission in the Cerebellar Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Calcium-activated chloride channels of the anoctamin (alias TMEM16)
   protein family fulfill critical functions in epithelial fluid transport,
   smooth muscle contraction and sensory signal processing. Little is
   known, however, about their contribution to information processing in
   the central nervous system. Here we examined the recent finding that a
   calcium-dependent chloride conductance impacts on GABAergic synaptic
   inhibition in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. We asked whether
   anoctamin channels may underlie this chloride conductance. We identified
   two anoctamin channel proteins, ANO1 and ANO2, in the cerebellar cortex.
   ANO1 was expressed in inhibitory interneurons of the molecular layer and
   the granule cell layer. Both channels were expressed in Purkinje cells
   but, while ANO1 appeared to be retained in the cell body, ANO2 was
   targeted to the dendritic tree. Functional studies confirmed that ANO2
   was involved in a calcium-dependent mode of ionic plasticity that
   reduces the efficacy of GABAergic synapses. ANO2 channels attenuated
   GABAergic transmission by increasing the postsynaptic chloride
   concentration, hence reducing the driving force for chloride influx. Our
   data suggest that ANO2 channels are involved in a Ca2+-dependent
   regulation of synaptic weight in GABAergic inhibition. Thus, in balance
   with the chloride extrusion mechanism via the co-transporter KCC2, ANO2
   appears to regulate ionic plasticity in the cerebellum.}},

   nearly constant within the first picoseconds and decays with tau(S) = 15

   transition, where the spin polarization vanishes at the Curie

Title = {{A Farm to Fork Risk Assessment for the Use of Wastewater in Agriculture
   in Accra, Ghana}},
Journal = {{PLoS One}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The need to minimise consumer risk, especially for food that can be
   consumed uncooked, is a continuing public health concern, particularly
   in places where safe sanitation and hygienic practices are absent. The
   use of wastewater in agriculture has been associated with disease risks,
   though its relative significance in disease transmission remains
   unclear. This study aimed at identifying key risk factors for produce
   contamination at different entry points of the food chain. Over 500
   produce and ready-to-eat salad samples were collected from fields,
   markets, and kitchens during the dry and wet seasons in Accra, Ghana,
   and over 300 soil and irrigation water samples were collected. All
   samples were analysed for E. coli, human adenovirus and norovirus using
   standard microbiological procedures, and real time RT-PCR. Finally,
   critical exposures associated with microbial quality of produce were
   assessed through observations and interviews. The study found that over
   80\% of produce samples were contaminated with E. coli, with median
   concentrations ranging from 0.64 to 3.84 Log E. coli/g produce. Prepared
   salad from street food vendors was found to be the most contaminated
   (4.23 Log E. coli/g), and that consumption of salad exceeded acceptable
   health limits. Key risk factors identified for produce contamination
   were irrigation water and soil at the farm level. Storage duration and
   temperature of produce had a significant influence on the quality of
   produce sold at markets, while observations revealed that the washed
   water used to rinse produce before sale was dirty. The source of produce
   and operating with a hygiene permit were found to influence salad
   microbial quality at kitchens. This study argues for a need to manage
   produce risk factors at all domains along the food chain, though it
   would be more effective to prioritise at markets and kitchens due to
   cost, ease of implementation and public health significance.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{813}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We report the discovery by the HATSouth network of HATS-7b, a transiting
   Super-Neptune with a mass of 0.120 +/- 0.012 M-J, a radius of
   0.563(-0.034)(+0.046) R-J, and an orbital period of 3.1853 days. The
   host star is a moderately bright (V = 13.340 +/- 0.010 mag, K-S = 10.976
   +/- 0.026 mag) K dwarf star with a mass of 0.849 +/- 0.027 M-circle dot,
   a radius of 0.815(-0.035)(+0.049) R-circle dot, and a metallicity of
   {[}Fe/H]= +0.250 +/- 0.080. The star is photometrically quiet to within
   the precision of the HATSouth measurements, has low RV jitter, and shows
   no evidence for chromospheric activity in its spectrum. HATS-7b is the
   second smallest radius planet discovered by a wide-field ground-based
   transit survey, and one of only a handful of Neptune-size planets with
   mass and radius determined to 10\% precision. Theoretical modeling of
   HATS-7b yields a hydrogen-helium fraction of 18 +/- 4\% (rock-iron core
   and H-2-He envelope), or 9 +/- 4\% (ice core and H-2-He envelope), i.e.,
   it has a composition broadly similar to that of Uranus and Neptune, and
   very different from that of Saturn, which has 75\% of its mass in
   H-2-He. Based on a sample of transiting exoplanets with accurately
   (<20\%) determined parameters, we establish approximate power-law
   relations for the envelopes of the mass-density distribution of
   exoplanets. HATS-7b, which, together with the recently discovered
   HATS-8b, is one of the first two transiting super-Neptunes discovered in
   the Southern sky, is a prime target for additional follow-up
   observations with Southern hemisphere facilities to characterize the
   atmospheres of Super-Neptunes (which we define as objects with mass
   greater than that of Neptune, and smaller than halfway between that of
   Neptune and Saturn, i.e., 0.054M(J) < M-p < 0.18M(J)).}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we explore the flavor-changing decays H-i -> bs in a
   general supersymmetric scenario. In these models the flavor-changing
   decays arise at loop level, but-because they originate from a
   dimension-four operator-they do not decouple and may provide a first
   sign of new physics for heavy masses beyond the reach of colliders. In
   the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard
   Model, we find that the largest branching ratio of the lightest Higgs
   (H-1) is O(10(-6)) after imposing present experimental constraints,
   while heavy Higgs states may still present branching ratios O(10(-3)).
   In a more general supersymmetric scenario, where additional Higgs states
   may modify the Higgs mixings, the branching ratio BR(H-1 -> bs) can
   reach values O(10(-4)), while heavy Higgses still remain at O(10(-3)).
   Although these values are clearly out of reach for the LHC, a full study
   in a linear collider environment could be worth pursuing.}},

Title = {{One year of free school fruit in Norway-7 years of follow-up}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is important that health-promoting efforts result in
   sustained behavioural changes, preferably throughout life. However, only
   a very few intervention studies evaluate long term follow up. Objective:
   The aim of the present study is to evaluate the overall and up to seven
   years effect of providing daily one piece of fruit or vegetable (FV) for
   free for one school year.
   Methods: A total of 38 randomly drawn elementary schools from two
   counties in Norway participated in the Fruit and Vegetables Make the
   Marks project. Baseline (2001) and follow-up surveys were conducted in
   May 2002, 2005 and 2009 (n = 320 with complete data) to assess FV and
   unhealthy snack intake. Mixed models were used to analyze the data.
   Results: Statistically significant adjusted overall effects of the
   intervention were revealed for FV intake (1.52 times/day) but this
   weakened over time. A significant adjusted overall effect (-1.54
   consumptions/week) and a significant seven-year-follow-up effect (-2.02
   consumptions/week) was found for consumption of unhealthy snacks for
   pupils of parents without higher education.
   Conclusion: One year of free school fruit resulted in higher FV intake
   and lower unhealthy snack intake, however this weakened over time for FV
   intake and became stronger for snack intake. More follow-up studies with
   larger samples and lower attrition rates are needed in order to further
   evaluate the long-term effect.}},

   Current research emphasizes the competition between habits and plans for

   computational efficiency of habitual control to select goals while
   preserving the flexibility of planning to achieve those goals. We
   formalize this mechanism in a reinforcement learning setting, illustrate
   its costs and benefits, and experimentally demonstrate its spontaneous

   cancer cells by selecting for CXCR4-negative cells and increasing
   peptidase CD26}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) may arise due to the
   persistence of drug resistant and cancer initiating cells that survive
   exposure to chemotherapy Proteins responsible for this recurrence
   include the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is known to enable CRC
   metastasis, as well as the cancer initiating cell marker and peptidase
   CD26, which terminates activity of its chemokine CXCL12.
   Methods: We evaluated the expression and function of CXCR4 and CD26 in
   colon cancer cell lines and xenografts following treatment with common
   chemotherapies using radioligand binding, flow cytometry,
   immunofluorescence, and enzymatic assays.
   Results: 5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and SN-38 (the active metabolite of
   irinotecan), as well as cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine, each
   caused decreases in cell surface CXCR4 and concomitant increases in CD26
   on HI 29, 184, HRT-18, 5W480 and 5W620 CRC cell lines. Flow cytometry
   indicated that the decline in CXCR4 was associated with a significant
   loss of CXCR4+/CD26- cells. Elevations in CD26 were paralleled by
   increases in both the intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase activity of CD26 as
   well as its capacity to bind extracellular adenosine deaminase.
   Orthotopic HI 29 xenografts treated with standard CRC chemotherapeutics
   5-tluorouracil, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin showed dramatic increases in
   CD26 compared to untreated tumors. Consistent with the loss of CXCR4 and
   gain in CD26, migratory responses to exogenous CXCL12 were eliminated in
   cells pretreated with cytotoxic agents, although cells retained basal
   motility. Analysis of cancer initiating cell CD44 and CD133 subsets
   revealed drug dependent responses of CD26/CD44/CD133 populations,
   suggesting that the benefits of combining standard chemotherapies
   5-fluoruracil and oxaliplatin may be derived from their complementary
   elimination of cell populations.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that conventional anticancer agents may
   act to inhibit chemokine-mediated migration through eradication of
   CXCR4+ cells and attenuation of chemokine gradients through elevation of
   CD26 activity.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We consider the most general set of SU(2) x U(1) invariant CP-violating
   operators of dimension six, which contribute to VVh interactions (V = W,
   Z, gamma). Our aim is to constrain any CP-violating new physics above
   the electroweak scale via the effective couplings that arise when such
   physics is integrated out. For this purpose, we use, in turn,
   electroweak precision data, global fits of Higgs data at the Large
   Hadron Collider and the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the
   electron. We thus impose constraints mainly on two-parameter and
   three-parameter spaces. We find that the constraints from the
   electroweak precision data are the weakest. Among the existing Higgs
   search channels, considerable constraints come from the diphoton signal
   strength. We note that potential contribution to h -> gamma Z may in
   principle be a useful constraining factor, but it can be utilized only
   in the high energy run. The contributions to electric dipole moments
   mostly lead to the strongest constraints, though somewhat fine-tuned
   combinations of more than one parameter with large magnitudes are
   allowed. We also discuss constraints on gauge boson trilinear couplings
   which depend on the parameters of the CP-violating operators.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fingerprinting is an emerging digital forensic technology that
   has been developed to detect digital forgeries and identify the pirates
   who leak the copies. Understanding the weaknesses and limitations of
   existing fingerprinting schemes and designing anti-forensic approaches
   play an important role in the development of digital fingerprinting. In
   this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM)-based
   anti-forensic method capable of removing the fingerprints from the
   previously marked images for spread-spectrum fingerprinting. We first
   estimate the parameters of the embedded fingerprint superposed on the
   frequency coefficients of the original signal. Then, we select the best
   basis through wavelet packet decomposition for thresholding the
   fingerprinted coefficients. Furthermore, an SVM-based classifier is used
   to measure the existence of the pirates' fingerprints. The experimental
   results show that the proposed method is more effective than the other
   examined approaches. About three pieces of fingerprinted content are
   able to interrupt the fingerprinting system that accommodates thousands
   of users. Meanwhile, high fidelity of the attacked content is retained.

Abstract = {{Turbulence can transport angular momentum in protoplanetary disks and
   influence the growth and evolution of planets. With spatially and
   spectrally resolved molecular emission line measurements provided by
   (sub) millimeter interferometric observations, it is possible to
   directly measure non-thermal motions in the disk gas that can be
   attributed to this turbulence. We report a new constraint on the
   turbulence in the disk around HD 163296, a nearby young A star,
   determined from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Science
   Verification observations of four CO emission lines (the CO(3-2),
   CO(2-1), (CO)-C-13(2-1), and (CO)-O-18(2-1) transitions). The different
   optical depths for these lines permit probes of non-thermal line-widths
   at a range of physical conditions (temperature and density) and depths
   into the disk interior. We derive stringent limits on the non-thermal
   motions in the upper layers of the outer disk such that any contribution
   to the line-widths from turbulence is < 3\% of the local sound speed.
   These limits are approximately an order of magnitude lower than
   theoretical predictions for full-blown magnetohydrodynamic turbulence
   driven by the magnetorotational instability, potentially suggesting that
   this mechanism is less efficient in the outer (R greater than or similar
   to 30 AU) disk than has been previously considered.}},

Title = {{Characterization of mesenchymal stem cells derived from the equine
   synovial fluid and membrane}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in equines, has
   been reported for different tissues including bone marrow, adipose,
   umbilical cord, peripheral blood, and yolk sac. In regard to the MSCs
   derived from synovial fluid (SF) or membrane (SM), there is data
   available for humans, dogs, pigs, goats and horses. Especially in
   equines, these cells have being considered promising candidates for
   articular regeneration. Herein, we established and characterized MSCs
   obtained from equine SF and SM. Samples were obtained during arthroscopy
   and cultured using MEM (Minimum Essential Medium). MSCs were
   characterized by morphology and expression of specific markers for stem
   cells, pluripotency, inflammation, and cell cycle.
   Results: The medium MEM was more effective (97 \% +/- 2) to maintain
   both cultures. The cultures were composed by adherent cells with
   fibroblast-like shape, which had a growth pattern represented by a
   sigmoidal curve. After the expansion, the cells were analyzed by flow
   cytometry for stem cells, inflammatory, and cell cycle markers, and both
   lineages showed significant expression of CD45, Oct3/4, Nanog, CD105,
   CD90, CD34, CD117, CD133, TRA-1-81, VEGF, and LY6a. In contrast, there
   were differences in the cell cycle phases between the lineages, which
   was not observed in relation to the mitochondrial electrical potential.
   Conclusion: Given the large impact that joint pathology has on the
   athletic performance horses, our results suggested that the SF and SM
   are promising sources of stem cells with satisfactory characteristics of
   growth and gene expression that can be used in equine regenerative
   medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The advance of high-throughput sequencing has made it
   possible to obtain new transcriptomes and study splicing mechanisms in
   non-model organisms. In these studies, there is often a need to
   investigate the transcriptomes of two related organisms at the same time
   in order to find the similarities and differences between them. The
   traditional approach to address this problem is to perform de novo
   transcriptome assemblies to obtain predicted transcripts for these
   organisms independently and then employ similarity comparison algorithms
   to study them.
   Results: Instead of obtaining predicted transcripts for these organisms
   separately from the intermediate de Bruijn graph structures employed by
   de novo transcriptome assembly algorithms, we develop an algorithm to
   allow direct comparisons between paths in two de Bruijn graphs by first
   enumerating short paths in both graphs, and iteratively extending paths
   in one graph that have high similarity to paths in the other graph to
   obtain longer corresponding paths between the two graphs. These paths
   represent predicted transcripts that are present in both organisms. We
   show that our algorithm recovers significantly more shared transcripts
   than traditional approaches by applying it to simultaneously recover
   transcripts in mouse against rat and in mouse against human from
   publicly available RNA-Seq libraries. Our strategy utilizes sequence
   similarity information within the paths that is often more reliable than
   coverage information.
   Conclusions: Our approach generalizes the pairwise sequence alignment
   problem to allow the input to be non-linear structures, and provides a
   heuristic to reliably recover similar paths from the two structures. Our
   algorithm allows detailed investigation of the similarities and
   differences in alternative splicing between the two organisms at both
   the sequence and structure levels, even in the absence of reference
   transcriptomes or a closely related model organism.}},

Abstract = {{Emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, and specifically
   resistance to third generation cephalosporins associated with extended
   spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) activity, is one of the greatest
   epidemiological challenges of our time. In this study we addressed the
   impact of the third generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone on microbial
   activity and bacterial community composition of two physically and
   chemically distinct undisturbed soils in highly regulated microcosm
   experiments. Surprisingly, periodical irrigation of the soils with
   clinical doses of cettriaxone did not affect their microbial activity;
   and only moderately impacted the microbial diversity (a and N of the two
   soils. Corresponding slurry experiments demonstrated that the antibiotic
   capacity of ceftriaxone rapidly diminished in the presence of soil, and
   70\% of this inactivation could be explained by biological activity. The
   biological nature of ceftriaxone degradation in soil was supported by
   microcosm experiments that amended model Escherichia call strains to
   sterile and non-sterile soils in the presence and absence of ceftriaxone
   and by the ubiquitous presence of ESBL genes (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and
   blaOXA) in soil DNA extracts. Collectively, these results suggest that
   the resistance of soil microbiomes to ceftriaxone stems from biological
   activity and even more, from broad-spectrum f beta-lactamase activity;
   raising questions regarding the scope and clinical implications of ESBLs

   effects against a synthetic, multi-epitope, long peptide from rat
   Her2/neu (rHer2/neu) using the help of CD4+ T cells and appropriate
   adjuvant in a mouse tumor model. Female BALB/c mice were vaccinated with

   lymphocytes (CTL) in combination with a universal Pan DR epitope (PADRE)
   or CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) as a Toll-like receptor agonist
   adjuvant. The results show that vaccination with the multi-epitope long
   peptide in combination with the PADRE peptide and CpG-ODN induced
   expansion of subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ cells producing IFN-gamma,
   the average tumor size in the vaccinated mice was less than that of the

   vaccinated group. The mean survival time was 82.6 +/- 1.25 days in mice

Abstract = {{10 homeopathic remedies commercially available (each in 3 dilutions) as
   sugar granules, where half of them were of organic (and half inorganic)
   origin were subjected to solid-state infrared spectroscopy, both in
   middle infrared (ATR-FTIR) and near infrared (NIR) range. Measurements
   were repeated six times (six days, each sample was measured once in the
   same day, samples were measured in random order). The obtained spectra
   was subjected to unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (PLS-DA) chemometric
   techniques to check any visible differnces in spectral data between
   homeopathic remedies, including also feature selection approaches. It
   can be concluded that the only one information encoded in this dataset
   is the atmospheric drift of spectra between consecutive measurement
   days. This proves that homeopathy is not ``infrared visible{''} in the
   case of proper experimental design. These results can be useful in
   further investigations of possible mechanisms of action of homeopathy
   (if they exist). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Nonsignaling quantum random access-code boxes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{A well-known cryptographic primitive is the so-called random access
   code. Namely, Alice is to send to Bob one of two bits, so that Bob has
   the choice of which bit he wants to learn about. However, at any time,
   Alice should not learn Bob's choice, and Bob should learn only the bit
   of his choice. The task is impossible to accomplish by means of either
   classical or quantum communication. On the other hand, a concept of
   correlations stronger than quantum ones, exhibited by the so-called
   Popescu-Rohrlich box, was introduced and widely studied. In particular,
   it is known that the Popescu-Rohrlich box enables simulation of the
   random access code with the support of one bit of communication. Here,
   we propose a quantum analog of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an
   analog of a random access code, where instead of classical bits, one
   encodes qubits. We provide a quantum nonsignaling box that if supported
   with two classical bits, allows one to simulate a quantum version of a
   random access code. We point out that two bits are necessary. We also
   show that a quantum random access code cannot be fully quantum: when Bob
   inputs the superposition of two choices, the output will be in a mixed
   state rather than in a superposition of required states.}},

Title = {{Can we measure beauty? Computational evaluation of coral reef aesthetics}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The natural beauty of coral reefs attracts millions of tourists
   worldwide resulting in substantial revenues for the adjoining economies.
   Although their visual appearance is a pivotal factor attracting humans
   to coral reefs current monitoring protocols exclusively target
   biogeochemical parameters, neglecting changes in their aesthetic
   appearance. Here we introduce a standardized computational approach to
   assess coral reef environments based on 109 visual features designed to
   evaluate the aesthetic appearance of art. The main feature groups
   include color intensity and diversity of the image, relative size,
   color, and distribution of discernable objects within the image, and
   texture. Specific coral reef aesthetic values combining all 109 features
   were calibrated against an established biogeochemical assessment (NCEAS)
   using machine learning algorithms. These values were generated for
   similar to 2,100 random photographic images collected from 9 coral reef
   locations exposed to varying levels of anthropogenic influence across 2
   ocean systems. Aesthetic values proved accurate predictors of the NCEAS
   scores (root mean square error <5 for N >= 3) and significantly
   correlated to microbial abundance at each site. This shows that
   mathematical approaches designed to assess the aesthetic appearance of
   photographic images can be used as an inexpensive monitoring tool for
   coral reef ecosystems. It further suggests that human perception of
   aesthetics is not purely subjective but influenced by inherent reactions
   towards measurable visual cues. By quantifying aesthetic features of
   coral reef systems this method provides a cost efficient monitoring tool
   that targets one of the most important socioeconomic values of coral
   reefs directly tied to revenue for its local population.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a new computationally efficient algorithm to
   determine a lower bound on the real structured singular value . The
   algorithm is based on a pole migration approach where an optimization
   solver is used to compute a lower bound on real independent of a
   frequency sweep. A distinguishing feature of this algorithm from other
   frequency independent one-shot tests is that multiple localized optima
   (if they exist) are identified and returned from the search. This is
   achieved by using a number of alternative methods to generate different
   initial conditions from which the optimization solver can initiate its
   search from. The pole migration algorithm presented has also been
   extended to determine lower bounds for complex parametric uncertainties
   as well as full complex blocks. However, the results presented are for
   strictly real and repeated parametric uncertainty problems as this class
   of problem is the focus of this paper and are in general the most
   difficult to solve. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Investigating the role of filamin C in Belgian patients with
   frontotemporal dementia linked to GRN deficiency in FTLD-TDP brains}},
Journal = {{ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions are pathological
   hallmarks of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Loss of TDP-43 in zebrafish
   engenders a severe muscle and vascular phenotype with a concomitant
   elevation of filamin C (FLNC) levels, an observation confirmed in the
   frontal cortex of FTLD-TDP patients. Here, we aimed to further assess
   the contribution of FLNC to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) etiology. We
   conducted a mutational screening of FLNC in a cohort of 529 unrelated
   Belgian FTD and FTD-ALS patients, and a control cohort of 920 unrelated
   and age-matched individuals. Additionally we performed an in-depth
   characterization of FLNC expression levels in FTD patients and a murine
   FTD model.
   In total 68 missense variants were identified of which 19 (MAF < 1 \%)
   were patient-only. Gene burden analysis demonstrated a significant
   association between the presence of rare variants in FLNC and disease (P
   = 0.0349, RR = 1.46 {[}95 \% CI 1.03-2.07]). Furthermore, elevated FLNC
   expression levels, observed previously in FTLD-TDP patients, were mainly
   attributable to FTD patients with the progranulin (GRN) p.0(IVS1 + 5G >
   C) loss-of-function mutation. Increased FLNC levels were, to a lesser
   extent, also identified in a FLNC p.V831I variant carrier and in FTD
   patients with the p.R159H mutation in valosin-containing protein (VCP).
   The GRN-associated increase of FLNC was confirmed in the frontal cortex
   of aged Grn knockout mice starting at 16-18 months of age. Combined
   quantitative proteomic and bioinformatic analyses of the frontal cortex
   of FTD patients possessing elevated FLNC levels, identified multiple
   altered protein factors involved in accelerated aging, neurodegeneration
   and synaptogenesis.
   Our findings further support the involvement of aberrant FLNC expression
   levels in FTD pathogenesis. Identification of increased FLNC levels in
   aged Grn mice and impaired pathways related to aging and
   neurodegeneration, implies a potential role for FLNC in mediating or
   accelerating the aging process.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality
   in men, but a method for accurate prognosis in these patients is yet to
   be developed. The recent discovery of altered endosomal biogenesis in
   prostate cancer has identified a fundamental change in the cell biology
   of this cancer, which holds great promise for the identification of
   novel biomarkers that can predict disease outcomes. Here we have
   identified significantly altered expression of endosomal genes in
   prostate cancer compared to non-malignant tissue in mRNA microarrays and
   confirmed these findings by qRT-PCR on fresh-frozen tissue. Importantly,
   we identified endosomal gene expression patterns that were predictive of
   patient outcomes. Two endosomal tri-gene signatures were identified from
   a previously published microarray cohort and had a significant capacity
   to stratify patient outcomes. The expression of APPL1, RAB5A, EEA1,
   PDCD6IP, NOX4 and SORT1 were altered in malignant patient tissue, when
   compared to indolent and normal prostate tissue. These findings support
   the initiation of a case-control study using larger cohorts of prostate
   tissue, with documented patient outcomes, to determine if different
   combinations of these new biomarkers can accurately predict disease
   status and clinical progression in prostate cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art coronagraphs employed on extreme adaptive optics
   enabled instruments are constantly improving the contrast detection
   limit for companions at ever-closer separations from the host star. In
   order to constrain their properties and, ultimately, compositions, it is
   important to precisely determine orbital parameters and contrasts with
   respect to the stars they orbit. This can be difficult in the
   post-coronagraphic image plane, as by definition the central star has
   been occulted by the coronagraph. We demonstrate the flexibility of
   utilizing the deformable mirror in the adaptive optics system of the
   Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system to generate a field
   of speckles for the purposes of calibration. Speckles can be placed up
   to 22.5 lambda/D from the star, with any position angle, brightness, and
   abundance required. Most importantly, we show that a fast modulation of
   the added speckle phase, between 0 and pi, during a long science
   integration renders these speckles effectively incoherent with the
   underlying halo. We quantitatively show for the first time that this
   incoherence, in turn, increases the robustness and stability of the
   adaptive speckles, which will improve the precision of astrometric and
   photometric calibration procedures. This technique will be valuable for
   high-contrast imaging observations with imagers and integral field
   spectrographs alike.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and transport properties of the family of coinage
   metal-stuffed Zintl compounds, Eu9Cd4-xCM2+x-y square Sb-y(9) (CM =
   coinage metal, square = vacancies), is presented as a function of
   coinage metal substitution. Eu9Cd4-xCM2+x-y square Sb-y(9) compounds are
   shown to be rare examples of metallic Zintl phases with low thermal
   conductivities. While the lattice thermal conductivity is low, which is
   attributed to the complex structure and presence of interstitials, the
   electronic contribution to thermal conductivity is also low. In these
   p-type compounds, the carriers transmit less heat than expected, based
   on the Wiedemann-Franz law and metallic conduction, k(e)= L0T/rho.
   Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the Fermi
   level resides in a pseudogap, which is consistent with the metallic
   description of the properties. While the contribution from the
   interstitial CM states to the Fermi level is small, the interstitial CMs
   are required to tune the position of the Fermi level. Analysis of the
   topology of electron localization function (ELF) basins reveals the
   multicenter Eu-Cd(CM)-Sb interactions, as the Eu and Sb states have the
   largest contribution at the top of the valence band. Regardless of the
   success of the Zintl concept in the rationalization of the properties,
   the representation of the CM-stuffed Eu9Cd4Sb9 structure as Eu cations
   encapsulated into a polyanionic (Cd/Cu)Sb network is oversimplified and
   underestimates the importance of the Eu-Sb bonding interactions. These
   results provide motivation to search for more efficient thermoelectric
   materials among complex metallic structures that can offer less
   electronic thermal conductivity without deteriorating the electrical
   conductivity.}},

Title = {{A census of alpha-helical membrane proteins in double-stranded DNA
   viruses infecting bacteria and archaea}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse
   biological entities on earth, yet the repertoire of viral proteins
   remains poorly explored. As the number of sequenced virus genomes grows
   into the thousands, and the number of viral proteins into the hundreds
   of thousands, we report a systematic computational analysis of the point
   of first-contact between viruses and their hosts, namely viral
   transmembrane (TM) proteins.
   Results: The complement of a-helical TM proteins in double-stranded DNA
   viruses infecting bacteria and archaea reveals large-scale trends that
   differ from those of their hosts. Viruses typically encode a
   substantially lower fraction of TM proteins than archaea or bacteria,
   with the notable exception of viruses with virions containing a lipid
   component such as a lipid envelope, internal lipid core, or inner
   membrane vesicle. Compared to bacteriophages, archaeal viruses are
   substantially enriched in membrane proteins. However, this feature is
   not always stable throughout the evolution of a viral lineage; for
   example, TM proteins are not part of the common heritage shared between
   Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In contrast to bacteria and archaea,
   viruses almost completely lack proteins with complicated membrane
   topologies composed of more than 4 TM segments, with the few detected
   exceptions being obvious cases of relatively recent horizontal transfer
   from the host.
   Conclusions: The dramatic differences between the membrane proteomes of
   cells and viruses stem from the fact that viruses do not depend on
   essential membranes for energy transformation, ion homeostasis, nutrient
   transport and signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The combinational delivery of doxorubicin and curcumin in a physically
   loaded nanocarrier offers the benefits of enhanced therapeutic efficacy
   and reduced adverse effects, but this strategy often suffers from the
   slow drug release followed by delayed onset of pharmacological action.
   This work reported the hydrazone-linked polymer-curcumin conjugate
   micelles containing physically loaded doxorubicin to address this
   problem; the ester-linked conjugate micelles were produced as the
   control. The pH-labile spherical micelles were less than 100 nmwith a
   loading at 9.3 +/- 0.5\% (w/w, Curcumin) and 2.5 +/- 0.1(w/w,
   Doxorubicin). Both agents were released at a faster rate in the
   pH-labile micelles compared to the control. The confocal laser scanning
   microscopy revealed a time-dependent co-localization of both agents in
   HepG2 cells. The IC50 of pH-labile conjugate micelles without
   doxorubicin in HepG2 cells was 27.7 +/- 5.3 (mu M), whereas the
   co-loaded micelles was lowered to 10.8 +/- 3.4 (mu M) (Cur-equivalent
   dose). The combination index calculation demonstrated a synergistic
   action of both agents in the co-loading nanocarrier. The current work
   provided an efficient nanocarrier system to achieve rapid on-demand drug
   release without onset delay of therapeutic action, which might add value
   to the clinical translation of the combinational delivery systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Aimed at improved durability and catalytic activity for oxygen reduction
   reaction, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with nitrogen, phosphorus and boron
   dopants have been synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of acetylene
   on electrolessly-plated copper foams. The as-prepared CNFs were
   extensively characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman analysis. Without any
   functionalization, the as-prepared CNF was employed as support for 40
   wt.\% Pt electrocatalyst (Pt/CNF). In an accelerated stability test
   (AST), Pt/CNF displayed higher stability relative to the
   state-of-the-art electrocatalyst from Johnson Matthey (Pt/C-JM) with the
   same Pt loading. TEM images after AST for Pt/CNF were obtained and found
   that the doped carbon nanofiber support is more resistant to corrosion.
   At the meantime, the catalytic activity to oxygen reduction for Pt/CNF
   surpassed Pt/C-JM by more positive on-set potential. CNFs with N, P and
   B dopants synthesized in this work should have promised applications for
   polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dysregulated splicing of pre-messenger (m) RNA is considered a molecular
   occasion of carcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism is complex
   and remains to be investigated. Herein, we report that the upregulated
   miR-92a reduced the RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4) protein expression,
   leading to the imbalanced expression of the neuronal polypyrimidine
   tract-binding (nPTB) protein through alternative splicing-coupled
   nonsense mediated decay (NMD) mechanism. Increase in nPTB protein
   enhances the relative level of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIc
   (FGFR2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) transcripts which contribute to
   the progression and metabolic signature of CRC cells. Expression
   profiles of RBM4 and downstream alternative splicing events are
   consistently observed in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal
   tissues. These results constitute a mechanistic understanding of RBM4 on
   repressing the carcinogenesis of colorectal cells.}},

Title = {{Battle between influenza A virus and a newly identified antiviral

Abstract = {{Previous studies showed that ZAPL (PARP-13.1) exerts its antiviral
   activity via its N-terminal zinc fingers that bind the mRNAs of some
   viruses, leading to mRNA degradation. Here we identify a different
   antiviral activity of ZAPL that is directed against influenza A virus.
   This ZAPL antiviral activity involves its C-terminal PARP domain, which
   binds the viral PB2 and PA polymerase proteins, leading to their
   proteasomal degradation. After the PB2 and PA proteins are
   poly(ADP-ribosylated), they are associated with the region of ZAPL that
   includes both the PARP domain and the adjacent WWE domain that is known
   to bind poly(ADP-ribose) chains. These ZAPL-associated PB2 and PA
   proteins are then ubiquitinated, followed by proteasomal degradation.
   This antiviral activity is counteracted by the viral PB1 polymerase
   protein, which binds close to the PARP domain and causes PB2 and PA to
   dissociate from ZAPL and escape degradation, explaining why ZAPL only
   moderately inhibits influenza A virus replication. Hence influenza A
   virus has partially won the battle against this newly identified ZAPL
   antiviral activity. Eliminating PB1 binding to ZAPL would be expected to
   substantially increase the inhibition of influenza A virus replication,
   so that the PB1 interface with ZAPL is a potential target for antiviral
   development.}},

Abstract = {{TRIM-NHL proteins are conserved among metazoans and control cell fate
   decisions in various stem cell linages. The Drosophila TRIM-NHL protein
   Brain tumor (Brat) directs differentiation of neuronal stem cells by
   suppressing self-renewal factors. Brat is an RNA-binding protein and
   functions as a translational repressor. However, it is unknown which
   RNAs Brat regulates and how RNA-binding specificity is achieved. Using
   RNA immunoprecipitation and RNAcompete, we identify Brat-bound mRNAs in
   Drosophila embryos and define consensus binding motifs for Brat as well
   as a number of additional TRIM-NHL proteins, indicating that TRIM-NHL
   proteins are conserved, sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. We
   demonstrate that Brat-mediated repression and direct RNA-binding depend
   on the identified motif and show that binding of the localization factor
   Miranda to the Brat-NHL domain inhibits Brat activity. Finally, to
   unravel the sequence specificity of the NHL domain, we crystallize the
   BratNHL domain in complex with RNA and present a high-resolution
   protein-RNA structure of this fold.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic, electronic and optical properties of Co2-xEuxVSn alloys

   investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   utilizing full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW)
   method. It was found that doping the Co2VSn alloy with rare-earth ions
   like Eu generates the nonstoichiometric Co2-xEuxVSn and changes its
   original behavior from half ferromagnetic material to a metallic one. In
   addition, the total magnetic moment was found to increase with
   increasing dopant concentration with maximum local magnetic
   contributions on the Eu-sites. The optical dielectric functions as well
   as their static value for all the above alloys were also investigated.
   Moreover, the absorption coefficient, reflectivity and refractive
   indices were calculated. All the optical calculations were found to
   agree well with the band structure calculations when determining the
   alloys' half-metallic behavior. Finally, the nonstoichiometric metallic
   compounds found in this series might be useful in the flat panel

Abstract = {{An energy-aware virtual topology rating system is proposed in this work,
   which can be utilized as a tool during the virtual topology
   reconfiguration procedure in an optical backbone network in order to
   reduce its energy consumption. It is well known that maintaining a
   static virtual topology in Internet Protocol (IP)-over-Wavelength
   Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks is not energy-efficient. To that
   end, virtual topology adaptation algorithms have been developed to
   adjust the virtual topology to the constantly fluctuating traffic load.
   While these algorithms achieve significant energy savings, further
   reduction on the total network energy consumption can be achieved
   through the proposed rating system. The proposed rating system is a
   modified version of the page rank algorithm, which ranks websites in the
   Internet based on their importance. The proposed rating system
   attributes ratings to lightpaths, which indicate the relative
   significance of a lightpath in the virtual topology in terms of energy
   consumption. The rating can be used during the routing procedure as an
   energy efficiency indicator, in order to increase the number of
   lightpaths that are deactivated from the reconfiguration mechanism and
   increase the utilization per lightpath. The proposed reconfiguration
   scheme (page rank-based virtual topology reconfiguration) achieves up to
   12\% additional energy savings in comparison to an existing virtual
   topology reconfiguration algorithm at the cost of slightly increased
   average hop distance. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   and phase structures using four-wave mixing in photorefractive

   filtering in the Fourier domain. Specifically, the nonlinear transfer
   function describing four-wave mixing is modeled, and the theory for
   detection of amplitude and phase defects and dislocations are developed.
   Furthermore, numerical simulations are performed for these cases. The
   results show that this technique successfully detects the slightest
   defects clearly even with no prior enhancement. This technique should
   prove to be useful in quality control systems, production-line defect

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{356}},
Pages = {{181-194}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between bladed wheels and the fluid distributed by the
   stator vanes results in cyclic loading of the rotating components.
   Compressors and turbines wheels are subject to vibration and fatigue
   issues, especially when resonance conditions are excited. Even if
   resonance conditions can be often predicted and avoided, high cycle
   fatigue failures can occur, causing safety issues and economic loss.
   Rigorous maintenance programs are then needed, forcing the system to
   expensive shut-down. Blade crack detection methods are beneficial for
   condition-based maintenance. While contact measurement systems are not
   always usable in exercise conditions (e.g. high temperature),
   non-contact methods can be more suitable. One (or more) stator-fixed
   sensor can measure all the blades as they pass by, in order to detect
   the damaged ones. The main drawback in this situation is the short
   acquisition time available for each blade, which is shortened by the
   high rotational speed of the components. A traditional Discrete Fourier
   Transform (NT) analysis would result in a poor frequency resolution. A
   Non-Harmonic Fourier Analysis (NHFA) can be executed with an arbitrary
   frequency resolution instead, allowing to obtain frequency information
   even with short-Lime data samples. This paper shows an analytical
   investigation of the NHFA method. A data processing algorithm is then
   proposed to obtain frequency shift information from short time samples.
   The performances of this algorithm are then studied by experimental and
   numerical tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic regulation of chromatin structure is required to modulate the
   transcription of genes in eukaryotes. However, the factors that
   contribute to the plasticity of heterochromatin structure are elusive.
   Here, we report that cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), a transcription
   elongation-associated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) kinase, antagonizes
   heterochromatin enrichment in Drosophila chromosomes. Notably, loss of
   CDK12 induces the ectopic accumulation of heterochromatin protein 1
   (HP1) on euchromatic arms, with a prominent enrichment on the X
   chromosome. Furthermore, ChIP and sequencing analysis reveals that the
   heterochromatin enrichment on the X chromosome mainly occurs within long
   genes involved in neuronal functions. Consequently, heterochromatin
   enrichment reduces the transcription of neuronal genes in the adult
   brain and results in a defect in Drosophila courtship learning. Taken
   together, these results define a previously unidentified role of CDK12
   in controlling the epigenetic transition between euchromatin and
   heterochromatin and suggest a chromatin regulatory mechanism in neuronal
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Concordance indices are used to assess the degree of agreement between
   different methods that measure the same characteristic. In this context,
   the total deviation index (TDI) is an unscaled concordance measure that
   quantifies to which extent the readings from the same subject obtained
   by different methods may differ with a certain probability. Common
   approaches to estimate the TDI assume data are normally distributed and
   linearity between response and effects (subjects, methods and random
   error). Here, we introduce a new non-parametric methodology for
   estimation and inference of the TDI that can deal with any kind of
   quantitative data. The present study introduces this non-parametric
   approach and compares it with the already established methods in two
   real case examples that represent situations of non-normal data (more
   specifically, skewed data and count data). The performance of the
   already established methodologies and our approach in these contexts is
   assessed by means of a simulation study. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel hierarchical multirate control scheme for
   nonlinear discrete-time systems is presented, consisting of a robust
   nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) and a multirate sliding
   mode disturbance compensator (MSMDC). The proposed MSMDC acts at a
   faster rate than the NMPC in order to keep the system as close as
   possible to the nominal trajectory predicted by NMPC despite model
   uncertainties and external disturbances. The a priori disturbance
   compensation turns out to be very useful in order to improve the
   robustness of the NMPC controller. A dynamic input allocation between
   MSMDC and NMPC allows to maximize the benefits of the proposed scheme
   that unites the advantages of sliding mode control (strong reduction of
   matched disturbances, low computational burden) to those of NMPC
   (optimality, constraints handling). Sufficient conditions required to
   guarantee input-to-state stability and constraints satisfaction by the
   overall scheme are also provided. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A central tenet of Rescorla and Wagner's model of associative learning
   is that the reinforcement value of a paired trial diminishes as the
   associative strength between the presented stimuli increases. Despite
   its fundamental importance to behavioral sciences, the neural mechanisms
   underlying the model have not been fully explored. Here, we present
   findings that, taken together, can explain why a stronger association
   leads to a reduced reinforcement value, within the context of eyeblink
   conditioning. Specifically, we show that learned pause responses in
   Purkinje cells, which trigger adaptively timed conditioned eyeblinks,
   suppress the unconditional stimulus (US) signal in a graded manner.
   Furthermore, by examining how Purkinje cells respond to two distinct
   conditional stimuli and to a compound stimulus, we provide evidence that
   could potentially help explain the somewhat counterintuitive
   overexpectation phenomenon, which was derived from the Rescorla-Wagner
   model.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the experiments of gas-assisted extrusion (GAE) for
   molten polypropylene were carried out under different gas pressures, the
   different extrudate deformations and sharkskin defects of melt were
   observed. To ascertain the effects of gas on melt extrusion,
   non-isothermal numerical simulation of GAE based on gas/melt two-phase
   fluid model was proposed and studied. In the simulations, the melt
   extruded profile, physical field distributions (velocities, pressure
   drop, and first normal stress difference) were obtained. Numerical
   results showed that the deformation degree of melt increased with
   increasing gas pressure, which was in good agreement with experimental
   results. It was demonstrated that the influence of gas pressure on the
   melt extrusion could be well reflected by GAE simulation based on
   gas/melt two-phase fluid model rather than simplified-GAE (SGAE) based
   on full-slip wall boundary condition used in the past time. Experimental
   and numerical results demonstrate that the gas pressure induced first
   normal stress difference is the main reason of triggering flow behavior
   changes, extrudate deformations, and sharkskin defects of melt.
   Therefore, the reasonable controlling of gas pressure is a key in
   practice of GAE, and the gas layer and its influence should be
   considered in GAE numerical simulation. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Tromethamine, a UV-transparent amine base excipient, was used in the
   liquid phase of a self-emulsifying drug delivery system-soft gelatin
   capsule (SEDDS-SGC) formulation as an emulsification agent and to
   improve solubilization of the active drug. The level of this excipient
   as found to be decreasing in aged and stressed drug product capsules.
   The decrease could potentially affect oral bioavailability of the drug;
   should the amount of solubilizer decrease enough to lead to
   precipitation of the active drug from the formulation. Therefore,
   further investigation was warranted. HPLC coupled with evaporative light
   scattering detection (ELSD) was used to monitor the physical and
   chemical stability of tromethamine in the SEDDS-SGC formulation.
   Confirmation of the tromethamine interaction products was done by LC-MS.

Abstract = {{Background: The detection of BRAFV600 mutations in patients with
   metastatic melanoma is important because of the availability of BRAF
   inhibitor therapy. However, the clinical relevance of the frequency of
   BRAFV600 mutant alleles is unclear.
   Patients and Methods: Allele frequencies of BRAFV600 mutations were
   analyzed by ultra-deep next-generation sequencing in formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded melanoma tissue (75 primary melanomas and 88 matched
   metastases). In a second study, pretreatment specimens from 76 patients
   who received BRAF inhibitors were retrospectively analyzed, and BRAFV600
   allele frequencies were correlated with therapeutic results.
   Results: Thirty-five patients had concordantly BRAF-positive and 36
   (48\%) patients had concordantly BRAF-negative primary melanomas and
   matched metastases, and four patients had discordant samples with low
   allele frequencies (3.4-5.2\%). Twenty-six of 35 patients with
   concordant samples had BRAFV600E mutations, three of whom had additional
   mutations (V600K in two patients and V600R in one) and nine patients had
   exclusively non-V600E mutations (V600K in eight patients and V600E
   -c.1799\_1800TG > AA- in one patient). The frequency of mutated BRAFV600
   alleles was similar in the primary melanoma and matched metastasis in
   27/35 patients, but differed by > 3-fold in 8/35 of samples. BRAFV600E
   allele frequencies in pretreatment tumor specimens were not
   significantly correlated with treatment outcomes in 76 patients with
   metastatic melanoma who were treated with BRAF inhibitors.
   Conclusions: BRAFV600 mutation status and allele frequency is consistent
   in the majority of primary melanomas and matched metastases. A small
   subgroup of patients has double mutations. BRAFV600 allele frequencies
   are not correlated with the response to BRAF inhibitors.}},

Title = {{Utilization of Donors with Hepatitis B Core Antibodies in Liver
   Transplantation}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: At present, the scarcity of organs is one of the major
   problems in transplantation. We present our own experience in expanding
   the acceptance criteria for deceased donors. We aimed to evaluate the
   potential impact of using hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antibody
   (anti-HBc)-positive donor grafts on the long-term liver transplantation
   results.
   Material/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 324 consecutive
   liver transplantation procedures performed in the largest transplant
   center in Poland, between January 2007 and February 2012. These patients
   included 36 who had received a liver from anti-HBc-positive donors.
   Results: The presence of anti-HBc antibodies in the donor did not have a
   significant negative impact on the overall 3-year patient or graft
   survival rates. Among recipients with pre-transplant HBV infection,
   patients who received an organ from an anti-HBc-positive donor tended to
   have an improved survival rate compared with patients who received liver
   transplants from seronegative donors (p=0.080). However, there was a
   statistically significant reduction in graft survival (p=0.035) in the
   recipients without serological markers of HBV infection who received
   liver transplants harvested from anti-HBc-positive donors.
   Conclusions: These results confirm the validity of extending the
   acceptance criteria to anti-HBc-positive donors, particularly for
   patients with a prior HBV infection. Despite the increased risk of graft
   loss, liver transplantation from anti-HBc-positive donors among
   recipients not infected with HBV may also be considered in appropriate
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{A new voltammetric method of hydrocortisone (HC) determination using
   renewable mercury film electrode is presented. The electrode mechanism
   reaction of HC was studied and the influence of instrumental parameters

   range from 0.02.10(-6) mol L-1 (7.25.10(-6) g L-1) to 1.2.10(-6) mol L-1
   (0.44.10(-3) g L-1), with a detection limit of 4.8.10(-9) mol L-1 for
   preconcentration time of 30 s. Repeatability of method was determined as
   RSD \% for hydrocortisone concentration of 0.2.10(-6) mol L-1 as 4.6 \%
   (n = 9). The proposed method was successfully applied and validated by
   studying the recovery of hydrocortisone in pharmaceutical products. (C)

Abstract = {{Physicochemical characterization of microfibers including powder X-ray
   diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, attenuated total
   reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and positron
   annihilation spectroscopy were used to track the crystalline-amorphous
   transition of carvedilol during formulation and stability testing. The
   applied methods unanimously indicated the amorphous transition of
   carvedilol in the course of rotary spinning, furthermore a
   supramolecular ordering of chains of polymer matrix was revealed out by
   positron annihilation spectroscopy. The accelerated stability study (40
   +/- 2 degrees C/75 +/- 5\% RH, for 4 weeks) indicated a large stress
   tolerance capacity of fibers, since only a partial crystallization of
   the active compound was observable at the last sampling point. To
   demonstrate possible utilization of microfibers, orodispersible tablets
   containing 10 mg of carvedilol were successfully prepared by direct
   compression applying common tableting excipients. All of the
   investigated tablet parameters (hardness, friability, in vitro
   disintegration time) complied with the pharmacopoeial requirements. The
   performed dissolution (pH 1.0 and 6.8) study indicated that the drug
   dissolution from the microfiber based formula was rapid, complete and
   independent from the pH of the applied media, while the dissolution from
   the control tablets, containing crystalline carvedilol was incomplete
   and was strongly influenced by the pH of the applied media. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an improvement to Integral Force Feedback UFO, which
   is a popular method for active vibration control of structures and
   mechanical systems. Benefits of IFF include robustness, guaranteed
   stability and simplicity. However, the maximum damping performance is
   dependent on the stiffness of the system; hence, some systems cannot be
   adequately controlled. In this paper, an improvement to the classical
   force feedback control scheme is proposed. The improved method achieves
   arbitrary damping for any mechanical system by introducing a
   feed-through term. The proposed improvement is experimentally
   demonstrated by actively damping an objective lens assembly for a
   highspeed confocal microscope. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work aims to evaluate the potential of reverse micelles prepared
   from amphiphilic polylactide-b-poly( ethylene glycol) (PLA-b-PEG) block
   copolymers for controlled release of hydrophilic drugs. Different
   PLA-b-PEG diblock and triblock copolymers were synthesized by
   ring-opening polymerization of D-or L-lactide in the presence of a PEG
   macroinitiator. Reverse micelles were prepared by self-assembly of
   copolymers in a solvent/co-solvent/water system. Toluene was used as
   solvent, and ethanol as co-solvent to solubilize appropriate amount of
   water. The resulting nano-sized reverse micelles were able to
   encapsulate heparin in the hydrophilic core. Dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to determine
   the size and morphology of reverse micelles. The results show that
   reverse micelles are spherical in shape with sizes below 100 nm. Drug
   loaded reverse micelles were embedded in biocompatible membranes by
   mixing with 10\% PLA solution in toluene with 1: 3 volume ratio. In
   vitro release studies were realized in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at
   37 degrees C. Heparin was almost totally released within 24 h. Triblock
   copolymer reverse micelles exhibited faster drug release than diblock
   ones probably due to the more compact micelle structure of the latter.
   Therefore, PLA-b-PEG reverse micelles could be promising for
   applications as carrier of hydrophilic drugs when embedded in
   biocompatible membranes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{44}},
Pages = {{6692-6703}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of cytochrome
   P450cam are subtly altered when the cysteine that coordinates to the
   heme iron is replaced with a selenocysteine. To map the effects of the
   sulfur-to-selenium substitution on the individual steps of the catalytic
   cycle, we conducted a comparative kinetic analysis of the selenoenzyme
   and its cysteine counterpart. Our results show that the more
   electron-donating selenolate ligand has only negligible effects on
   substrate, product, and oxygen binding, electron transfer, catalytic
   turnover, and coupling efficiency. Off-pathway reduction of oxygen to
   give superoxide is the only step significantly affected by the mutation.
   Incorporation of selenium accelerates this uncoupling reaction
   approximately 50-fold compared to sulfur, but because the second
   electron transfer step is much faster, the impact on overall catalytic
   turnover is minimal. Density functional theory calculations with pure
   and hybrid functionals suggest that superoxide formation is governed by
   a delicate interplay of spin distribution, spin state, and structural
   effects. In light of the remarkably similar electronic structures and
   energies calculated for the sulfur- and selenium-containing enzymes, the
   ability of the heavier atom to enhance the rate of spin crossover may
   account for the experimental observations. Because the selenoenzyme
   closely mimics wild-type P450cam, even at the level of individual steps
   in the reaction cycle, selenium represents a unique mechanistic probe
   for analyzing the role of the proximal ligand and spin crossovers in
   P450 chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental objective in membrane biology is to understand and predict
   how a protein sequence folds and orients in a lipid bilayer.
   Establishing the principles governing membrane protein folding is
   central to understanding the molecular basis formembrane proteins that
   display multiple topologies, the intrinsic dynamic organization of
   membrane proteins, and membrane protein conformational disorders
   resulting in disease. We previously established that lactose permease of
   Escherichia coli displays a mixture of topological conformations and
   undergoes postassembly bidirectional changes in orientation within the
   lipid bilayer triggered by a change in membrane phosphatidylethanolamine
   content, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the physiological
   implications and mechanism of dynamic structural reorganization of
   membrane proteins due to changes in lipid environment are limited by the
   lack of approaches addressing the kinetic parameters of transmembrane
   protein flipping. In this study, real-time fluorescence spectroscopy was
   used to determine the rates of protein flipping in the lipid bilayer in
   both directions and transbilayer flipping of lipids triggered by a
   change in proteoliposome lipid composition. Our results provide, for the
   first time to our knowledge, a dynamic picture of these events and
   demonstrate that membrane protein topological rearrangements in response
   to lipid modulations occur rapidly following a threshold change in
   proteoliposome lipid composition. Protein flipping was not accompanied
   by extensive lipid-dependent unfolding of transmembrane domains.
   Establishment of lipid bilayer asymmetry was not required but may
   accelerate the rate of protein flipping. Membrane protein flipping was
   found to accelerate the rate of transbilayer flipping of lipids.}},

Abstract = {{The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is the key to demand-side
   management system in smart grid. The communication over AMI consists of
   plenty important data, which have different security requirements. In
   this paper, we propose a hierarchical identity-based signature scheme
   (HIBaSS) to enhance the sender authentication for downlink transmission
   of AMI. The downlink in AMI mainly distributes control messages such as
   price and tariff information to the smart meters. Unlike the metering
   data in the uplink transmission that requires confidentiality, most of
   the control messages in downlink only require data integrity and sender
   authentication. Moreover, since most of the control messages are valid
   for a relatively long time period (e.g., an hour), more complicated but
   stronger cryptographic schemes can be applied in downlink AMI. In our
   proposed HIBaSS, each smart meter does not trust a signature from a
   single data aggregate point (DAP) although it includes the original
   signature from the authentication server (AS), because a smart meter has
   no way to verify a message or a DAP directly with the AS. Instead, a
   smart meter receives a group signature created by all the DAPs with
   certificates from the AS that prevents the messages from forgery,
   manipulation and repudiation. The performance evaluation also shows that
   HIBaSS is efficient enough to be applied in the AMI downlink
   transmission. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Environmental Polychlorinated Biphenyl Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk:
   A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Association between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and breast
   cancer risk has been widely studied, but the results remain
   controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the evidences
   from observational studies on PCB exposure and breast cancer risk.
   Methods
   Relevant studies with data on internal PCB dose were identified from
   PubMed, EMBASE, CBM and CNKI databases through November 2014.
   Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were applied to assess the association between PCB exposure and
   breast cancer risk. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup
   analysis and publication bias test were also performed. To further
   explore the association between specific groups of PCB congeners and
   breast cancer, we examined the PCB congeners classified, according to
   their structural, biological and pharmacokinetics properties, as group I
   (potentially estrogenic), group II (potentially anti-estrogenic and
   immunotoxic, dioxin-like), and group III (phenobarbital, CYP1A and CYP2B
   inducers, biologically persistent).
   Results
   Of 660 studies screened, 25 studies which met criteria were selected,
   involving a total of 12866 participants (6088 cases and 6778 controls)
   from eight countries. The results showed that the risk of breast cancer
   was associated with group II (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.40) and group
   III (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.43) PCBs, but not with group I (OR =
   1.10, 95\% CI: 0.97-1.24) PCBs or total PCB exposure (OR = 1.09, 95\%
   CI: 0.97-1.22).
   Conclusions
   Our meta-analysis based on the selected studies found group II and group
   III PCB exposure might contribute to the risk of breast cancer. More
   studies in developing countries with higher PCB levels are needed, as
   well as studies to explore the relationships between mixtures of
   organochlorine compounds and breast cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells producing IgG monoclonal
   antibody were cultivated in a novel perfusion culture system CellTank,
   integrating the bioreactor and the cell retention function. In this
   system, the cells were harbored in a non-woven polyester matrix perfused
   by the culture medium and immersed in a reservoir. Although adapted to
   suspension, the CHO cells stayed entrapped in the matrix. The cell-free
   medium was efficiently circulated from the reservoir into- and through
   the matrix by a centrifugal pump placed at the bottom of the bioreactor
   resulting in highly homogenous concentrations of the nutrients and
   metabolites in the whole system as confirmed by measurements from
   different sampling locations. A real-time biomass sensor using the
   dielectric properties of living cells was used to measure the cell
   density. The performances of the CellTank were studied in three
   perfusion runs. A very high cell density measured as 200 pF/cm (where 1
   pF/cm is equivalent to 1 x 106 viable cells/mL) was achieved at a
   perfusion rate of 10 reactor volumes per day (RV/day) in the first run.
   In the second run, the effect of cell growth arrest by hypothermia at
   temperatures lowered gradually from 37 C to 29 C was studied during 13
   days at cell densities above 100 pF/cm. Finally a production run was
   performed at high cell densities, where a temperature shift to 31 C was
   applied at cell density 100 pF/cm during a production period of 14 days
   in minimized feeding conditions. The IgG concentrations were comparable
   in the matrix and in the harvest line in all the runs, indicating no
   retention of the product of interest. The cell specific productivity was
   comparable or higher than in Erlenmeyer flask batch culture. During the
   production run, the final harvested IgG production was 35 times higher
   in the CellTank compared to a repeated batch culture in the same vessel
   volume during the same time period. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Scorpion envenomation is an acute, life-threatening medical emergency
   and a major public health problem in pediatric practice in many tropical
   countries including India.
   METHADOLOGY: Study design was an observational prospective study was
   aimed to analyze the clinical presentation and outcome of children
   admitted with scorpion sting.
   STUDY PERIOD: From August 2014 to July 2015.
   SETTING: Semi-urban pediatric tertiary care-center.
   STUDY POPULATION: All children less than 13 years of age admitted with
   history of scorpion sting.
   STUDY PARAMETERS: Age, geographical distribution, timing of sting and
   arrival to the hospital, site of bite, time of the day, clinical
   features at presentation, complications like shock, myocarditis,
   peripheral circulatory failure, duration of hospital stay, treatment
   related factors like need for inotropes and mechanical ventilation or
   CPAP, laboratory parameters including blood sugar, ECG changes,
   echocardiography features and final outcome. All children were followed
   upto outcome defined as hospital discharge or death.
   RESULTS: During the study period 68 children were recruited. 76\% of
   children were admitted with nocturnal bites and majority of the bites
   were in the extremities. 67\% were referred from peripheral centers.
   Pain at the bite site, cold extremities and excessive sweating were the
   common clinical features. 72\% if the study group did not have any
   significant hemodynamic derangements. Shock, CCF with pulmonary edema
   and encephalopathy were the complications encountered. Sinus tachycardia
   was the commonest ECG abnormality in the study group. 19 children in the
   study group had evidence of decreased left ventricular ejection
   fraction. Mortality was 2.9\%.
   CONCLUSION: Majority of the children with scorpion sting were referred
   to this Institute from primary and secondary levels hospitals. Delayed
   referral and non-administration of timely prazosin were common in the
   referrals. Administration of steroids and antihistamines is still
   followed by some physicians for scorpion envenomation. RECOMMENDATION:
   There is an urgent need to create awareness about timely use of Prazosin
   in children with scorpion envenomation. Physicians working in peripheral
   centres need to be sensitized on timely administration of the drug and
   early referral to a tertiary care center.}},

   Progression Through Activation of the H1R-TLR2/4-COX2 Axis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that infection and persistent inflammation
   are key players in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
   disease (CVD). Although it is well established that cigarette smoke (CS)
   promotes atherosclerotic CVD, very little is known about the potential
   impact of the collective effects of CS and intermittent or chronic
   subclinical infection on atherosclerosis. Our previous studies
   demonstrated that mast cell-derived histamine and lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS) synergistically enhance endothelial cell inflammatory response. We
   further noted that the synergy between histamine and LPS was due to
   reciprocal upregulation of histamine receptor and Toll like receptor 4
   (TLR4) expression and functions. These results suggest that the combined
   and persistent effects of mast cell mediators and bacterial agents on
   the vasculature are risk factors of CVD. Our recent data demonstrated
   that CS extract enhances histamine- and LPS-induced expression of
   cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in endothelial cells, suggesting that CS and
   mast cell mediators may collectively amplify inflammatory response in
   the vessel wall. We hypothesize that CS enhances histamine mediated
   upregulation of TLR2iTLR4 signaling in the endothelium and promotes
   progression of atherosclerosis. This article presents our perspective on
   the modulatory effects of CS and nicotine on the ``histamine-TLR-COX-2
   axis.{''}}},

Abstract = {{In this study, electrically conductive microporous layers (MPLs) were
   prepared through the phase inversion technique by coagulation in a water
   bath of a mixture of either poly(vinylidene fluoride) or sulfonated
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) and graphite and carbon black as
   electrically-conductive fillers (ECFs). The novel gas diffusion layers
   (GDL) were obtained by casting the MPLs on a wet proof carbon cloth.
   Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), due to its excellent chemical
   stability, thermal resistance and hydrophobic character was proposed in
   place of the more expensive and less processable PTFE. Moreover,
   sulfonated poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDFS, 1.9\% sulfonation degree)
   it was investigated as binding agent in order to obtain MPLs with
   improved characteristics especially in view of the possibility of
   preparation of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) by the deposition of
   electro-active catalysts. MPLs morphology, water contact angle,
   electrical resistance, and through-plane air permeability were carefully
   examined. The PVDF and PVDFS MPLs were assembled with a catalysts coated
   Nafion membrane and the performance of the resulting membrane electrode
   assemblies were compared in a fuel cell fed with air and hydrogen. While
   electrical resistance of MPLs was slightly influenced by the different
   preparation conditions, the air permeability considerably increased by
   switching the solvent from N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO) and by increasing the air exposure time of the
   composite film after casting as confirmed by the morphological analysis
   through scanning electron microscopy. As an indication of the MPLs
   performance, at the operating current density of 0.60 A cm(-2), the
   single cell voltage of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
   was enhanced from about 0.43 to 0.5 V for PVDF based MPLs to about 0.60
   V of PVDFS based MPL. The use of the phase inversion technique open
   several possibilities to tailor the MPL structure to specific fuel cell
   applications and moreover offers a more straightforward and scalable
   preparation method. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Title = {{EFT for vortices with dilaton-dependent localized flux}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{We study how codimension-two objects like vortices back-react
   gravitationally with their environment in theories (such as 4D or
   higher-dimensional supergravity) where the bulk is described by a
   dilaton-Maxwell-Einstein system. We do so both in the full theory, for
   which the vortex is an explicit classical `fat brane' solution, and in
   the effective theory of `point branes' appropriate when the vortices are
   much smaller than the scales of interest for their back-reaction (such
   as the transverse Kaluza-Klein scale). We extend the standard Nambu-Goto
   description to include the physics of flux-localization wherein the
   ambient flux of the external Maxwell field becomes partially localized
   to the vortex, generalizing the results of a companion paper {[}10] to
   include dilaton-dependence for the tension and localized flux. In the
   effective theory, such flux-localization is described by the
   next-to-leading effective interaction, and the boundary conditions to
   which it gives rise are known to play an important role in how (and
   whether) the vortex causes supersymmetry to break in the bulk. We track
   how both tension and localized flux determine the curvature of the
   space-filling dimensions. Our calculations provide the tools required
   for computing how scale-breaking vortex interactions can stabilize the
   extra-dimensional size by lifting the dilaton's flat direction. For
   small vortices we derive a simple relation between the near-vortex
   boundary conditions of bulk fields as a function of the tension and
   localized flux in the vortex action that provides the most efficient
   means for calculating how physical vortices mutually interact without
   requiring a complete construction of their internal structure. In
   passing we show why a common procedure for doing so using a
   delta-function can lead to incorrect results. Our procedures generalize
   straightforwardly to general co-dimension objects.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the far-field thermal emission properties of finite arrays of
   resonant gold dipole nanoantennas at equilibrium temperature. We
   numerically investigated the transition from the super-Planckian
   emission of the single resonant antenna to the sub-Planckian emission
   inherent to infinite periodic arrays. Increasing the number of unit
   cells of the array, the overall size of the system increases, and the
   relative emissivity quickly converges to values lower than the unity.
   Nevertheless, if the separation between nanoantennas in the array is
   small compared to the wavelength, the near-field interaction makes the
   emission of each unit cell multipolar. This opens the doors for
   additional tailoring of the emitted power and directionality of thermal
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Non-supersymmetric black hole microstates are of great interest in the
   context of the black hole information paradox. We identify the
   holographic description of the general class of non-supersymmetric
   orbifolded D1-D5-P supergravity solutions found by Jejjala, Madden, Ross
   and Titchener. This class includes both completely smooth solutions and
   solutions with conical defects, and in the near-decoupling limit these
   solutions describe degrees of freedom in the cap region. The CFT
   description involves a general class of states obtained by fractional
   spectral flow in both left-moving and right-moving sectors, generalizing
   previous work which studied special cases in this class. We compute the
   massless scalar emission spectrum and emission rates in both gravity and
   CFT and find perfect agreement, thereby providing strong evidence for
   our proposed identification. We also investigate the physics of
   ergoregion emission as pair creation for these orbifolded solutions. Our
   results represent the largest class of non-supersymmetric black hole
   microstate geometries with identified CFT duals presently known.}},

Title = {{High efficacy of the MACOP-B regimen in the treatment of adult
   Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a 20 year experience}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an orphan
   disease. Chemotherapy is usually reserved to patients presenting with
   single system multifocal (SS-m) or multisystem (MS) disease but due to
   the lack of randomized studies no standard first line therapy has been
   defined yet. Pediatric regimens based on the vinblastine/prednisone
   backbone are not well tolerated in adults and probably less effective.
   We previously demonstrated high efficacy of the dose dense
   polichemotherapy regimen MACOP-B in 7 adult patients with SS-m or
   MS-LCH, in terms of high response rate and durable responses. Here we
   report an update of these data with the purpose of evaluating the long
   term efficacy of MACOP-B in adult LCH.
   Methods: Clinical data of all adult LCH patients (n = 17) diagnosed and
   treated at our Institution during the past 20-year period were
   retrospectively reviewed.
   Results: A total of 11 patients (6 with SS-m and 5 with MS-LCH) were
   treated with MACOP-B from 1995 to 2014. The overall response rate was
   confirmed to be 100 \%, with a complete response of 73 \% and a partial
   response rate of 27 \%. Overall progression free survival was 64 \%, and
   disease free survival after achievement of initial CR was 87 \%. Overall
   survival rate was 82 \% after 6.7 years of median follow-up.
   Conclusions: These data confirm high activity of MACOP-B in adult LCH,
   indicating that a substantial fraction of patients achieve long lasting
   responses and can be cured with this therapeutic approach.}},

Title = {{Axion-Higgs interplay in the two-Higgs-doublet model}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The Zhitnitsky and Dine, Fischler and Srednicki (DFSZ) model is a
   natural extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model containing an
   additional singlet, endowed with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry, and leading to
   a physically acceptable axion. In this paper we reexamine this model in
   the light of some new developments. For generic couplings the model
   reproduces the minimal Standard Model showing only tiny deviations
   (extreme decoupling scenario) and all additional degrees of freedom
   (with the exception of the axion) are very heavy. Recently it has been
   remarked that the limit where the coupling between the singlet and the
   two doublets becomes very small is technically natural. Combining this
   limit with the requirement of exact or approximate custodial symmetry,
   we may obtain an additional 0(+) Higgs at the weak scale, accompanied by
   relatively light charged and neutral pseudoscalars. The mass spectrum
   would then resemble that of a generic two-Higgs-doublet model, with
   naturally adjustable masses in spite of the large scale that the axion
   introduces. However, the couplings are nongeneric in this model. We use
   the recent constraints derived from the Higgs-WW coupling together with
   oblique corrections to constrain the model as much as possible. As an
   additional result, we work out the nonlinear parametrization of the DFSZ
   model in the generic case where all scalars except the lightest Higgs
   and the axion have masses at or beyond the TeV scale.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss topological and electronic properties of thin films of the

   these films. This challenges recent contradictory reports on quantum
   spin Hall phases in Bi2Se3 films from both theory and experiment.
   Moreover, we argue that one cannot conclude the topological phase from
   the band structures measured in those studies. The reliability of our
   results is supported by the excellent agreement of all calculated
   spectral features with photoemission experiments, i.e., the band gaps
   and the energy and slope of the Dirac state.}},

Title = {{Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Regulates Hippocampal GABA(A) Receptor
   Delta Subunit Gene Expression}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Chronic ethanol consumption causes structural and functional
   reorganization in the hippocampus and induces alterations in the gene
   expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs).
   Distinct forced intermittent exposure models have been used previously
   to investigate changes in GABAAR expression, with contrasting results.
   Here, we used repeated cycles of a Chronic Intermittent Ethanol paradigm
   to examine the relationship between voluntary, dependence-associated
   ethanol consumption, and GABAAR gene expression in mouse hippocampus.
   Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to four 16-h ethanol vapor (or
   air) cycles in inhalation chambers alternated with limited access two
   bottle choice between ethanol (15\%) and water consumption. The mice
   exposed to ethanol vapor showed significant increases in ethanol
   consumption compared to their air-matched controls. GABAAR alpha4 and
   delta subunit gene expression were measured by qRT-PCR at different
   stages. There were significant changes in GABAAR delta subunit
   transcript levels at different time points in ethanol-vapor exposed
   mice, while the alpha4 subunit levels remained unchanged. Correlated
   concurrent blood ethanol concentrations suggested that GABAAR delta
   subunit mRNA levels fluctuate depending on ethanol intoxication,
   dependence, and withdrawal state. Using a vapor based Chronic
   Intermittent Ethanol procedure with combined two-bottle choice
   consumption, we corroborated previous evidences showing that
   discontinuous ethanol exposure affects GABAAR delta subunit expression
   but we did not observe changes in alpha4 subunit. These findings
   indicate that hippocampal GABAAR delta subunit expression changes
   transiently over the course of a Chronic Intermittent Ethanol paradigm
   associated with voluntary intake, in response to ethanol-mediated
   disturbance of GABAergic neurotransmission.}},

Abstract = {{The effect on post-operative outcomes after coronary artery bypass
   graft(CABG) surgery is not clear. Among 17,812 patients who underwent
   CABG during October 1,2006-September 28,2012 in any Department of US
   Veterans Affairs(VA) hospital, we identified 5,968 with available
   preoperative urine albumin-creatinine ratio(UACR) measurements. We
   examined the association of UACR<30, 30-299 and >=300 mg/g with
   30/90/180/365-day and overall all-cause mortality, and hospitalization
   length >10 days, and with acute kidney injury(AKI). Mean +/- SD baseline
   age and eGFR were 66 +/- 8 years and 77 +/- 19 ml/min/1.73 m(2),
   respectively. 788 patients(13.2\%) died during a median follow-up of 3.2
   years, and 26.8\% patients developed AKI(23.1\%-Stage 1; 2.9\%-Stage 2;
   0.8\%-Stage 3) within 30 days of CABG. The median lengths of stay were 8
   days(IQR: 6-13 days), 10 days(IQR: 7-14 days) and 12 days(IQR: 8-19
   days) for groups with UACR < 30 mg/g, 30-299 mg/g and >= 300 mg/g,
   respectively. Higher UACR conferred 72 to 85\% higher 90-, 180-, and
   365-day mortality compared to UACR<30 mg/g (odds ratio and 95\%
   confidence interval for UACR >= 300 vs. < 30 mg/g: 1.72(1.01-2.95);
   1.85(1.14-3.01); 1.74(1.15-2.61), respectively). Higher UACR was also
   associated with significantly longer hospitalizations and higher
   incidence of all stages of AKI. Higher UACR is associated with
   significantly higher odds of mortality, longer post-CABG
   hospitalization, and higher AKI incidence.}},

Title = {{Oxygen Reduction Reaction Promotes Li+ Desorption from Cathode Surface
   in Li-O-2 Batteries}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Li-O-2 batteries are claimed to be one of the future energy storage
   technologies. Great number of scientific and technological challenges
   should be solved first to transform Li-O-2 battery from a promise to
   real practical devices. Proposed mechanisms for oxygen reduction assume
   a reservoir of solved Li+ ions in the electrolyte. However, the role
   that adsorbed Li+ on the electrode surface might have on the overall
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has not deserved much attention.
   Adsorbed Li+ consumption is monitored here using impedance measurements
   from extended electrochemical double layer capacitance, which depends on
   the carbon matrix surface area. The presence of O-2 drastically reduces
   the amount of adsorbed Li+, signaling the kinetic competition between
   Li+ surface adsorption and its consumption, only for potentials
   corresponding to the oxygen reduction reaction. Noticeably double layer
   capacitance remains unaltered after cycling. This fact suggests that the
   ORR products (Li2O2 and Li2CO3) are not covering the internal electrode
   surface, but deposited on the outer electrode-contact interface,
   hindering thereby the subsequent reaction. Current results show new
   insights into the discharge mechanism of Li-O-2 batteries and reveal the
   evidence of Li+ desorption from the C surface when the ORR starts.}},

Abstract = {{Bis-silylated and bis-germylated derivatives of Lu3N@I-h-C-80 (3, 4, 5)
   were successfully synthesized by the photochemical addition of
   disiliranes 1a, 1b or digermirane 2, and fully characterized by
   spectroscopic, electrochemical, and theoretical studies. Interestingly,
   digermirane 2 reacts more efficiently than disiliranes 1a and 1b because
   of its good electron-donor properties and lower steric hindrance around
   the GeGe bond. The 1,4-adduct structures of 3, 4, 5 were unequivocally
   established by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses. The
   electrochemical and theoretical studies reveal that the energy gaps
   between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest
   unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 1,4-adducts are remarkably
   smaller than those of Lu3N@I-h-C-80, because the electron-donating
   groups effectively raise the HOMO levels. It is also observed that
   germyl groups are slightly more electron-donating than the silyl groups
   on the basis of the redox properties and the HOMO-LUMO energies of 4 and
   5. Bis-silylation and bis-germylation are effective and versatile
   methods for tuning the electronic characteristics of endohedral
   metallofullerenes.}},

Abstract = {{Activity-directed synthesis (ADS), a novel discovery approach in which
   bioactive molecules emerge in parallel with associated syntheses, was
   exploited to develop a weakly binding fragment into novel androgen
   receptor agonists. Harnessing promiscuous intermolecular reactions of
   carbenoid compounds enabled highly efficient exploration of chemical
   space. Four substrates were prepared, yet exploited in 326 reactions to
   explore diverse chemical space; guided by bioactivity alone, the
   products of just nine of the reactions were purified to reveal diverse
   novel agonists with up to 125-fold improved activity. Remarkably, one
   agonist stemmed from a novel enantioselective transformation; this is
   the first time that an asymmetric reaction has been discovered solely on
   the basis of the biological activity of the product. It was shown that
   ADS is a significant addition to the lead generation toolkit, enabling
   the efficient and rapid discovery of novel, yet synthetically
   accessible, bioactive chemotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The effects of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on
   heart metabolism and function after myocardial infarction (MI)
   remodelling were investigated in rats.
   Methods: Fifteen days after STZ (50 mg/kg b.w. i.v.) injection, MI was
   induced by surgical occlusion of the left coronary artery. Two weeks
   after MI induction, contents of glycogen, ATP, free fatty acids and
   triacylglycerols (TG) and enzyme activities of glycolysis and Krebs
   cycle (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
   phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase) and expression of carnitine
   palmitoyl-CoA transferase I (a key enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid
   oxidation) were measured in the left ventricle (LV). Plasma glucose,
   free fatty acids and triacylglycerol levels were determined. Ejection
   fraction (EF) and shortening fraction (SF) were also measured by
   echocardiography.
   Results: Glycogen and TG contents were increased (p < 0.05) whereas ATP
   content was decreased in the LV of the non-infarcted diabetic group when
   compared to the control group (p < 0.05). When compared to infarcted
   control rats (MI), the diabetic infarcted rats (DI) showed (p < 0.05):
   increased plasma glucose and TG levels, elevated free fatty acid levels
   and increased activity of, citrate synthase and decreased ATP levels in
   the LV. Infarct size was smaller in the DI group when compared to MI
   rats (p < 0.05), and this was associated with higher EF and SF (p <
   0.05).
   Conclusions: Systolic function was preserved or recovered more
   efficiently in the heart from diabetic rats two weeks after MI, possibly
   due to the high provision of glucose and free fatty acids from both
   plasma and heart glycogen and triacylglycerol stores.}},

Title = {{Performance evaluation of three commercial molecular assays for the
   detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical specimens in a
   high TB-HIV-burden setting}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: A major challenge faced by countries with a high burden of
   tuberculosis (TB) is early detection especially in individuals with
   paucibacillary disease which is common in HIV endemic settings.
   Remarkable efforts have been made globally to accelerate the development
   and expansion of new diagnostic technologies that allow better and
   earlier diagnosis of active tuberculosis particularly directly from
   clinical specimens with a few commercial options available. These
   include GenoType MTBDRplus Version 2.0 (Hain Lifescience), Xpert (R)
   MTB/RIF (Cepheid) and Anyplex (TM) plus MTB/NTM/DR-TB Real-time
   detection (Seegene).
   We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these three commercial
   molecular assays for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
   from clinical specimens in a high TB-HIV-burden setting.
   Methods: This was a retrospective laboratory-based study using stored
   remnant sediments from clinical specimens of presumptive pulmonary TB
   cases. A stratified sample of smear positive TB, smear negative TB and
   TB culture negatives was included. All the samples were tested on the
   three molecular assays following the manufacturers' instructions; except
   for Anyplex (TM) plus, for which DNA extraction was performed using the
   NucliSENS (R) easyMAG (R) platform (bioMerieux). Samples were also
   processed for liquid TB culture and time-to-culture positivity was
   recorded.
   Results: Of the 90 sediments processed, 81 were analyzable across all
   three systems. The overall sensitivity was highest for Xpert (R) MTB/RIF
   (89.1 \%) followed by GenoType MTBDRplus (70.9 \%) and Anyplex (TM) plus
   (65.5 \%). The specificity and sensitivity in smear positive cases was
   comparable across all systems. There was a significant difference in
   sensitivity between Xpert (R) MTB/RIF and the other two assays for
   smear-negative cases (P < 0.05). The performance in cases where the
   time-to-culture positivity was >= 20 days was also significantly poorer
   for both Anyplex (TM) plus and GenoType MTBDRplus compared to Xpert (R)
   MTB/RIF (P < 0.05). Xpert (R) MTB/RIF achieved 100 \% specificity, while
   Anyplex (TM) plus and GenoType MTBDRplus achieved 96.2 and 92.3 \%
   respectively.
   Conclusion: The Xpert (R) MTB/RIF was superior to the other two assays
   for the detection of TB in smear negative specimens notably when
   bacterial loads are very low in sputum. It is important that studies
   reporting on test performance stratify their results by time-to-culture
   positivity to accurately assess clinical performance especially in high
   HIV settings.}},

Abstract = {{The author of this paper uses critical discourse analysis and draws on
   critical social theory and policy studies to analyze the
   interdiscursivity between neoliberal common sense discourses around
   crime and safety and race-neutral discourses, evidence-based policy, and
   the research that supports school policing programs. The author offers a
   macro-sociological analysis of how neoliberal common sense and
   race-neutral discourses shape crime policy. Next, the author discusses
   the rise of evidence-based policy formation. She argues that
   evidence-based policy serves to narrow the scope of what constitutes
   scientific research and delegitimize research that uses race as an
   analytical lens. Then, through textual analysis of samples of the
   evidence supporting school policing, the author illustrates the ways in
   which neoliberal common sense discourses around crime and safety and
   race-neutral discourses become the ideological starting point for the
   research and internalized within research documents. The result is the
   creation of a hegemonic evidence-loop that privileges ideologically
   driven research that assumes a scientific stance and obscures racial
   bias while it excludes the critical research on the school policing.}},

Abstract = {{Delusions are a hallmark positive symptom of schizophrenia, although
   they are also associated with a wide variety of other psychiatric and

   underlying disease, along with a lack of experimental animal models,
   make delusions exceptionally difficult to study in isolation, either in
   schizophrenia or other diseases. To date, no detailed studies have
   focused specifically on the neural mechanisms of delusion, although some
   studies have reported characteristic activation of specific brain areas
   or networks associated with them. Here, we present a novel hypothesis

   poorly understood forebrain nucleus, as a potential common center for

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of a strong flux of photons with matter through an
   ionizing front (I-front) is an ubiquitous phenomenon in the context of
   astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion (ICF) where intense sources
   of radiation put matter into motion. When the opacity of the irradiated
   material varies continuously in the radiation spectral domain, only one
   single I-front is formed. In contrast, as numerical simulations tend to
   show, when the opacity of the irradiated material presents a sharp edge
   in the radiation spectral domain, a second I-front (an edge front) can
   form. A full description of the mechanism behind the formation of this
   edge front is presented in this article. It allows us to understand
   extra shocks (edge-shocks), displayed by ICF simulations, that might
   affect the robustness of the design of fusion capsules in actual
   experiments. Moreover, it may have consequences in various domains of
   astrophysics where ablative flows occur.}},

Title = {{The impact of allergic rhinitis on the management of asthma in a working
   population}},
Journal = {{BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Currently, little data is available about the management of
   asthma in the working population. The aim of this study was to describe
   asthma control and severity among workers according to current or
   previous allergic rhinitis comorbidity.
   Methods: A network of occupational physicians participated in this pilot
   study on a voluntary basis. They included a random sample of salaried
   workers during their systematic occupational medical check-up. All
   subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire based on the
   European Community Respiratory Health Survey screening questionnaire,
   and if they reported any respiratory symptoms including allergic
   rhinitis, the physician filled in a medical questionnaire. Current
   asthma control and severity were evaluated according to 2006 Global
   Initiative for Asthma guidelines.
   Results: A total of 110 occupational physicians from two French regions
   participated. Out of the 6906 employees screened, 3102 identified
   respiratory symptoms and completed the medical questionnaire and
   performed spirometry. Overall, 374 were identified as current
   asthmatics, including 271 (72.5 \%) with allergic rhinitis. Among
   current asthmatics with current allergic rhinitis (n = 95), 68.8 \% had
   partially controlled asthma or uncontrolled asthma, including 51.6 \%
   who received insufficient anti-asthmatic treatment. Partly or no control
   asthma was not associated with current rhinitis (OR = 1.4; 95 \% CI:
   0.8-2.7). Current asthmatics with current or previous allergic rhinitis
   had a significantly lower risk of emergency department visits than
   current asthmatics without allergic rhinitis (respectively 11.6, 17.1
   and 29.1 \%; P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Most current asthmatics both with and without allergic
   rhinitis had uncontrolled asthma, with inappropriate treatment. Future
   intervention strategies need to be developed for effective control and
   prevention of asthma in the workplace.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the effects of xenotransplantation of
   Adipose Tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AT-MSCs) in animals after ventral
   root avulsion. AT-MSC has similar characteristics to bone marrow
   mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), such as immunomodulatory properties
   and expression of neurotrophic factors. In this study, Lewis rats were
   submitted to surgery for unilateral avulsion of the lumbar ventral roots
   and received 5 x 10(5) AT-MSCs via the lateral funiculus. Two weeks
   after cell administration, the animals were sacrificed and the moto
   neurons, T lymphocytes and cell defense nervous system were analyzed. An
   increased neuronal survival and partial preservation of
   synaptophysin-positive nerve terminals, related to GDNF and BDNF
   expression of AT-MSCs, and reduction of pro-inflammatory reaction were
   observed. In conclusion, AT-MSCs prevent second phase neuronal injury,
   since they suppressed lymphocyte, astroglia and microglia effects, which
   finally contributed to rat motor-neuron survival and synaptic stability
   of the lesioned motorneuron. Moreover, the survival of the injected
   AT-MSCs lasted for at least 14 days. These results indicate that
   neuronal survival after lesion, followed by mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   administration, might occur through cytokine release and
   immunomodulation, thus suggesting that AT-MSCs are promising cells for
   the therapy of neuronal lesions.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of the suppression of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect by
   applied magnetic fields is studied. We perform numerical simulations of
   the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion for an
   atomistic spin model and calculate the magnon accumulation in linear
   temperature gradients for different strengths of applied magnetic fields
   and different length scales of the temperature gradient. We observe a
   decrease of the magnon accumulation with increasing magnetic field and
   we reveal that the origin of this effect is a field dependent change of
   the frequency distribution of the propagating magnons. With increasing
   field the magnonic spin currents are reduced due to a suppression of
   parts of the frequency spectrum. By comparison with measurements of the
   magnetic field dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in YIG thin
   films with various thicknesses, we find qualitative agreement between
   our model and the experimental data, demonstrating the importance of
   this effect for experimental systems.}},

Abstract = {{Mineralisation of all components of stylohyoid complex or chain, a 2nd
   branchial arch derivative is frequently reported. But bilateral
   occurrence of continuous bands of ossified tissue involving stylohyoid

   presented abnormally long osseous bands extending from base of skull in
   place of styloid process. On left side a band of 6.5cm long x1cm wide
   and 0.3cm in thickness, and on right side an irregularly rounded
   elongated structure of 7.5cm length were noticed. Lower end of the left
   process was fused to hyoid bone. Either abnormally long styloid process
   or this type of ossified stylohyoid complex may be a causative factor
   for severe pharyngeal pain, dysphagia, may be a cause for occasional
   swelling in submandibular region or may be associated with Eagle
   syndrome. Due to its close proximity to tonsillar bed, if elongated it
   may be felt during tonsillectomy in tonsillar fossa. In this backdrop
   reports of this type may be of interest to clinicians.}},

Abstract = {{A two-scale parameter identification approach is investigated. The
   microscopic material parameters of a two-scale model are identified by
   comparing macroscopic simulation data with macroscopic full-field
   measurements of the micro-structured specimen. Gradient-based solution
   strategies are employed for the optimization problem of the two-scale
   parameter identification. In particular, two approaches for the gradient
   calculation are investigated: the finite difference method is compared
   with a newly introduced semi-analytical scheme. The focus lies on the
   identification of microscopic elastoplastic material parameters. The
   presented identification example with artificial data confirms a reduced
   computational effort and advantageous convergence for the
   semi-analytical approach within the two-scale parameter identification.
   A drawback is the increase in memory requirement. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) is a member of the Rho guanosine
   triphosphatase family and has pivotal functions in actin organization,
   cell migration, and proliferation. To further study the molecular
   mechanisms of dendritic cell (DC) regulation by Cdc42, we used
   Cdc42-deficient DCs. Cdc42 deficiency renders DCs phenotypically mature
   as they up-regulate the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 from intracellular
   storages to the cell surface. Cdc42 knockout DCs also accumulate high
   amounts of invariant chain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
   II complexes at the cell surface, which cannot efficiently present
   peptide antigens (Ag's) for priming of Ag-specific CD4 T cells. Proteome
   analyses showed a significant reduction in lysosomal MHC class II
   processing proteins, such as cathepsins, which are lost from DCs by
   enhanced secretion. As these effects on DCs can be mimicked by chemical
   actin disruption, our results propose that Cdc42 control of actin
   dynamics keeps DCs in an immature state, and cessation of Cdc42 activity
   during DC maturation facilitates secretion as well as rapid
   up-regulation of intracellular molecules to the cell surface.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of the urinary tract is recommended for all children with UTI.
   The aim of these investigations is to identify patients at risk of renal

   (VUR) or urinary tract obstruction. This study was designed and
   conducted in the department of Pediatrics and department of
   Radiodiagnosis, BVDU Medical college hospital, Pune during the period
   from July 2009 to August 2011 to do imaging studies as per protocol of
   investigations suggested by the Indian Pediatric Nephrology Group of
   children from birth to 12 years of age presenting with their first
   culture positive UTI who attended our tertiary care centre. Abnormal USG
   was found in 40.3\% cases and helped to identify hydroureteronephrosis
   (HUN) and calculi. Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) examination was
   abnormal in 31.1\% cases. Of which, 22.2\% patients had VUR suggesting
   that VUR is common in culture positive UTI, thus stressing the need of
   MCU in patients of culture positive UTI. DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA) showed
   scar in 56\% of total cases examined indicating need for doing DMSA
   whenever indicated and for prognostication. One single imaging modality
   is not sufficient to evaluate children with UTI.}},

   effector cells in response to primary infection with Listeria
   monocytogenes or Vaccinia virus. Notably, even after transitioning into
   the memory pool, miR-150(-/-) cells still mount a weaker recall response
   to secondary infection, and remain less differentiated than their
   wild-type counterparts. Transcriptome analysis shows miR-150 gene
   targets are globally upregulated in cells lacking miR-150, and amongst
   these targets, we found misregulation of genes associated with
   proliferation and effector cell function. These transcriptome data
   suggest that miR-150 deficient CD8+ T cells are less efficient in
   killing infected cells, which we validate experimentally. Together,
   these results reveal a cell-intrinsic role for miR-150 in the regulation
   of effector CD8+ T cell fate and function.}},

Abstract = {{A Schiff-base polypyrrolic ligand (H4L) can accommodate two U3+ ions and
   form a Pacman-like complex {[}U-2(L)](2+) according to relativistic
   density functional theory. Sixteen species, featuring four structural
   models in four electronic states, are energetically stable. Ligand
   flexibility, lack of axial restriction, and suitable U-N interactions
   allow the two U3+ ions to stretch freely over a wide range, in contrast
   to U-2@C-n (n = 60, 74, 80) studied previously. Diverse U3+-U3+
   interactions are found. The quintet state of the Out-In model, which is
   calculated to be the global ground state both including and excluding
   the spin-orbit coupling energy, likely shows a weak single U-2 bond. In
   both vertical and tilt In-In species, a triple bond is found. It is
   composed of two two-electron-two-center bonds and two
   one-electron-two-center bonds; moreover, the tilt conformer is almost
   isoenergetic with Out-In. The Out-Out species shows no U center dot
   center dot center dot U bonding. Comparison with explicitly THF-solvated
   diuranium complexes is also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyll breakdown in higher plants occurs by the so called
   PaO/phyllobilin path. It generates two major types of phyllobilins, the
   characteristic 1-formyl-19-oxobilins and the more recently discovered
   1,19-dioxobilins. The hypothetical branching point at which the original
   1-formyl-19-oxobilins are transformed into 1,19-dioxobilins is still
   elusive. Here, we clarify this hypothetical crucial transition on the
   basis of the identification of the first natural 1,19-dioxobilin-type
   fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (DFCC). This transient chlorophyll
   breakdown intermediate was isolated from leaf extracts of Arabidopsis
   thaliana at an early stage of senescence. The fleetingly existent DFCC
   was then shown to represent the direct precursor of the major
   nonfluorescent 1,19-dioxobilin that accumulated in fully senescent
   leaves.}},

   reprogramming and scaffold manipulation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Efficiency of cell-based tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   has been limited by inadequate cellular responses to injury because of
   aging and poor controllability of cellular interactions. Since cell
   progression is under a tight epigenetic regulation, epigenetic
   modulators such as 5-azacytidine (5-Aza-CR) have been utilized to
   facilitate reprogramming and development of somatic cells in
   2-dimensional (2-D) settings. Nonetheless, progression of a specific
   tissue lineage toward the terminal phenotype is dependent not only on
   the genomic potential, but also on the microenvironment cues that are
   beyond the capability of 2-D approaches. In this study, we investigated
   the combined effects of matrices of variable rigidities and the
   treatment with the epigenetic modulator 5-Aza-CR on reprogramming
   adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into myoblast-like cells by
   utilizing tunable transglutaminase cross-linked gelatin (Col-Tgel) in
   vitro and in vivo. Our experiments demonstrated that cellular plasticity
   and trans-differentiation were significantly enhanced when ADSCs were
   treated with an effective dose of 5-Aza-CR (1.25 to 12.5 ng) in the
   optimal myogenic matrix (15 +/- 5 kPa Col-Tgel). Our findings suggest
   that both physical signals and chemical milieu are critical for the
   regulation of cellular responses.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the motor protein Myosin Vb (Myo5B) or the soluble NSF
   attachment protein receptor Syntaxin 3 (Stx3) disturb epithelial
   polarity and cause microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a lethal
   hereditary enteropathy affecting neonates. To understand the molecular
   mechanism of Myo5B and Stx3 interplay, we used genome editing to
   introduce a defined Myo5B patient mutation in a human epithelial cell
   line. Our results demonstrate a selective role of Myo5B and Stx3 for
   apical cargo exocytosis in polarized epithelial cells. Apical exocytosis
   of NHE3, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), and
   GLUT5 required an interaction cascade of Rab11, Myo5B, Slp4a, Muncl 8-2,
   and Vamp7 with Stx3, which cooperate in the final steps of this
   selective apical traffic pathway. The brush border enzymes DPPIV and
   sucrase-isomaltase still correctly localize at the apical plasma
   membrane independent of this pathway. Hence, our work demonstrates how
   Myo5B, Stx3, Slp4a, Vamp7, Muncl 8-2, and Rab8/11 cooperate during
   selective apical cargo trafficking and exocytosis in epithelial cells
   and thereby provides further insight into MVID pathophysiology.}},

Title = {{Late Eocene white pines (Pinus subgenus Strobus) from southern China}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Fossil records indicate that the genus Pinus L. split into two subgenera
   by the Late Cretaceous, although subgenus Strobus (D. Don) Lemmon is
   less well documented than subgenus Pinus L., especially in eastern Asia.
   In this paper, Pinus maomingensis sp. nov. is established based on a
   compressed seed cone from the upper Eocene of the Maoming Basin of
   southern China. This species is attributed to genus Pinus, subgenus
   Strobus, section Quinquefoliae Duhamel, subsection Strobus Loudon based
   on the combination of morphological characters obtained from the cone
   scales, specifically from the terminal umbo, rhombic apophysis, and
   cuticle structure. Associated fascicles of needle leaves with deciduous
   sheaths and bulbous bases are recognized as Pinus sp. and also represent
   Pinus subgenus Strobus. This new discovery from the Maoming Basin
   constitutes the first megafossil record of subgenus Strobus from
   southern China and implies that the members of this subgenus arrived in
   the southern region of China by the late Eocene. The extant species of
   subgenus Strobus are mainly distributed in northern temperate and
   tropical to subtropical mountainous regions. We propose that the Maoming
   Basin was adjacent to a mountainous region during the late Eocene.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to play
   an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
   Previous studies have associated the VEGF rs2146323 polymorphism with
   the risk of DR. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent.
   A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the
   VEGF rs2146323 polymorphism and the risk of DR.
   Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar
   literature databases until March 2015 were searched. The differences in
   the studies were expressed in the form of an odds ratio (OR) and the
   corresponding 95 \% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among the
   studies was tested using the I2 statistic based on the Q test.
   Results: A total of four studies (598 cases and 709 controls) were
   included in the meta-analysis. A significant association was found
   involving the rs2146323 polymorphism in the dominant model (CA + AA VS.
   CC) (OR = 1.38, CI = 1.10-1.72, P = 0.005) and the co-dominant model (CA
   VS. CC) (OR = 1.37, CI = 1.08-1.74, P = 0.008).
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis confirmed the association between the
   VEGF rs2146323 polymorphism and the risk of DR.}},

Abstract = {{Although surgical resection is still the optimal treatment option for
   early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with well
   compensated cirrhosis, thermal ablation techniques provide a valid
   non-surgical treatment alternative, thanks to their minimal
   invasiveness, excellent tolerability and safety profile, proven efficacy
   in local disease control, virtually unlimited repeatability and
   cost-effectiveness. Different energy sources are currently employed in
   clinics as physical agents for percutaneous or intra-surgical thermal
   ablation of HCC nodules. Among them, radiofrequency (RF) currents are
   the most used, while microwave ablations (MWA) are becoming increasingly
   popular. Starting from the 90s', RF ablation (RFA) rapidly became the
   standard of care in ablation, especially in the treatment of small HCC
   nodules; however, RFA exhibits substantial performance limitations in
   the treatment of large lesions and/or tumors located near major heat
   sinks. MWA, first introduced in the Far Eastern clinical practice in the
   80s', showing promising results but also severe limitations in the
   controllability of the emitted field and in the high amount of power
   employed for the ablation of large tumors, resulting in a poor
   coagulative performance and a relatively high complication rate,
   nowadays shows better results both in terms of treatment controllability
   and of overall coagulative performance, thanks to the improvement of
   technology. In this review we provide an extensive and detailed overview
   of the key physical and technical aspects of MWA and of the currently
   available systems, and we want to discuss the most relevant published
   data on MWA treatments of HCC nodules in regard to clinical results and
   to the type and rate of complications, both in absolute terms and in
   comparison with RFA.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To study clinical and histopathological features of nonalcoholic
   fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with and without type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) using updated nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical
   research network (NASH-CRN) grading system.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 235 patients with biopsy
   proven NAFLD with and without T2DM. This database was utilized in the
   previously published study comparing ethnicity outcomes in NAFLD by the
   same corresponding author. The pathology database from University of
   Chicago was utilized for enrolling consecutive patients who met the
   criteria for NAFLD and their detailed clinical and histopathology
   findings were obtained for comparison. The relevant clinical profile of
   patients was collected from the Electronic Medical Records around the
   time of liver biopsy and the histology was read by a single well-trained
   histopathologist. The updated criteria for type 2 diabetes have been
   utilized for analysis. Background data of patients with NASH and NAFLD
   has been included. The mean differences were compared using X-2 and
   7-test along with regression analysis to evaluate the predictors of NASH
   and advanced fibrosis.
   RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD and T2DM were significantly older (49.9 vs
   43.0, P < 0.01), predominantly female (71.4 vs 56.3, P < 0.02), had
   higher rate of metabolic syndrome (88.7 vs 36.4, P < 0.01), had
   significantly higher aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase
   (ALT) ratio (0.94 vs 0.78, P < 0.01) and Fib-4 index (1.65 vs 1.06, P <
   0.01) as markers of NASH, showed higher mean NAFLD activity score (3.5
   vs 3.0, P = 0.03) and higher mean fibrosis score (1.2 vs 0.52, P < 0.01)
   compared to patients with NAFLD without T2DM. Furthermore, advanced
   fibrosis (32.5 vs 12.0, P < 0.01) and ballooning (27.3 vs 13.3, P <
   0.01) was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD and T2DM
   compared to patients with NAFLD without T2DM. On multivariate analysis,
   T2DM was independently associated with NASH (OR = 3.27, 95\%CI:
   1.43-7.50, P < 0.01) and advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.45, 95\%CI:
   1.53-7.77, P < 0.01) in all patients with NAFLD. There was a higher rate
   of T2DM (38.1 vs 19.4, P < 0.01) and cirrhosis (8.3 vs 0.0, P = 0.01)
   along with significantly higher mean Bilirubin (0.71 vs 0.56, P = 0.01)
   and AST (54.2 vs 38.3, P < 0.01) and ALT (78.7 vs 57.0, P = 0.01) level
   among patients with NASH when compared to patients with steatosis alone.
   The mean platelet count (247 vs 283, P < 0.01) and high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol level (42.7 vs 48.1, P = 0.01) was lower among
   patients with NASH compared to patients with steatosis.
   CONCLUSION: Patients with NAFLD and T2DM tend to have more advanced
   stages of NAFLD, particularly advanced fibrosis and higher rate of
   ballooning than patients with NAFLD without T2DM.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{3420-3426}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several observational studies suggested that vitamin E
   intake is related to the risk of kidney cancer; however, the results of
   published studies are inconsistent.
   Material/Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to assess the
   relationship between vitamin E intake and the risk of kidney cancer by
   searching PubMed and Medline through August 2015. We computed pooled
   relative risks (RR) and 95\% CI of kidney cancer for the highest versus
   lowest level of vitamin E intake.
   Results: A total of 13 observational studies (7 case-control and 6
   cohort) were included. The pooled RR (95\% CI) of kidney cancer for the
   highest vs. the lowest level of vitamin E intake was 0.81 (0.69-0.94).
   In subgroup-analysis, this study found an inverse relationship between
   vitamin E intake and kidney cancer risk, which was not significantly
   modified by study design, study population, or sex distribution except
   in the cohort studies.
   Conclusions: Results of the present study suggest an inverse
   relationship between vitamin E intake and kidney cancer risk. However,
   additional well designed cohort studies and randomized controlled trials
   that focus on the relationship between vitamin E intake and kidney
   cancer risk are needed.}},

Title = {{Surgical resection of unilateral thalamic tumors in adults: approaches
   and outcomes}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The thalamic tumors were less common in adults and this
   study aimed to determine the clinical features, surgical approaches, and
   outcomes of adult thalamic tumors, which have not been well-described in
   the literature.
   Methods: We reviewed the clinical presentation, surgical approach,
   perioperative mortality and morbidity, and outcomes of 111 operated
   patients (71 males, 40 females; mean age at presentation, 33.4 +/- 13.2
   years) with unilateral thalamic tumor.
   Results: The most common clinical presentations were increased
   intracranial pressure (65 \%) and motor deficits (40 \%). Five surgical
   approaches were used depending on tumor location; the most common was
   the transparieto-occipital approach (47.7 \%). According to peri-and
   post-operative magnetic resonance imaging findings, the tumors were
   totally resected in 29 cases (26.1 \%), subtotally resected in 54 cases
   (48.6 \%), and partially resected in 21 cases (18.9 \%). Five patients
   died during the perioperative period (4.5 \%, 5/111). The most common
   morbidity was motor deficits (21.7 \%, 23/106). According to
   histological findings, there were 50 high-grade and 61 low-grade tumors.
   Median survival of patients with low-and high-grade tumors were 40 and
   12 months, respectively (mean follow-up, 37.3 months). Survival was
   significantly longer in cases of total or subtotal resection (median, 28
   months) compared to partial resection or biopsy (median, 12 months).
   Survival was poorer in adults than in previous reported pediatrics.
   Conclusions: Surgical treatment of adult thalamic tumors must be
   individualized according to tumor location. Low-grade tumors and
   total/subtotal resection seem to be predictors of better surgical
   outcomes. Nevertheless, the outcome of adult patients were still worse
   than pediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Signaling proteins are an important topic in drug development due to the
   increased importance of finding fast, accurate and cheap methods to
   evaluate new molecular targets involved in specific diseases. The
   complexity of the protein structure hinders the direct association of
   the signaling activity with the molecular structure. Therefore, the
   proposed solution involves the use of protein star graphs for the
   peptide sequence information encoding into specific topological indices
   calculated with S2SNet tool. The Quantitative Structure-Activity
   Relationship classification model obtained with Machine Learning
   techniques is able to predict new signaling peptides. The best
   classification model is the first signaling prediction model, which is
   based on eleven descriptors and it was obtained using the Support Vector
   Machines-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) technique with the
   Laplacian kernel (RFE-LAP) and an AUROC of 0.961. Testing a set of 3114
   proteins of unknown function from the PDB database assessed the
   prediction performance of the model. Important signaling pathways are
   presented for three UniprotIDs (34 PDBs) with a signaling prediction
   greater than 98.0\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among sasang constitutional types: a
   population-based study in Korea}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common
   cause of chronic liver disease and is highly prevalent in populations
   with metabolic conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes. Specific
   types of Sasang constitution can act as a risk factor for metabolic
   diseases, but there are no studies addressing the association between
   the Sasang constitutional types (SCTs) and NAFLD.
   Methods: A total of 1184 individuals (508 males, 676 females) that
   enrolled in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were included in
   the present study. Classification of SCTs was done with an integrated
   diagnostic model. NAFLD was diagnosed when the liver attenuation index
   (LAI) value was <5 Hounsfield units using computed tomography.
   Relationships between the SCTs and NAFLD were analyzed using multiple
   logistic regressions.
   Results: The average LAI was 13.3 +/- 6.0 in the So-eum (SE) type, 12.3
   +/- 7.0 in the So-yang (SY) type, and 6.5 +/- 9.9 in the Tae-eum (TE)
   type. Prevalence of NAFLD was 4.7 \% in the SE type, 14.0 \% in the SY
   type, and 34 \% in the TE type. Even after adjusting for possible
   confounders, the SY and TE types continued to show a 3.90-fold (95 \%
   CI, 1.60-9.51; P = 0.0028) and 3.36-fold (95 \% CI, 1.42-7.92; P =
   0.0057) increase in chance of having NAFLD, respectively, compared with
   the SE type. In the additional analysis including only non-obese
   subjects, the odds ratio of NAFLD was 3.27 (95 \% CI, 1.29-8.29; P =
   0.0126) in the SY type and 3.53 (95 \% CI, 1.30-9.58; P = 0.0134) in the
   TE type compared with SE type. In the multivariate analysis to determine
   which parameter had an independent association with NAFLD, higher body
   mass index, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), and low
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently associated with
   developing NAFLD in the SY type. In contrast, male sex, alcohol
   consumption, higher ALT, TG, and fasting glucose were risk factors for
   NAFLD in the TE type.
   Conclusions: These results indicated that the SY and TE types are
   independent risk factors for NAFLD.}},

Abstract = {{MnO-doped ZnO ceramics have been synthesized through the conventional
   ceramic processing route. Mn2+ ions have been incorporated into the ZnO
   lattice within the limits of solid solubility. By using X-band-frequency
   and high-field electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we have resolved
   some of the main electronic transitions for the S = 5/2, I = 5/2
   high-spin system and have determined accurately the EPR spin-Hamiltonian
   parameters. By combining data from crystallographic X-ray diffraction
   and EPR with the semi-empirical Newman superposition model, we have
   found the local configurational position of Mn2+ and have confirmed the
   symmetry of the lattice. The results presented in this contribution
   indicate that Mn ions substitute at Zn sites in ZnO. The effect of Mn2+
   ions on the intrinsic defects becomes remarkable, thus the vacancy
   related intrinsic defect signals cannot be visible in the EPR spectrum.
   MnO doping affects the band gap energy of ZnO system which was confirmed
   via UV-Vis spectroscopy. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Killing of Mycolic Acid-Containing Bacteria Aborted Induction of
   Antibiotic Production by Streptomyces in Combined-Culture}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Co-culture of Streptomyces with mycolic acid-containing bacteria (MACB),
   which we termed ``combined-culture,{''} alters the secondary metabolism
   pattern in Streptomyces and has been a useful method for the discovery
   of bioactive natural products. In the course of our investigation to
   identify the inducing factor(s) of MACB, we previously observed that
   production of pigments in Streptomyces lividans was not induced by
   factors such as culture extracts or mycolic acids. Although dynamic
   changes occurred in culture conditions because of MACB, the activation
   of pigment production by S. lividans was observed in a limited area
   where both colonies were in direct contact. This suggested that direct
   attachment of cells is a requirement and that components on the MACB
   cell membrane may play an important role in the response by S. lividans.
   Here we examined whether this response was influenced by dead MACB that
   possess intact mycolic acids assembled on the outer cell membrane.
   Formaldehyde fixation and.-irradiation were used to prepare dead cells
   that retain their shape and mycolic acids of three MACB species:
   Tsukamurella pulmonis, Rhodococcus erythropolis, and Rhodococcus opacus.
   Culturing tests verified that S. lividans does not respond to the intact
   dead cells of three MACB. Observation of combined-culture by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that adhesion of live MACB to S.
   lividans mycelia were a significant interaction that resulted in
   formation of co-aggregation. In contrast, in the SEM analysis, dead
   cells were not observed to adhere. Therefore, direct attachment by live
   MACB cells is proposed as one of the possible factors that causes
   Streptomyces to alter its specialized metabolism in combined-culture.}},

Abstract = {{Two new species of the cirratulid genus Tharyx are reported from shallow
   waters in the Kattegat inshore Sweden. In addition, the lectotype of
   Tharyx killariensis (Southern, 1914) is redescribed resulting in a
   revised concept of the noto- and neuropodial acicular spines of
   posterior parapodia for that species. These spines were originally
   reported as bidentate crotchets with sharply pointed teeth; in reality
   the spines have blunt, knob-shaped tips, typical of several other
   species of Tharyx. Both of the new species are atypical for the genus
   Tharyx. T. maryae n. sp. has an expanded posterior end more typical of
   the genus Aphelochaeta, but otherwise shares characters of Tharyx. T.
   robustus n. sp. has a body shape that is consistently broad and
   dorsoventrally flattened throughout, rather than elongate and narrow as
   in other species of the genus. Both of the new species, however, have
   short, blunt-tipped spines in far posterior parapodia. With the addition
   of the two new species, the genus Tharyx now includes 11 species that
   are compared and contrasted. Morphology that defines and characterizes
   species of Tharyx is reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of membrane separation like ultrafiltration for reuse of
   reclaimed water has become an increasingly attractive option, especially
   nowadays when water quality and water scarcity are stringent issues. In
   this study, a secondary effluent from Iasi municipal wastewater
   treatment plant (MWWTP) was treated in a laboratory-scale
   ultrafiltration equipment with 4 and 6kDa membranes, in cross-flow
   operating mode, with complete recirculation of the concentrate, under
   various pressure conditions (1-2.5bar) and time periods (1-4h).
   Considering the technical performances of the ultrafiltration process,
   two main directions were followed: firstly, the assessment of membrane
   productivity in terms of permeate flux, volume reduction factor (VRF),
   and fouling index (I-t) and secondly, the evaluation of permeate
   quality, calculated by the removal efficiencies calculated for various
   water quality indicators: turbidity, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total
   Organic Carbon (TOC), Phenols, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorous (TP),
   Total Fe, Total Cr, Cu2+, Zn2+. The best results obtained on the EM006
   membrane, (1h test, pressure p=1.5bar) show removal efficiencies up to
   50\% in terms of organic compounds removal (COD and TOC indicators),
   100\% in terms of solids presence (measured by turbidity) and phenolic
   compounds, up to 30\% reduction of TP. The permeate quality was compared
   with different limits of pollutants concentration, specified in the
   existing legislative framework for reclaimed water, in United States
   (US) and Spain (EU). The study indicates that ultrafiltration of the
   secondary municipal effluent from Iasi MWWTP, in an advanced treatment
   step, is a feasible option for water reclamation, but special attention
   is required to the compounds containing nitrogen and especially nitrates
   concentration which exceed the maximum admissible concentration.}},

Abstract = {{A b-coloring of the vertices of a graph is a proper coloring where each
   color class contains a vertex which is adjacent to at least one vertex
   in each other color class. The b-chromatic number of G is the maximum
   integer b(G) for which G has a b-coloring with b(G) colors. This problem
   was introduced by Irving and Manlove (1999), where they showed that
   computing b(G) is N P-hard in general and polynomial-time solvable for
   trees. A natural question that arises is whether the edge version of
   this problem is also NIP-hard or not. Here, we prove that computing the
   b-chromatic index of a graph G is N P-hard, even if G is either a
   comparability graph or a C-k-free graph, and give partial results on the
   complexity of the problem restricted to trees, more specifically, we
   solve the problem for caterpillars graphs. Although solving problems on
   caterpillar graphs is usually quite simple, this problem revealed itself
   to be unusually hard. The presented algorithm uses a dynamic programming
   approach that combines partial solutions which are proved to exist if,
   and only if, a particular polyhedron is non-empty. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 Promotes Autocrine Epidermal Growth Factor
   Receptor (EGFR) Signaling to Stimulate Migration and Invasion toward
   Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)}},

Abstract = {{Background: Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 is overexpressed in pancreatic
   cancer and enhances invasion.
   Results: Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 coordinately up-regulates AREG, EREG,
   and MMP1 through DNA demethylation and NFAT5 that in turn enhances
   HGF-mediated invasion.
   Conclusion: Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 stimulates HGF-dependent invasion
   through autocrine EGFR signaling.
   Significance: HGF-stimulated invasion is dependent on autocrine EGFR
   signaling, thus implicating why EGFR inhibitors are effective in a
   complex tumor microenvironment.
   Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 is up-regulated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas
   where it contributes to carcinoma cell invasion by altering the
   transcriptome. In this study, we found that integrin alpha 6 beta 4
   up-regulates several genes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (
   EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and
   ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1, which is mediated by promoter
   demethylation and NFAT5. The correlation of these genes with integrin
   alpha 6 beta 4 was confirmed in The Cancer Genome Atlas Pancreatic
   Cancer Database. Based on previous observations that integrin alpha 6
   beta 4 cooperates with c-Met in pancreatic cancers, we examined the
   impact of EGFR signaling on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated
   migration and invasion. We found that AREG and EREG were required for
   autocrine EGFR signaling, as knocking down either ligand inhibited
   HGF-mediated migration and invasion. We further determined that HGF
   induced secretion of AREG, which is dependent on integrin-growth factor
   signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PKC. Moreover, matrix
   metalloproteinase activity and integrin alpha 6 beta 4 signaling were
   required for AREG secretion. Blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific
   antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated
   pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in
   three-dimensional culture. Finally, we found that EGFR was
   phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation that isdependenton EGF
   Rkinase activity; however, c-Metphosphorylation in response to HGF was
   unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, these data illustrate that
   integrin alpha 6 beta 4 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR
   signaling through transcriptional up-regulation of key EGFR family
   members and by facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion. These
   signaling events, in turn, promote pancreatic carcinoma migration and
   invasion.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the contribution of chiral fermions in d = 2, 4, 6, chiral
   bosons, a chiral gravitino like theory in d = 2 and chiral gravitinos in
   d = 6 to all the leading parity odd transport coefficients at one loop.
   This is done by using finite temperature field theory to evaluate the
   relevant Kubo formulae. For chiral fermions and chiral bosons the
   relation between the parity odd transport coefficient and the
   microscopic anomalies including gravitational anomalies agree with that
   found by using the general methods of hydrodynamics and the argument
   involving the consistency of the Euclidean vacuum. For the gravitino
   like theory in d = 2 and chiral gravitinos in d = 6, we show that
   relation between the pure gravitational anomaly and parity odd transport
   breaks down. From the perturbative calculation we clearly identify the
   terms that contribute to the anomaly polynomial, but not to the
   transport coefficient for gravitinos. We also develop a simple method
   for evaluating the angular integrals in the one loop diagrams involved
   in the Kubo formulae. Finally we show that charge diffusion mode of an
   ideal 2 dimensional Weyl gas in the presence of a finite chemical
   potential acquires a speed, which is equal to half the speed of light.}},

Abstract = {{We consider here a robust study of stellar dynamics for white dwarf
   stars with polytropic matter in the weak-field approximation using the
   Lane-Emden equation from the brane-world scenario. We also derive an
   analytical solution to the nonlocal energy density and show the behavior
   and sensitivity of these stars to the presence of extra dimensions.
   Similarly, we analyze stability and compactness, in order to show
   whether it is possible to agree with the conventional wisdom of white
   dwarfs dynamics. Our results predict an average value of the brane
   tension of <lambda > greater than or similar to 84.818 MeV4, with a
   standard deviation sigma similar or equal to 82.021 MeV4, which comes
   from a sample of dwarf stars, being weaker than other astrophysical
   observations but remaining higher than cosmological results provided by
   nucleosynthesis among others.}},

Title = {{Validity of flounce sign to rule out medial meniscus tear in knee
   arthroscopy}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The meniscal flounce is wavy fold in free inner border of
   meniscus seen during knee arthroscopy. The presence of this flounce in
   medial meniscus has been found to be highly predictive of normal medial
   meniscus. With meniscus related symptoms being commonest indication for
   undergoing knee arthroscopy, presence or absence of medial meniscus
   flounce, can be a good guiding sign. In this study, we aimed to validate
   the significance of the flounce sign in ruling out medial meniscus tear.
   Methods: A prospective study was undertaken to validate the significance
   of flounce sign. There were 62 patients who underwent arthroscopic
   surgery of the knee over the duration of one and half years. Free inner
   margin of medial meniscus as seen through anterolateral portal was
   recorded for the presence or absence of flounce. The sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value
   (NPV) and accuracy of this sign was then calculated for diagnosing
   normal medial meniscus. Significance was tested with chi square test
   with 95 \% confidence interval.
   Results: A total of 62 cases were included. The sensitivity,
   specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of flounce sign was found to be 67.64
   \%, 92.85 \%, 92 \%, 70.27 \% and 79.03 \% respectively, and the result
   was significant (p value = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The flounce sign has been shown to have high diagnostic
   value. Use of it in routine knee arthroscopy can be helpful,
   particularly during screening procedure and in exploring tears which are
   usually not seen easily through routine portals.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore the experiences of patients and carers involved in
   patient and public involvement (PPI) activities for stroke research.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews conducted with stroke survivors and
   carers (n=11) were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four key
   themes emerged: impact of PPI on the individual and the research
   process, credibility and expertise, level of involvement and barriers
   and facilitators to PPI for stroke survivors and carers. The perceived
   benefits to the research process included: asking questions, keeping
   researchers grounded and directing the research agenda. All participants
   drew upon their experiential expertise in their PPI role, but some also
   drew upon their professional expertise to provide additional
   credibility. Stroke survivors and carers can be involved in PPI at
   different levels of involvement simultaneously and the majority of
   participants wanted to be more involved. Barriers to involvement
   included: location, transport and stroke survivors capacity to
   concentrate and comprehend complex information. Facilitators included:
   reimbursement for travel and time and professionals effort to facilitate
   involvement. Conclusions: PPI in stroke research benefits stroke
   survivors and carers and is perceived to benefit the research process.
   The barriers and facilitators should be considered by professionals
   intending to engage stroke survivors and carers collaboratively in
   research.Implications for RehabilitationThis study has implications for
   PPI in stroke rehabilitation research, which could also be extrapolated
   to stroke rehabilitation service development and
   evaluation.Professionals facilitating PPI need to invest in developing
   supportive relationships in order to maintain ongoing
   involvement.Professionals need to be aware of how the varied
   consequences of stroke might impede participation and strategies to
   facilitate involvement for all who wish to be involved.For each
   rehabilitation issue being considered professionals need to decide: (1)
   how representative of the specific rehabilitation population the PPI
   members need to be, (2) whether experience alone is sufficient or
   whether additional professional skills are required and (3) whether
   training is likely to assist involvement or potentially reduce the lay
   representation.}},

Title = {{Precision subtypes of T cell-mediated rejection identified by molecular
   profiles}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Among kidney transplant recipients, the treatment of choice for acute T
   cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) with pulse steroids or antibody protocols
   has variable outcomes. Some rejection episodes are resistant to an
   initial steroid pulse, but respond to subsequent antibody protocols. The
   biological mechanisms causing the different therapeutic responses are
   not currently understood. Histological examination of the renal
   allograft is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of acute
   rejection. The Banff Classification System was established to
   standardize the histopathological diagnosis and to direct therapy.
   Although widely used, it shows variability among pathologists and lacks
   criteria to guide precision individualized therapy. The analysis of the
   transcriptome in allograft biopsies, which we analyzed in this study,
   provides a strategy to develop molecular diagnoses that would have
   increased diagnostic precision and assist the development of
   individualized treatment. Our hypothesis is that the histological
   classification of TCMR contains multiple subtypes of rejection. Using R
   language algorithms to determine statistical significance,
   multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical, we analyzed differential
   gene expression based on microarray data from biopsies classified as
   TCMR. Next, we identified KEGG functions, protein protein interaction
   networks, gene regulatory networks, and predicted therapeutic targets
   using the integrated database Consesnsus-PathDB (CPDB). Based on our
   analysis, two distinct clusters of biopsies termed TCMR01 and TCMR02
   were identified. Despite having the same Banff classification, we
   identified 1933 differentially expressed genes between the two clusters.
   These genes were further divided into three major groups: a core group
   contained within both the TCMR01 and TCMR02 subtypes, as well as genes
   unique to TCMR01 or TCMR02. The subtypes of TCMR utilized different
   biological pathways, different regulatory networks and were predicted to
   respond to different therapeutic agents. Our results suggest approaches
   to identify more precise molecular diagnoses of TCMR, which could form
   the basis for personalized treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The circulant graph C-n(s1,s2, ...,st) is the 2t regular graph with n
   vertices labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1, where each vertex i has the 2t
   neighbors i +/- s(1), i +/- s(2), ..., i +/- s(t) in which all the
   operations are modulo n. Golin et al. (2010) derive several closed
   integral formulas for the asymptotic limit
   (n ->infinity)lim T (C-n (s1,s2, ..., sk, left perpendicularn/d1right
   perpendicular+e1,leftperpendicularn/d2right perpendicular+e2, ..., left
   perpendicularn/dlright perpendicular+el))(1/n)
   as a function of s(i), d(j) and e(k), where T(G) is the number of
   spanning trees in graph G. In this paper we derive simple and explicit
   formulas for the number of spanning trees in circulant graphs
   C-pn(1,a1n,a2n, ...a1n). Following from the formulas we show that
   (n ->infinity)lim T (C-pn(1,a1n,a2n, ...,a1n))(1/n)
   = (t=0)Pi(k-1)(root 1+(i=1)Sigma(l)sin(2) pi a(i)t/p + root(i=1)Sigma(l)
   pi a(i)t/p)(2p/k),
   where k = lcm(p/a(1), p/a(2), ..., p/a(l)), and lcm denotes the least
   common multiple. The asymptotic limit represents the average growth rate
   of the number of spanning trees.

Abstract = {{Multicomponent nanoframes (NFs) with a hollow structural character have
   shown the potential to be applied in many fields. Here we report a novel
   strategy to synthesize ZnxCd1-xS NFs via the synergistic actions of the
   graphene oxide (GO) confinement effect and oriented cation exchange. The
   obtained samples have been systematically characterized by x-ray
   diffractometry (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray photospectroscopy (XPS)
   and Raman spectrometry. The results show that the two dimensional space
   confinement effect induced by GO and the oriented cation exchange
   reaction are responsible for the formation of the multicomponent NFs.
   The high photoelectrochemical activity and the low cost of the starting
   materials will make the multicomponent NFs applicable in photoelectronic
   and photoelectrocatalytic fields.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic Buffering in a Monogenean: Canalization and Developmental
   Stability in Shape and Size of the Haptoral Anchors of Ligophorus
   cephali (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae)}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variation results from the balance between sources of
   variation and counteracting regulatory mechanisms. Canalization and
   developmental stability are two such mechanisms, acting at two different
   levels of regulation. The issue of whether or not they act concurrently
   as a common developmental buffering capacity has been subject to debate.
   We used geometric morphometrics to quantify the mechanisms that
   guarantee phenotypic constancy in the haptoral anchors of Ligophorus
   cephali. Canalization and developmental stability were appraised by
   estimating inter- and intra-individual variation, respectively, in size
   and shape of dorsal and ventral anchors. The latter variation was
   estimated as fluctuating asymmetry (FA) between anchor pairs. The
   general-buffering-capacity hypothesis was tested by two different
   methods based on correlations and Principal Components Analyses of the
   different components of size and shape variation. Evidence for FA in the
   dorsal and ventral anchors in both shape and size was found. Our
   analyses supported the hypothesis of a general developmental buffering
   capacity. The evidence was more compelling for shape than for size and,
   particularly, for the ventral anchors than for the dorsal ones. These
   results are in line with previous studies of dactylogyrids suggesting
   that ventral anchors secure a firmer, more permanent attachment, whereas
   dorsal anchors are more mobile. Because fixation to the host is crucial
   for survival in ectoparasites, we suggest that homeostatic development
   of the ventral anchors has been promoted to ensure the morphological
   constancy required for efficient attachment. Geometric morphometrics can
   be readily applied to other host-monogenean models, affording not only
   to disentangle the effects of canalization and developmental stability,
   as shown herein, but to further partition the environmental and genetic
   components of the former.}},

Title = {{Targeted, noninvasive blockade of cortical neuronal activity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Here we describe a novel method to noninvasively modulate targeted brain
   areas through the temporary disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   via focused ultrasound, enabling focal delivery of a neuroactive
   substance. Ultrasound was used to locally disrupt the BBB in rat
   somatosensory cortex, and intravenous administration of GABA then
   produced a dose-dependent suppression of somatosensory-evoked potentials
   in response to electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. No
   suppression was observed 1-5 days afterwards or in control animals where
   the BBB was not disrupted. This method has several advantages over
   existing techniques: it is noninvasive; it is repeatable via additional
   GABA injections; multiple brain regions can be affected simultaneously;
   suppression magnitude can be titrated by GABA dose; and the method can
   be used with freely behaving subjects. We anticipate that the
   application of neuroactive substances in this way will be a useful tool
   for noninvasively mapping brain function, and potentially for surgical
   planning or novel therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Hfq facilitates gene regulation by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs),
   thereby affecting bacterial attributes such as biofilm formation and
   virulence. Escherichia coli Hfq recognizes specific U-rich and AAN
   motifs in sRNAs and target mRNAs, after which an arginine patch on the
   rim promotes base pairing between their complementary sequences. In the
   cell, Hfq must discriminate between many similar RNAs. Here, we report
   that acidic amino acids lining the sRNA binding channel between the
   inner pore and rim of the Hfq hexamer contribute to the selectivity of
   Hfq's chaperone activity. RNase footprinting, in vitro binding and
   stopped-flow fluorescence annealing assays showed that alanine
   substitution of D9, E18 or E37 strengthened RNA interactions with the
   rim of Hfq and increased annealing of non-specific or U-tailed RNA
   oligomers. Although the mutants were less able than wild-type Hfq to
   anneal sRNAs with wild-type rpoSmRNA, the D9A mutation bypassed
   recruitment of Hfq to an (AAN)4 motif in rpoS, both in vitro and in
   vivo. These results suggest that acidic residues normally modulate
   access of RNAs to the arginine patch. We propose that this selectivity
   limits indiscriminate target selection by E coli Hfq and enforces
   binding modes that favor genuine sRNA and mRNA pairs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   of the displacement reaction using aniline submonomers in solid-phase
   peptoid synthesis. This is achieved by adding halophilic silver salts to
   the displacement reaction, facilitating bromide abstraction and AgBr
   precipitation. Mechanistic insight derived from analysis of a series of
   15 substituted anilines reveals that the silver-mediated reaction
   proceeds through a transition state that has considerably less positive
   charge buildup on the incoming nucleophile and an enhanced leaving
   group. This straightforward enhancement to the submonomer method enables
   the rapid room temperature synthesis of a wide variety of N-aryl
   glycine-rich peptoid oligomers, possessing both electron-withdrawing and
   -donating substituents, in good yields.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare disease with
   poor prognosis in spite of significant improvement in survival, due to
   new chemotherapy regimens. We describe here patients' profiles and
   management in daily practice in France.
   Methods: Observational retrospective study. Data were collected from
   medical files. All patients with histologically proven MPM diagnosed
   from January 2005 to December 2008 were included in the participating
   sites.
   Results: Four hundred and six patients were included in 37 sites: mean
   age 68.9 +/- 9.8 years, male predominance (sex ratio 3.27), latency of
   the disease 45.7 years, epithelioid type 83 \%. Diagnosis was made using
   thoracoscopy in 80.8 \% of patients. Radical surgery was performed in
   6.2 \% of cases. Chemotherapy was administered to 74.6 \% of patients.
   First line regimens consisted mainly of platinum + pemetrexed (91 \%) or
   pemetrexed alone (7 \%). Objective response rate was 17.2 \% and another
   41.6 \% of patients experienced disease stabilization. Half of these
   patients underwent second line chemotherapy (platinium + pemetrexed 31.6
   \%, pemetrexed alone 24.6 \%), resulting in a 6 \% response rate.
   Third-line chemotherapy (56 patients) yielded disease control in 5.4 \%
   of cases.
   Conclusions: The management of MPM in France is usually in accordance
   with guidelines. Response rates are somewhat lower than those described
   in clinical trials.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The traditional application of the sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerotis
   (tiger's milk mushroom) by the indigenous folks as tonic and remedy to
   treat a variety of ailments has been documented in Malaysia. Indigenous
   communities claimed to have consumed the decoction to boost their
   alertness during hunting. Mental alertness is believed to be related to
   neuronal health and neuroactivity. In the present study, the cell
   viability and neuritogenic effects of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium hot
   aqueous and ethanolic extracts, and crude polysaccharides on rat
   pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were studied. Interestingly, the hot
   aqueous extract exhibited neuritogenic activity comparable to NGF in
   PC-12 cells. However, the extracts and crude polysaccharides stimulated
   neuritogenesis without stimulating the production of NGF in PC-12 cells.
   The involvements of the TrkA receptor and MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in hot
   aqueous extract-stimulated neuritogenesis were examined by Trk (K252a)
   and MEK/ ERK1/2 (U0126 and PD98059) inhibitors. There was no significant
   difference in protein expression in NGF- and hot aqueous extract-treated
   cells for both total and phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK. The neuritogenic
   activity in PC-12 cells stimulated by hot aqueous and ethanolic
   extracts, and crude polysaccharides of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium
   mimicking NGF activity via the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is reported
   for the first time.}},

Title = {{Multilocus genotyping of Giardia duodenalis (Lambl, 1859) from
   symptomatic human infections in Slovenia}},
Journal = {{FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Giardiasis is a common gastrointestinal infection of humans and animals
   with a worldwide distribution. Eight genetic groups (known as
   assemblages A to H) are currently recognised within the species complex
   of Giardia duodenalis (Lambl, 1859), of which assemblages A and B are
   responsible for infection of humans and other mammalian hosts.
   Genotyping data on giardiasis are not available from Slovenia. In this
   work, we have characterised isolates of G. duodenalis from 85 human
   symptomatic cases collected during 2002-2013. Genomic DNAs were first
   tested by a real-time (rt) PCR assay and then by conventional PCR at
   three loci (beta-giardin, bg; triose phosphate isomerase, tpi; and
   glutamate dehydrogenase, gdh). We found that the threshold cycle (Ct)
   values in rt-PCR testing were higher for samples collected during
   2002-2005 and that this was paralleled by a low amplification rate in
   conventional PCR (6 of 32, i. e. 19\%). In contrast, lower Ct values and
   higher amplification rate (45 of 53; 85\%) were observed for samples
   collected during 2006-2013, suggesting an adverse effect of prolonged
   freezing of stools. Assemblages A and B were found with an almost
   identical frequency in the 51 genotyped samples. In agreement with
   previous studies, sequences from assemblage B isolates were
   characterised by larger genetic variability and by the presence of
   heterogeneous positions, which made assignment to specific genotypes
   difficult. Less variability was observed in sequences from assemblage A
   isolates, which belonged to the human-specific subassemblage AII. These
   data showed that the genotypes of G. duodenalis that circulate in humans
   in Slovenia are similar to those previously identified in Europe.}},

Title = {{Bone morphogenetic protein 7 sensitizes O6-methylguanine
   methyltransferase expressing-glioblastoma stem cells to clinically
   relevant dose of temozolomide}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral DNA-alkylating agent used for
   treating patients with glioblastoma. However, therapeutic benefits of
   TMZ can be compromised by the expression of O6-methylguanine
   methyltransferase (MGMT) in tumor tissue. Here we used MGMT-expressing
   glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) lines as a model for investigating the
   molecular mechanism underlying TMZ resistance, while aiming to explore a
   new treatment strategy designed to possibly overcome resistance to the
   clinically relevant dose of TMZ (35 mu M).
   Methods: MGMT-expressing GSC cultures are resistant to TMZ, and IC50
   (half maximal inhibitory concentration) is estimated at around 500 mu M.
   Clonogenic GSC surviving 500 mu M TMZ (GSC-500 mu M TMZ), were isolated.
   Molecular signatures were identified via comparative analysis of
   expression microarray against parental GSC (GSC-parental). The
   recombinant protein of top downregulated signature was used as a single
   agent or in combination with TMZ, for evaluating therapeutic effects of
   treatment of GSC.
   Results: The molecular signatures characterized an activation of
   protective stress responses in GSC-500 mu M TMZ, mainly including
   biotransformation/detoxification of xenobiotics, blocked endoplasmic
   reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT), and inhibited growth/differentiation. Bone
   morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) was identified as the top down-regulated
   gene in GSC-500 mu M TMZ. Although augmenting BMP7 signaling in GSC by
   exogenous BMP7 treatment did not effectively stop GSC growth, it
   markedly sensitized both GSC-500 mu M TMZ and GSC-parental to 35 mu M
   TMZ treatment, leading to loss of self-renewal and migration capacity.
   BMP7 treatment induced senescence of GSC cultures and suppressed mRNA
   expression of CD133, MGMT, and ATP-binding cassette drug efflux
   transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2), as well as reconfigured transcriptional
   profiles in GSC by downregulating genes associated with
   EMT/migration/invasion, stemness, inflammation/immune response, and cell
   proliferation/tumorigenesis. BMP7 treatment significantly prolonged
   survival time of animals intracranially inoculated with GSC when
   compared to those untreated or treated with TMZ alone (p = 0.0017),
   whereas combination of two agents further extended animal survival
   compared to BMP7 alone (p = 0.0489).
   Conclusions: These data support the view that reduced endogenous BMP7
   expression/signaling in GSC may contribute to maintained stemness, EMT,
   and chemoresistant phenotype, suggesting that BMP7 treatment may provide
   a novel strategy in combination with TMZ for an effective treatment of
   glioblastoma exhibiting unmethylated MGMT.}},

   spectrometry. Using high-resolution H2O2 and peroxidase-dependent silver
   ion reduction and nanoparticle deposition, imaged by electron
   microscopy, csPxt activity was shown to be localized in the peripheral
   layer of drawn silk fibres. CsPxt catalyses dityrosine cross-linking
   within the adhesive peripheral layer post-draw, initiated perhaps by
   H2O2 generated by a silk gland-specific superoxide dismutase 3 (csSOD3)
   from environmental reactive oxygen species present in natural water.
   CsSOD3 was also shown to be a glycoprotein and is likely localized in
   the peripheral layer. Using a synthetic fluorescent phenolic copolymer
   and confocal microscopy, it was shown that csPxt catalyses oxidative
   cross-linking to external polyphenolic compounds capable of diffusive
   interpenetration into the fuzzy peripheral coating, including humic
   acid, a natural surface-active polyphenol. The results provide evidence
   of enzyme-mediated covalent cross-linking of a natural bioadhesive to
   polyphenol conditioned interfaces as a mechanism of permanent adhesion
   underwater.}},

Title = {{Plasmon-resonant Raman spectroscopy in metallic nanoparticles:
   Surface-enhanced scattering by electronic excitations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Since the discovery of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 40 years
   ago, the origin of the ``background{''} that is systematically observed
   in SERS spectra has remained questionable. To deeply analyze this
   phenomenon, plasmon-resonant Raman scattering was recorded under
   specific experimental conditions on a panel of composite multilayer
   samples containing noble metal (Ag and Au) nanoparticles. Stokes,
   anti-Stokes, and wide, including very low, frequency ranges have been
   explored. The effects of temperature, size (in the nm range), embedding
   medium (SiO2, Si3N4, or TiO2) or ligands have been successively
   analyzed. Both lattice (Lamb modes and bulk phonons) and electron
   (plasmon mode and electron-hole excitations) dynamics have been
   investigated. This work confirms that in Ag-based nanoplasmonics
   composite layers, only Raman scattering by single-particle electronic
   excitations accounts for the background. This latter appears as an
   intrinsic phenomenon independently of the presence of molecules on the
   metallic surface. Its spectral shape is well described by revisiting a
   model developed in the 1990s for analyzing electron scattering in dirty
   metals, and used later in superconductors. The gs factor, that
   determines the effective mean-free path of free carriers, is evaluated,
   g(s)(expt) = 0.33 +/- 0.04, in good agreement with a recent evaluation
   based on time-dependent local density approximation g(s)(theor) = 0.32.
   Confinement and interface roughness effects at the nanometer range thus
   appear crucial to understand and control SERS enhancement and more
   generally plasmon-enhanced processes on metallic surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the structural and vibrational properties of the
   sesquiterpene lactone onopordopicrin (OP) were studied by using infrared
   spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations together
   with the 6-31G{*} basis set. The harmonic vibrational wavenumbers for
   the optimized geometry were calculated at the same level of theory. The
   complete assignment of the observed bands in the infrared spectrum was
   performed by combining the DFT calculations with Pulay's scaled quantum
   mechanical force field (SQMFF) methodology. The comparison between the
   theoretical and experimental infrared spectrum demonstrated good
   agreement. Then, the results were used to predict the Raman spectrum.
   Additionally, the structural properties of OP, such as atomic charges,
   bond orders, molecular electrostatic potentials, characteristics of
   electronic delocalization and topological properties of the electronic
   charge density were evaluated by natural bond orbital (NBO), atoms in
   molecules (AIM) and frontier orbitals studies. The calculated energy
   band gap and the chemical potential (mu), electronegativity (chi),
   global hardness (eta), global softness (S) and global electrophilicity
   index (omega) descriptors predicted for OP low reactivity, higher
   stability and lower electrophilicity index as compared with the

Abstract = {{For the first time a novel oxygen reduction catalyst with a 3D

   This nano-architecture with highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles exhibits a
   very high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and polymer
   electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell performance. The mass activity of
   half cells is 1.6 times of that of the GNS supported Pt, and 2.4 times
   that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Moreover, after an
   accelerated stress test our catalyst shows a predominantly
   electrochemical stability compared with benchmarks. Further fuel cell

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Cabozantinib is an oral, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
   targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) as well as
   MET and AXL, each of which has been implicated in the pathobiology of
   metastatic renal-cell carcinoma or in the development of resistance to
   antiangiogenic drugs. This randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial
   evaluated the efficacy of cabozantinib, as compared with everolimus, in
   patients with renal-cell carcinoma that had progressed after
   VEGFR-targeted therapy.
   METHODS
   We randomly assigned 658 patients to receive cabozantinib at a dose of
   60 mg daily or everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily. The primary end
   point was progression-free survival. Secondary efficacy end points were
   overall survival and objective response rate.
   RESULTS
   Median progression-free survival was 7.4 months with cabozantinib and
   3.8 months with everolimus. The rate of progression or death was 42\%
   lower with cabozantinib than with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 0.45 to 0.75; P<0.001). The objective
   response rate was 21\% with cabozantinib and 5\% with everolimus
   (P<0.001). A planned interim analysis showed that overall survival was
   longer with cabozantinib than with everolimus (hazard ratio for death,
   0.67; 95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P = 0.005) but did not cross the
   significance boundary for the interim analysis. Adverse events were
   managed with dose reductions; doses were reduced in 60\% of the patients
   who received cabozantinib and in 25\% of those who received everolimus.
   Discontinuation of study treatment owing to adverse events occurred in
   9\% of the patients who received cabozantinib and in 10\% of those who
   received everolimus.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Progression-free survival was longer with cabozantinib than with
   everolimus among patients with renal-cell carcinoma that had progressed
   after VEGFR-targeted therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature effects of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells having simple
   planar architecture were investigated on the crystal structure and
   photovoltaic performance. The obvious changes in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal
   structure were found by varying the temperature as a consequence to the
   augmentation in lattice parameters and expansion of the unit cell. The
   expansion of the crystal gave a serious influence on the performance of
   the solar cells, where the differences in the coefficients of the
   thermal expansion (CTEs) together with the lattice mismatch between TiO2
   and perovskite materials might cause interfacial defects responsible for
   the deterioration in the photovoltaic performance. Interestingly, the
   hysteresis in the cubic phase is very small because of the less
   distorted angles of the CH3NH3PbI3 structure against the temperature
   fluctuation.}},

Abstract = {{Marine reserves (MRs) areusedworldwide as ameans of
   conserving-biodiversity and protecting depleted populations. Despite
   major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have
   proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear
   expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to
   guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that
   reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can
   reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries
   and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially
   explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based
   fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable
   yield (MSY) under conventional quota management if reserves provide
   protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to
   recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net
   fishery benefit of MRs is lost when gains in fecundity of old, large
   individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with
   high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show
   that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve
   implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable
   catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic
   overfishing.}},

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria have established dominant aquatic populations around the
   world, generally in aggressive environments and under severe stress
   conditions, e.g., intense solar radiation. Several marine strains make
   use of compounds such as the polyenic molecules for their damage
   protection justifying the range of colours observed for these species.
   The peridinin/chlorophyll-a/protein complex is an excellent example of
   essential structures used for self-prevention; their systems allow to
   them surviving under aggressive environments. In our simulations, few
   protective dyes are required to the initial specimen defense; this is an
   important data concern the synthetic priority in order to supply
   adequate damage protection. Raman measurements obtained with 1064 and
   514.5 nm excitations for Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis
   aeruginosa strains shows bands assignable to the carotenoid peridinin.
   It was characterized by bands at 1940, 1650, 1515, 1449, 1185, 1155 and
   1000 cm(-1) assigned to nu(C=C=C) (allenic vibration), nu(C=C/CO),
   nu(C-=C), delta(C=H, C-18/19), delta(C-H), nu(C-C), and rho(C-CH3),
   respectively. Recognition by Raman spectroscopy proved to be an
   important tool for preliminaries detections and characterization of
   polyene molecules in several algae, besides initiate an interesting
   discussion about their synthetic priority. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Five different butynediol-ethoxylate modified polysiloxanes (PSi-EO)

   low-hydrogen containing silicone oil (LPMHS) by acid-catalyzed
   polymerization and the following hydrosilylation reaction with
   1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-butyne. The chemical composition of each
   product was confirmed by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, and Si-29 NMR. The surface
   activities and aggregation behaviors of PSi-EO surfactants in aqueous
   solution were studied systematically using surface tension, dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   contact-angle methodologies. Relatively low critical aggregation
   concentration (15-34 mg.L-1) and surface tension (similar to 25
   mN.m(-1)) were measured for PSi-EO aqueous solution. The rate of surface
   tension reduction increased both with increasing PSi-EO concentration
   and with increases in the proportion of hydrophilic moieties within the
   synthesized compounds. Furthermore, DLS and TEM studies revealed that
   PSi-EO self-assembled in aqueous solution to form spherical aggregates.
   Contact-angle measurements conducted upon low-energy paraffin film
   surfaces demonstrated that PSi-EO exhibited efficient spreading at
   concentrations above the critical aggregation concentration.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we employ phase-contrast tapping mode and conductive
   probe atomic force microscopy (cp-AFM) as tools to investigate the
   nanoscale morphology and proton conductance of a 3M perfluoro-imide acid
   (PFIA) membrane (625 EW) over a large range of relative humidity (3-95\%
   RH). As a point of comparison, we also investigate 3M perfluorosulfonic
   acid (PFSA) (825 EW) and Nafion 212. With AFM, we assess the membrane's
   water retention and mechanical stability at low RH and high RH,
   respectively. Cp-AFM allows us to spatially resolve the hydrophilic and
   electrochemically active domains under a similar set of conditions and
   observe directly the ties between membrane morphology and proton
   conductance. From our data, we are able to correlate the improved water
   retention indicated by the size of the hydrophilic domains with the
   proton conductance in the PFIA membrane at elevated temperature and
   compare the result with that observed for the PFSA and Nafion. At high
   RH conditions, we see evidence of a nearly continuous hydrophilic phase,
   which indicates a high degree of swelling.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of a vaccine or specific treatments for Ebola virus
   disease (EVD), early identification of cases is crucial for the control
   of EVD epidemics. We evaluated a new extraction kit (SpeedXtract (SE),
   Qiagen) on sera and swabs in combination with an improved diagnostic
   reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the
   detection of Ebola virus (EBOV-RT-RPA). The performance of combined
   extraction and detection was best for swabs. Sensitivity and specificity
   of the combined SE and EBOV-RT-RPA were tested in a mobile laboratory
   consisting of a mobile glovebox and a Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase powered
   by a battery and solar panel, deployed to Matoto Conakry, Guinea as part
   of the reinforced surveillance strategy in April 2015 to reach the goal
   of zero cases. The EBOV-RT-RPA was evaluated in comparison to two
   real-time PCR assays. Of 928 post-mortem swabs, 120 tested positive, and
   the combined SE and EBOV-RT-RPA yielded a sensitivity and specificity of
   100\% in reference to one real-time RT-PCR assay. Another widely used
   real-time RT-PCR was much less sensitive than expected. Results were
   provided very fast within 30 to 60 min, and the field deployment of the
   mobile laboratory helped improve burial management and community

Title = {{How Big of an Effect Do Small Dams Have? Using Geomorphological
   Footprints to Quantify Spatial Impact of Low-Head Dams and Identify
   Patterns of Across-Dam Variation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Longitudinal connectivity is a fundamental characteristic of rivers that
   can be disrupted by natural and anthropogenic processes. Dams are
   significant disruptions to streams. Over 2,000,000 low-head dams (<7.6 m
   high) fragment United States rivers. Despite potential adverse impacts
   of these ubiquitous disturbances, the spatial impacts of low-head dams
   on geomorphology and ecology are largely untested. Progress for research
   and conservation is impaired by not knowing the magnitude of low-head
   dam impacts. Based on the geomorphic literature, we refined a
   methodology that allowed us to quantify the spatial extent of low-head
   dam impacts (herein dam footprint), assessed variation in dam footprints
   across low-head dams within a river network, and identified select
   aspects of the context of this variation. Wetted width, depth, and
   substrate size distributions upstream and downstream of six low-head
   dams within the Upper Neosho River, Kansas, United States of America
   were measured. Total dam footprints averaged 7.9 km (3.0-15.3 km) or 287
   wetted widths (136437 wetted widths). Estimates included both upstream
   (mean: 6.7 km or 243 wetted widths) and downstream footprints (mean: 1.2
   km or 44 wetted widths). Altogether the six low-head dams impacted 47.3
   km (about 17\%) of the mainstem in the river network. Despite
   differences in age, size, location, and primary function, the sizes of
   geomorphic footprints of individual low-head dams in the Upper Neosho
   river network were relatively similar. The number of upstream dams and
   distance to upstream dams, but not dam height, affected the spatial
   extent of dam footprints. In summary, ubiquitous low-head dams
   individually and cumulatively altered lotic ecosystems. Both
   characteristics of individual dams and the context of neighboring dams
   affected low-head dam impacts within the river network. For these
   reasons, low-head dams require a different, more integrative, approach
   for research and management than the individualistic approach that has
   been applied to larger dams.}},

   dissociation energy. Experimentally determined dissociation energies
   were compared with a variety of ab initio calculations. One of the

Abstract = {{Over two centuries of economic growth have put undeniable pressure on
   the ecological systems that underpin human well-being. While it is
   agreed that these pressures are increasing, views divide on how they may
   be alleviated. Some suggest technological advances will automatically
   keep us from transgressing key environmental thresholds; others that
   policy reform can reconcile economic and ecological goals; while a third
   school argues that only a fundamental shift in societal values can keep
   human demands within the Earth's ecological limits. Here we use novel
   integrated analysis of the energy-water-food nexus, rural land use
   (including biodiversity), material flows and climate change to explore
   whether mounting ecological pressures in Australia can be reversed,
   while the population grows and living standards improve. We show that,
   in the right circumstances, economic and environmental outcomes can be
   decoupled. Although economic growth is strong across all scenarios,
   environmental performance varies widely: pressures are projected to more
   than double, stabilize or fall markedly by 2050. However, we find no
   evidence that decoupling will occur automatically. Nor do we find that a
   shift in societal values is required. Rather, extensions of current
   policies that mobilize technology and incentivize reduced pressure
   account for the majority of differences in environmental performance.
   Our results show that Australia can make great progress towards
   sustainable prosperity, if it chooses to do so.}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{The new type of molecular recognition, in which an intrinsically
   disordered region (IDR) of a protein binds to many different target
   proteins with target-dependent structure formation, is indispensable to
   the expression of life phenomena and also implicated in a number of
   diseases. According to the prevailing view, the physicochemical factors
   responsible for the binding are also target dependent. Here we consider
   an IDR of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, p53CTD, as an important
   example related to carcinogenesis and analyze its binding to four
   targets accompanying the formation of target-dependent structures (i.e.,
   helix, sheet, and two different coils) using our statistical-mechanical
   method combined with molecular models for water. We find that all of the
   seemingly different binding processes are driven by a large gain of the
   translational, configurational entropy of water in the system. The gain
   originates from sufficiently high shape complementarity on the atomic
   level within the p53CTD target interface. It is also required that the
   electrostatic complementarity be ensured as much as possible to
   compensate for the dehydration. Such complementarities are achieved in
   harmony with the portion of the target to which p53CTD binds, leading to
   a large diversity of structures of p53CTD formed upon binding: If they
   are not achievable, the binding does not occur. This finding is made
   possible only by calculating the changes in thermodynamic quantities

Abstract = {{This study was aimed to study the effect of solution pH on the aid
   effect of compound bioflocculant (CBF) in dye wastewater treatment
   combined with widely used alum coagulants. The color removal performance
   of aluminum sulfate (AS) and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) was
   significantly improved with the aid of CBF. In addition, the effective
   pH range of alum salts was also broadened by CBF. Floc properties
   including size, growth, breakage, re-growth and sedimentation natural
   were determined by PDA2000. The results showed that floc size was
   enlarged by CBF, especially at acidic conditions and that floc grew
   faster when CBF was added, especially under neutral and alkaline
   conditions. Floc sedimentation rate, floc breakage and recovery factor
   were also enhanced by CBF throughout the studied pH range. CBF was
   characterized by FT-IR on which there is abundant -COO- and -NH. It was
   suggested that adsorption and bridging effect of CBF performed a
   positive role in dye wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   of chain segments, the drawing-induced extended conformation can be
   found. On the contrary, polymer chains can adjust to form a helical
   conformation. Besides, the conformation fraction, segmental orientation,
   inter-molecular interactions, relative mobility of the flexible and
   rigid segments of PTT chains and cold crystallization behavior were
   discussed in detail for clarifying the micro-structural changes during
   drawing process, and we found that the segmental orientation and the
   conformational changes occurred simultaneously when T < T-g, while the
   former arose prior to the latter when T > T-g. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Chitin oligomers are of interest because of their numerous biologically
   relevant properties. To prepare chitin oligomers containing 4-6 GlcNAc
   units {[}(GlcNAc)(4-6)], alpha- and beta-chitin were hydrolyzed with
   concentrated hydrochloric acid at 40 degrees C. The reactant was mixed
   with acetone to recover the acetone-insoluble material, and
   (GlcNAc)(4-6) was efficiently recovered after subsequent water
   extraction. Composition analysis using gel permeation chromatography and
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that (GlcNAc)(4-6) could be
   isolated from the acetone-insoluble material with recoveries of
   approximately 17\% and 21\% from the starting alpha-chitin and
   beta-chitin, respectively. The acetone precipitation method is highly
   useful for recovering chitin oligomers from the acid hydrolysate of
   chitin. The changes in the molecular size and higher-order structure of
   chitin during the course of hydrolysis were also analyzed, and a model
   that explains the process of oligomer accumulation is proposed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRaf mutants, but not oncogenic KRas
   mutants, are sensitive to MEK inhibitors (MEKi). The mechanism
   underlying the intrinsic resistance to MEKi in KRas-mutant cells is
   under intensive investigation. Here, we pursued this mechanism by live
   imaging of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and mammalian
   target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activities in oncogenic KRas or
   BRaf-mutant cancer cells. We established eight cancer cell lines
   expressing Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for ERK
   activity and S6K activity, which was used as a surrogate marker for
   mTORC1 activity. Under increasing concentrations of MEKi, ERK activity
   correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in BRaf-mutant cancer
   cells, but not KRas-mutant cancer cells. The administration of PI3K
   inhibitors resulted in a linear correlation between ERK activity and
   cell growth rate in KRas-mutant cancer cells. Intriguingly, mTORC1
   activity was correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in both
   BRaf-mutant cancer cells and KRas-mutant cancer cells. These
   observations suggested that mTORC1 activity had a pivotal role in cell
   growth and that the mTORC1 activity was maintained primarily by the ERK
   pathway in BRaf-mutant cancer cells and by both the ERK and PI3K
   pathways in KRas-mutant cancer cells. FRET imaging revealed that MEKi
   inhibited mTORC1 activity with slow kinetics, implying transcriptional
   control of mTORC1 activity by ERK. In agreement with this observation,
   MEKi induced the expression of negative regulators of mTORC1, including
   TSC1, TSC2 and Deptor, which occurred more significantly in BRaf-mutant
   cells than in KRas-mutant cells. These findings suggested that the
   suppression of mTORC1 activity and induction of negative regulators of
   mTORC1 in cancer cells treated for at least 1 day could be used as
   surrogate markers for the MEKi sensitivity of cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{The instability of organometal halide perovskites when in contact with
   water is a serious challenge to their feasibility as solar cell
   materials. Although studies of moisture exposure have been conducted, an
   atomistic understanding of the degradation mechanism is required. Toward
   this goal, we study the interaction of water with the (001) surfaces of
   CH3NH3PbI3 under low and high water concentrations using density
   functional theory. We find that water adsorption is heavily influenced
   by the orientation of the methylammonium cations close to the surface.
   We demonstrate that, depending on methylammonium orientation, the water
   molecule can infiltrate into the hollow site of the surface and get
   trapped. Controlling dipole orientation via poling or interfacial
   engineering could thus enhance its moisture stability. No direct
   reaction between the water and methylammonium molecules is seen.
   Furthermore, calculations with an implicit solvation model indicate that
   a higher water concentration may facilitate degradation through
   increased lattice distortion.}},

Abstract = {{This comparative study focuses on the cyclodehydration reaction of
   poly(hydroxyamide)s (PHAs) and the thermal rearrangement (TR) reaction
   of aromatic poly(hydroxyimide)s (APIs) to produce poly-benzoxazoles
   (PBOs) for application as gas separation membranes. Systematic
   comparisons between the two routes showed that PHA cyclodehydration can
   produce fully converted PBO membranes at a temperature more than 100
   degrees C lower than the API-TR route. Gas separation performance of
   PHA-PBOs is comparable to API-TR polymers, and PHA-PBOs are considerably
   more mechanically robust. More importantly, PBO films can be produced
   equally well in both air and inert atmospheres via the PHA
   cyclodehydration route. The PHA-PBOs formed in air have statistically
   the same physical and transport properties as those formed in N-2. The
   present study provides fundamental information regarding the PHA-to-PBO
   cyclodehydration process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pigment composition of six painted metal knight shields of the Order
   of the Elephant dating from the second half of the 20th century
   belonging to the Danish royal collection were studied using Raman
   microscopy. By focusing a 785 nm laser with a 50x objective on particles
   in paint cross sections, it was possible to identify the following 20
   compounds: hematite, goethite, chrome red/orange, chrome yellow, zinc
   chrome yellow, carbon black, toluidine red PR3, chlorinated para red
   PR4, dinitroaniline orange PO5, phthalocyanine blue PB15, indanthrone
   blue PB60, ultramarine, Prussian blue, lead white, anatase, rutile,
   calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, gypsum and dolomite. The components
   were frequently present in complex pigment mixtures. Additional
   information was obtained by elemental analysis with scanning electron
   microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) to identify
   cobalt blue, zinc white and cadmium red, as well as to indicate the
   presence of zinc white in some pigment mixtures. The study allowed a
   comparison between the industrially applied preparation layers and the
   artistic paint layers applied by the heraldic painter. Differences in
   the choice of paint and pigment types were observed on the earliest
   knight shields, demonstrating a general delay of industrial materials
   into artist paints. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Unusual Deep Water sponge assemblage in South China-Witness of the
   end-Ordovician mass extinction}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{There are few sponges known from the end-Ordovician to early-Silurian
   strata all over the world, and no records of sponge fossils have been
   found yet in China during this interval. Here we report a unique sponge
   assemblage spanning the interval of the end-Ordovician mass extinction
   from the Kaochiapien Formation (Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian) in
   South China. This assemblage contains a variety of well-preserved
   siliceous sponges, including both Burgess Shale-type and modern type
   taxa. It is clear that this assemblage developed in deep water, low
   energy ecosystem with less competitors and more vacant niches. Its
   explosion may be related to the euxinic and anoxic condition as well as
   the noticeable transgression during the end-Ordovician mass extinction.
   The excellent preservation of this assemblage is probably due to the
   rapid burial by mud turbidites. This unusual sponge assemblage provides
   a link between the Burgess Shale-type deep water sponges and the modern
   forms. It gives an excellent insight into the deep sea palaeoecology and
   the macroevolution of Phanerozoic sponges, and opens a new window to
   investigate the marine ecosystem before and after the end-Ordovician
   mass extinction. It also offers potential to search for exceptional
   fossil biota across the Ordovician-Silurian boundary interval in China.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we prove that an expanding Thurston map f : S-2 -> S-2 is
   asymptotically h-expansive if and only if it has no periodic critical
   points, and that no expanding Thurston map is h-expansive. As a
   consequence, for each expanding Thurston map without periodic critical
   points and each real-valued continuous potential on S-2, there exists at
   least one equilibrium state. For such maps, we also establish large
   deviation principles for iterated preimages and periodic points. It
   follows that iterated preimages and periodic points are equidistributed
   with respect to the unique equilibrium state for an expanding Thurston
   map without periodic critical points and a potential that is Holder
   continuous with respect to a visual metric on S-2. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Injectable hydrogel precursor solution was prepared by physical blend of
   xanthan gum (XG) and methylcellulose (MC) in aqueous solution. Due to
   the formation of XG network composed of XG double helical strand
   structure, XG/MC blend was a high viscous solution with good
   shear-thinning property at room temperature. When the temperature was
   changed from 23 to 37 degrees C, thermo-responsive MC network formed,
   which caused XG/MC blend solution to gelate. The gelation time and
   storage modulus of the blend can be tuned by XG and/or MC
   concentrations. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that
   the blend solution immediately recovered its high viscosity and rapidly
   formed hydrogel at body temperature after injection using a syringe. In
   vivo biocompatibility and biodegradability of the hydrogel were
   validated by implantation of the hydrogel in rats. In vitro
   investigation demonstrated that XG/MC blend is a promising injectable
   hydrogel material for long-term drug delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present report pertains to synthesis and combined experimental-OFT
   studies of a series of four novel mixed-ligand complexes of cobalt(II)
   of the general composition {[}Co(dha)(L)(H2O)(2)], where dhaH =
   dehydroacetic acid, LH beta-ketoenolates viz., o-acetoacetotoluidide
   (o-aatdH), o-acetoacetanisidide (o-aansH), acetylacetone (acacH) or
   1-benzoylacetone (1-bac). The resulting complexes were formulated based
   on elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic measurements, mass
   spectrometric, IR, electronic, electron spin resonance and cyclic
   voltammetric studies. The TGA based thermal behavior of one
   representative complex was evaluated. Molecular geometry optimizations
   and vibrational frequency calculations have been performed with Gaussian
   09 software package by using density functional theory (DFT) methods
   with B3LYP/LANL2MB combination for dhaH and one of its complexes,
   {[}Co(dha)(1-bac)(H2O)(2)]. Theoretical data has been found in an
   excellent agreement with the experimental results. Based on experimental
   and theoretical data, suitable trans-octahedral structure has been
   proposed for the present class of complexes. Moreover, the complexes
   also showed a satisfactory antibacterial activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{The impact of comorbid disease history on all-cause and cancer-specific
   mortality in myeloid leukemia and myeloma - a Swedish population-based
   study}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Comorbidity increases overall mortality in patients
   diagnosed with hematological malignancies. The impact of comorbidity on
   cancer-specific mortality, taking competing risks into account, has not
   been evaluated.
   Methods: Using the Swedish Cancer Register, we identified patients aged
   > 18 years with a first diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, N =
   2,550), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, N = 1,000) or myeloma (N = 4,584)
   2002-2009. Comorbid disease history was assessed through in-and
   out-patient care as defined in the Charlson comorbidity index. Mortality
   rate ratios (MRR) were estimated through 2012 using Poisson regression.
   Probabilities of cancer-specific death were computed using flexible
   parametric survival models.
   Results: Comorbidity was associated with increased all-cause as well as
   cancer-specific mortality (cancer-specific MRR: AML= 1.27, 95 \% CI:
   1.15-1.40; CML = 1.28, 0.96-1.70; myeloma = 1.17, 1.08-1.28) compared
   with patients without comorbidity. Disorders associated with higher
   cancer-specific mortality were renal disease (in patients with AML, CML
   and myeloma), cerebrovascular conditions, dementia, psychiatric disease
   (AML, myeloma), liver and rheumatic disease (AML), cardiovascular and
   pulmonary disease (myeloma). The difference in the probability of
   cancer-specific death, comparing patients with and without comorbidity,
   was largest among AML patients < 70 years, whereas in myeloma the
   difference did not vary by age among the elderly. The probability of
   cancer-specific death was generally higher than other-cause death even
   in older age groups, irrespective of comorbidity.
   Conclusion: Comorbidities associated with organ failure or cognitive
   function are associated with poorer prognosis in several hematological
   malignancies, likely due to lower treatment tolerability. The results
   highlight the need for a better balance between treatment toxicity and
   efficacy in comorbid and elderly AML, CML and myeloma patients.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the catalytic activity of the subnanometer-sized
   bimetallic Au19Pt cluster for oxidation of CO via first-principles
   density functional theory calculations. For this purpose we consider two
   structurally similar and energetically close homotops of the Au19Pt
   cluster with the Pt atom occupying an edge (Td-E) or a facet (Td-S) site
   of a 20-atom tetrahedron. Using these homotops as catalysts we calculate
   the complete reaction paths and the thermodynamic functions
   corresponding to the oxidation of CO to CO2. It is found that the
   oxidation of CO on the Td-S isomer occurs through a smaller reaction
   barrier (0.38 eV) as compared with that on the Td-E isomer (0.70 eV),
   although the activation of O-2 on the latter is much higher than that on
   the former. Therefore, a clear conclusion is that a higher O-2
   activation, which is generally believed to be the key factor for CO
   oxidation, solely cannot determine the catalytic efficiency of the Au-Pt
   bimetallic clusters. In addition, we find a stronger CO adsorption on
   the Td-E isomer (2.06 eV) as compared with that on the Td-S isomer (1.68
   eV). Although stronger CO adsorption on the Td-E isomer leads to a
   higher O2 activation; however, high value of CO adsorption energy
   deteriorates the catalytic activity of the Td-E isomer towards the CO
   oxidation reaction. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of
   Chemicals) is the European Union's chemical regulation for the
   management of risk to human health and the environment (European
   Chemicals Agency, 2006). This regulation entered into force in June 2007
   and required manufacturers and importers to register substances produced
   in annual quantities of 1000 tonnes or more by December 2010, with
   further deadlines for lower tonnages in 2013 and 2018. Depending on the
   type of registration, required information included the substance's
   identification, the hazards of the substance, the potential exposure
   arising from the manufacture or import, the identified uses of the
   substance, and the operational conditions and risk management measures
   applied or recommended to downstream users. Among the content developed
   to support this information were Derived No-Effect Levels or Derived
   Minimal Effect Levels (DNELs/DMELs) for human health hazard assessment,
   Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for environmental hazard
   assessment, and exposure scenarios for exposure and risk assessment.
   Once registered, substances may undergo evaluation by the European
   Chemicals Agency (ECHA) or Member State authorities and be subject to
   requests for additional information or testing as well as additional
   risk reduction measures. To manage the REACH registration and related
   activities for the European olefins and aromatics industry, the Lower
   Olefins and Aromatics REACH Consortium was formed in 2008 with
   administrative and technical support provided by Penman Consulting. A
   total of 135 substances are managed by this group including 26
   individual chemical registrations (e.g. benzene, 1,3-butadiene) and 13
   categories consisting of 5-26 substances. This presentation will
   describe the content of selected registrations prepared for 2010 in
   addition to the significant post-2010 activities. Beyond REACH, content
   of the registrations may also be relevant to other European activities,
   for example consideration of worker DNELs/DMELs for occupational
   exposure level setting, discussion of this aspect will be presented for
   1,3-butadiene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In general male and females learn differently. Learning style is the
   learners' preferred mode of learning in terms of the sensory modality by
   which they prefer to take in new information. While learning each of we
   have our own preferences for the way in which we receive the new
   information. Each learner has distinct and consistent preferred ways of
   perception, organization and retention. The visual, auditory \&
   kinesthetic (VAK) questionnaire identifies student's preferences for
   particular modes of information presentation. We administered the VAK
   questionnaire to our first-year medical students studying at Vinayaka
   Mission's Kirupananda Variyar medical College, Salem and 153 out of 200
   students (76.5\%) returned the completed questionnaire. The responses
   were compiled and assessed for gender difference in learning style
   preference; (45.1\%) of males and (47\%) of females preferred a single
   mode of information presentation. Among the male students, 14.1\% of the
   students preferred Visual (learning from graphs, charts, and flow
   diagrams), 18\% of the students preferred Auditory (learning from
   speech), 13\% of the students preferred Kinesthetic (learning from
   touch, hearing, smell, taste, and sight). Among the female students
   14.2\% of the students preferred Visual, 17.8\% of the students
   preferred Auditory, 15\% of the students preferred Kinesthetic.
   Furthermore, 54.9\% of male and 53\% of female respondents preferred
   multiple modes {[}male: two modes (51.6\%), three modes (3.3\%), and;
   females: two modes (48.4\%), three modes (4.6\%)] of presentation. In
   summary, a majority of male students preferred multimodal instruction,
   specifically, two modes, whereas a majority of female students preferred
   two and single-mode instruction. Thus, male and female students have
   significantly different learning styles. Knowing the students preferred
   modes can help to avoid mismatches in the styles between instructors and
   learners. Assist students to build confidence and more effectively
   manage their own learning.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report a simple and practical approach for the facile
   production of superhydrophobic modified-TiO2/PDMS composite surface on
   the Cu substrate by a dip coating process. The chemical compositions,
   surface morphologies and hydrophobicity were investigated using Fourier
   transform infrared spectrometry, scanning electron microscope and
   contact angle measurement. The results show that the hydrophobic -CH3,
   -CH2, -CF3 and -CF2 groups were introduced into TiO2 particles via
   modification. The superhydrophobicity of composite surface is the best
   when polydimethylsiloxane content is 30\%, the superhydrophobic surface
   with a water contact angle of 162.3 and a sliding angle of 4.3 is
   derived from the assembly of low-surface-energy film on it and its rough
   surface with hierarchical micro/nano-structures. Interestingly,
   superhydrophobic surface can convert superhydrophobicity to and from
   hydrophilicity by UV light and heat treatment. In addition, the
   as-prepared superhydrophobic surface has excellent self-cleaning
   ability, corrosion resistance and good durability, indicating the
   considerable range of potential applications for fabricating
   superhydrophobic surface on Cu materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents the preparation of in situ electrodeposited rGO/MnO2
   nanocomposite as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor application.
   The work describes and evaluates the performance of prepared electrode
   via green and facile electrodeposition technique of in situ

   composite electrode increased after GO and D (+) glucose solution has
   been added in the deposition electrolyte. This study found that a
   suitable concentration of D (+) glucose in the deposition electrolyte
   can slow down the nucleation process of MnO2 particles and lead to
   uniform and ultrathin nanoflakes structure. The optimize electrode
   exhibited low transfer resistance and resulted on excellent
   electrochemical performance in three electrolyte systems viz. Na2SO4,
   KOH and KOH/K3Fe(CN)(6) redox electrolytes. The optimum energy density
   and power density were 1851 Whkg(-1) and 68 kWkg(-1) at current density
   of 20 Ag-1 in mixed KOH/K3Fe(CN)(6) electrolyte.}},

Abstract = {{A thin film nanocomposite nanofiltration (TFN-NF) membrane was prepared
   by interfacial polymerization between piperazine and trimesoyl chloride
   monomers and partially reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/TiO2 nanocomposite
   as a hydrophilic modifier. The surface properties of the prepared NF
   membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle measurements.
   These analyses confirmed the improved hydrophilicity and the smoother
   surface of the modified membranes. Furthermore, the separation
   performance of the membranes was evaluated using 2000 mg/L of Na2SO4 and
   NaCl solutions tested by cross-flow filtration system. TFN membrane
   containing 0.005 wt.\% rGO/TiO2 presented the optimum separation
   performance, including 60.6 L/m(2) h water flux and 93.57\% and 36.61\%
   salt rejection of Na2SO4 and NaCl solutions, respectively. The fouling
   resistance of the membranes was also studied using bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) protein as a model fouling agent, based on the water flux decline
   during the filtration process. Results showed that decoration of TiO2
   nanoparticles onto GO nanosheets had dual effects on the TiO2
   incorporation into the cross-linked active layer of NF membrane, thereby
   improved the fouling resistance of these membranes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Gallium antimonide (GaSb) has an extremely high electron mobility and an
   excellent lattice match with various III-V ternary and quaternary
   compounds. In this study, the effect of wet-etching processes on the
   GaSb (001) surface was investigated, with a focus on the effect of H2O2.
   Dilution with H2O and addition of H2O2 in HF/H2O2/H2O, NH4OH/H2O2/H2P,
   and HCl/H2O2/H2O mixtures produced different effects on the GaSb
   surface. The etching rate of GaSb increased with a high dilution ratio
   and a small amount of H2O2 in the mixture of NH4OH/H2O2/H2O. The
   addition of H2O2 in H2O decreased GaSb oxide thickness and increased the
   contact angle on the GaSb surface and the XPS Ga 3d and Sb 3d(3/2) peak
   area ratios of Ga2O3/GaSb and Sb2O3/GaSb, which strongly imply that the
   H2O2 in the wet-etching solution served as an inhibitor of surface
   oxidation on GaSb. On the basis of the observed etching rates of GaSb,
   oxidation kinetics, contact angles, and chemical states, it is suggested
   that concurrent oxidation of GaSb and etching of oxidized GaSb occur on
   the GaSb surface in the presence of H2O2. Furthermore, the overall
   kinetics is determined by the relative amount of H2O2, which depends on
   the pH of the etching solution.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: FNAC is a simple, cost effective, readily repeated and quick
   to perform procedure, with excellent patient compliance. It is, however,
   not without limitations related to specimen adequacy, sampling
   techniques, and overlapping cytological features between benign and
   malignant follicular neoplasm. Here arises the need for
   Histopathological examination (HPE), as it is considered the final
   diagnostic test.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aims at correlating the cytological diagnosis with
   the final histopathological diagnosis to evaluate the sensitivity,
   specificity and positive predictive value of smears and thereby its role
   in the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid swellings.
   METHODS: Data for the study was collected from patients undergoing
   thyroidectomy in Department of ENT, Head and Neck Surgery at Raja
   Rajeswari Medical College and Hospital, Bangalore. The study period was
   from 1st October 2013 -30th September 2014. Fine needle aspiration
   cytology of the swelling was done on OPD basis for all patients
   presenting with goitre. Thyroidectomy specimens preserved in 10\%
   formalin was sent for histopathology examination.
   RESULTS: A total of 157 patients was evaluated, out of which 118
   patients underwent FNAC. 15 were unsatisfactory aspirates. A total of 57
   cases were operated specimens were available for histopathologic
   examination. The mean age of patients were 36.9 years. The ratio between
   female to males was 7.1: 1. The sensitivity of FNAC was 87.5\%, the
   Specificity was 100\%, accuracy was 98.2\%, and the positive predictive
   value of a positive test for malignancy was 100\%.
   CONCLUSION: FNAC of thyroid lesions has been shown to be safe, simple,
   cost effective and accurate method for management of palpable thyroid
   lesions. It not only facilitates the communication among
   cytopathologists, surgeons, radiologists, and endocrinologists but also
   facilitate research into the epidemiology, molecular biology, pathology
   and diagnosis of thyroid diseases.}},

   the ground state by the concave-convex pi-pi CT interaction. Herein, the
   structures, binding interactions, electronic absorption spectra, and
   first hyperpolarizabilities of a series of Li+ and Li atom in contact
   with C-60 have been explored with density functional theory methods. It
   is found that independent of the doping position, doping Li atom can
   significantly narrow the wide gap between the highest occupied molecular
   orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (E-gap
   = 2.82 eV) of the pure C20H10/C-60 in the range of 0.86-0.99 eV. Among
   them, the Li-doped outer isomer C20H10/LiC60 can exhibit the intriguing
   n-type characteristic, where a high energy level containing the excess
   electron is introduced as the new HOMO orbital in the original gap of
   C20H10/C-60. Furthermore, the diffuse excess electron also brings
   C20H10/C-60 the considerable first hyperpolarizability, which is 3.53 X
   10(-29) esu. When Li+ and Li were encapsulated into the C-60 cage, inner
   complexes C20H10/Li+@C-60 and C20H10/Li+@C-60 of enhanced static first
   hyperpolarizabilities (5.39 and 2.13 X 10(-29) esu, respectively) are
   also delivered due to that encapsulated Li+@C-60 and Li@C-60 show
   enhanced electron acceptability as compared to pristine C-60, leading to
   more obvious intermolecular CT transitions. From a certain point of
   view, such systems can be considered as high-performance NLO materials
   that combine the basic characteristics of a classical donor-acceptor
   superstructure and systems with cations and easily polarizable excess
   electrons.}},

Title = {{Insights into immune responses in oral cancer through proteomic analysis
   of saliva and salivary extracellular vesicles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The development and progression of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
   (OSCC) involves complex cellular mechanisms that contribute to the low
   five-year survival rate of approximately 20\% among diagnosed patients.
   However, the biological processes essential to tumor progression are not
   completely understood. Therefore, detecting alterations in the salivary
   proteome may assist in elucidating the cellular mechanisms modulated in
   OSCC and improve the clinical prognosis of the disease. The proteome of
   whole saliva and salivary extracellular vesicles (EVs) from patients
   with OSCC and healthy individuals were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and
   label-free protein quantification. Proteome data analysis was performed
   using statistical, machine learning and feature selection methods with
   additional functional annotation. Biological processes related to immune
   responses, peptidase inhibitor activity, iron coordination and protease
   binding were overrepresented in the group of differentially expressed
   proteins. Proteins related to the inflammatory system, transport of
   metals and cellular growth and proliferation were identified in the
   proteome of salivary EVs. The proteomics data were robust and could
   classify OSCC with 90\% accuracy. The saliva proteome analysis revealed
   that immune processes are related to the presence of OSCC and indicate
   that proteomics data can contribute to determining OSCC prognosis.}},

Title = {{Full-length single-cell RNA-seq applied to a viral human cancer:
   applications to HPV expression and splicing analysis in HeLa S3 cells}},
Journal = {{GIGASCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Viral infection causes multiple forms of human cancer, and
   HPV infection is the primary factor in cervical carcinomas. Recent
   single-cell RNA-seq studies highlight the tumor heterogeneity present in
   most cancers, but virally induced tumors have not been studied. HeLa is
   a well characterized HPV+ cervical cancer cell line.
   Result: We developed a new high throughput platform to prepare
   single-cell RNA on a nanoliter scale based on a customized microwell
   chip. Using this method, we successfully amplified full-length
   transcripts of 669 single HeLa S3 cells and 40 of them were randomly
   selected to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on these data, we
   obtained a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of HeLa S3
   cells in gene expression, alternative splicing and fusions. Furthermore,
   we identified a high diversity of HPV-18 expression and splicing at the
   single-cell level. By co-expression analysis we identified 283 E6, E7
   co-regulated genes, including CDC25, PCNA, PLK4, BUB1B and IRF1 known to
   interact with HPV viral proteins.
   Conclusion: Our results reveal the heterogeneity of a virus-infected
   cell line. It not only provides a transcriptome characterization of HeLa
   S3 cells at the single cell level, but is a demonstration of the power
   of single cell RNA-seq analysis of virally infected cells and cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Three polysaccharides, PSPP1-1, PSPP2-1 and PSPP3-1, were isolated from
   purple sweet potato. The three polysaccharides belonged to p-type
   polysaccharides and contained low proportions of proteins and uronic
   acids. PSPP1-1 and PSPP3-1 with molecular weights of 33.3 and 75.3 kDa,
   respectively, were composed of rhamnose, xylose, glucose and galactose,
   whereas PSPP2-1 with molecular weight of 17.8 kDa was composed of
   rhamnose and galactose. The three polysaccharides possessed in vitro
   antioxidant (scavenging DPPH radicals, chelating ferrous ions and
   reducing power) and antitumor activities (against SGC7901 and SW620
   cells) in a dose-dependent manner. Among the three polysaccharides,
   PSPP2-1 exhibited the strongest reducing power, scavenging activity on
   DPPH radicals and chelating capability on ferrous ions. PSPP1-1 showed
   the strongest inhibitory activities on the growth of SGC7901 and SW620
   cells. In addition, flow cytometry results showed that PSPP1-1 could
   induce apoptosis in SGC7901 and SW620 cells. These results suggest that
   polysaccharides from purple sweet potato are potential natural
   antioxidant and antitumor agents that can be used as drugs or functional
   food ingredients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel fractal tree-like channels network heat sink in spindle's
   cooling sleeve is designed based on fractal theory. A three-dimensional
   thermal and hydrodynamic model for fractal tree-like channels net heat
   sink is developed. The heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics
   are numerically investigated, taking into consideration conjugate heat
   transfer in the channel walls. The traditional helical channel net heat
   sink is designed with the same convective heat transfer area and inlet
   geometric dimensions. The pressure drop, temperature uniformity and
   coefficient of performance of the fractal tree-shaped net heat sink are
   evaluated and compared with those of the traditional helical channel net
   heat sink. A conclusion is made that fractal tree-like channels net heat
   sink has lower pressure drop, more uniform temperature field
   distribution and larger coefficient of performance than that of the
   traditional helical channel net heat sink. Both heat sinks were
   fabricated on a steel bar. The conclusion is verified by the experiment.

Abstract = {{In this study, nanocrystalline ZnAl2O4 (ZA) (x = 0-20 wt\%) were
   introduced into Ni0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 ferrite (NZ) by a solid-state reaction
   method combining a sol-gel auto-combustion method. The effects of ZA
   addition on the crystalline phase formation, microstructures, magnetic
   and dielectric properties were systematically investigated. X-ray
   diffraction and scanning electron microscope results reveal that the
   added ZA can fully solve into the NZ to form a ceramic with single-phase
   cubic spinel structure, and the grain size decreases obviously as x > 5
   wt\%. Meanwhile, the magnetic and dielectric properties exhibit
   significantly dependent on the ZA addition content. With the increasing
   addition level of ZA from 0 to 20 wt\%, the initial permeability mu(i)
   is found increased initially and then decreased with the maximum 679 at
   x = 0.5 wt\%. For the samples with x <= 5 wt\%, permittivity epsilon' is
   relatively higher at low frequencies (epsilon' = 91-138 at 1 MHz) and
   dielectric loss tan delta(epsilon) shows distinct peak behavior. When x
   reaches 10 wt\%, however, the epsilon' and tan delta(epsilon) show very
   stable spectra from 1 MHz to 1 GHz. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Islanding detection plays an important role in operation and control of
   distributed generations (DGs). In this study, a novel hybrid method is
   proposed, which combines decision tree (DT) with voltage and frequency
   positive feedbacks for islanding detection in DGs. In the proposed
   method, the feature indices of prescribed events are captured and
   recorded in a target location to train a DT classifier, and the
   classifier can then be used for categorising islanding mode or
   grid-connected mode. The voltage and frequency positive feedback schemes
   are employed to regulate the DG power outputs based on voltage and
   frequency deviation between DG outputs and rated values. Furthermore,
   the disturbances are introduced to change the feature indices
   significantly when DG is switched to islanding mode, which can increase
   the sensitivities of feature indices and improve detection accuracy. The
   proposed hybrid method has been fully evaluated and tested on a
   representative DG system with two DGs. Simulation studies demonstrate
   that the proposed method can detect the islanding more accurately in
   situations where the power is balanced between DG output and load
   consumption, and can also improve detection accuracy in situations where
   DG system operates in minimum or maximum loading states.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Crocin biosynthesis in Crocus has been proposed to proceed through a
   zeaxanthin cleavage pathway catalyzed by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase
   2 (CCD2), and followed by glucosylation reactions catalyzed by CsGT2
   (UGT74AD1). In Crocus ancyrensis flowers, crocins with eight (crocin-1),
   seven (crocin-2), and six glucose (crocin-3) moieties accumulated both
   in stigma and tepals. We have characterized the structure of these
   highly glucosylated crocins and follow up their accumulation by
   high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector
   along the development of both tissues, and coupled to the isolation and
   analysis of the expression of eighteen genes (PSY-I, PSY-II, PDS-(1-0,
   ISO-ZDS, ZDS, CtrISO, LYC-I and II, BCH, CaCCD2, UGT74AD2-5) related
   with the apocarotenoid metabolism in C. ancyrensis tepals and stigmas.
   Structure elucidation of crocin-1 and crocin-2 was done by the combined
   use of 1D and 2D {[}H-1, H-1] (gCOSY and TOCSY and ROESY) and
   {[}H-1-C-13] NMR experiments, revealing that for crocin-1 was
   all-trans-crocetin O-{[}beta-D- Glucopyranosyl)-(1 ->
   4)-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1 -> 2)]-O-{[}beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 ->
   6)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl diester, while crocin-2 showed an identical
   structure except for the absence of one glucose residue in one end of
   the molecule. Crocins accumulation was not synchronically regulated in
   stigma and tepals, although in both cases crocins accumulation parallels
   tissue development, decreasing at anthesis. The expression of the
   carotenogenic genes PSY, ZDS-V, BCH, and LCY-II was correlated with
   crocins accumulation. In addition, CaCCD2 and only one of the four
   glucosyltransferase encoding genes, UGT74AD2, were highly expressed, and
   the expression was correlated with high levels of crocins accumulation
   in stigma and tepals.}},

Abstract = {{Effectively composite materials with optimized structures exhibited
   promising potential in continuing improving the electrochemical
   performances of supercapacitors in the past few years. Here, we proposed
   a rational design of branched CoMoO4@CoNiO2 core/shell nanowire arrays
   on Ni foam by two steps of hydrothermal processing. Owing to the high
   activity of the scaffold-like CoMoO4 nanowires and the well-defined
   CoNiO2 nanoneedles, the three-dimensional (3D) electrode architectures
   achieved remarkable electrochemical performances with high areal
   specific capacitance (5.31 F/cm(2) at 5 mA/cm(2)) and superior cycling
   stability(159\% of the original specific capacitance, i.e., 95.7\% of
   the maximum retained after 5000 cycles at 30 mA/cm(2)). The
   all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors composed of such electrode
   and activated carbon (AC) exhibited an areal specific capacitance of
   1.54 F/cm(2) at 10 mA/cm(2) and a rate capability (59.75 Wh/kg at a 1464
   W/kg) comparable with Li-ion batteries. It also showed an excellent
   cycling stability with no capacitance attenuation after 50000 cycles at
   100 mA/cm(2). After rapid charging (1 s), such supercapacitors in series
   could lighten a red LED for a long time and drive a mini motor
   effectively, demonstrating advances in energy storage, scalable
   integrated applications, and promising commercial potential.}},

Abstract = {{The present data showed that a natural compound isolated from the plant
   Physalis pubescens L. (Solanaceae), physapubescin B, exhibited antitumor
   activity against prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Treating prostate
   cancer cells with physapubescin B resulted in the accumulation of cells
   in the G2/M phase, which was associated with reduced Cdc25C levels and
   increased levels of CyclinB1, P21 as well as p-Cdk1 (Tyr15).
   Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was increased in
   physapubescin B-treated PC-3 cells. Furthermore, the physapubescin
   B-induced decrease of Cdc25C protein expression together with the G2/M
   phase cell cycle arrest were significantly abrogated by antioxidant NAC
   and GSH. Our data also demonstrated that physapubescin B exhibited
   strong in vivo antitumor efficacy in human prostate cancer PC3
   xenograft. In conclusion, our results provide clear evidence that
   physapubescin B exhibits antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo
   and deserves further development as an anticancer agent.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen coumarin-oxadiazole-appended phenols were synthesized, while

   (ABTS(+center dot)) and to inhibit the oxidation of DNA caused by
   2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH) and Cu2+/glutathione
   (GSH). The coumarin-oxadiazole-appended phenols containing the hydroxyl
   group were able to inhibit AAPH-induced oxidation of DNA and to quench
   ABTS(+center dot), and the antioxidant effectiveness depended upon the
   number of hydroxyl groups. Moreover, the coumarin-oxadiazole-appended
   phenols used herein were able to inhibit Cu2+/GSH-induced oxidation of
   DNA, and the inhibitory effect generated by bromide was similar to that
   of the hydroxyl group. In particular, the antioxidant effectiveness of
   para-bromide at the benzene ring even approached to that of Trolox. (C)

Title = {{Ethnobotany of medicinal plants used in Antakya: A multicultural
   district in Hatay Province of Turkey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{118-152}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: We have compiled information about the
   medicinal plants used in folk medicine in the district of Antakya. Since
   its establishment by King Seleucus I in 300 B.C., Antakya (old Antioch)
   has hosted nearly 20 civilizations. Antakya, neighboring Northwestern
   Syria, is located on the western end of the ``Silk Road{''} and was one
   of the great centers of Graeco-Roman world. Today, Antakya is a
   cosmopolitan city in which Arabic and Turkish are widely spoken, and
   where distinct ethnic and religious communities, such as Arab Alawite,
   Arab Christian, Arab Sunni, Turk Sunni, Armenian, and Jewish, have been
   living together in harmony for centuries. In addition, the rich flora in
   the vicinity of Antakya also renders the area interesting in terms of
   ethnobotanical fieldwork.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to compile the information about
   plants used for medicinal purposes by local people in the district of
   Antakya. This city is a significant region in terms of ethnobotanical
   fieldwork, owing to its cosmopolitan structure, long history, relatively
   preserved traditional community structure, and rich flora. Furthermore,
   we sought to compare the ethnomedicinal data geographically,
   cross-culturally, and historically.
   Materials and methods: The ethnobotany of medicinal plants used in the
   district of Antakya has been investigated through two separate studies;
   one was conducted in 1975, interviewing 29 people, and the other was
   conducted in 2011-2013, interviewing 182 people. The use value (UV) and
   informant consensus factor (FIC) values of the plants were calculated.
   In order to interpret the authenticity and sources of the compiled
   ethnomedicinal information, previous publications that contain
   information about the similar medicinal uses of plants identified in our
   region were reviewed and evaluated meticulously. A comparison with the
   data obtained from other regions of Turkey and from other Mediterranean
   regions, as well as a cross-cultural analysis between the ethnic groups
   within the study area, was performed by implementation of the Jaccard
   index (JI)
   Results: Throughout the study, information about 202 medicinal plant
   taxa was compiled. Among these plants, 39 have either not yet been
   mentioned in ethnobotanical or medicinal studies, or have been used for
   a medicinal purpose other than those encountered in the literature
   review. The ethnomedicinal information we gathered from the study area
   exhibits close similarities to the ethnomedicinal information of other
   Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries where Arabic is spoken, as
   well as to that of Northern and Western Mediterranean countries where
   Latin languages are spoken. In addition to these similarities, in most
   cases, this ethnomedicinal information shows hybrid features of
   ethnomedicinal knowledge from Eastern and Western Mediterranean
   countries.
   Conclusion: Based on a literature survey, we found that the cited
   medicinal uses for 43 plants have also been corroborated by other
   various biological testings. This finding strongly suggests the
   importance of ethnobotanical studies in the development of new
   medicines. We believe that this study has compiled rich ethnomedicinal
   information that reflects the cosmopolitan structure of Antakya in a
   very good way. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Flos Cluysanthemi (FC), a commonly used
   traditional Chinese medicine, has five major cultivars ({''}Boju{''},
   ``Chuju{''}, ``Gongju{''}, ``Hangbaiju{''} and ``Huaiju{''}) from
   different sources. However, the active constituents of these cultivars
   have not been studied or characterized with respect to their
   bioactivity, which is a serious problem when considering quality and
   safety.
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the differences among the five cultivars
   of FC, and to establish a method for the standardization and quality
   control of FC related to its bioactivity.
   Materials and methods: In this study, the different ingredients in five
   cultivars of FC were identified by UPLC-Q/TOF and PCA, and the
   anti-inflammatory ingredients of FC were predicted and screened by
   artificial neural network (ANN) and an NF-kappa B luciferase reporter
   gene assay system. Using this comprehensive method, we successfully
   screened the anti-inflammatory markers of different cultivars of FC.
   Results: Nineteen marker ingredients were confirmed to contribute
   strongly to the cluster, and eleven compounds in the five cultivars of
   FC were found to exert potential anti-inflammatory effects. Among these
   compounds, the NF-kappa B inhibitor activity of
   apigenin-7-O-6{''}-malonyl-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-rutinoside,
   quercetin-7-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside,
   apigenin-7-O-rutinoside and apigenin-7-O-glucoside were first reported
   here. Chlorogenic acid, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic
   acid and luteolin were confirmed to be the most important
   anti-inflammatory marker ingredients useful for the quality control of
   FC.
   Conclusions: The proposed efficient and systematic method is helpful for
   the standardization and quality control of FC. Moreover, this
   comprehensive strategy may prove to be a powerful technique for the
   rapid establishment of quality control procedures related to bioactivity
   for other herbal samples and foods. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of
   adverse events in elderly patients who required inpatient admission
   after sustaining an ankle fracture and to consider these data in
   relation to geriatric hip fracture and other geriatric patient
   admissions.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with an ankle
   fracture, a hip fracture, or any other diagnosis was performed with the
   Medicare Part A database for 2008. The primary outcome measure was the
   one-year mortality rate, examined with multivariate analysis factoring
   for both patient age and preexisting comorbidity. Secondary outcome
   measures analyzed additional morbidity as reflected by length of stay,
   discharge disposition, readmissions, and medical complications.
   Results: There were 19,648 patients with ankle fractures, 193,980
   patients with hip fractures, and 5,801,831 patients with other admitting
   diagnoses. Significant differences (p < 0.001) were noted in both age
   and comorbidity status between the group with ankle fractures and the
   group with hip fractures. The one-year mortality after admission was
   11.9\% for patients with ankle fracture, 28.2\% for patients with hip
   fracture, and 21.5\% for patients with any other admission. Upon using
   multivariate analysis to account for both age and comorbidity, the
   hazard ratio for one-year mortality associated with fracture was 1.088
   for patients with hip fracture and 0.557 for patients with ankle
   fracture.
   Conclusions: Even after selecting for admitted patients and accounting
   for both age and comorbidity, geriatric patients with ankle fractures
   were found to have a lower one-year morbidity compared with geriatric
   patients who had sustained a hip fracture or alternative admitting
   diagnoses. Geriatric patients with ankle fractures are likely healthier
   and more active in ways that are not captured by simply accounting for
   age and comorbidity. These findings may support more aggressive
   definitive management of such injuries in this population.}},

Title = {{Biochar-amended potting medium reduces the susceptibility of rice to
   root-knot nematode infections}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biochar is a solid coproduct of biomass pyrolysis, and soil
   amended with biochar has been shown to enhance the productivity of
   various crops and induce systemic plant resistance to fungal pathogens.
   The aim of this study was to explore the ability of wood biochar to
   induce resistance to the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne
   graminicola in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) and examine its
   histochemical and molecular impact on plant defense mechanisms.
   Results: A 1.2 \% concentration of biochar added to the potting medium
   of rice was found to be the most effective at reducing nematode
   development in rice roots, whereas direct toxic effects of biochar
   exudates on nematode viability, infectivity or development were not
   observed. The increased plant resistance was associated with
   biochar-primed H2O2 accumulation as well as with the transcriptional
   enhancement of genes involved in the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway.
   The increased susceptibility of the Ein2b-RNAi line, which is deficient
   in ET signaling, further confirmed that biochar-induced priming acts at
   least partly through ET signaling.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that biochar amendments protect rice
   plants challenged by nematodes. This priming effect partially depends on
   the ET signaling pathway and enhanced H2O2 accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the physical properties and electronic structure calculations
   of a layered chromium oxypnictide, Sr2Cr3As2O2, which crystallizes in a
   Sr2Mn3As2O2-type structure containing both CrO2 planes and Cr2As2
   layers. The newly synthesized material exhibits a metallic conduction
   with a dominant electron-magnon scattering. Magnetic and specific-heat
   measurements indicate at least two intrinsic magnetic transitions below
   room temperature. One is an antiferromagnetic transition at 291 K,
   probably associated with a spin ordering in the Cr2As2 layers. Another
   transition is broad, occurring at around 38 K, and possibly due to a
   short-range spin order in the CrO2 planes. Our first-principles
   calculations indicate predominant two-dimensional antiferromagnetic
   exchange couplings, and suggest a KG-type {[}i.e., K2NiF4 (abbreviated
   as ``K{''}) type in the CrO2 sublattice and Neel (usually denoted by
   ``G{''}) type in the Cr2As2 sublattice] magnetic structure, with reduced
   moments for both Cr sublattices. The corresponding electronic states
   near the Fermi energy are mostly contributed from Cr - 3d orbitals which
   weakly (modestly) hybridize with the O - 2p (As - 4p) orbitals in the
   CrO2 (Cr2As2) layers. The bare band structure density of states at the
   Fermi level is only similar to 1/4 of the experimental value derived
   from the low-temperature specific-heat data, consistent with the
   remarkable electron-magnon coupling. The title compound is argued to be
   a possible candidate to host superconductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur is an attractive cathode material in energy storage devices due
   to its high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g(-1). However, practical
   application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries can be achieved only when
   the major barriers, including the shuttling effect of polysulfides
   (Li2Sx, x = 3-8), significant volume change (similar to 80\%), and the
   resultant rapid deterioration of electrodes, are tackled. Here, we
   propose an inside-out synthesis strategy by mimicking the structure of
   the pomegranate fruit to achieve conductive confinement of sulfur to
   address these issues. In the proposed pomegranate-like structure, sulfur
   and carbon nanotubes composite is encapsulated by the in situ formed
   amorphous carbon network, which allows the regeneration of electroactive
   material sulfur and the confinement of the sulfur as well as the lithium
   polysulfide within the electrical conductive carbon network.
   Consequently, a highly robust sulfur cathode is obtained, delivering
   remarkable performance in a Li-S battery. The obtained composite cathode
   shows a reversible capacity of 691 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with
   impressive cycle stability at the current density of 1600 mA g(-1).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{174}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dolichos falcatus Klein (DF), a Chinese
   Dai ethnic medicine popularly known as ``Tuoyeteng{''} in Yunnan
   province of China, has been widely used in China to treat fracture,
   rheumatoid arthritis and soft tissue injuries for a long time. Our
   previous study showed that saponins in DF (DFS) ameliorated the gouty
   arthritis induced by MSU crystals in vivo and in vitro. The present
   study was carried out to evaluate the no-observed-adverse-effect level
   (NOAEL) of DFS.
   Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (10/sex/group) were gavaged
   with DFS at dose level of 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight /day for
   90-days.
   Results: DFS administration did not result in mortality or show
   treatment-related changes in clinical signs of toxicity, body weights
   gain or feed consumption. Similarly, in addition to slightly hemolytic
   anemia and gastrointestinal tract lesion in males of high-dose treatment
   group, no toxicologically significant treatment-related changes in
   hematological, clinical chemistry, urine analysis parameters, organ
   weights, and macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities were noted during
   the testing period.
   Conclusion: The results of subchronic toxicity study support the NOAEL
   for DFS as 200 mg/kg/d in females and as 100 mg/kg/d in males. These
   results provide an important reference for further DFS-related clinical
   trials or new drug exploration. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Reducing oxidative stress is crucial to prevent hypoxia-reoxygenation
   (H/R)-induced lung injury. Resveratrol has excellent antioxidant and
   anti-inflammatory effects, and this study investigated its role in
   H/R-induced type II pneumocyte dysfunction. H/R conditions increased
   expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 beta
   (142.3 +/- 21.2\%, P < 0.05) and IL-6 (301.9 +/- 35.1\%, P < 0.01) in a
   type II alveolar epithelial cell line (A549), while the
   anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (64.6 +/- 9.8\%, P < 0.05) and
   surfactant proteins (SPs) decreased. However, resveratrol treatment
   effectively inhibited these effects. H/R significantly activated an
   inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, while
   resveratrol significantly inhibited H/R-induced NF-kappa B transcription
   activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   showing resveratrol-mediated reversal of H/R-induced inflammatory
   responses and dysfunction of type II pneumocyte cells in vitro. The
   effects of resveratrol were partially mediated by promoting SP
   expression and inhibiting inflammation with NF-kappa B pathway
   involvement. Therefore, our study provides new insights into mechanisms
   underlying the action of resveratrol in type II pneumocyte dysfunction.}},

Title = {{Health Insurance Status as a Barrier to Ideal Cardiovascular Health for

   Survey (NHANES)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Little is known about the association between cardiovascular (CV) health
   and health insurance status. We hypothesized that U.S. adults without
   health insurance coverage would have a lower likelihood of ideal
   cardiovascular health.
   Methods and Results
   Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data
   from 2007-2010, we examined the relationship between health insurance
   status and ideal CV health in U.S. adults aged >= 19 years and <65 (N =
   3304). Ideal CV health was defined by the American Heart Association
   (AHA) as the absence of clinically manifested CV disease and the
   simultaneous presence of 6-7 ``ideal{''} CV health factors and
   behaviors. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the
   relationship between health insurance status and the odds of ideal CV
   health. Of the U.S. adult population, 5.4\% attained ideal CV health,
   and 23.5\% were without health insurance coverage. Those without health
   insurance coverage were more likely to be young (p<0.0001), male
   (p<0.0001), non-white (p<0.0001), with less than a high school degree
   (p<0.0001), have a poverty-to-income ratio less than 1 (p<0.0001) and
   unemployed (p<0.0001) compared to those with coverage. Lack of health
   insurance coverage was associated with a lower likelihood of ideal CV
   health; however, this relationship was attenuated by socioeconomic
   status.
   Conclusions
   U.S. adults without health insurance coverage are less likely to have
   ideal CV health. Population-based strategies and interventions directed
   at the community-level may be one way to improve overall CV health and
   reach this at-risk group.}},

Abstract = {{A promising approach of designing mesostructured materials with novel
   physical behavior is to combine unique optical and electronic properties
   of solid nanoparticles with long-range ordering and facile response of
   soft matter to weak external stimuli. Here, orientationally ordered
   nematic liquid crystalline dispersions of rod-like upconversion
   nanoparticles are designed, practically realized, and characterized.
   Boundary conditions on particle surfaces, defined through surface
   functionalization, promote spontaneous unidirectional self-alignment of
   the dispersed rod-like nanoparticles, mechanically coupled to the
   molecular ordering direction of the thermotropic nematic liquid crystal
   host. As host is electrically switched at low voltages approximate to 1
   V, nanorods rotate, yielding tunable upconversion and polarized
   luminescence properties of the composite. Spectral and polarization
   dependencies are characterized and explained through invoking models of
   electrical switching of liquid crystals and upconversion dependence on
   crystalline matrices of nanorods, and their potential practical uses are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Humans recognize body parts in categories. Previous studies have shown
   that responses in the fusiform body area (FBA) and extrastriate body
   area (EBA) are evoked by the perception of the human body, when
   presented either as whole or as isolated parts. These responses occur
   approximately 190 ms after body images are visualized. The extent to
   which body-sensitive responses show specificity for different body part
   categories remains to be largely clarified. We used a decoding method to
   quantify neural responses associated with the perception of different
   categories of body parts. Nine subjects underwent measurements of their
   brain activities by magnetoencephalography (MEG) while viewing 14 images
   of feet, hands, mouths, and objects. We decoded categories of the
   presented images from the MEG signals using a support vector machine
   (SVM) and calculated their accuracy by 10-fold cross-validation. For
   each subject, a response that appeared to be a body-sensitive response
   was observed and the MEG signals corresponding to the three types of
   body categories were classified based on the signals in the
   occipitotemporal cortex. The accuracy in decoding body part categories
   (with a peak at approximately 48\%) was above chance (33.3\%) and
   significantly higher than that for random categories. According to the
   time course and location, the responses are suggested to be
   body-sensitive and to include information regarding the body part
   category. Finally, this non-invasive method can decode category
   information of a visual object with high temporal and spatial resolution
   and this result may have a significant impact in the field of brain
   machine interface research.}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cervical cancer (CC) is -second to breast cancer-a dominant
   cause of gynecological cancer-related deaths worldwide. CC tumor
   biopsies and blood samples are of easy access and vital for the
   development of future precision medicine strategies.
   Design: BIO-RAIDs is a prospective multicenter European study, presently
   recruiting patients in 6 EU countries. Tumor and liquid biopsies from
   patients with previously non-treated cervical cancer (stages IB2-IV) are
   collected at defined time points. Patients receive standard primary
   treatment according to the stage of their disease. 700 patients are
   planned to be enrolled. The main objectives are the discovery of
   -dominant molecular alterations, -signalling pathway activation, and
   -tumor micro-environment patterns that may predict response or
   resistance to treatment. An exhaustive molecular analysis is performed
   using 1 degrees Next generation sequencing, 2 degrees Reverse phase
   protein arrays and 3 degrees Immuno-histochemistry.
   Discussion: The clinical study BIO-RAIDs is activated in all planned

Abstract = {{A pyrolysis assisted method was applied for the synthesis of defect
   controlled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by varying different growth
   temperatures. The fabricated resistive devices containing a random
   network of CNTs were tested for oxygen sensing under standard
   room-temperature and pressure conditions. Nanotubes grown at moderate
   growth temperatures (870 degrees C), when exposed to different
   concentrations of oxygen, displayed a higher sensitivity (3.6\%), with
   fast response and recovery times of about 60 and 180 s, respectively,
   compared to nanotubes grown at higher and lower temperatures. A
   room-temperature oxygen detection concentration as low as 0.3\% is
   achieved. The fast response and recovery of CNTs are explained in terms
   of physisorption of oxygen molecules at (i) carboxyl functional sites
   and (ii) graphitic carbon sites (pristine CNT) rather than chemisorption
   at (iii) defected sites. Interestingly, the density functional theory
   simulated interaction energies (E-ads) of oxygen molecules with defected
   CNTs (-3.381 eV) and pristine CNTs (-0.753 eV) are higher than that of
   the carboxyl functional sites (-0.551 eV) and are well correlated with
   the observed sensing response and recovery times of CNT sensors. Our
   results show that the carboxyl sites provide lower activation energy or
   shorter time for desorption of oxygen molecules to yield higher response
   and fast recovery of the CNT sensors.}},

Title = {{An integrative approach to phylogeography: investigating the effects of
   ancient seaways, climate, and historical geology on multi-locus
   phylogeographic boundaries of the Arboreal Salamander (Aneides lugubris)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Phylogeography is an important tool that can be used to
   reveal cryptic biodiversity and to better understand the processes that
   promote lineage diversification. We studied the phylogeographic history
   of the Arboreal Salamander (Aneides lugubris), a wide-ranging species
   endemic to the California floristic province. We used multi-locus data
   to reconstruct the evolutionary history of A. lugubris and to discover
   the geographic location of major genetic breaks within the species. We
   also used species distribution modeling and comparative phylogeography
   to better understand the environmental factors that have shaped the
   genetic history of A. lugubris.
   Results: We found six major mitochondrial clades in A. lugubris. Nuclear
   loci supported the existence of at least three genetically distinct
   groups, corresponding to populations north of the San Francisco Bay and
   in the Sierra Nevada, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and in the central
   coast and southern California. All of the genetic breaks in
   mitochondrial and nuclear loci corresponded to regions where historical
   barriers to dispersal have been observed in other species. Geologic or
   water barriers likely were the most important factors restricting gene
   flow among clades. Climatic unsuitability during glacial maximum may
   have contributed to the isolation of the mitochondrial clades in the
   central coast and southern California. A projection of our species
   distribution model to a future scenario with a moderate amount of
   climate change suggests that most of the range of A. lugubris will
   remain climatically suitable, but climatic conditions in the Sierra
   Nevada and low elevation areas in Southern California are likely to
   deteriorate.
   Conclusions: Aneides lugubris contains substantial cryptic genetic
   diversity as a result of historical isolation of populations. At least
   two (and perhaps three) evolutionarily significant units in A. lugubris
   merit protection; all six mitochondrial clades should be considered as
   management units within the species.}},

Abstract = {{Readers of this Special Issue of Vaccine are likely unified by a desire
   to enhance vaccine efficacy and improve vaccine manufacturing
   efficiency. For influenza vaccines, challenges to achieving those goals
   are many, and range from improved surveillance to less cumbersome
   production platforms and more reliable performance verification.
   Specifically, demand is growing for an alternative vaccine potency
   assay. Assuming that a replacement potency assay is found to be
   promising, one question will be: how will it be judged to be accurate?
   It is generally agreed that any potential replacement for SRID will have
   to exhibit good correlation with SRID and yield a value within +/- 20\%
   of the SRID determined potency. In my opinion, SRID itself has enough
   limitations that judging alternatives relative to that particular
   standard will not ensure that the industry as a whole transitions to an
   improved method. In fact, it could blind us to an assay that may
   ultimately provide a better predictive measure of vaccine efficacy (or
   immunogenicity). There is only one way to verify that measured potency
   is correlated with, and predictive of, measured immunogenicity - test
   the relationship in clinical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the rheological
   properties of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC)/lignosulfonate (LS)
   hydrogels and to use them in the manufacture of carbon objects by 3D
   printing and carbonization. For this purpose, both flow mode and
   thixotropic mode were used to characterize the hydrogel rheological
   behavior, which was subsequently used to search for
   formulation/processability correlations during 3D printing of square
   cuboids. At a concentration of 2\%, MFC displayed excellent
   printability, i.e., shear-thinning behavior with high yield stress and a
   viscoelastic response to a step-down shear rate variation. The addition
   of LS induced a drop in the yield stress, and above an LS mass fraction
   of 30\%, the MFC/LS hydrogels displayed an inelastic thixotropic
   response with a drop in printability (viz., the printed cuboids
   underwent a continuous deformation until spreading of the hydrogel was
   complete). Above 50\% LS, the high viscosity slowed the flow of the
   MFC/LS hydrogels, and the printed cuboids had minor deformation. Freeze
   and air drying of cuboids printed with LS mass fractions lower than 20\%
   and higher than 50\%, respectively, allowed the cuboids to keep their
   original shape, and their carbonization under inert gas led to the
   production of highly conducting objects. In line with the high density
   of the air-dried samples, carbonized samples displayed an irregular
   structure with pores and crackles generated during drying and
   carbonization, whereas the freeze-dried samples had the typical lamellar
   structure of ice-templated materials.}},

Abstract = {{Cholesteric blue phases are liquid crystalline phases in which the
   constituent rod-like molecules spontaneously form three-dimensional,
   helical structures. Despite theoretical predictions that they are
   composed of cylindrical substructures within which the liquid crystal
   molecules are doubly twisted, real space observation of the arrangement
   of such structures had not been performed. Through transmission electron
   microscopy of photopolymerized blue phases with controlled lattice plane
   orientations, we report real space observation and comparison of the
   lattice structures of blue phases I and II. The two systems show
   distinctly different contrasts, reflecting the theoretically predicted,
   body centred and simple cubic arrangement of the double-twist cylinders.
   Transmission electron microscopy also reveals different tendencies of
   the two blue phases to align on unidirectionally rubbed surfaces. We
   thus show that TEM observation of alignment-controlled, photopolymerized
   liquid crystals can be a powerful tool to investigate complex liquid
   crystalline order.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To search for biomarkers to differentiate primary focal segmental

   Methods
   We isolated glomeruli from kidney biopsies of 6 patients with

   the profiles of glomerular transcriptomes between the two groups of
   patients using microarray analysis.
   Results
   Analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that
   up-regulated DEGs in FSGS patients compared with MCD patients were
   primarily involved in spermatogenesis, gamete generation, regulation of
   muscle contraction, response to unfolded protein, cell proliferation and
   skeletal system development. The down-regulated DEGs were primarily
   related to metabolic process, intracellular transport,
   oxidation/reduction and establishment of intracellular localization. We
   validated the expression of the top 6 up-regulated and top 6
   down-regulated DEGs using real-time PCR. Membrane metallo-endopeptidase
   (MME) is a down-regulated gene that was previously identified as a key
   gene for kidney development. Immunostaining confirmed that the protein
   expression of MME decreased significantly in FSGS kidneys compared with
   MCD kidneys.
   Conclusions
   This report was the first study to examine transcriptomes in Chinese
   patients with various glomerular diseases. Expressions of MME both in
   RNA and protein level decreased significantly in glomeruli of FSGS
   kidneys compared with MCD kidneys. Our data suggested that MME might
   play a role in the normal physiological function of podocytes and a
   decrease in MME expression might be related to podocyte injury. We also
   identified genes and pathways specific for FSGS versus MCD, and our data
   could help identify potential new biomarkers for the differential
   diagnosis between these two diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lamivudine associated mutation and
   resistance reduces the effect of anti-hepatitis B virus. Pharmacological
   studies in cell and animal model suggest that Chinese herbal medicines
   (CHMs) have anti-hepatitis B virus effect. Observational studies offer
   mixed results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation
   between the use of CHMs and outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis B
   receiving lamivudine treatment and further estimate the association of
   Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-Sang (JWXYS) use with mortality of those patients.
   Materials and methods: We conducted a cohort study among patients age
   20-90 years within a National Health Insurance Healthcare system.
   Information on the use of CHMs and covariates were obtained from Taiwan
   National Health Insurance Research Database. We used Cox proportional
   hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio and 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI) for all-cause mortality among CHMs users compared to
   nonusers.
   Results: Among 1037 patients studied from 2004 to 2011, median follow-up
   time 5.3 years and 88 deaths were identified. During the study period,
   49\% of patients used CHMs and the median duration of use was 2.4 years.
   We found that significant difference on all-cause mortality among CHMs
   users (aHR= 0.45, 95\% CI: 0.27-0.76) compared to CHMs nonusers.
   All-cause mortality also differed by JWXYS use (aHR= 0.26, 95\% CI:
   0.08-0.83).
   Conclusions: This study reveals that the use of CHMs may lower the risk
   of death in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving lamivudine
   treatment. Further randomized-controlled trials are required to validate
   these findings. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Gap Procedure: for the identification of phylogenetic clusters in
   HIV-1 sequence data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the context of infectious disease, sequence clustering
   can be used to provide important insights into the dynamics of
   transmission. Cluster analysis is usually performed using a phylogenetic
   approach whereby clusters are assigned on the basis of sufficiently
   small genetic distances and high bootstrap support (or posterior
   probabilities). The computational burden involved in this phylogenetic
   threshold approach is a major drawback, especially when a large number
   of sequences are being considered. In addition, this method requires a
   skilled user to specify the appropriate threshold values which may vary
   widely depending on the application.
   Results: This paper presents the Gap Procedure, a distance-based
   clustering algorithm for the classification of DNA sequences sampled
   from individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1). Our heuristic algorithm bypasses the need for phylogenetic
   reconstruction, thereby supporting the quick analysis of large genetic
   data sets. Moreover, this fully automated procedure relies on
   data-driven gaps in sorted pairwise distances to infer clusters, thus no
   user-specified threshold values are required. The clustering results
   obtained by the Gap Procedure on both real and simulated data, closely
   agree with those found using the threshold approach, while only
   requiring a fraction of the time to complete the analysis.
   Conclusions: Apart from the dramatic gains in computational time, the
   Gap Procedure is highly effective in finding distinct groups of
   genetically similar sequences and obviates the need for subjective
   user-specified values. The clusters of genetically similar sequences
   returned by this procedure can be used to detect patterns in HIV-1
   transmission and thereby aid in the prevention, treatment and
   containment of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Through investigating and comparing the fatigue behavior of an as-cast
   Mg-7\%Gd-5\%Y-1\%Nd-0.5\%Zr alloy in both laboratory air and 3.5 wt.\%
   NaCl solution, the effect of corrosion attack on fatigue crack
   initiation has been disclosed. The S-N curves showed that the fatigue
   strength in air was 120 MPa and not sensitive to the loading frequency,
   whereas the fatigue strength in NaCl solution decreased from 80 MPa to
   60 MPa with the loading frequency decreasing from 20 Hz to 5 Hz.
   Observations to fracture surfaces demonstrated that in air, fatigue
   cracks preferentially initiated at the oxide inclusions. However, the
   fatigue crack initiation in NaCl solution was associated with corrosion
   pits. Moreover, multiple fatigue cracks initiated at pits on fracture
   surfaces of corrosion fatigue failed samples when the loading frequency
   decreased to 5 Hz. Based on the measured ``defect area{''} of oxide
   inclusions, the predicted fatigue strength in air could be well fitted
   with the experimental data. However, due to the occurrence of hydrogen
   embrittlement and crack initiation at multiple sites, the fatigue
   strength of samples tested in NaCl solution cannot be predicted.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The human beta-amyloid (A beta) cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) is a target for
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments. This study was conducted to
   determine if acacetin extracted from the whole Agastache rugosa plant
   had anti-BACE-1 and behavioral activities in Drosophila melanogaster AD
   models and to determine acacetin's mechanism of action. Acacetin (100,
   300, and 500 mu M) rescued amyloid precursor protein
   (APP)/BACE1-expressing flies and kept them from developing both eye
   morphology (dark deposits, ommatidial collapse and fusion, and the
   absence of ommatidial bristles) and behavioral (motor abnormalities)
   defects. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis
   revealed that acacetin reduced both the human APP and BACE-1 mRNA levels
   in the transgenic flies, suggesting that it plays an important role in
   the transcriptional regulation of human BACE-1 and APP. Western blot
   analysis revealed that acacetin reduced A beta production by interfering
   with BACE-1 activity and APP synthesis, resulting in a decrease in the
   levels of the APP carboxyterminal fragments and the APP intracellular
   domain. Therefore, the protective effect of acacetin on A beta
   production is mediated by transcriptional regulation of BACE-1 and APP,
   resulting in decreased APP protein expression and BACE-1 activity.
   Acacetin also inhibited APP synthesis, resulting in a decrease in the
   number of amyloid plaques.}},

Abstract = {{A novel kind of spherical g-C3N4/tz-Bi0.92Gd0.08VO4 heterojuctions are
   prepared via a simple microwave hydrothermal method. The sphere
   self-assembled mechanism and the heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism
   are mainly studied in this article. The results show that the added
   g-C3N4 sheets first anchor on ms-BiVO4 surfaces and then polymerize to
   form the coating layers, generating steric effect which is competing
   with Gd3+ induction effect to affect the crystal transformation (from
   ms-BiVO4 to tz-BiVO4) and its growth during those processes. Afterward,
   independent coated structures are further polymerized and assembled into
   g-C3N4/tz-Bi0.92Gd0.08VO4 spheres. Because E-CB (-0.95 V) of g-C3N4 is
   more negative than E-CB (-0.05 V) of tz-BiVO4, the photoelectrons of
   g-C3N4 can be transferred into tz-BiVO4 surfaces through the
   heterojunction structure, so as to promote the separation rate of
   electron hole pairs. In general, the adding of g-C3N4 can introduce
   hydroxyl groups to catch the photoholes and can inject electrons to
   react with dissolved oxygen to boost the production of active groups.
   Depending on such cooperation, g-C3N4/tz-Bi0.92Gd0.08VO4 heterojunction
   catalysts exhibit high and stable mineralization properties.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{With the solar panels quickly spreading across the rooftops worldwide,
   solar power is now very popular. However, the output of the solar cell
   panels is highly dependent on weather conditions, making it rather
   unstable. Here, a hybridized power panel that can simultaneously
   generate power from sunlight, raindrop, and wind is proposed and
   demonstrated, when any or all of them are available in ambient
   environment. Without compromising the output performance and conversion
   efficiency of the solar cell itself, the presented hybrid cell can
   deliver an average output of 86 mW m(-2) from the water drops at a
   dripping rate of 13.6 mL s(-1), and an average output of 8 mW m(-2) from
   wind at a speed of 2.7 m s(-1), which is an innovative energy
   compensation to the common solar cells, especially in rainy seasons or
   at night. Given the compelling features, such as cost-effectiveness and
   a greatly expanded working time, the reported hybrid cell renders an
   innovative way to realize multiple kinds of energy harvesting and as an
   useful compensation to the currently widely used solar cells. The
   demonstrated concept here will possibly be adopted in a variety of
   circumstances and change the traditional way of solar energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{High-grade conventional osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone
   tumor. Prognosis for osteosarcoma patients is poor and resistance to
   chemotherapy is common. We performed an siRNA screen targeting members
   of the Bcl-2 family in human osteosarcoma cell lines to identify
   critical regulators of osteosarcoma cell survival. Silencing the
   anti-apoptotic family member Bcl-xL but also the pro-apoptotic member
   Bak using a SMARTpool of siRNAs as well as 4/4 individual siRNAs caused
   loss of viability. Loss of Bak impaired cell cycle progression and
   triggered autophagy. Instead, silencing Bcl-xL induced apoptotic cell
   death. Bcl-xL was expressed in clinical osteosarcoma samples but mRNA or
   protein levels did not significantly correlate with therapy response or
   survival. Nevertheless, pharmacological inhibition of a range of Bcl-2
   family members showed that inhibitors targeting Bcl-xL synergistically
   enhanced the response to the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin.
   Indeed, in osteosarcoma cells strongly expressing Bcl-xL, the
   Bcl-xL-selective BH3 mimetic, WEHI-539 potently enhanced apoptosis in
   the presence of low doses of doxorubicin. Our results identify Bcl-xL as
   a candidate drug target for sensitization to chemotherapy in patients
   with osteosarcoma.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women and mammography
   screening programs are seen as a key strategy to reduce breast cancer
   mortality. In Germany, women are invited to the population-based
   mammography screening program between ages 50 to 69. It is still
   discussed whether the benefits of mammography screening outweigh its
   harms. Therefore, the concept of informed choice comprising knowledge,
   attitude and intention has gained importance. The objective of this
   observational study was to assess the proportion of informed choices
   among women invited to the German mammography screening program for the
   first time. A representative sample of 17,349 women aged 50 years from a
   subregion of North Rhine Westphalia was invited to participate in a
   postal survey. Turkish immigrant women were oversampled. The effects of
   education level and migration status on informed choice and its
   components were assessed. 5,847 (33.7\%) women responded to the postal
   questionnaire of which 4,113 were used for analyses. 31.5\% of the women
   had sufficient knowledge. The proportion of sufficient knowledge was
   lower among immigrants and among women with low education levels. The
   proportion of women making informed choices was low (27.1\%), with
   similar associations with education level and migration status. Women of
   low (OR 2.75; 95\% CI 2.18-3.46) and medium education level (OR 1.49;
   95\% CI 1.27-1.75) were more likely to make an uninformed choice than
   women of high education level. Turkish immigrant women had the greatest
   odds for making an uninformed choice (OR 5.30, 95\% CI 1.92-14.66)
   compared to non-immigrant women. Other immigrant women only had slightly
   greater odds for making an uninformed choice than non-immigrant women.
   As immigrant populations and women with low education level have been
   shown to have poor knowledge, they need special attention in measures to
   increase knowledge and thus informed choices.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{In severe burn injury the unique setting of a depleted, dysfunctional
   immune system along with a loss of barrier function commonly results in
   opportunistic infections that eventually proof fatal. Unfortunately, the
   dynamic sequence of bacterial contamination, colonization and eventually
   septic invasion with bacteria such as Pseudomonas species is still
   poorly understood although a limiting factor in clinical decision
   making. Increasing evidence supports the notion that inhibition of
   bacterial translocation into the wound site may be an effective
   alternative to prevent infection. In this context we investigated the
   role of the mammalian Chitinase-3-Like-1 (CHI3L1) non-enyzmatic protein
   predominately expressed on epithelial as well as innate immune cells as
   a potential bacterial-translocation-mediating factor. We show a strong
   trend that a modulation of chitinase expression is likely to be
   effective in reducing mortality rates in a mouse model of burn injury
   with superinfection with the opportunistic PA14 Pseudomonas strain, thus
   demonstrating possible clinical leverage.}},

Abstract = {{Insulinoma associated-1 (IA-1/INSM1) gene is exclusively expressed
   during early embryonic development, but has been found to be
   re-expressed at high levels in neuroendocrine tumors including
   neuroblastoma. Using over-expression and knockdown experiments in
   neuroblastoma cells, we showed that INSM1 is critical for cell
   proliferation, BME-coated invasion, and soft agar colony formation.
   Here, we identified INSM1 as a novel target gene activated by N-myc in
   N-myc amplified neuroblastoma cells. The Sonic hedgehog signaling
   pathway induced INSM1 by increasing N-myc expression. INSM1 activated
   PI3K/AKT/GSK3 beta pathways to suppress N-myc phosphorylation (Thr-58)
   and inhibited degradation of N-myc. Inversely, N-myc protein bound to
   the E2-box region of the INSM1 promoter and activated INSM1 expression.
   The invasion assay and the xenograft nude mouse tumor model revealed
   that the INSM1 factor facilitated growth and oncogenesis of
   neuroblastoma. The current data supports our hypothesis that a
   positive-feedback loop of sonic hedgehog signaling induced INSM1 through
   N-myc and INSM1 enhanced N-myc stability contributing to the
   transformation of human neuroblastoma.}},

Title = {{International study of the place of death of people with cancer: a

Abstract = {{Background: Where people die can influence a number of indicators of the
   quality of dying. We aimed to describe the place of death of people with
   cancer and its associations with clinical, socio-demographic and
   healthcare supply characteristics in 14 countries.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study using death certificate data for all
   deaths from cancer (ICD-10 codes C00-C97) in 2008 in Belgium, Canada,
   Czech Republic, England, France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the
   Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain (2010), USA (2007) and
   Wales (N = 1 355 910). Multivariable logistic regression analyses
   evaluated factors associated with home death within countries and
   differences across countries.
   Results: Between 12\% (South Korea) and 57\% (Mexico) of cancer deaths
   occurred at home; between 26\% (Netherlands, New Zealand) and 87\%
   (South Korea) occurred in hospital. The large between-country
   differences in home or hospital deaths were partly explained by
   differences in availability of hospital-and long-term care beds and
   general practitioners. Haematologic rather than solid cancer (odds
   ratios (ORs) 1.29-3.17) and being married rather than divorced (ORs
   1.17-2.54) were most consistently associated with home death across
   countries.
   Conclusions: A large country variation in the place of death can partly
   be explained by countries' healthcare resources. Country-specific
   choices regarding the organisation of end-of-life cancer care likely
   explain an additional part. These findings indicate the further
   challenge to evaluate how different specific policies can influence
   place of death patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of electronic health records (EHR) systems is challenging
   even in traditional healthcare settings, where administrative and
   clinical roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. However, even
   in these traditional settings the conflicting needs of stakeholders can
   trigger hierarchical decision-making processes that reflect the
   traditional power structures in healthcare today. These traditional
   processes are not structured to allow for incorporation of new
   patient-care models such as patient-centered care and interprofessional
   teams. New processes for EHR implementation and evaluation will be
   required as healthcare shifts to a patient-centered model that includes
   patients, families, multiple agencies, and interprofessional teams in
   short- and long-term clinical decision-making. This new model will be
   enabled by healthcare information technology and defined by information
   flow, workflow, and communication needs. We describe a model in
   development for the configuration and implementation of an EHR system in
   an interprofessional, interagency, free-clinic setting. The model uses a
   formative evaluation process that is rooted in usability to configure
   the EHR to fully support the needs of the variety of providers working
   as an interprofessional team. For this model to succeed, it must include
   informaticists as equal and essential members of the healthcare team.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is glucose analog routinely used in
   clinical and animal radiotracer studies to trace glucose uptake but it
   has rarely been used in plants. Previous studies analyzed FDG
   translocation and distribution pattern in plants and proposed that FDG
   could be used as a tracer for photoassimilates in plants. Elucidating
   FDG metabolism in plants is a crucial aspect for establishing its
   application as a radiotracer in plant imaging. Here, we describe the
   metabolic fate of FDG in the model plant species Arabidopsis thallana.
   We fed FDG to leaf tissue and analyzed leaf extracts using MS and NMR.
   On the basis of exact mono isotopic masses, MS/MS fragmentation, and NMR
   data, we identified 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-gluconic acid, FDG-6-phosphate,
   2-deoxy-2-fluoro-maltose, and uridine-diphosphate-FDG as four major end
   products of FDG metabolism. Glycolysis and starch degradation seemed to
   be the important pathways for FDG metabolism. We showed that FDG
   metabolism in plants is considerably different than animal cells and
   goes beyond FDG-phosphate as previously presumed.}},

   antiangiogenic therapy alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy
   before definitive surgery (week 10). Serial DCE-MRI parameters (K-trans,
   v(p), and v(e)) were examined for correlation with FDG-PET (SUVmax) and
   association with drug exposure, and evaluated with clinical outcome.
   Results: Ktrans (P = 0.041) and vp (P = 0.001) significantly dropped
   from baseline at 24 h after the first dose of bevacizumab alone, but
   returned to baseline by 72 h. Greater exposure to bevacizumab was
   correlated with larger decreases in vp at day 5 (P = 0.04) and week 10
   (P = 0.02). A lower Ktrans at week 10 was associated with greater
   percent necrosis (P = 0.024) and longer event-free survival (P = 0.034).
   Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate significant changes
   of the plasma volume fraction and vascular leakage in OS with
   bevacizumab alone. The combination of demonstrated associations between
   drug exposure and imaging metrics, and imaging metrics and patient
   survival during neoadjuvant therapy, provides a compelling rationale for
   larger studies using DCE-MRI to assess vascular effects of therapy in
   OS.}},

Abstract = {{The SMC5/6 complex is the least understood of SMC complexes. In yeast,
   smc5/6 mutants phenocopy mutations in sgs1, the BLM ortholog that is
   deficient in Bloom's syndrome (BS). We here show that NSMCE2 (Mms21, in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an essential SUMO ligase of the SMC5/6
   complex, suppresses cancer and aging in mice. Surprisingly, a mutation
   that compromises NSMCE2-dependent SUMOylation does not have a detectable
   impact on murine lifespan. In contrast, NSMCE2 deletion in adult mice
   leads to pathologies resembling those found in patients of BS. Moreover,
   and whereas NSMCE2 deletion does not have a detectable impact on DNA
   replication, NSMCE2-deficient cells also present the cellular hallmarks
   of BS such as increased recombination rates and an accumulation of
   micronuclei. Despite the similarities, NSMCE2 and BLM foci do not
   colocalize and concomitant deletion of Blm and Nsmce2 in B lymphocytes
   further increases recombination rates and is synthetic lethal due to
   severe chromosome mis-segregation. Our work reveals that SUMO- and
   BLM-independent activities of NSMCE2 limit recombination and facilitate
   segregation; functions of the SMC5/6 complex that are necessary to
   prevent cancer and aging in mice.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript we find another class of real Banach spaces which
   admit vector-valued Banach limits different from the classes found in
   {[}6, 7]. We also characterize the separating subsets of l(infinity)(X).
   For this we first need to study when the space of almost convergent
   sequences is closed in the space of bounded sequences, which turns out
   to happen only when the underlying space is complete. Finally, a study
   on the extremal structure of the set of vector-valued Banach limits is
   conducted when the underlying normed space is a Hilbert space. We also
   reach the conclusion that the set of vector-valued Banach limits is not
   a convex component of B-CL(l infinity(X).X), provided that X is a
   1-injective Banach space satisfying that the underlying compact
   Hausdorff topological space has isolated points.}},

Abstract = {{Position-specific isotope effects (PSIEs) have been measured by isotope
   ratio monitoring C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry during the
   evaporation of 10 liquids of different polarities under 4 evaporation
   modes (passive evaporation, air-vented evaporation, low pressure
   evaporation, distillation). The observed effects are used to assess the
   validity of the Craig-Gordon isotope model for organic liquids. For
   seven liquids the overall isotope effect (IE) includes a vapor-liquid
   contribution that is strongly position specific in polar compounds but
   less so in apolar compounds and a diffusive IE that is not
   position-specific, except in the alcohols, ethanol and propan-1-ol. The
   diffusive IE is diminished under forced evaporation. The
   position-specific isotope pattern created by liquid-vapor IEs is
   manifest in five liquids, which have an air-side limitation for
   volatilization. For the alcohols, undefined processes in the liquid
   phase create additional PSIEs. Three other liquids with limitations on
   the liquid side have a lower, highly position-specific, bulk diffusive
   IE. It is concluded that evaporation of organic pollutants creates
   unique position-specific isotope patterns that may be used to assess the
   progress of remediation or natural attenuation of pollution and that the
   Craig-Gordon isotope model is valid for the volatilization of nonpolar
   organic liquids with air-side limitation of the volatilization rate.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Both bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and
   c-kit(+) cardiac stem cells (CSCs) improve left ventricular remodeling
   in porcine models and clinical trials. Using xenogeneic (human) cells in
   immunosuppressed animals with acute ischemic heart disease, we
   previously showed that these 2 cell types act synergistically.
   OBJECTIVES To more accurately model clinical applications for heart
   failure, this study tested whether the combination of autologous MSCs
   and CSCs produce greater improvement in cardiac performance than MSCs
   alone in a non-immunosuppressed porcine model of chronic ischemic
   cardiomyopathy.
   METHODS Three months after ischemia/reperfusion injury, Gottingen swine
   received transendocardial injections with MSCs alone (n = 6) or in
   combination with cardiac-derived CSCs (n = 8), or placebo (vehicle; n =
   6). Cardiac functional and anatomic parameters were assessed using
   cardiac magnetic resonance at baseline and before and after therapy.
   RESULTS Both groups of cell-treated animals exhibited significantly
   reduced scar size (MSCs -44.1 +/- 6.8\%; CSC/MSC -37.2 +/- 5.4\%;
   placebo -12.9 +/- 4.2\%; p < 0.0001), increased viable tissue, and
   improved wall motion relative to placebo 3 months post-injection.
   Ejection fraction (EF) improved (MSCs 2.9 +/- 1.6 EF units; CSC/MSC 6.9
   +/- 2.8 EF units; placebo 2.5 +/- 1.6 EF units; p = 0.0009), as did
   stroke volume, cardiac output, and diastolic strain only in the
   combination-treated animals, which also exhibited increased
   cardiomyocyte mitotic activity.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings illustrate that interactions between MSCs and
   CSCs enhance cardiac performance more than MSCs alone, establish the
   safety of autologous cell combination strategies, and support the
   development of second-generation cell therapeutic products. (C) 2015 by

Abstract = {{To investigate the molecular changes that allow influenza B viruses to
   adapt to new mammalian hosts, influenza B/Florida/04/2006 was serially
   passaged in BALB/c mice until highly virulent. The viral factors
   underlying this transition were then investigated in mice and ferrets.
   Five viruses, including the wild-type virus (P0), three intermediate
   viruses (P5, P9, and P12), and a lethal mouse-adapted virus (P17 (MA)),
   harbored one to five amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin, M,
   NP, and PA segments suggesting that these mutations enhance virulence.
   The P17 (MA) virus replicated significantly more efficiently than the P0
   virus both in vitro and in vivo (P < 0.0001), and was highly virulent
   (MLD50: 10(5.25)TCID(50)) while the P0, P5, and P9 viruses did not kill
   any infected mice (MLD50 > 10(6.0)TCID(50)). Furthermore, the P17 (MA)
   virus grew to greater titers in the ferret upper respiratory tract
   compared with the P0 and intermediate viruses, and only the P17 (MA)
   virus was transmissible between ferrets via both direct and aerosol
   contact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
   ferret-to-ferret transmission of influenza B virus and to delineate
   factors that may affect its transmission.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Differences between sexes in cardiac risk factors,
   perceptions of cardiac risk, and health care provider discussions about
   risk among young patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are not
   well studied.
   OBJECTIVES This study compared cardiac risk factor prevalence, risk
   perceptions, and health care provider feedback on heart disease and risk
   modification between young women and men hospitalized with AMI.
   METHODS We studied 3,501 AMI patients age 18 to 55 years enrolled in the
   VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI
   Patients) study in U.S. and Spanish hospitals between August 2008 and
   January 2012, comparing the prevalence of 5 cardiac risk factors by sex.
   Modified Poisson regression was used to assess sex differences in
   self-perceived heart disease risk and self-reported provider discussions
   of risk and modification.
   RESULTS Nearly all patients (98\%) had >= 1 risk factor, and 64\% had >=
   3. Only 53\% of patients considered themselves at risk for heart
   disease, and even fewer reported being told they were at risk (46\%) or
   that their health care provider had discussed heart disease and risk
   modification (49\%). Women were less likely than men to be told they
   were at risk (relative risk: 0.89; 95\% confidence interval: 0.84 to
   0.96) or to have a provider discuss risk modification (relative risk:
   0.84; 95\% confidence interval: 0.79 to 0.89). There was no difference
   between women and men for self-perceived risk.
   CONCLUSIONS Despite having significant cardiac risk factors, only
   one-half of young AMI patients believed they were at risk for heart
   disease before their event. Even fewer discussed their risks or risk
   modification with their health care providers; this issue was more
   pronounced among women. (C) 2015 by the American College of Cardiology

   through inhibition of histone deacetylases}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are products of microbial fermentation
   that are important for intestinal epithelial health. Here, we describe
   that SCFAs have rapid and reversible effects on toll-like receptor (TLR)
   responses in epithelial cells. Incubation of HEK293 or HeLa epithelial
   cells with the SCFAs butyrate or propionate at physiological
   concentrations enhanced NF-kappa B activation induced by TLR5, TLR2/1,
   TLR4, and TLR9 agonists. NF-kappa B activation in response to tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was also increased by SCFAs.
   Comparative transcript analysis of HT-29 colon epithelial cells revealed
   that SCFAs enhanced TLR5-induced transcription of TNFa but dampened or
   even abolished the TLR5-mediated induction of IL-8 and monocyte
   chemotactic protein 1. SCFAs are known inhibitors of histone
   deacetylases (HDACs). Butyrate or propionate caused a rapid increase in
   histone acetylation in epithelial cells, similar to the small molecule
   HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). TSA also mimicked the effects of
   SCFAs on TLR-NF-kappa B responses. This study shows that bacterial SCFAs
   rapidly alter the epigenetic state of host cells resulting in
   redirection of the innate immune response and selective reprograming of
   cytokine/chemokine expression.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic molecularly imprinted resorcinol-formaldehyde-melamine resin
   (MIRFM) is synthesized in water and shows excellent molecular
   recognition in aqueous matrices. The double functional monomers
   resorcinol and melamine, and the cross-linker formaldehyde, are all
   hydrophilic, and then the hydrophilic groups (such as hydroxyls, imino
   groups, and ether linkages) can be introduced into MIRFM, which make the
   material compatible with aqueous samples. The general principle is
   demonstrated by the synthesis of MIRFM using sulfanilamide as a dummy
   template for the selective recognition to sulfonamides (SAs) in milk
   samples. Resorcinol and melamine can interact with the template mainly
   by hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interaction, which makes MIRFM and the
   analytes have strong affinity. Besides, melamine can improve the
   rigidity of MIRFM and accelerate the polymerization process, so there is
   no need to add base or acid as a catalyst, which guarantees the success
   of molecular imprinting. MIRFM shows higher recovery and improved
   purification effect for SAs, in comparison to silica, HLB, C-18, and
   SCX. Because of its excellent hydrophilicity and specificity, MIRFM is
   promising to be applied in biological, environmental, and clinical
   fields.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Some studies find that eating with TV increases food intake while others
   do not. Some of this variability may reflect the engagingness of what is
   being watched (i.e., content). To test this we varied engagingness by
   manipulating content familiarity. Female participants undertook two
   sessions. In the ``Different{''} session they watched two different
   episodes of the comedy Friends, with snack food presented during the
   second episode. In the ``Same{''} session they viewed another episode of
   Friends twice in succession, with snack food presented during the second
   repeat showing. The three episodes of Friends used here were fully
   counterbalanced, so overall the only difference between the ``Same{''}
   and ``Different{''} sessions was whether the content of the second show
   was familiar or novel. As expected, 14\% less was eaten in the
   ``Different{''} session, suggesting that novel and presumably more
   engaging content can reduce intake relative to watching familiar and
   presumably less engaging content. These findings are consistent with the
   idea that the engagingness of TV can differentially affect food intake,
   although boredom or irritability resulting from repeat viewing might
   also explain this effect.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Synchrotron reflection x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS)
   measurements, rather than previously reported transmission TDS, are
   carried out at room temperature and analyzed using a formalism based
   upon second-order interatomic force constants and long-range Coulomb
   interactions to obtain quantitative determinations of MgO phonon
   dispersion relations (h) over bar omega(j) (q), phonon densities of
   states g((h) over bar omega), and isochoric temperature-dependent
   vibrational heat capacities c(v) (T). We use MgO as a model system for
   investigating reflection TDS due to its harmonic behavior as well as its
   mechanical and dynamic stability. Resulting phonon dispersion relations
   and densities of states are found to be in good agreement with
   independent reports from inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering
   experiments. Temperature-dependent isochoric heat capacities cv (T),
   computed within the harmonic approximation from (h) over bar omega(j)
   (q) values, increase with temperature from 0.4 x 10(-4) eV/atom K at 100
   K to 1.4 x 10(-4) eV/atom K at 200 K and 1.9 x 10(-4) eV/atom K at 300
   K, in excellent agreement with isobaric heat capacity values c(p) (T)
   between 4 and 300 K. We anticipate that the experimental approach
   developed here will be valuable for determining vibrational properties
   of heteroepitaxial thin films since the use of grazing-incidence (theta
   less than or similar to theta(c), where theta(c) is the
   density-dependent critical angle) allows selective tuning of x-ray
   penetration depths to less than or similar to 10 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The beta-defensins are a class of small cationic proteins that serve as
   components of numerous systems in vertebrate biology, including the
   immune and melanocortin systems. Human, beta-defensin 3 (HBD3), which is
   produced in the skin, has been found to bind to melanocortin receptors 1
   and 4 through complementary electrostatics, a unique mechanism of
   ligand-receptor interaction. This finding indicates that electrostatics
   alone, and not specific amino acid contact points, could be sufficient
   for function in this ligand-receptor system, and further suggests that
   other small peptide ligands could interact with these receptors in a
   similar fashion. Here, we conducted molecular-similarity analyses and
   functional studies of additional members of the human, beta-defensin
   family, examining their potential as ligands of melanocortin-1 receptor,
   through selection based on their electrostatic similarity to HBD3. Using
   Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic calculations and molecular-similarity
   analysis, we identified members of the human, beta-defensin family that
   are both similar and dissimilar to HBD3 in terms of electrostatic
   potential. Synthesis and functional testing of a subset of these,
   beta-defensins showed that peptides with an HBD3-like electrostatic
   character bound to melanocortin receptors with high affinity, whereas
   those that were anticorrelated to HBD3 showed no binding affinity. These
   findings expand on the central role of electrostatics in the control of
   this ligand-receptor system and further demonstrate the utility of
   employing molecular-similarity analysis. Additionally, we identified
   several new potential ligands of melanocortin-1 receptor, which may have
   implications for our understanding of the role defensins play in
   melanocortin physiology.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Anemia results in increased morbidity and mortality, underscoring the
   need to better understand its pathophysiology amongst HIV-exposed and
   infected children in sub-Saharan Africa, the region where most infant
   HIV exposure and infections occur.
   Methods
   This analysis used samples obtained from children in the Kisumu
   Breastfeeding Study (KiBS). KiBS was a longitudinal phase IIB,
   open-label, one-arm clinical trial, designed to investigate the safety,
   tolerability and effectiveness of a maternal triple-antiretroviral (ARV)
   regimen for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV,
   during late pregnancy and early infancy while breastfeeding. Blood
   samples from 482 children were obtained at birth, 2, 6, 10 and 14 weeks
   and 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Severity of anemia was graded using the
   NIH Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity tables. We describe the proportion
   of children with anemia and anomalies in red blood cell parameters at
   various time points over 24 months and compare rates of anemia between
   HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children and by mothers' ARV regimen and
   infant malaria infection.
   Results
   The proportion of children with anemia significantly increased after the
   breastfeeding period in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children
   with higher proportion among HIV-infected children compared to
   HIV-uninfected children (RR: 1.72; CI: 1.22-2.44, p = 0.002). Maternal
   triple-antiretroviral regimen was not associated with infant anemia ( p
   = 0.11). There was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin between
   HIV-uninfected children with and without malaria at each time point
   except at 24 months.
   Conclusion
   A relatively lower proportion of children with severe anemia during the
   breastfeeding period suggest that exposure to mother's triple
   antiretroviral combinations through breast milk, posed minimal risk of
   hematologic toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is
   associated with significant morbidity and mortality but is currently
   refractory to therapy. Despite limited evidence, heart rate reduction
   has been advocated, on the basis of physiological considerations, as a
   therapeutic strategy in HFpEF. We tested the hypothesis that heart rate
   reduction improves exercise capacity in HFpEF.
   Methods and Results-We conducted a randomized, crossover study comparing
   selective heart rate reduction with the I-f blocker ivabradine at 7.5 mg
   twice daily versus placebo for 2 weeks each in 22 symptomatic patients
   with HFpEF who had objective evidence of exercise limitation (peak
   oxygen consumption at maximal exercise {[}(V)over doto(2) peak] <80\%
   predicted for age and sex). The result was compared with 22 similarly
   treated matched asymptomatic hypertensive volunteers. The primary end
   point was the change in (V) over doto(2) peak. Secondary outcomes
   included tissue Doppler-derived E/e' at echocardiography, plasma brain
   natriuretic peptide, and quality-of-life scores. Ivabradine
   significantly reduced peak heart rate compared with placebo in the HFpEF
   (107 versus 129 bpm; P<0.0001) and hypertensive (127 versus 145 bpm;
   P=0.003) cohorts. Ivabradine compared with placebo significantly
   worsened the change in (V) over doto(2) peak in the HFpEF cohort (-2.1
   versus 0.9 mL.kg(-1).min(-1); P=0.003) and significantly reduced
   submaximal exercise capacity, as determined by the oxygen uptake
   efficiency slope. No significant effects on the secondary end points
   were discernable.
   Conclusion-Our observations bring into question the value of heart rate
   reduction with ivabradine for improving symptoms in a HFpEF population
   characterized by exercise limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Leiomodin 2 (Lmod2) is an actin-binding protein that has been implicated
   in the regulation of striated muscle thin filament assembly; its
   physiological function has yet to be studied. We found that knockout of
   Lmod2 in mice results in abnormally short thin filaments in the heart.
   We also discovered that Lmod2 functions to elongate thin filaments by
   promoting actin assembly and dynamics at thin filament pointed ends.
   Lmod2-KO mice die as juveniles with hearts displaying contractile
   dysfunction and ventricular chamber enlargement consistent with dilated
   cardiomyopathy. Lmod2-null cardiomyocytes produce less contractile force
   than wild type when plated on micropillar arrays. Introduction of
   GFP-Lmod2 via adeno-associated viral transduction elongates thin
   filaments and rescues structural and functional defects observed in
   Lmod2-KO mice, extending their lifespan to adulthood. Thus, to our
   knowledge, Lmod2 is the first identified mammalian protein that
   functions to elongate actin filaments in the heart; it is essential for
   cardiac thin filaments to reach a mature length and is required for
   efficient contractile force and proper heart function during
   development.}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We study the fate of superconductivity in the vicinity of a class of
   metallic quantum critical points obtained by coupling a Fermi surface to
   a critical boson. In such systems there is a competition between the
   enhanced pairing tendency due to the presence of long-range attractive
   interactions near criticality, and the suppression of superconductivity
   due to the destruction of the Landau quasiparticles. We show that there
   are regimes in which these two effects offset one another, resulting in
   a non-Fermi liquid fixed point with finite, scale invariant, BCS
   coupling. While these interactions lead to substantial superconducting
   fluctuations, they do not drive the system into a superconducting ground
   state. The metallic quantum critical fixed points are connected to the
   superconducting regime by a continuous phase transition. These results
   are established using a controlled expansion in the deviation from d = 3
   spatial dimensions, as well as in a large number N of internal flavors.
   We discuss the possible relevance of our findings to the phenomenon of
   superconducting domes condensing out of a non-Fermi liquid normal state
   near quantum critical points.}},

Title = {{Relative Prevalence of Grapevine Leafroll-Associated Virus Species in

Abstract = {{Some diseases manifest as one characteristic set of symptoms to the
   host, but can be caused by multiple pathogens. Control treatments based
   on plant symptoms can make it difficult to effectively manage such
   diseases, as the biology of the underlying pathogens can vary. Grapevine
   leafroll disease affects grapes worldwide, and is associated with
   several viral species in the family Closteroviridae. Whereas some of the
   viruses associated with this disease are transmitted by insect vectors,
   others are only graft-transmissible. In three regions of California, we
   surveyed vineyards containing diseased vines and screened symptomatic
   plants for all known viral species associated with grapevine leafroll
   disease. Relative incidence of each virus species differed among the
   three regions regions, particularly in relation to species with known
   vectors compared with those only known to be graft-transmitted. In one
   region, the pathogen population was dominated by species not known to
   have an insect vector. In contrast, populations in the other surveyed
   regions were dominated by virus species that are vector-transmissible.
   Our survey did not detect viruses associated with grapevine leafroll
   disease at some sites with characteristic disease symptoms. This could
   be explained either by undescribed genetic diversity among these viruses
   that prevented detection with available molecular tools at the time the
   survey was performed, or a misidentification of visual symptoms that may
   have had other underlying causes. Based on the differences in relative
   prevalence of each virus species among regions and among vineyards
   within regions, we expect that region and site-specific management
   strategies are needed for effective disease control.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) tumors all carry a
   deletion of similar to 400 kb in chromosome 19, resulting in a fusion of
   the genes for the heat shock protein, DNAJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B,
   member 1, DNAJB1, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA.
   The resulting chimeric transcript produces a fusion protein that retains
   kinase activity. No other recurrent genomic alterations have been
   identified. Here we characterize the molecular pathogenesis of FLHCC
   with transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing). Differential expression
   (tumor vs. adjacent normal tissue) was detected for more than 3,500
   genes (log(2) fold change >= 1, false discovery rate <= 0.01), many of
   which were distinct from those found in hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Expression of several known oncogenes, such as ErbB2 and Aurora Kinase
   A, was increased in tumor samples. These and other dysregulated genes
   may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{This study provides the first physiological evidence of humans' ability
   to empathize with robot pain and highlights the difference in empathy
   for humans and robots. We performed electroencephalography in 15 healthy
   adults who observed either human- or robot-hand pictures in painful or
   non-painful situations such as a finger cut by a knife. We found that
   the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful
   stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand
   belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3
   component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful
   human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of
   ANOVA was not significant, but marginal. These results suggest that we
   empathize with humanoid robots in late top-down processing similarly to
   human others. However, the beginning of the top-down process of empathy
   is weaker for robots than for humans.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Personality and anxiety disorders across species are affected by genetic
   and environmental factors. Shyness-boldness personality continuum exists
   across species, including the domestic dog, with a large within-and
   across-breed variation. Domestic dogs are also diagnosed for several
   anxiety-related behavioral conditions, such as generalized anxiety
   disorders, phobias, and separation anxiety. Genetic and environmental
   factors contributing to personality and anxiety are largely unknown. We
   collected questionnaire data from a Finnish family dog population (N =
   3264) in order to study the associating environmental factors for canine
   fearfulness, noise sensitivity, and separation anxiety. Early life
   experiences and exercise were found to associate with anxiety
   prevalence. We found that fearful dogs had less socialization
   experiences (p = 0.002) and lower quality of maternal care (p < 0.0001)
   during puppyhood. Surprisingly, the largest environmental factor
   associating with noise sensitivity (p < 0.0001) and separation anxiety
   (p = 0.007) was the amount of daily exercise; dogs with noise
   sensitivity and separation anxiety had less daily exercise. Our findings
   suggest that dogs share many of the same environmental factors that
   contribute to anxiety in other species as well, such as humans and
   rodents. Our study highlights the importance of early life experiences,
   especially the quality of maternal care and daily exercise for the
   welfare and management of the dogs, and reveals important confounding
   factors to be considered in the genetic characterization of canine
   anxiety.}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an adhesion
   molecule, which upon inflammation is rapidly translocated from
   intracellular sources to the endothelial cell surface. We have recently
   discovered that sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9
   (Siglec-9) is a leukocyte ligand of VAP-1 and that Ga-68-labeled
   Siglec-9 motif peptide facilitates in vivo imaging of inflammation. This
   study evaluated the feasibility of Ga-68-DOTA-Siglec-9 positron emission
   tomography (PET) for the assessment of synovitis.
   Methods: Rabbits with synovial inflammation were injected with F-18-FDG
   or Ga-68-DOTA-Siglec-9 and studied by gamma counting and
   autoradiography. Certain rabbits were also examined with magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). After PET imaging, rabbits were intravenously
   administered with anti-VAP-1 antibody to evaluate luminal expression of
   VAP-1 by immunohistochemistry. Finally, binding of Siglec-9 peptide and
   VAP-1 positive vessels were evaluated by double staining of rheumatoid
   arthritis synovium.
   Results: Intra-articular injection of hemagglutinin induced mild
   synovial inflammation in rabbit knee with luminal expression of VAP-1.
   Synovitis was clearly visualized by Ga-68-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET in addition
   to F-18-FDG-PET and MRI. Compared with the F-18-FDG, the ex vivo
   inflamed-to-control synovium ratio of Ga-68-DOTA-Siglec-9 was similar
   (1.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2, P = 0.32). Double staining revealed that
   Siglec-9 peptide binds to VAP-1 positive vessels in human rheumatoid
   synovium.
   Conclusion: Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET tracer detected VAP-1 positive
   vasculature in the mild synovitis of rabbits comparable with F-18-FDG,
   suggesting its potential for in vivo imaging of synovial inflammation in
   patients with rheumatic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Protein-rich clusters of steady submicron size and narrow size
   distribution exist in protein solutions in apparent violation of the
   classical laws of phase equilibrium. Even though they contain a minor
   fraction of the total protein, evidence suggests that they may serve as
   essential precursors for the nucleation of ordered solids such as
   crystals, sickle-cell hemoglobin polymers, and amyloid fibrils. The
   cluster formation mechanism remains elusive. We use the highly basic
   protein lysozyme at nearly neutral and lower pH as a model and explore
   the response of the cluster population to the electrostatic forces,
   which govern numerous biophysical phenomena, including crystallization
   and fibrillization. We tune the strength of intermolecular electrostatic
   forces by varying the solution ionic strength I and pH and find that
   despite the weaker repulsion at higher I and pH, the cluster size
   remains constant. Cluster responses to the presence of urea and ethanol
   demonstrate that cluster formation is controlled by hydrophobic
   interactions between the peptide backbones, exposed to the solvent after
   partial protein unfolding that may lead to transient protein oligomers.
   These findings reveal that the mechanism of the mesoscopic clusters is
   fundamentally different from those underlying the two main classes of
   ordered protein solid phases, crystals and amyloid fibrils, and partial
   unfolding of the protein chain may play a significant role.}},

Abstract = {{Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with poor prognosis that
   is endemic to Southeast Asia. We profiled microRNAs (miRNAs) of NPCs
   using microarrays and confirmed the results by quantitative RT-PCR. The
   results revealed that seven miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and
   six miRNAs were down-regulated, in NPC tissues relative to noncancerous
   nasopharyngeal epithelia (NNE). Expression of miR-497 was also
   significantly reduced in the plasma of NPC patients relative to the
   plasma of noncancerous control patients. The concordant down-regulation
   of miR-497 in tissues and plasma suggested that miR-497 could be used as
   a diagnostic biomarker for NPC. Functional analyses of the effect of
   miR-497 on cancer phenotypes revealed that transfection of miR-497 mimic
   into NPC cells suppressed cell growth and migration and induced
   apoptosis. Subcutaneous xenografts of transfected cells in nude mice
   demonstrated that miR-497 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Two
   potential targets of miR-497, ANLN (anillin, actin-binding protein) and
   HSPA4L (heat shock 70 kDa protein 4-like), both of which were
   overexpressed in NPC tissues, were negatively regulated by miR-497 mimic
   in NPC cell lines. Silencing of ANLN and HSPA4L suppressed cell
   proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in NPC cells. Our
   findings indicate that miR-497 is a potent tumor suppressor that
   inhibits cancer phenotypes by targeting ANLN and HSPA4L in NPC.}},

   temperature of 18 +/- 0.5 degrees C under constant darkness. According
   to double-plotted actograms and waveform curves, results showed the
   presence of two different locomotor patterns; in fact, individuals of O.
   gammarellus concentrated their activity during the hours of subjective
   night, whereas O. montagui were active during the subjective night and
   beyond the subjective dawn. Furthermore, whatever the species studied,
   periodogram analysis indicated a distinct circadian pattern of activity.
   Moreover, whatever the experiment condition is, the most clearly defined
   rhythms were found in O. gammarellus. In contrary to O. gammarellus, the
   group effect on the locomotor rhythm parameters seems to be less marked
   in O. montagui. On the other hand, a highly inter-individual variability
   was observed in the activity time for these two species and especially

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{3356-3361}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Equal distribution of the genetic material during cell division relies
   on efficient congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Prior to
   their alignment, the Dynein motor recruited to kinetochores transports a
   fraction of laterally-attached chromosomes along microtubules toward the
   spindle poles. By doing that, Dynein not only contributes to chromosome
   movements, but also prevents premature stabilization of end-on
   kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This is achieved by 2 parallel
   mechanisms: 1) Dynein-mediated poleward movement of chromosomes
   counteracts opposite polar-ejection forces (PEFs) on chromosome arms by
   the microtubule plus-end-directed motors chromokinesins. Otherwise, they
   could stabilize erroneous syntelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments
   and lead to the random ejection of chromosomes away from the spindle
   poles; and 2) By transporting chromosomes to the spindle poles, Dynein
   brings the former to the zone of highest Aurora A kinase activity,
   further destabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Thus, Dynein
   plays an important role in keeping chromosome segregation error-free by
   preventing premature stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule
   attachments near the spindle poles.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum/pressure swing adsorption is an attractive and often energy
   efficient separation process for some applications. However, there is
   often a trade-off between the different objectives: purity, recovery and
   power consumption. Identifying those trade-offs is possible through use
   of multi-objective optimisation methods but this is computationally
   challenging due to the size of the search space and the need for high
   fidelity simulations due to the inherently dynamic nature of the
   process. This paper presents the use of surrogate modelling to address
   the computational requirements of high fidelity simulations needed to
   evaluate alternative designs. We present SbNSGA-II ALM, surrogate based
   NSGA-II, a robust and fast multi-objective optimisation method based on
   kriging surrogate models and NSGA-II with the Active Learning MacKay
   (ALM) design criterion. The method is evaluated by application to an
   industrially relevant case study: a two column six step system for
   CO2/N-2 separation. A 5 times reduction in computational effort is
   observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined anxiety and depressive symptoms in relation
   to the social functioning of young adolescents with
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and builds upon prior
   work by incorporating youths' self-reports of internalizing symptoms and
   examining distinct anxiety and depression dimensions to increase
   specificity. Participants were 310 young adolescents (ages 10-14; 71\%
   male, 78\% Caucasian) diagnosed with ADHD. Youth provided ratings of
   anxiety/depression, and parents provided ratings of their own
   depression. Parents and youth both reported on youths' social skills and
   perceived social acceptance. Path analyses indicated that above and
   beyond child demographics, ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder
   symptom severity, and parents' own depression, self-reported social
   anxiety and anhedonia were both associated with lower youth-reported
   social skills and both parent- and youth-reported social acceptance.
   Negative self-evaluation was associated with poorer parent-reported
   social skills. Finally, harm avoidance was positively associated with
   both youth- and parent-reported social skills. A path analysis using
   comorbid diagnoses (rather than symptom dimensions) indicated that that
   having a comorbid disruptive behavior disorder or depression diagnosis
   (but not a comorbid anxiety diagnosis) was associated with poorer
   parent-reported social functioning. Results demonstrate that the
   relation between internalizing symptoms and social functioning among
   young adolescents with ADHD is nuanced, with social anxiety and
   anhedonia symptoms associated with lower social skills and social
   acceptance in contrast to harm avoidance being associated with higher
   ratings of social skills (and unrelated to social acceptance). In terms
   of comorbid diagnoses, depression is more clearly related than anxiety
   to poorer social functioning among young adolescents with ADHD. These
   results point to the importance of attending to specific facets of
   anxiety and depression in clinical care and future research.}},

Abstract = {{Background:Health and life expectancy for people with hemophilia have
   improved significantly in recent years, but we face new challenges,
   especially in the context of resource-constrained health
   services.Aim:This paper aims to highlight such challenges and propose
   practical solutions.Methods:Nine hemophilia specialists from Australia
   and New Zealand reached consensus on areas of greatest need for
   improvement in hemophilia care in these countries, based on clinical
   experience and published data, and agreed on how to address
   these.Results:Demography, optimizing treatment and assessing treatment
   success were identified as broad areas of challenge which included:
   comorbidities in ageing patients; transitioning from pediatric to adult
   care; equity of care for remote populations; weight-based dosing in
   obese patients; tailoring prophylaxis; accurate diagnosis of acute joint
   pain; managing chronic arthropathy; providing psychosocial support;
   consistency in definitions and assessment; and quantifiable outcome
   measures. Practice points included increased cross-specialty
   coordination and including psychologists and rheumatologists as part of
   comprehensive care teams; close collaboration between pediatric and
   adult centers to facilitate transition of care; systems such as
   telehealth that ensure continuity of care for remote populations; using
   pharmacokinetic data to tailor therapy; rapid and accurate diagnosis of
   acute joint pain; using data from bleeding registries to assess
   treatment effects and help with service planning; and ensuring
   consistency through benchmarking and standardization of
   HTCs.Summary:Achieving treatment equity, optimal outcomes and cost
   savings may be possible through investing in national governance
   structures, expanding the comprehensive model of care and implementing
   innovative solutions tailored to local needs.}},

Abstract = {{The chronicity of osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by pain and
   inflammation in the joints, is linked to a glutamate receptor,
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The use of plant species such as
   Chenopodium ambrosioides L. (Amaranthaceae) as NMDA antagonists offers a
   promising perspective. This work aims to analyze the antinociceptive and
   anti-inflammatory responses of the crude hydroalcoholic extract (HCE) of
   C. ambrosioides leaves in an experimental OA model. Wistar rats were
   separated into six groups (n = 24): clean (C), negative control (CTL-),
   positive control (CTL+), HCE0.5, HCE5 and HCE50. The first group
   received no intervention. The other groups received an intra-articular
   injection of sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) (8 mg/kg) on day 0. After six
   hours, they were orally treated with saline, Maxicam plus (meloxicam +
   chondroitin sulfate) and HCE at doses of 0.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 50
   mg/kg, respectively. After three, seven and ten days, clinical
   evaluations were performed (knee diameter, mechanical allodynia,
   mechanical hyperalgesia and motor activity). On the tenth day, after
   euthanasia, synovial fluid and draining lymph node were collected for
   cellular quantification, and cartilage was collected for
   histopathological analysis. Finally, molecular docking was performed to
   evaluate the compatibility of ascaridole, a monoterpene found in HCE,
   with the NMDA receptor. After the third day, HCE reduced knee edema.
   HCE5 showed less cellular infiltrate in the cartilage and synovium and
   lower intensities of allodynia from the third day and of hyperalgesia
   from the seventh day up to the last treatment day. The HCE5 and HCE50
   groups improved in forced walking. In relation to molecular docking,
   ascaridole showed NMDA receptor binding affinity. C. ambrosioides HCE
   was effective in the treatment of OA because it reduced synovial
   inflammation and behavioral changes due to pain. This effect may be
   related to the antagonistic effect of ascaridole on the NMDA receptor.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the pancreatic lesions caused by the infection
   with either H7N1 or H7N3 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses, 28
   experimentally infected turkeys were submitted for histopathology,
   immunohistochemistry, haematobiochemistry and real-time reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction after different days
   post-infection (DPI). The localization of viral antigen and the
   measurement of insulin and glucagon expression in the pancreas were
   assessed to verify the progression from pancreatitis to metabolic
   disorders, such as diabetes. At the early infection phase (4-7 DPI), a
   severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis was recognized. During the
   intermediate phase (8-17 DPI), a mixed acute/chronic change associated
   with regenerative ductular proliferation was observed. A loss of
   pancreatic islets was detected in most severe cases and viral antigen
   was found in the pancreas of 11/28 turkeys (4-10 DPI) with the most
   severe histological damage. In turkeys euthanized at 39 DPI (late
   phase), a chronic fibrosing pancreatitis was observed with the
   reestablishment of both the exocrine and the endocrine pancreas. Insulin
   and glucagon expression manifested a progressive decrease with
   subsequent ductular positivity. Haematobiochemistry revealed increased
   lipasemia in the first week post-infection and hyperglycaemia in the
   second, with a progressive normalization within 21 DPI. This study
   allowed the identification of progressive virus-associated exocrine and
   endocrine pancreatic damage, suggesting that influenza virus might be
   responsible for metabolic derangements. Moreover, it highlighted a
   remarkable post-damage hyperplastic and reparative process from a
   presumptive common exocrine/endocrine precursor. This potential
   regeneration deserves further investigation for its relevance in a
   therapeutic perspective to replace lost and non-functional cells in
   diabetes mellitus.}},

Abstract = {{This foreword begins with a survey of the field of postcolonial studies,
   from its points of departure to its current situation and future
   directions. We suggest that the field has long sought to problematize
   borders, particularly those that separate academic disciplines. The
   foreword also highlights the material consequences of border crossing
   for people of colour and other Others', examining Caryl Phillips' case
   study of the migrant David Oluwale. Oluwale's abhorrent treatment in
   Leeds necessitates discussion of the burgeoning new current of
   postcolonial cities research, to which this special issue adds
   interdisciplinary perspectives. To explore whether or not global and
   postcolonial cities are actually synonymous, we return to the origins of
   postcolonial studies to suggest that the postcolonial city has a longer
   provenance than the global, and retains the double meaning of post' as
   signalling both a coming after and a continuation. We go on to argue
   that the special issue demonstrates that postcolonial cities exclude
   even as they embrace, and produce both internal and external
   marginality. The foreword concludes by adumbrating potential problems
   with the special issue's topic: its neglect of economics in favour of
   culture, its overlooking of the postcolonial rural, and as terminology
   not coming from within but without.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the news work of Taiwan correspondents in mainland
   China, focusing particularly on the issue of journalist-source
   relations. Drawing upon the concepts of tie strength and homophily from
   social network analysis, this article argues that strong and
   heterophilous ties play a crucial role for foreign correspondents
   working within a context where news information does not always flow
   freely. Data from in-depth interviews and a supplementary survey show
   that different types of source ties offer different types of information
   to the Taiwan correspondents. The analysis illustrates how strong ties
   with Chinese officials and correspondents from other countries allow
   Taiwan journalists to obtain the news information and clues that are of
   the highest value, i.e., information and clues about exclusive and/or
   sensitive stories. The Taiwan correspondents established such strong
   ties through long-term interactions and instrumental exchange.
   Implications of the findings for understanding the work of foreign
   correspondents are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of acute mental stress on atherosclerosis can be estimated
   using arterial elasticity measured by carotid artery distensibility
   (Cdist). We examined the interactive effect of acute stress-induced
   cardiac reactivity and Cdist to preclinical atherosclerosis assessed by
   carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 58 healthy adults aged 24-39
   years participated in the epidemiological Young Finns Study. Cdist and
   IMT were measured ultrasonographically. Impedance electrocardiography
   was used to measure acute mental stress-induced cardiac autonomic
   responses: heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia and
   pre-ejection period after the mental arithmetic and the public speaking
   tasks. Interactions between HR reactivity and Cdist in relation to
   preclinical atherosclerosis were found. The results imply that elevated
   HR reactivity to acute mental stress is related to less atherosclerosis
   among healthy participants with higher arterial elasticity. Possibly,
   increased cardiac reactivity in response to challenging tasks is an
   adaptive reaction related to better cardiovascular health.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the use of archive in the work of contemporary
   artists that reflects the vexed status of historical representation in
   former Yugoslavia. Hito Steyerl, Aleksandra Domanovic and Zoran
   Todorovic represent historical memory in former Yugoslavia by
   highlighting the process of producing the archive: Steyerl creates a
   trans-historical constellation of archival narratives that span and
   conflate temporalities of the Second World War and the war in the 1990s,
   Domanovic draws attention to the way in which different temporalities
   inflect our apprehension of collected information, and Todorovic
   articulates the temporality of the archive as a medium. I argue that all
   three artists use the symbolism of the archive to capture a sense of
   being in the permanent state of in between' contested histories,
   reflecting the social reality of the region. At a time when the Eurozone
   is becoming increasingly fragmented, and various forms of right wing
   populisms are on the rise, Steyerl, Domanovic and Todorovic demonstrate
   the way in which art can help us to think through new historical
   discontinuities that have emerged in post-socialist transition.}},

Abstract = {{We observed the effects of changes in progesterone (P) during late
   follicular phases on the treatment outcome of in vitro
   fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection (ICSI) in patients with different ovarian responses. The data
   of 8,575 cycles of patients receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone
   (GnRH) agonist using the long protocol were retrospectively analyzed.
   According to the number of oocytes retrieved, the cycles were divided
   into poor ovarian response group (oocyte retrieval <5), intermediate
   ovarian response group (5 oocyte retrieval 15), and high ovarian
   response group (oocyte retrieval 16). We found that in the poor ovarian
   response group, the clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly
   associated with both the level of P or the day of human chorionic
   gonadotrophin (hCG) and the duration of pre-hCG P elevation (p=0.66 and
   p=0.1874). In intermediate and high ovarian response groups, the
   clinical pregnancy rate was inversely related to both the level of P on
   the day of hCG administration and the duration of pre-hCG P elevation
   (all p<0.0001). The cut-off values of serum P level on the day of hCG
   administration were 1ng/ml and 1.75ng/ml in intermediate and high
   ovarian response groups, respectively. The cut-off values of pre-hCG P
   elevation duration were obtained on day 1 in the intermediate ovarian
   response group, and days 1 or 3 in the high ovarian response group.
   After correcting for other confounding factors, multivariate logistic
   regression analysis indicated that P level on the day of hCG
   administration was not associated with clinical pregnancy rates, but
   pre-hCG P elevation duration was negatively associated with clinical
   pregnancy rate in the intermediate and high ovarian response groups. P
   level is associated with clinical pregnancy rate only in the patients
   with intermediate or high ovarian response. The longer the duration of
   pre-hCG P 1ng/ml, the lower the clinical pregnancy rate.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1249-1275}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates the relationship between regulatory
   globalization and neoliberal standard-setting arrangements building on
   industry capacities and responsibilities. Focusing on international
   pharmacovigilance, it recounts the history of the World Health
   Organization programme for the international drug monitoring, to shed
   light and explain the concomitant rise of the International Conference
   on Harmonization and of its standards. It shows that the
   neoliberalization of a regime or installation of a regulatory
   standard-setting arrangement responsibilizing the industry is
   inseparable from the emergence of an altogether different way of
   regulating pharmaceuticals (including a different definition of the
   problem of pharmaceuticals safety, of the organizations in charge of
   this problem and of the kinds of expertise and information used to make
   decisions about it). This happens incrementally, through gradual changes
   and hybridization of the existing regime, much more than all-out
   replacement of the regime. The rise of a market-oriented regulatory
   arrangement can therefore not be reduced to the influence of a
   neoliberal scheme, but is on the contrary linked to the ways in which a
   tool gains legitimacy as a way of tackling a global issue.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{96}},
Pages = {{1015-1031}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{The tianxia trope has been advanced as an organizing principle for
   post-Cold War international relations encompassing the rise of the
   People's Republic of China. The tianxia system is defined as a
   Sino-centric hierarchical relationship among unequals, governed
   according to Confucian principles of benevolence. As traditionally
   practiced, it incorporated an important role for the observance of
   ritual, including the presentation of tribute to the emperor as Son of
   Heaven, purportedly resulting in a Pax Sinica. Its supporters believe
   that, if adopted in today's world, tianxia would constitute a great
   improvement over the anarchic Westphalian system of theoretically equal
   states who possess sovereignty, i.e. inviolability within their own
   borders. Because they answer to no superior authority, the Westphalian
   system is by its very nature conducive to discord and war. This article
   will argue that both the tianxia and Westphalian systems have serious
   flaws and were rarely practiced as either their proponents or detractors
   argue. However, even states whose domestic autonomy is compromised by
   internal dissent and whose weaknesses prevent their playing an
   influential role internationally have vested interests in maintaining
   adherence to the Westphalian system, if only as a bargaining position.
   The PRC government itself has accepted the principles inherent therein
   through such actions as joining the United Nations and becoming a
   signatory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It zealously
   defends its sovereign prerogatives when useful, even as it makes efforts
   to educate the world on the virtues of a Confucian Great Harmony, and
   its supporters advocate following a somewhat nebulously defined Chinese
   model. In the absence of compelling incentives for major players in the
   current international system to adopt the tianxia system, Westphalian
   sovereignty appears likely to remain the organizing principle of
   international relations for the foreseeable future, its serious
   deficiencies notwithstanding. To paraphrase Winston Churchill's remarks
   on democracy, it may be the worst form of government except for all the
   others.}},

Journal = {{ATTACHMENT \& HUMAN DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{599-614}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Anxiety is the most prevalent psychiatric disturbance in childhood
   effecting typically 15-20\% of all youth. It has been associated with
   attachment insecurity and reduced competence in peer relations. Prior
   work has been limited by including mainly White samples, relying on
   questionnaires, and applying a cross-sectional design. The present study
   addressed these limitations by considering how at-risk non-White youth
   (n=34) responded to the Friends and Family Interview (FFI) in middle
   childhood and how this linked up with anxiety symptoms and an anxiety
   diagnosis threeyears later in early adolescence. Five dimensions of
   secure attachment, namely, (i) to mother, (ii) to father, (iii)
   coherence, (iv) developmental understanding, and (v) social competence
   and quality of contact with best friend in middle childhood, were found
   to correlate significantly (and negatively) with self-reported anxiety
   symptoms. Linear regression results showed independent influences of
   female gender, and (low) quality of best friend contact as the most
   efficient model predicting anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression results
   suggested a model that included female gender, low social competence,
   and immature developmental understanding as efficient predictors of an
   anxiety diagnosis, evident in only 18\% of the sample. These results
   point to the usefulness of after-school programs for at-risk minority
   youth in promoting peer competence, developmental awareness, and
   minimizing anxiety difficulties.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the issue of valence framing effect in the context
   of immunization, a preventive behavior often addressed by the equation
   of benefit versus risk. The authors examined how framing (support vs.
   oppose) the issue of HPV vaccination in Israel's immunization routine
   affects attitudes regarding vaccine regulations. The study also examined
   issue involvement as a moderator of valence framing effect. The results
   demonstrate that participants in the positive framing condition tended
   to express greater support for voluntary immunization than participants
   in the negative framing condition (77.5\% and 48.5\%, respectively).
   Among those who supported the mandatory HPV immunization policy, the
   negative framing condition was more prominent than the positive
   condition (51.5\% and 22.5\%, respectively). The analysis of interaction
   between valence framing and issue involvement showed that the latter
   tends to moderate the direct effect of framing on attitudes towards
   vaccination. Findings indicate that even attitudes towards such
   consequential preventive behaviors as vaccination could be affected by
   different framing of the issue, especially for those who are less
   involved. Implications of predilection for freedom of choice regarding
   vaccination are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of clouds are present in almost all moderate-resolution
   imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. To extract accurate
   information from MODIS data, a key preprocessing step is to detect the
   cloudy pixels. This article proposes a new algorithm to distinguish
   between cloudy and cloud-free pixels in MODIS images. This algorithm is
   based on the differences in the spectral areas between clouds and other
   surface features. It uses as many as 24 of the 36 MODIS spectral bands
   to obtain the integrated spectral information. The method has been
   illustrated by an example of 76 MODIS images recorded from 2011 to 2013.
   The results show that the algorithm is capable of correctly identifying
   most of the cloud-contaminated pixels except for some thin cloud pixels.
   We compared the new method with the MODIS Cloud Mask algorithm and found
   that the new algorithm performs better than the MODIS MOD35 Cloud Mask
   in some situation, such as coastal area, sun glint, and data with
   invalid values. ResumeUne variete de nuages est presente dans la
   quasi-totalite des images du spectroradiometre imageur a resolution

   nuageux. Cet article propose un nouvel algorithme pour distinguer les
   pixels avec nuages des pixels sans nuages dans les images MODIS. Cet
   algorithme est base sur les differences dans les zones du spectre entre
   les nuages et d'autres caracteristiques de surface. Il utilise jusqu'a
   24 des 36 bandes spectrales de MODIS pour obtenir les informations

Abstract = {{This paper examines how children exercise their agency vis-a-vis their
   mother's beliefs and practices of bilingualism, especially
   code-switching, at home and elsewhere. The data were mainly collected
   through audio-recordings of family conversations both with and without
   the presence of the researcher and semi-structured interviews conducted
   during 19 visits to two families with Japanese-speaking mothers and
   12-year-old English-Japanese bilingual children. An analysis of the data
   reveals that, despite there being a difference in language practices and
   backgrounds, both children discursively negotiate and construct their
   bilingual positions at home through their flexible use of the two
   languages. Furthermore, their language practices are not a passive
   response to their mothers' beliefs, but an exercise of their agency
   through contestation, negotiation and redefinition of the mothers'
   beliefs. In particular, this study has identified two types of agency:
   (1) construction of the positive self-image and negotiation of the
   parent-child relationship through the active use of English; and (2)
   resistance to the mother's monolingual policy through a flexible use of
   the two languages. The data also provide insight into the situated and
   multidimensional nature of agency by showing changes in the children's
   practices depending on the context, such as in conversations with the
   researcher.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of fluids' physicochemical properties is mandatory for the
   design and optimisation of industrial processes and products. A data
   quantity of most importance, in this regard, turns out to be the value
   of fluid viscosity. Many empirical and semi-empirical formulas have been
   proposed in the literature to describe the viscosity of pure liquids and
   binary liquid mixtures. Recently, an interesting equation is proposed
   for pure solvents correlating the two parameters in the viscosity
   Arrhenius-type equation, namely the activation energy (E-a) and the
   pre-exponential factor (A(s)). This paper aims to extend the said
   correlation to binary liquid mixtures. To achieve this purpose,
   statistical methods are applied using data sets from the literature of
   some solvent binary mixtures at different compositions and temperatures.
   The validation of the extended proposed equation for binary liquid
   mixtures is important since it simplifies the estimation of viscous
   behaviour and the ensuing calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The Abrasion Index (AI) describes fines generation from iron ore
   pellets, and is one of the most common indicators of pellet quality. In
   a typical pellet plant, dust is generated during the process and then
   captured. Can the dust be measured and used to predict AI? In this
   paper, the feasibility of using airborne dust measurements as an
   indicator of AI is investigated through laboratory tests and using data
   from a pellet plant. Bentonite clay, polyacrylamide and pregelled
   cornstarch contents, and induration temperature were adjusted to control
   the abrasion resistance of laboratory iron ore pellets. AI were observed
   to range from approximately 1\% to 12\%. Size distributions of the
   abrasion progeny were measured and used to estimate quantities of PM10
   (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m)
   produced during abrasion. A very good correlation between AI and PM10
   (R-2=0.90) was observed using the laboratory pellets. Similarly, a
   correlation was observed between AI and PM measured in the screening
   chimney at a straight-grate pelletization plant in Brazil, with an R-2
   value of 0.65. Thus, the laboratory and industry data suggest that
   measuring dust generation from fired pellets may be an effective on-line
   measurement of pellet quality. The data also showed that particulate
   emissions from pelletization plants may be directly affected by AI.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Older adults are the fastest growing age group in Australia,
   necessitating an increase in appropriate mental health services in the
   coming years. While Internet-delivered mental health treatments have
   been established as acceptable and efficacious among younger samples,
   little research has explored whether they would be similarly useful in
   older populations.Methods: The participants were part of the Australian
   Rural Mental Health study, which explores mental health and well-being
   in residents of non-metropolitan New South Wales. A postal survey was
   used to assess knowledge of and intentions to use Internet-delivered
   mental health treatments. Demographics, mental health, and frequency of
   Internet use were also measured.Results: The survey was completed by 950
   adults aged 50-93. The sample was largely unfamiliar with Internet
   mental health services, with 75\% reporting that they had never heard of
   them and a further 20\% not knowing any details of what they involved.
   Intentions to use these services were also low, at 13.5\%; however, this
   increased with level of familiarity. Respondents with higher
   psychological distress, higher education, and more frequent Internet use
   were significantly more likely to consider using Internet
   treatments.Conclusions: Among older adults, overall awareness of
   Internet-delivered mental health treatments appears to be limited;
   however, higher familiarity contributes to higher intentions to use
   these treatments. Importantly, respondents with higher distress and
   greater computer literacy were more likely to consider mental health
   treatments delivered via the Internet. Future research exploring
   strategies to increase the promotion of these services to older samples
   may further improve their perceptions and use.}},

Abstract = {{A series of 2-(3'-fluoro-4'-alkoxy-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-benzoxazole
   liquid crystals (coded as nPF(3)PBx) were prepared, where a lateral
   fluorine substituent, as well as methyl, chlorine and nitro terminal
   groups, was introduced into the molecules to investigate the effects of
   different polar substituents on the liquid crystal properties. The
   mesomorphic and photophysical properties were investigated. The results
   show that compounds nPF(3)PBx have enantiotropic mesophases; meanwhile,
   they exhibit UV-vis absorption bands with maxima at 323-326nm and
   photoluminescence emission peaks at 389-395nm, respectively. It is noted
   that nPF(3)PBx with terminal polar groups or electron-withdrawing groups
   (NO2, Cl) display higher clearing temperatures and wider mesophase range
   than those of the corresponding homologues with terminal non-polar
   groups or electron-donating groups (CH3, H). Meanwhile, compared with
   two lateral fluorine-substituted analogues containing 3,5-difluorophenyl
   unit, lateral monofluoro-substituted nPF(3)PBx display enhanced
   mesophase range both in heating and cooling except for terminal
   methyl-substituted compounds, as well as show obvious red-shifted UV-vis
   absorption bands and photoluminescence emission, which are attributed to
   the enhanced dipole-dipole interaction caused by increased dipole
   moment.}},

Title = {{Development of a questionnaire to measure primary care physicians' scope

Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite an increase in research devoted to primary care
   attributes, the patient benefits and educational aspects of broad scope
   practice of primary care physicians (PCPs) have not been well studied,
   due to a lack of validated measurement in each country. The objective of
   this study was to develop and validate the Scope of Practice Inventory
   (SPI) to measure physicians' scope of practice within the Japanese
   primary care setting.
   Methods: The questionnaire was developed in seven phases: 1) item
   generation, 2) consensus method for necessity of each item, 3) Delphi
   process for the importance of each item, 4) pilot tests to limit the
   number of items, 5) preliminary cross-sectional study to examine factor
   structure and to validate the construct validity, 6) evaluation of
   internal consistency and intra-class reliability, and 7) evaluation of
   external validity. To confirm the interpretability of the SPI, the
   determinants of the SPI using a generalized linear model were evaluated.
   Results: Among 359 items generated by a focus group, 180 reached a
   defined consensus on face and content validity after the Delphi process.
   After deletion of items with Kappa values less than 0.6, 120 items were
   selected for the preliminary study. The principle component analysis
   using responses from 451 PCPs eliminated 52 items. The final 68-point
   SPI had three subdomains: Inpatient care, 25 items; Urgent care and
   minor procedures, 27 items; and Ambulatory care, 16 items. Internal
   consistency and test-retest reliability for total SPI and each subdomain
   revealed acceptable reliability. Male sex, less years since graduation,
   working in a hospital, sub-urban or rural setting, having remote
   experience, and having board certification as a PCP were positively
   associated with higher SPI.
   Conclusions: We developed a self-administered 68-point scale, the SPI,
   which had satisfactory validity and reliability. Primary care quality
   and educational research using SPI are expected to contribute to
   comprehensive and efficient health care systems in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A successful carbon capture and storage (CCS) policy and programme is
   widely considered essential to curbing carbon dioxide emissions. What
   explains the strikingly different policy outcomes in two key European
   Union political heavyweights and coal economies, the UK and Germany? The
   UK has decided to contract two specific CCS projects, with explicit
   timelines for realisation; Germany has made no such decisions. From
   scrutiny of official documents and in-depth high-level interviews, it
   was found that the UK has more favourable structural capacity, including
   offshore storage capacity (which evokes less conflict) and significant
   oil-industry expertise, and thus an easier task. Moreover, this
   structural capacity has interacted with a solid political commitment to
   bring CCS forward in the UK, including specific, multistage funding and
   a high-level drive to develop CCS, especially after 2009. In Germany, by
   contrast, CCS has encountered increasing local and central opposition
   since 2009, with the Energiewende and renewables being accorded
   priority.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{In wireless communications, a fading multiple-access channel (MAC) is
   typically used to model the uplink communication. Conventional MACs
   assume a centralized system, where the transmission rate and power are
   chosen centrally for every fading vector realization. On the other hand,
   there is considerable interest in the performance of distributed
   multiple access systems, where the lack of global channel state
   information (CSI) demands novel communication strategies. We consider a
   block-fading MAC where each transmitter is aware only of its own link
   CSI, which we term as the individual CSI MAC. The receiver has access to
   the full CSI of all links. This model was recently introduced in the
   information theory literature, and naturally leads to a distributed
   access system with several applications. An important utility of
   interest for this model is known as the power-controlled adaptive
   sum-capacity, whose evaluation is an open problem. This is the main
   subject of the current paper. We present the power-controlled adaptive
   sum-capacity of a wide class of popular fading MAC models. In
   particular, we characterize the sum-capacity when the statistics of the
   channel are identical across users. The proposed schemes also allow a
   low-complexity successive-cancellation decoding using rate-splitting.
   Furthermore, the optimal schemes are extended to situations in which
   each transmitter has additional finite-rate partial CSI on the link
   quality of others.}},

Abstract = {{Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were modified by Fe3O4 nanoparticles with
   application for the preconcentration of metals. The modified materials

   cadmium and lead from maca prior to analysis by flame atomic absorption
   spectrometry. The amount of nanoparticles, pH, adsorption time,
   coexisting ions, eluent solution, and reuse of the material were
   characterized to optimize the recoveries of the analytes. Under the
   optimum conditions, the calibration curves were linear from 0.05 to 20
   milligrams per liter for cadmium and from 0.05 to 25 milligrams per
   liter for lead. The limits of detection were 0.32 and 0.57 micrograms

Abstract = {{Introduction: External price referencing (EPR) is applied frequently to
   control pharmaceutical prices. Our objective was to analyse how EPR is
   used in Middle Eastern (ME) countries and to compare the price corridor
   for original pharmaceuticals to non-pharmaceutical services not
   subjected to EPR. Methods: We conducted a survey on EPR regulations and
   collected prices of 16 patented pharmaceuticals and 14
   non-pharmaceutical services in seven Middle Eastern (ME) countries.
   Maximum and minimum prices of each pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
   technology were compared to mean prices in the countries studied by
   using market exchange rates. Influencing factors of pharmaceutical
   prices were assessed by multivariate linear regression analysis.
   Results: The average price corridor is narrower for pharmaceuticals
   (-39.8\%; +35.9\%) than for outpatient and hospital services (-81.7\%;
   +96.3\%). Conclusion: Our analysis revealed the importance of population
   size and EPR implementation on drug price levels; however, EPR results
   in higher pharmaceutical prices in lower-income countries compared to
   non-pharmaceutical services.}},

Title = {{Variation in the ontogeny of sex steroid levels between latitudinal
   populations of the medaka}},
Journal = {{ZOOLOGICAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Sex steroids mediate the expression of sexual dimorphism
   during ontogeny, and populations that differ in the magnitudes of sexual
   dimorphism may accordingly differ in the ontogenetic patterns of their
   sex steroid levels. The medaka, Oryzias latipes species complex, shows
   geographic variation in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism with respect
   to the lengths of their anal and dorsal fins; dimorphism is greater in
   low-latitude populations than in high-latitude populations. However,
   sexual differences in the ontogenetic dynamics of sex steroids, and its
   interpopulation variation, have not been examined.
   Results: We measured testosterone (T), estradiol-17 beta (E2), and
   11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) concentrations throughout ontogeny of
   laboratory-reared fish from two latitudinal populations: Aomori
   (northern) and Okinawa (southern). In both populations, the levels of
   all three steroids were high during early ontogenetic stages and
   decreased with growth. After reaching about 15 mm in standard length,
   when sexual dimorphisms in fin lengths became apparent, steroid levels
   increased and tended to plateau. Sexual differences in the steroid
   levels were observed only in the later ontogenetic stages; T and 11-KT
   levels were higher in males, while E2 levels were higher in females.
   Accordingly, interpopulation differences also became clearer; the
   southern fish tended to show higher T levels and lower E2 levels than
   the northern fish.
   Conclusions: The ontogenetic patterns of sex steroid levels paralleled
   the ontogeny of anal and dorsal fins in the two latitudinal populations,
   suggesting that interpopulation variation in the degree of sexual
   dimorphisms in fin lengths is mediated by sex steroid-dependent
   regulation of fin elongation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Eating disorders (ED) and substance use disorders (SUD)
   commonly co-occur, especially in conjunction with posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD), yet little is known about ED and ED symptoms in women
   presenting to addiction treatment programs. Objective: We examined the
   association between ED symptoms and substance use frequency and severity
   in a sample of women with a DSM IV diagnosis of current SUD and PTSD
   enrolled in SUD treatment. Method: Participants were 122 women from four
   substance abuse treatment sites who participated in a multi-site
   clinical trial through the National Institute of Drug Abuse Clinical
   Trials Network (NIDA CTN). The Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire
   (EDE-Q), the Clinician's Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the
   Addiction Severity Index (ASI) were administered at baseline and
   correlational analyses were performed. Variables that significantly
   correlated with EDE-Q total and subscale scores were entered into a
   linear regression analysis. Results: Scores on the EDE-Q Global scale,
   as well as the Eating Concern, Weight Concern and Shape Concern
   subscales of the EDE-Q were significantly associated with Caucasian
   race/ethnicity, past 30 day opiate use, higher ASI Psychiatric Subscale
   score and lower ASI Employment Subscale score. Conclusion: Although
   exploratory, these findings suggest that there may be a relationship
   between addiction severity, use of certain drugs of abuse and eating
   disorder symptoms, particularly those involving weight and shape
   concerns in women with comorbid PTSD and SUD.}},

Title = {{Invisible Hyperbolic Metamaterial Nanotube at Visible Frequency}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Subwavelength-scale metal and dielectric nanostructures have served as
   important building blocks for electromagnetic metamaterials, providing
   unprecedented opportunities for manipulating the optical response of the
   matter. Recently, hyperbolic metamaterials have been drawing particular
   interest because of their unusual optical properties and
   functionalities, such as negative refraction and hyperlensing of light.
   Here, as a promising application of a hyperbolic metamaterial at visible
   frequency, we propose an invisible nanotube that consists of metal and
   dielectric alternating thin layers. The theoretical study of the light
   scattering of the layered nanotube reveals that almost-zero scattering
   can be achieved at a specific wavelength when the transverse-electric-or
   transverse-magnetic-polarized light is incident to the nanotube. In
   addition, the layered nanotube can be described as a radial-anisotropic
   hyperbolic metamaterial nanotube. The low scattering occurs when the
   effective permittivity of the hyperbolic nanotube in the angular
   direction is near zero, and thus the invisibility of the layered
   nanotube can be efficiently obtained by analyzing the equivalent
   hyperbolic nanotube. Our new method to design and tune an invisible
   nanostructure represents a significant step toward the practical
   implementation of unique nanophotonic devices such as invisible
   photodetectors and low-scattering near-field optical microscopes.}},

Abstract = {{Waste rock piles producing acid mine drainage (AMD) are complex and
   heterogeneous unsaturated systems in which multiple coupled processes
   are involved: multiphase flow of fluids (liquid and gas), heat transfer
   and mass transport. Numerical modelling is required to consider together
   these processes. Such modelling was used to evaluate the effects of
   closing options for a waste rock pile, including resloping and the
   placement of a cover, on AMD production from the South Dump of the Doyon
   Mine (Quebec, Canada). The thermal data recorded within the pile during
   15years show a steady reduction of temperature over the last 10years.
   The objective of this study was to numerically reproduce the temporal
   evolution of thermal conditions to answer two key questions: (1) Can the
   evolution of material properties over time explain observed changes in
   thermal conditions? (2) If waste rock properties have evolved, is it
   effective to cover the pile to mitigate AMD production? Modelling showed
   that reducing the permeability of materials in the model can reproduce
   observed temperature changes over time, which cannot be achieved by
   reducing the reactivity of materials. Results also show that the
   evolution of hydraulic properties of the waste rock pile can have a
   direct effect on the global oxidation rate because of their control over
   the supply of atmospheric air and oxygen in the pile. When the
   production of AMD is already in decline, simulations also show that a
   simple remodelling of the surface may be sufficient to significantly
   decrease the oxidation rate and provide immediate environmental gains,
   without a cover. However, there may be other benefits related to cover
   placement that have not been evaluated by our study, especially in
   relation to the management of water runoff and leachate.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term preservation of fish fertility is essential for the
   conservation of endangered fishes. However, cryopreservation techniques
   for fish oocytes and embryos have not yet been developed. In the present
   study, functional eggs and sperm were derived from whole rainbow trout
   that had been frozen in a freezer and stored without the aid of
   exogenous cryoprotectants. Type A spermatogonia retrieved from
   frozen-thawed whole trout remained viable after freezing duration up to
   1,113 days. Long-term-frozen trout spermatogonia that were
   intraperitoneally transplanted into triploid salmon hatchlings migrated
   toward the recipient gonads, where they were incorporated, and
   proliferated rapidly. Although all triploid recipients that did not
   undergo transplantation were functionally sterile, 2 of 12 female
   recipients and 4 of 13 male recipients reached sexual maturity. Eggs and
   sperm obtained from the salmon recipients were capable of producing
   donor-derived trout offspring. This methodology is thus a convenient
   emergency tool for the preservation of endangered fishes.}},

Title = {{Phospholipid complex as an approach for bioavailability enhancement of

Journal = {{DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1777-1784}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Context: Echinacoside (ECH) has been shown to possess a multitude of
   pharmacological activities, however, oral administered ECH failed to
   fulfill its therapeutic potential due to poor absorption and low
   bioavailability. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new oral
   dosage form to enhance its intestinal absorption and improve
   bioavailability.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to formulate ECH into phospholipid
   complex (phytosome, PHY) to enhance intestinal absorption and oral
   bioavailability of ECH in vivo.Methods: The PHY was prepared by a
   solvent evaporation method and was characterized by differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared spectroscopy (IR), and then the
   physicochemical properties, intestinal absorption and bioavailability of
   the PHY were investigated.
   Results: Compared with the physical mixture (MIX) or ECH alone, the
   n-octanol/water partition coefficient (P) determination results showed
   that the lipophilicity of ECH was significantly enhanced by formation of
   PHY. Accordingly, the intestinal absorption rate (K-a) was improved to
   2.82-fold and the effective permeability coefficient (P-eff) increased
   to 3.39-fold. The concentrations of ECH in rat plasma at different times
   after oral administration of PHY were determined by HPLC.
   Pharmacokinetic parameters of the PHY in rats were T-max=1.500h,
   C-max=3.170mg/mL, AUC(0-infinity)=9.375mg/Lh and AUC(0-24)=7.712mg/Lh,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Compared with ECH alone or the MIX group, the relative
   bioavailability of ECH was increased significantly after formulation
   into PHY (p<0.05). This might be mainly due to an improvement of the
   absorption of PHY.}},

Abstract = {{Raltegravir and lamivudine have been part of highly active therapy
   regimens throughout the past years of antiretroviral therapy. A
   fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen comprising a non-poloxamer formulation
   of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir and the transcriptase inhibitor
   lamivudine (raltegravir/lamivudine; Dutrebis((R))) has been recently
   licensed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In several Phase I
   pharmacokinetic studies, one Dutrebis (150 mg lamivudine/300 mg
   raltegravir) fixed-dose combination tablet showed a higher
   bioavailability but comparable lamivudine and 400 mg raltegravir
   poloxamer exposures. Thus, the co-administration of raltegravir together
   with lamivudine created a potent, effective, well-tolerated
   antiretroviral combination, which could be more convenient for the
   patient. However, the disadvantage of twice a day administration, and
   the existence of other fixed-dose combinations limit its widespread

Abstract = {{We systematically measured the Hall effect in the extremely large
   magnetoresistance semimetal WTe2. By carefully fitting the Hall
   resistivity to a two-band model, the temperature dependencies of the
   carrier density and mobility for both electron-and hole-type carriers
   were determined. We observed a sudden increase in the hole density below
   similar to 160 K, which is likely associated with the
   temperature-induced Lifshitz transition reported by a previous
   photoemission study. In addition, a more pronounced reduction in
   electron density occurs below 50 K, giving rise to comparable electron
   and hole densities at low temperature. Our observations indicate a
   possible electronic structure change below 50 K, which might be the
   direct driving force of the electron-hole ``compensation{''} and the
   extremely large magnetoresistance as well. Numerical simulations imply
   that this material is unlikely to be a perfectly compensated system. (C)

Abstract = {{People with a mental health or cognitive disability are vastly
   over-represented in the Australian prison system. Investigatory reports
   by Ombudsmen and similar organisations reveal that there is considerable
   scope for improving the treatment of this cohort. One avenue for doing
   so is using a human rights framework, given that Australia's
   international human rights law obligations require (among other things)
   that imprisoned people be treated with respect for their human dignity
   and, furthermore, recent international research demonstrating that fair
   and respectful treatment in prison may improve psychological well-being.
   However, there are considerable challenges involved in implementing this
   requirement in overcrowded and hierarchical prison settings. It is even
   more difficult to comply with the legal requirements given the web of
   provisions at the international, national and State/Territory levels,
   causing complexity and a lack of clarity as to their interrelationship.
   This article condenses the requirements into four principles and
   discusses how these have been applied by courts in relevant
   international and domestic cases. This analysis aims to assist
   correctional managers and policy makers seeking to comply with these
   legal requirements. Such compliance should form part of a multifaceted
   approach to protecting these vulnerable individuals from further harm.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model for the prediction of the shear-flexural strength of
   slender reinforced concrete beams with and without transverse
   reinforcement is presented. The model incorporates the shear transferred
   by the un-cracked concrete chord, along the crack's length, by the
   stirrups, if they are, and, in that case by the longitudinal
   reinforcement. After the development of the first branch of the critical
   shear crack, failure is considered to occur when the stresses at any
   point of the concrete compression chord reach the assumed biaxial stress
   failure envelope. A physical explanation is provided for the evolution
   of the shear transfer mechanisms, and the contribution of each one at
   ultimate limit state is formulated accordingly. Simple equations are
   derived for shear strength verification and for designing transverse
   reinforcement. The method is validated by comparing its predictions with
   the results of 1131 shear tests, obtaining very good results in terms of
   mean value and coefficient of variation. Because of its accuracy,
   simplicity and theoretical consistency, the proposed method is
   considered to be very useful for the practical design and assessment of
   concrete structures subjected to combined shear and bending.}},

Title = {{THE POSTCRANIAL ANATOMY OF YACARERANI BOLIVIENSIS AND THE PHYLOGENETIC
   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NOTOSUCHIAN POSTCRANIAL SKELETON}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, we describe new specimens of Yacarerani
   boliviensis from the Cajones Formation (Upper Cretaceous) of Bolivia. We
   focus on the postcranial anatomy of Y. boliviensis, because this
   anatomical region is completely unknown in other sphagesaurid
   notosuchians up to the present. At least eight individuals representing
   almost the entire postcranial skeleton are described. Although the
   postcranial anatomy of Yacarerani resembles that of other notosuchians
   in many features, five autapomorphic characters were identified:
   pedicles of the atlas bearing a lateral bulge; absence of rounded
   depressions on the dorsal surface of the anterior to middle dorsal
   vertebrae; coracoid bearing an oblique crest on its lateral surface;
   lateromedially compressed anterior ungual phalanges; and femur with a
   shallow depression for the M. puboischiofemoralis internus 1 and M.
   caudifemoralis longus. Observed variation in the postcranial anatomy of
   basal mesoeucrocodylians was incorporated as new characters in a
   phylogenetic analysis, expanding the postcranial information used in
   current phylogenetic data sets. The phylogenetic analysis depicts
   Yacarerani forming a clade with Adamantinasuchus, which is positioned at
   the base of Sphagesauridae. This family is well nested among a clade of
   `advanced notosuchians,' and Mariliasuchus is recovered as its sister
   group. The cladistic analysis recovered new postcranial synapomorphies
   for Notosuchia and less inclusive clades, although the fact that many
   taxa lack postcranial remains limits the number of unambiguous
   postcranial synapomorphies within Notosuchia.}},

Title = {{Proteomic analysis of Pteropus alecto kidney cells in response to the
   viral mimic, Poly I:C}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bats are recognised as an important reservoir for a number
   of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses. While many of these viruses cause
   severe and often fatal disease in humans, bats are able to coexist with
   these viruses without clinical signs of disease. The mechanism
   conferring this antiviral response is not fully understood. Here, we
   investigated the differential protein expression of immortalised
   Pteropus alecto kidney cells (PaKiT03) following transfection with the
   viral mimic, Poly I:C. Two complementary proteomic approaches,
   difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and isobaric tagging for relative
   and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to quantify changes in
   protein expression following Poly I: C stimulation at 4, 8 and 20 hr
   post treatment (hpt).
   Results: The expression of ISG54 gene, a known responder to virus
   infection and Poly I: C treatment, was significantly induced in
   transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Through iTRAQ
   analysis we show that Poly I: C up-regulates key glycolytic enzymes at 4
   hpt within PaKiT03 cells. In contrast, at 20 hpt PaKiT03 cells
   down-regulated ribosomal subunit proteins. The analysis with DIGE of
   Poly I: C transfected PaKiT03 cells showed over 215 individual spots
   differentially regulated, however only 25 spots could be unambiguously
   identified by LC-MS/MS. Immunoblotting confirmed the up-regulation of
   Eno1 and Tpi1 in PaKiT03 cells following Poly I: C transfection. A
   comparison with human cells (HEK293T and HeLa) and one additional bat
   cell line (PaLuT02), demonstrated that glycolytic pathways are also
   induced in these cell types, but at different intensities.
   Conclusion: The two techniques, DIGE and iTRAQ identified largely
   overlapping sets of differentially expressed proteins, however DIGE
   unambiguously identified significantly less proteins than iTRAQ. Poly I:
   C induced a rapid metabolic shift towards glycolysis within the PaKiT03
   cells at 4 hpt, presumably as a consequence of increased energy
   requirements. On the other hand ribosomal subunit proteins were seen as
   down-regulated by iTRAQ, these proteins may be the limiting factors in
   the translational machinery available for virus replication. This study
   provides new insight into the antiviral response of bat cells,
   highlighting the importance of energy metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{We consider how Agenda, a feminist journal located in the Global South,
   and Africa specifically, mediates and balances the demands of
   peer-reviewed and peer-sanctioned knowledge production with the
   requisite gender, race and space/place equality in the context of
   mechanisms that often privilege particular ways of knowing. The article
   addresses the following questions: What forces inhibit and marginalise
   women's voices generally, and black women's voices in particular, from
   feminist knowledge production and dissemination? How do we sustain our
   feminist positioning and critique in publishing in an environment where
   gender equality in the various socioeconomic spheres of life remains
   elusive and where gender violence against women is rife, and this in the
   context of `scholarly' peer review? In particular, how do we ensure that
   the voices of those most marginalised by these inequalities and social
   forces are heard in ways that matter - and, indeed, count - in scholarly
   publishing? Informing these questions is our argument that it is not
   simply the quantitative dimension related to scholars of the south that
   matters in terms of how many get published, but also the qualitative
   dimension in respect of who gets published, who has access to
   publications, and what limitations and challenges exist to address this.}},

   artifacts that classically appear in traditional Fourier analysis, and
   were consecutively used to demonstrate the correction efficiency of the
   proposed conditioning technique. Optimization of the algorithm
   parameters is also presented and discussed. Finally, the procedure was
   applied to grating-based interferometric measurements performed in the
   hard X-ray regime. The proposed algorithm enables nearly
   edge-artifact-free retrieval of the phase derivatives. A similar
   enhancement of the retrieved absorption and fringe visibility images is
   also achieved. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Eight fly ash samples collected from South African power stations were
   evaluated for various chemical properties, liming potential and metal
   species release under incubation. All fly ashes had alkaline pH ranging
   from 10.97 to 12.75 with much wider variations of electrical
   conductivity (range 0.46-8.27dSm(-1)). Their total P content ranged from
   553.3 to 1514mgPkg(-1) and Olsen extractable P from 130 to
   345.5mgPkg(-1). Application of two of the fly ashes to three different
   soils showed a high ability to neutralize acidity, resulting in an
   average of 41\% change in pH after 8weeks of incubation. Across all
   three soils, the fly ash incorporation increased extractable P content
   from a P-deficient level to levels above 25mgPkg(-1) in two of the three
   soils. Except for Cu, all metal species (Cr, Pb, Ni and Fe) showed

Abstract = {{There is no doubt that viruses require cells to successfully reproduce
   and effectively infect the next host. The question is what is the fate
   of the infected cells? All eukaryotic cells can ``sense{''} viral
   infections and exhibit defence strategies to oppose viral replication
   and spread. This often leads to the elimination of the infected cells by
   programmed cell death or apoptosis. This ``sacrifice{''} of infected
   cells represents the most primordial response of multicellular organisms
   to viruses. Subverting host cell apoptosis, at least for some time, is
   therefore a crucial strategy of viruses to ensure their replication, the
   production of essential viral proteins, virus assembly and the spreading
   to new hosts. For that reason many viruses harbor apoptosis inhibitory
   genes, which once inside infected cells are expressed to circumvent
   apoptosis induction during the virus reproduction phase. On the other
   hand, viruses can take advantage of stimulating apoptosis to (i)
   facilitate shedding and hence dissemination, (ii) to prevent infected
   cells from presenting viral antigens to the immune system or (iii) to
   kill non-infected bystander and immune cells which would limit viral
   propagation. Hence the decision whether an infected host cell undergoes
   apoptosis or not depends on virus type and pathogenicity, its capacity
   to oppose antiviral responses of the infected cells and/or to evade any
   attack from immune cells. Viral genomes have therefore been adapted
   throughout evolution to satisfy the need of a particular virus to induce
   or inhibit apoptosis during its life cycle. Here we review the different
   strategies used by viruses to interfere with the two major apoptosis as
   well as with the innate immune signaling pathways in mammalian cells. We
   will focus on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and discuss new ideas
   about how particular viruses could activately engage mitochondria to
   induce apoptosis of their host. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Terrorism can heighten fears and undermine
   the feeling of safety. Little is known, however, about the factors that
   influence threat and safety perception after terrorism. The aim of the
   present study was to explore how proximity to terror and posttraumatic
   stress reactions are associated with perceived threat and safety after a
   workplace terrorist attack. Design and methods: A cross-sectional
   questionnaire survey was administered to employees in 14 of 17 Norwegian
   ministries 9-10 months after the 2011 bombing of the government
   headquarters in Oslo (n = 3520). Results: About 198 of 1881 employees
   completing the survey were at work when the bomb exploded. Regression
   analysis showed that this high-exposed group had elevated perceived
   threat ( = 0.36; 95\% CI = 0.19 to 0.53) and reduced perceived safety (
   = -0.42; 95\% CI = -0.62 to -0.23) compared to a reference group of
   employees not at work. After adjusting for posttraumatic stress
   reactions, however, proximity to the explosion no longer mattered,
   whereas posttraumatic stress was associated with both high perceived
   threat ( = 0.55; 95\% CI = 0.48 to 0.63) and low perceived safety ( =
   -0.71; 95\% CI, -0.80 to -0.63). Conclusion: Terror-exposed employees
   feel more threatened and less safe after a workplace terrorist attack,
   and this is closely linked to elevated levels of posttraumatic stress
   reactions.}},

   obtained from the air-dried ground and unground herb, collected at full
   flowering (1st harvest), and from regrowth stems (2nd harvest) was
   analysed by GC-MS and GC-FID. The studied plants belong to the
   trans-sabinene hydrate chemotype, and the average percentage of this
   compound was 49.12 \%. The harvest of the herb at full flowering stage
   (July) allows to obtain an oil containing more cis-sabinene hydrate,
   sabinene as well as cis- and trans- sabinene hydrate acetates than that
   obtained from the second harvest in October, from which we obtain, in
   turn, more trans-sabinene hydrate, linalyl acetate, and E-caryophyllene
   in the oil. These modifications may be important for the practical
   application of marjoram essential oil and herbal raw material itself.
   The grinding of marjoram raw material should be considered to be a
   treatment that enhances the fragrance of the spice. The separation of
   low-value stems allows obtaining an oil with a higher proportion of
   sabinene and cis-sabinene hydrate.}},

   experienced by women academics in pursuing research careers. Mentoring
   was found to facilitate research career development and improve levels

   head of department with mentoring as a key function emerged as an
   influential structure for the career advancement of women academics.

Abstract = {{Plants have elaborate defensive machinery to protect against numerous
   pathogens and insects. Plant hormones function as modulators of
   defensive mechanisms to maintain plant resistance to natural enemies.
   Our recent study suggests that salicylic acid (SA) is the primary
   phytohormone regulating plant responses to Agrobacterium tumefaciens
   infection. Tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana Domin.) immune responses
   against Agrobacterium-mediated crown gall disease were activated by
   exposure to the sucking insect whitefly, which stimulated SA
   biosynthesis in aerial tissues; in turn, SA synthesized in aboveground
   tissues systemically modulated SA secretion in root tissues. Further
   investigation revealed that endogenous SA biosynthesis negatively
   modulated Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation. Our study
   provides novel evidence that activation of the SA-signaling pathway
   mediated by a sucking insect infestation has a pivotal role in
   subsequently attenuating Agrobacterium infection. These results
   demonstrate new insights into interspecies cross-talking among insects,
   plants, and soil bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Electro-kinetic phenomena (EKP) arising under dc electric field in
   nanoporous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films, filled with a nematic
   liquid crystal (NLC) 4-n-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (5CB), were
   investigated for the first time. The volumetric flow rate was found to
   be directly proportional to the applied voltage U in the range of 0 ...
   30 for both isotropic and nematic phases. Such type of dependences
   correspond to quasi-Newtonian behaviour of a liquid crystal (LC) with
   orientation strongly stabilised by surfaces. The value of zeta potential
   (about -12mV) was estimated from the data, obtained in isotropic phase
   in the approximation of a plug' velocity profile. The possible role of
   electrically induced flows in previously reported electrooptical
   response of PET films filled with LC is discussed. The obtained results
   can be used for elaboration of optofluidic devices of a new type.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Responses of sensory neurons represent stimulus information, but are
   also influenced by internal state. For example, when monkeys direct
   their attention to a visual stimulus, the response gain of specific
   subsets of neurons in visual cortex changes. Here, we develop a
   functional model of population activity to investigate the structure of
   this effect. We fit the model to the spiking activity of bilateral
   neural populations in area V4, recorded while the animal performed a
   stimulus discrimination task under spatial attention. The model reveals
   four separate time-varying shared modulatory signals, the dominant two
   of which each target task-relevant neurons in one hemisphere. In
   attention-directed conditions, the associated shared modulatory signal
   decreases in variance. This finding provides an interpretable and
   parsimonious explanation for previous observations that attention
   reduces variability and noise correlations of sensory neurons. Finally,
   the recovered modulatory signals reflect previous reward, and are
   predictive of subsequent choice behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Food forgery has posed considerable risk to public health, religious
   rituals, personal budget and wildlife. Pig, dog, cat, rat and monkey
   meat are restricted in most religions, but their sporadic adulteration
   are rampant. Market controllers need a low-cost but reliable technique
   to track and trace suspected species in the food chain. Considering the
   need, here we documented a lab-on-a-chip-based multiplex polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) assay for the authentication of five non-halal meat
   species in foods. Using species-specific primers, 172, 163, 141, 129 and
   108-bp sites of mitochondrial ND5, ATPase 6 and cytochrome b genes were
   amplified to detect cat, dog, pig, monkey and rat species under complex
   matrices. Species-specificity was authenticated against 20 different
   species with the potential to be used in food. The targets were stable
   under extreme sterilisation (121 degrees C at 45psi for 2.5h) which
   severely degrades DNA. The assay was optimised under the backgrounds of
   various commercial meat products and validated for the analysis of
   meatballs, burgers and frankfurters, which are popular fast food items
   across the globe. The assay was tested to detect 0.1\% suspected meats
   under commercial backgrounds of marketed foods. Instead of simplex PCR
   which detects only one species at a time, such a multiplex platform can
   reduce cost by at least fivefolds by detecting five different species in
   a single assay platform.}},

   and normally distributed exogenous variables. Its advantages became more
   prominent when indicator reliabilities were heterogeneous and small. The
   EXUC was a viable option for estimating the model when indicators were
   parallel and exhibited large indicator reliabilities. An empirical
   example of the results is provided, and the relevance of measurement
   model characteristics to assess nonlinear relationships is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A Cross Sectional study was carried out on 100 patients with pleural
   effusion from December 2013 to July 2015 at ASRAM Medical College and
   Hospital Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Eluru. In our study,
   Exudative effusion remains most common cause of pleural effusion.
   Tubercular effusion remains the commonest etiology of all exudative
   effusions, where as Congestive cardiac failure remains commonest cause
   among transudative effusions. Tubercular effusion affects most commonly
   young and is associated with cough and fever as the most common
   presenting symptom. Malignant effusions were seen in older age group
   with cough and dyspnoea as predominant symptoms. Massive effusion with
   hemorrhagic pleural fluid is commonly associated with malignant effusion
   while small to moderate effusions with straw colour pleural fluid is
   associated ubercular effusion where as empyema cases presented with pus.
   Right sided effusion was most common with male to female ratio of
   3.54:1, with mean age of 40.511.3 years. Empyema was most commonly
   associated with high Leukocytes. Tubercular effusion was associated with
   lymphocytic predominant effusion where as neutophilic dominant effusion
   included empyema and parapneumonic effusion. Pleural fluid, with low
   glucose (<40 mg/dl) was seen predominantly in empyemas. Pleural LDH to
   serum LDH ratio >2 was seen predominantly in empyemas. A pleural fluid
   ADA more than 70 IU/L was associated with nearly half of Tubercular
   effusions, where as others with ADA levels between 30 to 70 IU/L along
   with clinicoradiological findings suggestive of tubercular effusion.
   Thus proving diagnostic importance of ADA in TB effusions. Early
   intiation Anitubercular drugs in TB pleural effusion, early intervention
   and treatment in cases of empyema and parapneumonic effusion showed
   improvement and signs of recovery.}},

Title = {{Elasticity of polymeric nanocolloidal particles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Softness is an essential mechanical feature of macromolecular particles
   such as polymer-grafted nanocolloids, polyelectrolyte networks,
   cross-linked microgels as well as block copolymer and dendrimer
   micelles. Elasticity of individual particles directly controls their
   swelling, wetting, and adsorption behaviour, their aggregation and
   self-assembly as well as structural and rheological properties of
   suspensions. Here we use numerical simulations and self-consistent field
   theory to study the deformation behaviour of a single spherical polymer
   brush upon diametral compression. We observe a universal response, which
   is rationalised using scaling arguments and interpreted in terms of two
   coarse-grained models. At small and intermediate compressions the
   deformation can be accurately reproduced by modelling the brush as a
   liquid drop, whereas at large compressions the brush behaves as a soft
   ball. Applicable far beyond the pairwise-additive small-strain regime,
   the models may be used to describe microelasticity of nanocolloids in
   severe confinement including dense disordered and crystalline phases.}},

Abstract = {{A general modular methodology for the simultaneous optimization of the
   supply-chain network and the production systems of a general industrial
   gas producer is developed and implemented in a C++ program. The
   formulation and solution algorithm are specifically designed to be able
   to work on-line and to determine the optimal assignments of production
   site output to customer demand in the supplychain and the corresponding
   optimal operating conditions for the production plants in integrated
   fashion. Here, the production network is not simply modelled as a set of
   product sources, rather the model is detailed enough to allow effective
   and feasible optimization of the entire system. Moreover, the proposed
   approach can be easily combined with the rolling horizon technique to
   mitigate the uncertainties in demand. The modelling strategies, employed
   for the supply-chain network and the production sites, along with the
   solution approach, adopted for the resulting optimization problem, are
   detailed. BzzMath library classes are used to meet the computational
   efficiency requirements for on-line applications. The effectiveness of
   the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a case study involving a
   portion of the real supply-chain and network of production facilities of

Title = {{Edging along a Warming Coast: A Range Extension for a Common Sandy Beach
   Crab}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Determining the position of range edges is the first step in developing
   an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in play as
   species' ranges shift in response to climate change. Here, we study the
   leading (poleward) range edge of Ocypode cordimanus, a ghost crab that
   is common along the central to northern east coast of Australia. Our
   study establishes the poleward range edge of adults of this species to
   be at Merimbula (36.90 degrees S, 149.93 degrees E), 270 km (along the
   coast) south of the previous southernmost museum record. We also
   establish that dispersal of pelagic larvae results in recruitment to
   beaches 248 km (along the coast; 0.9 degrees of latitude) beyond the
   adult range edge we have documented here. Although we cannot
   conclusively demonstrate that the leading range edge for this species
   has moved polewards in response to climate change, this range edge does
   fall within a ``hotspot{''} of ocean warming, where surface isotherms
   are moving southwards along the coast at 20-50 km. decade(-1); coastal
   air temperatures in the region are also warming. If these patterns
   persist, future range extensions could be anticipated. On the basis of
   their ecology, allied with their occupancy of ocean beaches, which are
   home to taxa that are particularly amenable to climate-change studies,
   we propose that ghost crabs like O. cordimanus represent ideal model
   organisms with which to study ecological and evolutionary processes
   associated with climate change. The fact that ``hotspots{''} of ocean
   warming on four other continents correspond with poleward range edges of
   ghost crab species suggests that results of hypothesis tests could be
   generalized, yielding excellent opportunities to rapidly progress
   knowledge in this field.}},

Abstract = {{IrO2 is one of the most active water oxidant catalysis for the oxygen
   evolution anode owing to its chemical stability and outstanding
   catalytic activities, however iridium (Ir) is also one of the rarest
   metals in the world. In this report, a novel highly active
   nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was
   fabricated by depositing IrO2 nanoparticles onto Ti nanotube substrates.
   This nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode exhibits comparable oxygen evolution
   catalytic activities as the traditional IrO2/Ti dimensional stable anode
   with only 1\% iridium consumption of the traditional method. This
   nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode would be a promising candidate method for
   fabricating high effective IrO2/Ti anode with low Ir consumption.

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the impact of visual cues, speech materials, age
   and listening condition on the frequency bandwidth necessary for
   optimizing speech recognition performance. Design: Using a randomized
   repeated measures design; speech recognition performance was assessed
   using four speech perception tests presented in quiet and noise in 13 LP
   filter conditions and presented in multimodalities. Participants'
   performance data were fitted with a Boltzmann function to determine
   optimal performance (10\% below performance achieved in FBW). Study
   sample: Thirty adults (18-63 years) and thirty children (7-12 years)
   with normal hearing. Results: Visual cues significantly reduced the
   bandwidth required for optimizing speech recognition performance for
   listeners. The type of speech material significantly impacted the
   bandwidth required for optimizing performance. Both groups required
   significantly less bandwidth in quiet, although children required
   significantly more than adults. The widest bandwidth required was for
   the phoneme detection task in noise where children required a bandwidth
   of 7399 Hz and adults 6674 Hz. Conclusions: Listeners require
   significantly less bandwidth for optimizing speech recognition
   performance when assessed using sentence materials with visual cues.
   That is, the amount of bandwidth systematically decreased as a function
   of increased contextual, linguistic, and visual content.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient delivery of anticancer drugs into tumor cells to increase the
   intracellular drug concentration is a major challenge for cancer therapy
   due to drug resistance and inefficient cellular uptake. pH-Sensitive
   intracellular tumor targeting is increasingly investigated as a pathway
   to trigger the release of drugs once the drug carrier reached the unique
   acidic environment of the solid tumors, resulting in the localization of
   the polymer in the acidic endosomes and lysosomes. Herein, we report a
   novel pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer poly (itaconic
   acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-histidine) (PIA-PEG-PHIS) for use as
   an anticancer drug carrier. The product was found to form homogeneous
   and spherical micelles in aqueous media due to its amphiphilic nature
   measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) imaging. In vitro drug release study demonstrated that
   doxorubicin (DOX) was released in a sustained manner in response to
   endosome pH conditions (pH 4-6) while inhibited at normal physiological
   pH. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide MTT
   assays demonstrated that PIA-PEG-PHIS were nontoxic and biocompatible.
   These favorable properties suggested PIA-PEG-PHIS micelles have great
   potential for targeted cancer chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer-related direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) is controversial

   Drawing from the Structural Influence Model of Communication, this study
   explores communication inequalities in DTCA exposure across social
   determinants among a population-based sample of 2013 patients diagnosed
   with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Three survey items
   assessed patients' frequency of encountering ads concerning treatment
   alternatives for cancer, dealing with side effects of treatment, and
   doctors or hospitals offering services for cancer following their
   diagnosis. The analysis showed that overall exposure to DTCA in this
   study population was modest (median was once per week). Breast cancer
   patients reported significantly higher exposure to all three ad
   categories and overall DTCA exposure than prostate and colorectal cancer
   patients. Older patients consistently reported lower overall exposure to
   DTCA across the three cancer types. Other significant correlates
   included ethnicity (higher exposures among African American prostate
   cancer patients vs. White; lower exposures in Hispanic colorectal cancer
   patients vs. White) and cancer stage (higher exposures in Stage IV
   prostate cancer patients vs. Stages 0-II). Education level did not
   predict patients' DTCA exposure. The implications of these observed
   inequalities in DTCA exposure on cancer outcomes are discussed.}},

   The moth orchid (Phalaenopsis species) is an ornamental crop that is
   highly commercialized worldwide. Over 30,000 cultivars of moth orchids
   have been registered at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). These
   cultivars were obtained by artificial pollination of interspecific

   expressed sequence tag (EST)simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. After
   de novo assembly, the obtained sequence covered 29.1 Mb, approximately
   2.2\% of the P. aphrodite subsp. formosana genome (1,300 Mb), and a
   total of 1,439 EST-SSR loci were detected. SSR occurs in the exon
   region, including the 5' untranslated region (UTR), coding region (CDS),
   and 3'UTR, on average every 20.22 kb. The di- and tri-nucleotide motifs
   (51.49\% and 35.23\%, respectively) were the two most frequent motifs in
   the P. aphrodite subsp. formosana. To validate the developed EST-SSR
   loci and to evaluate the transferability to the genus Phalaenopsis,
   thirty trinucleotide motifs of the EST-SSR loci were randomly selected
   to design EST-SSR primers and to evaluate the polymorphism and
   transferability across 22 native Phalaenopsis species that are usually
   used as parents for moth orchid breeding. Of the 30 EST-SSR loci, ten
   polymorphic and transferable SSR loci across the 22 native taxa can be
   obtained. The validated EST-SSR markers were further proven to
   discriminate 12 closely related Phalaenopsis cultivars. The results show
   that it is not difficult to obtain universal SSR markers by
   transcriptome deep sequencing in Phalaenopsis species.
   Conclusions
   This study supported that transcriptome analysis based on deep
   sequencing is a powerful tool to develop SSR loci in non-model species.
   A large number of EST-SSR loci can be isolated, and about 33.33\%
   EST-SSR loci are universal markers across the Phalaenopsis breeding
   germplasm after preliminary validation. The potential universal EST-SSR
   markers are highly valuable for identifying all of Phalaenopsis
   cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty analysis has become the standard approach to hydrological
   modelling, but has yet to be effectively used in practical water
   resources assessment. This study of the Great Ruaha River basin in
   Tanzania is based on the use of regional estimates of mean runoff,
   groundwater recharge and three flow points on flow duration curves
   (FDCs) to constrain ensemble outputs from the Pitman monthly model using
   Monte Carlo parameter sampling. The constraint bounds were quantified
   from gauged data available for 26 sub-basins together with assumptions
   about the spatial variations in hydrological response using limited
   physical sub-basin property and climate data. The results are
   encouraging in that the simulated FDC ranges bracket the observed curves
   at two gauging stations downstream of many ungauged sub-basins that are
   important sites for water resources development decision making. Further
   work is required to refine the constraint bounds, the input parameter
   sets and climate data and achieve a more robust model of the basin.}},

Abstract = {{A polycross is the pollination by natural hybridization of a group of
   genotypes, generally selected, grown in isolation from other compatible
   genotypes in such a way to promote random open pollination. A particular
   practical application of the polycross method occurs in the production
   of a synthetic variety resulting from cross-pollinated plants. Laying
   out these experiments in appropriate designs, known as polycross
   designs, would not only save experimental resources but also gather more
   information from the experiment. Different situations may arise in
   polycross nurseries where accordingly different polycross designs may be
   used. For situations in which some genotypes interfere in the growth or
   production of other genotypes, but have to be grown together,
   neighbour-restricted design is a better option. Furthermore, when the
   topography of the nursery is such that a known wind system in a certain
   direction may prevail, then designs balanced for neighbour effects of
   genotypes only in the direction of wind are appropriate which may help
   in saving experimental resources to a great extent. Also, when genotypes
   are planted in a small area without leaving much space between rows,
   designs balanced for neighbour effects from all possible eight
   directions are useful to have equal chance of pollinating and being
   pollinated by every other genotype. Here, polycross designs have been
   obtained to match above-mentioned three situations. SAS Macros have also
   been developed to generate these proposed designs.}},

Abstract = {{We have imaged optically the spatial distributions of ferroelectricity
   and piezoelectricity at the diffraction limit. Contributions to the
   birefringence from electro-optics - linked to ferroelectricity as well
   as strain - arising from converse piezoelectric effects-have been
   recorded simultaneously in a BaTiO3 thin film. The concurrent recording
   of electro-optic and piezo-optic mappings revealed that, far from the
   ideal uniformity, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric responses were
   strikingly inhomogeneous, exhibiting significant fluctuations over the
   scale of the micrometer. The optical methods here described are
   appropriate to study the variations of these properties simultaneously,
   which are of great relevance when ferroelectrics are downscaled to small
   sizes for applications in data storage and processing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The management of liver receivers requires intense
   immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil
   (MMF) is a common immunosuppressant but frequently suffer dose reduction
   for gastrointestinal adverse reactions (GI). Hence, the enteric-coated
   mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is introduced as a substitute for MMF to
   reduce GI. The study was designed to investigate the efficacy, safety
   and exposure equation of EC-MPS in liver transplant patients in
   China.Methods: Ninety-two liver receivers who administered EC-MPS or MMF
   as a primary immunosuppressant were enrolled in this single-center study
   and divided into MMF group and EC-MPC group, respectively. Efficacy and
   safety of EC-MPS were compared with MMF. The MPA exposure was measured
   at time 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12h after mean 4.5 days of EC-MPS
   treatment. An equation of limited time points for estimating serum MPA
   exposure of EC-MPS was established using multiple stepwise regression
   model.Results: Data show an interpatient variation in MPA AUC, C-max and
   T-max. After a first dose of EC-MPS, the mean value of serum AUC(0-12h)
   was 20.68 mg/L (SD 8.94, range 8.1-46.3). C-max was 9.7 mg/L (SD 6.48,
   range 2.7-16.3); T-max was 1.90h (SD 0.97, range 0.5-4). The best
   equation for estimating the AUC was 6.0 1
   4+0.946C(2)+0.606C(3)+1.154C(4)+2.479C(6)+5.07C(12). Comparing with MMF,
   EC-MPS not only effectively maintained immunosuppression, but also had
   similar incidences of infection, renal dysfunction and hematological
   disorders. However, EC-MPS markedly improved GI, the incidence of GI was
   half of the MMF group.Conclusion: This analysis presented that EC-MPS is
   an effective and safe immunosuppressant as similar as MMF. The
   conversion of MMF to EC-MPS could be administered.}},

Abstract = {{The decision to preserve the uterus in a young nulliparous woman with an
   extremely rare tumor is challenging. Uterine tumor resembling ovarian
   sex cord-like tumor (UTROSCT) belongs to the rarest uterine pathologies.
   A 22-year-old nulligravida with uterine bleeding underwent a
   hysteroscopic resection of an intrauterine mass presumed as grade-1
   submucous myoma. According to the presence of sex cord-like
   differentiation and positivity for calretinin, CD99, estrogen receptor,
   vimentin, WT1 and Melan-A, the tumor was diagnosed as UTROSCT. After 28
   months, without any adjuvant therapy, the patient is still free of
   recurrence. This is the youngest patient with UTROSCT reported so far,
   with the longest follow-up among all five cases treated via
   hysteroscopy. Although UTROSCT has been traditionally treated with
   hysterectomy (with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy), no
   established treatment protocol for UTROSCT exists. UTROSCT shows a
   low-malignant potential, but metastasizing and recurrent cases occur. In
   light of the probably less aggressive tumor biology and with respect to
   the patient's autonomy, a conservative, uterus preserving treatment
   appears to be justified in selected cases in which close follow-up can
   be guaranteed. Further case reports are needed to prove the safety of
   organ-preserving strategy in UTROSCT.}},

Abstract = {{Stimuli were presented in which values of an outcome variable for a
   single individual were recorded over 24 time periods, and an
   intervention was introduced at one of the time periods. Participants
   judged whether and how much the intervention affected the outcome.
   Judgements were affected by manipulations of the temporal relation
   between the intervention and a gradual increase in values on the outcome
   variable, by the size of the increase, by the time taken for the
   increase to occur, and by variance in the preincrease data. Most results
   were predicted by a simple model in which the mean outcome value for the
   preintervention time periods is subtracted from the mean outcome value
   for the postintervention time periods, though there was also an effect
   of temporal contiguity that is not predicted by the simple model. This
   form of information, which is a kind of quasiexperimental design, is
   more representative of the kind of information generally available for
   causal judgement than the more commonly investigated binary variables in
   which the cause is either present or absent, and the outcome either
   occurs or does not; as such, it is more revealing of how causal
   judgements are made under the conditions that prevail in the world.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the situation where measurements are taken at two different
   times and let M-j(x) be some conditional robust measure of location
   associated with the random variable Y at time j, given that some
   covariate X=x. The goal is to test H-0: M-1(x)=M-2(x) for each x is an
   element of x(1), horizontal ellipsis , x(K) such that the probability of
   one or more Type I errors is less than alpha, where x(1), horizontal
   ellipsis , x(K) are K specified values of the covariate. The paper
   reports simulation results comparing two methods aimed at accomplishing
   this goal without specifying some parametric form for the regression
   line. The first method is based on a simple modification of the method
   in Wilcox {[}Introduction to robust estimation and hypothesis testing.
   3rd ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press; 2012, Section 11.11.1]. The main
   result here is that the second method, which has never been studied, can
   have higher power, sometimes substantially so. Data from the Well
   Elderly 2 study, which motivated this paper, are used to illustrate that
   the alternative approach can make a practical difference. Here, the
   estimate of M-j(x) is based in part on either a 20\% trimmed mean or the
   Harrell-Davis quantile estimator, but in principle the more successful
   method can be used with any robust location estimator.}},

Abstract = {{Transferrin (Tf) is a glycosylated protein responsible for transporting
   iron. Various sialylation levels of Tf are observed during physiological
   and pathological processes. We studied if the changes in iron stores as
   well as tobacco smoke may have an impact on foetal development and in
   consequence lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the third
   trimester of pregnancy, lower levels of 4-sialoTf isoform and higher
   levels of 5-sialoTf were observed in the serum of non-smoking women with
   IUGR in comparison to the control group. On the day of labour, level of
   2-sialoTf was significantly lower and level of 3-sialo was Tf higher in
   the serum of non-smoking women. Level of 4-sialo was found lower in the
   serum of smoking women with IUGR than in the control group. The observed
   changes may suggest a connection between iron stores, transport of iron
   to the foetus and foetal development.}},

Title = {{Role of competition between polarity sites in establishing a unique
   front}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Polarity establishment in many cells is thought to occur via positive
   feedback that reinforces even tiny asymmetries in polarity protein
   distribution. Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in
   a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell. Positive
   feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic
   fluctuations, but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations,
   how do cells ensure that they make only one front? In polarizing cells
   of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, positive feedback can
   trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time, but this
   multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state, which
   then promotes bud emergence. By manipulating polarity protein dynamics,
   we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a
   greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity
   proteins from a shared intracellular pool.}},

Journal = {{MABS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1072-1083}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{The Fc (fragment crystallizable) is a common structural region in
   immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) proteins, IgG-based multi-specific platforms,
   and Fc-fusion platform technologies. Changes in conformational
   stability, protein-protein interactions, and aggregation of NS0-produced
   human Fc1 were quantified experimentally as a function of pH (4 to 6)
   and temperature (30 to 77 degrees C), using a combination of
   differential scanning calorimetry, laser light scattering,
   size-exclusion chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis. The Fc1
   was O-glycosylated at position 3 (threonine), and confirmed to
   correspond to the intact IgG1 by comparison with Fc1 produced by
   cleavage of the parent IgG1. Changing the pH caused large effects for
   thermal unfolding transitions, but it caused surprisingly smaller
   effects for electrostatic protein-protein interactions. The aggregation
   behavior was qualitatively similar across different solution conditions,
   with soluble dimers and larger oligomers formed in most cases.
   Aggregation rates spanned approximately 5 orders of magnitude and could
   be divided into 2 regimes: (i) Arrhenius, unfolding-limited aggregation
   at temperatures near or above the midpoint-unfolding temperature of the
   C(H)2 domain; (ii) a non-Arrhenius regime at lower temperatures,
   presumably as a result of the temperature dependence of the unfolding
   enthalpy for the C(H)2 domain. The non-Arrhenius regime was most
   pronounced for lower temperatures. Together with the weak
   protein-protein repulsions, these highlight challenges that are expected
   for maintaining long-term stability of biotechnology products that are
   based on human Fc constructs.}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the total selenium (Se) content and species of Se in

   samples with different land-use purposes were collected, and the
   concentrations of total Se, water-soluble Se, exchangeable Se,
   acid-soluble Se, organic-bound Se and residual Se and the physical and
   chemical properties of these soils were investigated. The total Se
   content ranged between 0.31 and 7.65mgkg(-1) (dry weight). The
   concentrations of water-soluble, exchangeable, acid-soluble,
   organic-bound and residual forms of Se were 7.71-26.8gkg(-1),
   24.7-93.3gkg(-1), 112-1430gkg(-1), 26-765gkg(-1) and 1300-5330gkg(-1),
   respectively. The concentrations of total Se were positively correlated
   with the contents of clay and soil organic matter, but were negatively
   correlated with pH values. The contents of bioavailable Se, which
   consists of water-soluble Se and exchangeable Se, were negatively
   correlated with the contents of soil organic matter, but positively
   correlated with pH values. The results suggest that pH value and the
   content of organic matter are key factors that regulate the
   bioavailability of Se in soils of Dashan Region.}},

   estimated using the equation was in a range between about a half and

Pages = {{1111-1127}},

Abstract = {{The question of why some authoritarian regimes choose to incorporate
   institutions of democracy such as village elections into their governing
   systems remains largely unanswered. As a typical case of a resilient
   authoritarian state that implements democracy in its villages, China has
   provided an invaluable case for researchers to study. Current theories
   focus on the influence of political elites and rural forces separately.
   Insightful as they are, these theories are invalid as an explanation of
   the variation of local governance in China across time and thus are
   incomplete. It should be recognized that central fiscal strategies have
   great effects on local governance. Specifically, if the central
   government largely relies upon fiscal revenue from rural areas, it has
   to expand its bureaucracy to the countryside to extract revenue. In
   contrast, if it does not rely on the rural areas for revenue, the
   central government will establish local democracy in the countryside.
   This hypothesis is historically reflected in the authoritarian regimes
   led by the Nationalist Party (KMT) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in
   China. As opposed to the familiar story about representation through
   taxation, the logic of representation without taxation seems to be the

Abstract = {{The nitrogen content of waste water generated by the thin film
   transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) industry is not
   satisfactorily removed through the conventional aerobic-activated sludge
   process. In this study, the performance of three reactors - suspended
   type TiO2 membrane photoreactor (MPR), anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor
   (AOMBR), and their combination (MPR-AOMBR) - was evaluated using
   feedwater containing TFT-LCD discharge. The parameters that maximized
   monoethanolamine (MEA) removal in the MPR were continuous ultraviolet
   (UV) irradiation and pH 11. Among the tested loadings, 0.1g/l of TiO2
   promoted MEA removal but degradation rate may further increase with
   photocatalyst concentration. The nitrified sludge recycle ratio R of the
   AOMBR was adjusted to 1.5 to minimize the amount of nitrate in the
   effluent. The AOMBR greatly decreased chemical oxygen demand and MEA,
   but removed only 32.7\% of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The
   MPR was configured as the pre-treatment unit for AOMBR, and the combined
   MPR-AOMBR has improved TMAH removal by 80.1\%. The MPR bolstered
   performance by decomposing slowly biodegradable compounds, and had no
   negative effects on denitrification and carbon removal.}},

Abstract = {{The railway sector in China has undergone several major rounds of reform
   and institutional restructuring since 1986. These reform initiatives
   have largely been unsuccessful due to strong resistance from vested

   some challenging issues that include the centralization of power in the
   Ministry of Railways (MOR), state monopoly control, rampant corruption
   and the accumulation of a huge debt burden. The 2013 railway reform
   initiatives have provided very little in the way of concrete measures to
   deal with these thorny issues but have instead created more controversy
   and problems in an already crisis-ridden sector. For the railway
   industry, the transformation from the mixed-function MOR to a
   monopolistic China Railway Corporation (CRC) will not necessarily lead
   to better railway management.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The article studies the effects of universal design measures in public
   transport. It is based on an evaluation conducted by the authors in
   2010-2012 - a before and after study of measures partfunded by a
   Norwegian government funding program for improved accessibility in six
   different cities. The article employs a two-pronged empirical approach;
   quantitative surveys of all passengers on the affected routes
   (supplemented by interviews with drivers and personnel), and qualitative
   case studies with individual public transport users with disabilities.
   The first part of the article describes how universal design measures
   are perceived by and affect passengers in general, and discuss whether
   such measures may lead to an increase in the number of passengers. The
   second part considers how such measures influence the experience of
   travelling for passengers with disabilities, and what it takes for
   disabled passengers to be able to use public transport on par with other
   citizens. We conclude that previous surveys, which have not included
   control cases and questions, have probably overestimated passenger
   effects of universal design measures, as the results are affected by
   demographic factors. We still find that the measures have a positive
   impact on patronage. Like earlier studies, we find that the majority of
   respondents having trouble using public transport, report that this is
   due to bringing a pram or heavy luggage. We hypothesize that positive
   effects on passenger numbers due to reduced expulsion, (i.e. that
   certain groups are able to continue using public transport for a longer
   period when it is universally designed) may mean that effects on
   passenger numbers can increase over time. We find that in terms of
   social economics, universal design is profitable even with fairly low
   passenger numbers. The case studies demonstrate that although universal
   design measures contribute to enabling persons with disabilities to use
   public transport, such measures should be analyzed as parts of a
   transport system, not separately. The various elements of the system,
   including the people employed in it, must continuously work together to
   maintain universality. This goes for maintenance as well as for services
   provided by drivers. To secure mobility for people with disabilities, it
   is also essential that the systemis predictable and that accessibility
   is from door-to-door, not only from bus-stop to bus-stop. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A simple and reproducible surgical technique for gluteal shaping and
   augmentation with autologous fat is needed.
   The authors describe a novel approach to large-volume gluteal
   augmentation that combines power-assisted liposculpting and fat
   harvesting of the zones around the buttock with autologous fat transfer.
   One hundred ten patients who underwent gluteal augmentation were
   evaluated in a prospective study. Liposculpting and fat harvesting were
   performed with power-assisted liposuction. Fat then was transferred to
   the gluteal region with simultaneous power-assisted vibration and
   tunnelization. A questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction was
   administered at 6 months postoperatively.
   The mean body mass index of the patients was 30 kg/m(2) (range, 26-36
   kg/m(2)). Liposuction volumes ranged from 1400 to 5000 mL, and injection
   volumes ranged from 300 to 900 mL per side for each session. Operating
   times ranged from 60 to 120 minutes. Patients were monitored for an
   average of 20 months (range 12-48 months). Complications included a
   burning sensation in 5 of 110 patients (4.5\%), persistent swelling in
   the lower back in 3 patients (2.7\%), and a mild infection in 1 patient
   (0.9\%).
   Power-assisted gluteal augmentation with autologous fat is an efficient,
   safe, and reproducible procedure that produces an aesthetically pleasing
   gluteal projection and contour.}},

Abstract = {{A facile synthesis approach was successfully used for the fabrication of
   Ag/SiO2 (nanofibers, NFs and nanoparticles, NPs) composite using a
   simple hydrothermal plasma method with the aid of stabilizing function
   and reducing agent of triethoxyvinylsilane (C8H18O3Si) and black carbon
   powder, respectively. The new synthesis approach proposed in this study
   will provide new insights towards the manufacturing of advanced
   nanocomposite materials with a wide range of properties and industrial
   applications. In this approach, AgNO3 was first adsorbed on the surfaces
   of silica via an electrostatic attraction between the silanol groups and
   Ag+ cations and NO anions. The adsorbed compounds at silica crystals
   were then reduced and protected by a mixture of carbon CO and H-2, at
   500 and 650 degrees C for 20 min to enhance the reduction of silver
   nitrate to silver metal and finally obtain Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite. FESEM
   images revealed the formation of NFs having a uniform distribution and
   strictly straight morphology with 60-90 nm diameter and up to ca. 40 mu
   m length at 500 degrees C. By increasing the treatment temperature to
   650 degrees C, well defined-NPs ranging from 23 to 26 nm were obtained.
   Our study suggests that the as-synthesized Ag/SiO2 nanocomposites with
   special morphological properties can be used for a variety of industrial
   applications including, catalysis, Raman spectroscopy and life science.

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to extract and bleach cellulose from a
   low-value agricultural waste, namely, olive tree branches. The
   extraction procedure began by subjecting finely powdered olive tree
   branches to alkaline treatment, using different concentrations of sodium
   hydroxide solution to remove/dissolve the non-cellulosic cementing
   constituents, such as pectin, hemicelluloses, and natural waxes from the
   structure of this lignocellulosic network. The second step of the
   extraction procedure was the oxidation/bleaching treatment, and for this
   purpose, a powerful oxidizing agent composed of sodium
   chlorite/triethanolamine salt was used. All factors and conditions
   affecting the bleaching reaction, including triethanolamine salt
   concentration, bleaching temperature, and utilization of different
   triethanolamine salts, were extensively studied. The efficiency of the
   bleaching/oxidation treatment was evaluated by recording the FTIR
   spectra of the samples before and after extraction and analyzing the
   bleached samples to estimate the carboxyl content, loss in weight, and
   whiteness index.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the protective role of curcumin (Curc)
   against hematological and biochemical changes, as well as renal
   pathologies induced by lead acetate {[}Pb (CH3COO)(2)center dot 3H2O]
   treatment. Male albino rats were intraperitoneally treated with Pb2+ (25
   mg of lead acetate/kg b.w., once a day) alone or in combination with
   Curc (30 mg of Curc/kg b.w., twice a day) for 7 days. Exposure of rats
   to Pb2+ caused significant decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) content,
   hematocrit (Ht) value, and platelet (Plt) count, while Pb2+-related
   leukocytosis was accompanied by absolute neutrophilia, monocytosis,
   lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. A significant rise in lipid peroxidation
   (LPO) and a marked drop of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were evident
   in the kidney, liver, and serum of Pb2+ group compared to that of
   control. Furthermore, significantly high levels of total cholesterol
   (TC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (LDL-C), and a sharp drop in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C)
   level were also seen in blood after injection of Pb2+. Additionally,
   hepatorenal function tests were enhanced. Meanwhile, Pb2+ produced
   marked histo-cytological alterations in the renal cortex.
   Co-administration of Curc to the Pb2+-treated animals restored most of
   the parameters mentioned above to near-normal levels/features. In
   conclusion, Curc appeared to be a promising agent for protection against

Abstract = {{Objective: To clinically evaluate the pain intensity during the week
   following initial placement of three different orthodontic aligning
   archwires.
   Materials and Methods: A consecutive sample of 75 patients requiring
   upper and lower fixed orthodontic appliances were alternately allocated
   into three different archwires (0.014-inch superelastic NiTi, 0.014-inch
   thermoelastic NiTi or 0.014-inch conventional NiTi). Assessments of
   pain/discomfort were made on a daily basis over the first 7-day period
   after bonding by means of visual analog scale and consumption of
   analgesics. The maximum pain score was recorded. The possible
   associations between age, gender, degree of crowding, and teeth
   irregularity and the pain intensity were also examined. Demographic and
   clinical differences between the three groups were compared with
   chi-square test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.
   Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the pain
   intensity when the three aligning NiTi archwires were compared (P =
   .63). No significant differences in pain perception were found in terms
   of gender, age, lower arch crowding, and incisor irregularity. The
   intake of analgesics was the least in the superelastic NiTi group.
   Conclusions: The three forms of NiTi wires were similar in terms of pain
   intensity during the initial aligning stage of orthodontic fixed
   appliance therapy. Gender, age, and the degree of crowding have no
   effect on the perceived discomfort experienced by patients undergoing
   fixed orthodontic treatment.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveDiagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis using fine-needle
   aspiration cytology is a simple and safe but low-specificity method,
   whereas conventional smear microscopy has variable sensitivity due to
   low bacterial load. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of
   fluorescent light-emitting diode (LED) microscopy on routinely collected
   fine-needle aspirates from tuberculous lymphadenitis presumptive cases.
   MethodsFine-needle aspirates were collected from patients clinically
   suspected of having tuberculous lymphadenitis as part of routine
   diagnosis. Smear preparation was performed from the aspirate and
   processed for cytology, conventional Ziehl-Neelsen and LED microscopy.
   The remaining aspirate was processed for culture on Lowenstein-Jensen
   media. Capilia TB-Neo test was used to differentiate M.tuberculosis
   complex from non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
   ResultA total of 144 tuberculous lymphadenitis presumptive cases were
   included. 66.7\% (96/144) were positive for M. tuberculosis complex on
   culture. Only one isolate was identified as non-tuberculous
   mycobacteria. The detection rates of Ziehl-Neelsen and LED microscopy
   were 18.8\% (27/144) and 34\% (49/144), respectively. As compared to
   culture, sensitivity was 25.0\% {[}95\% CI: 16.3-33.7] for Ziehl-Neelsen
   microscopy and 45.8\% {[}95\% CI: 35.9-55.8] for LED microscopy. The
   specificity was 93.8\% {[}95\% CI: 86.9-100] for Ziehl-Neelsen
   microscopy and 89.6\% {[}95\% CI: 80.9-98.2] for LED microscopy. LED
   microscopy showed a statistically significant increase in sensitivity
   and similar specificity compared to Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy. Mean
   reading time of positive slides was 2.62min/slide for Ziehl-Neelsen and
   1.60min/slide for LED microscopy. Cytology showed sensitivity of 82.3\%
   and specificity of 54.2\%. LED microscopy detected TB bacilli in 33.3\%
   of cases cytologically classified as suppurative abscess.
   ConclusionThe LED microscopy for tuberculous lymphadenitis had
   significantly higher sensitivity and shorter screening time than
   Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy. Use of LED microscopy among cases classified
   as suppurative abscess on fine-needle aspirate cytology improves
   evidence-based diagnosis of presumptive tuberculous lymphadenitis cases.
   Moreover, LED microscopy could be considered as an alternative approach
   in settings where fine-needle aspirate cytology is impractical.}},

Abstract = {{Generally reservoir simulation results show considerable distance from
   actual behavior of system which is mainly due to poor initial estimates
   of model parameters. The problem of improving the property estimates
   using reservoir observations is called history matching which is an
   essential and inseparable part of reservoir studies. In recent years a
   promising tool from control engineering called ensemble filtering is
   used in history matching problems which could be used to quantify the
   uncertainty in predictions.
   This paper focuses on comparison of traditional ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF) and a relatively new form of ensemble filters called finite size
   ensemble transform Kalman filter on a small size benchmark model. This
   study tries to estimate the porosity and permeability fields by
   assimilating production data in 13 time steps. A weighting approach is
   used as modification to filter procedure. The results show traditional
   ensemble Kalman filter with localization has a better performance in a
   problem with a small ensemble but this superiority comes with more
   computational cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Two types of source/drain (S/D) electrodes, formed of
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): p-toluenesulfonate (PEDOT:PTS)
   conducting polymer and Au, were fabricated and mounted on flexible
   pentacene transistors. Several properties of the S/D electrodes were
   investigated: the adhesion between electrode and pentacene, the failure
   induced by mechanical bending, the electrical properties including
   contact resistance, and the field-effect mobility. The measurement of
   adhesive force using a 90 degrees peel tester revealed that the adhesive
   force of the pentacene-PEDOT:PTS interface was 200 N/m, while that of
   Au-pentacene was too small to be measured. The poor adhesion between the
   Au and pentacene led to the local delamination of the Au film, starting
   at a strain of approximately 1\% and with a rapid increase of
   delamination density with increasing strain. The strain-induced
   mechanical damage has a direct effect on contact resistance, which in
   turn degrades mobility. In contrast, no delamination is observed with
   the high adhesive force at the pentacene-PEDOT: PTS interface, which
   thus led to a slight increase of contact resistance and mobility with
   strain. Consequently, the pentacene-PEDOT: PTS contacts provide

Abstract = {{The present study evaluated the anti-oxidative activity of Hibiscus
   callus anthocyanins (HCA) by measuring their effects on lipid
   peroxidation inhibition capacity. HCA have been tested in vitro
   examining their TBARS and the antiradical activity was estimated by the
   ability of HCA to scavenge the DPPH center dot. The anti-oxidative
   activity of HCA was defined by TBARS assay (IC50) in the Fe(2(+)) and
   Cu(2(+))-mediated oxidize lipids. Six anthocyanins were determined in
   Roselle callus. The most prominent anthocyanin was Cya-3sam followed by
   Dp-3sam, Mv-3gluc and Dp-3gluc. Cya-3gluc and Pt-3gluc were the lowest
   anthocyanins. HCA showed strong potential in inhibiting lipid
   peroxidation. A high correlation between the number of glycoside, the
   number of hydroxyl and, radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of
   HCA was found. Thus, HCA classified as antioxidants are able to inhibit
   lipid peroxidation by scavenging free radicals: Dp-3sam > Cya-3sam >
   Dp-3gluc > Cya-3gluc. It can be concluded that HCA could be a potential
   source of antioxidant compounds.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAs a step towards clinical cardiac xenotransplantation, our
   experimental heterotopic intrathoracic xenotransplantation model offers
   a beating and ejecting donor heart while retaining the recipients native
   organ as a backup in case of graft failure. Clinically applicable
   immunosuppressive regimens (IS) were investigated first, then treatments
   known to be effective in hypersensitized patients or those with
   recalcitrant rejection reactions.
   MethodsConsecutive experiments were carried out between 2009 and 2013.
   Twenty-one genetically modified pigs (GGTA1-knockout/hCD46/
   thrombomodulin, in one case HLA-E instead) were used as donors. In all
   experiments, two cycles of immunoabsorption reduced preformed
   antibodies. Recipient baboons were divided into two groups according to
   IS regimen: In group one (n = 10), pre-treatment started either one
   (anti-CD20) or four weeks (anti-CD20 plus the proteasome inhibitor
   bortezomib) prior to transplantation. The extended conventional (as for
   allotransplantation) immunosuppressive maintenance regimen included
   anti-thymocyte globuline, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil,
   methylprednisolone and weekly anti-CD20. In group two (n = 11),
   myeloablative pre-treatment as in multiple myeloma patients (long and
   short regimens) was added to extended conventional IS; postoperative
   total thoracic and abdominal lymphoid irradiation (TLI; single dose of
   600 cGY) was used to further reduce antibody-producing cells.
   ResultsIn the perioperative course, the surgical technique was safely
   applied: 19 baboons were weaned off extracorporeal circulation and 17
   extubated. Nine animals were lost in the early postoperative course due
   to causes unrelated to surgical technique or IS regimen. Excluding these
   early failures, median graft survival times of group 1 and 2 were 18.5
   (12-50) days and 16 (7-35) days. Necropsy examination of group 1 donor
   organs revealed hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall in the six
   longer-lasting grafts; myocardial histology confirmed pre-clinical
   suspicion of humoral rejection, which was not inhibited by the extended
   conventional IS including intensified treatments, and signs of
   thrombotic microangiopathy. Grafts of group 2 presented with only
   mild-to-moderate features of humoral rejection and thrombotic
   microangiopathy, except in one case of delayed rejection on day 17. The
   other experiments in this group were terminated because of untreatable
   pulmonary oedema, recurring ventricular fibrillation, Aspergillus
   sepsis, as well as a combination of a large donor organ and late toxic
   side effects due to TLI.
   ConclusionsLonger-term results were difficult to achieve in this model
   due to the IS regimens used. However, we conclude that heterotopic
   intrathoracic heart transplantation may be an option for clinical
   xenotransplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Humans communicate using language, but they also communicate using
   gesture - spontaneous movements of the hands and body that universally

   Moreover, gestures systematically integrate with language at all levels
   of linguistic structure, as evidenced in both production and perception.
   Viewed typologically, gesture is universal, but nevertheless exhibits
   constrained variation across language communities (as does language
   itself). Finally, gesture has rich cognitive dimensions in addition to
   its communicative dimensions. In overviewing these and other topics, we
   show that the study of language is incomplete without the study of its
   communicative partner, gesture.}},

Abstract = {{IgG4-related disease is a systemic chronic inflammatory disorder
   characterized by a high blood level of IgG4 and the organ injuries by
   marked infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis. A
   71-year-old male was hospitalized for a cough, malaise and anorexia.
   IgG4-related disease was suspected due to marked elevation of the serum
   IgG4 level. However, on lung biopsy, only eosinophil infiltration was
   demonstrated with no plasma cell infiltration. Otherwise abdominal
   contrast-enhanced CT showed mild enlargement of the bilateral kidneys
   and many differed contrasted areas and FDG PET-CT. Moreover, renal
   biopsy specimens showed typical tubulointerstitial nephritis with a
   large number of IgG4-positive plasma cells infiltration (the
   IgG4/IgG-positive cell rate, 89 \%) and fibrosis. We diagnosed this
   patient as typical IgG4-related kidney disease. He was treated by the
   moderate dose of prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day) alone, and showed prompt
   response in the clinical condition, and both the lung and kidney
   lesions. In this case, it was useful for diagnosis of IgG4-related
   diseases to evaluate an image such as abdominal contrast-enhanced CT and

Title = {{Inflammatory Cytokines and Matrix Metalloproteinases in the Synovial
   Fluid After Intra-articular Ankle Fracture}},
Journal = {{FOOT \& ANKLE INTERNATIONAL}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) can occur after
   intra-articular fracture despite anatomic fracture reduction. It has
   been hypothesized that an early inflammatory response after
   intra-articular injury could lead to irreversible cartilage damage that
   progresses to PTOA. Therefore, in addition to meticulous fracture
   reduction, it would be ideal to prevent this initial inflammatory
   response but little is known about the composition of the synovial
   environment after intra-articular fracture. The purpose of this work was
   to characterize the inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP) composition in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with acute
   intra-articular ankle fractures.
   Methods: Twenty-one patients with an intra-articular ankle fracture were
   included in this study. All patients had a contralateral ankle joint
   that was pain free, had no radiographic evidence of arthritis, and no
   history of trauma. The uninjured ankle served as a matched control. SF
   was obtained from bilateral ankles at the time of surgery which occurred
   at a mean of 17 days post-fracture (range 8-40). The SF was analyzed for
   granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
   interferon-gamma (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin
   (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9,
   MMP-10, CTXII, sGAG, and bilirubin/biliverdin (markers of hemearthrosis)
   using either multiplex assay or ELISA using commercially available kits.
   Mean concentrations of each factor were compared between SF from
   fractured and control ankles, and correlation analysis was done to
   determine potential relationships between levels of cytokines and time
   from fracture and age at fracture.
   Results: Twelve of 18 measured factors including GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-1,
   IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, and
   bilirubin/biliverdin were found to be significantly higher in the
   fractured ankles. Mean concentrations of ECM degradation markers (sGAG
   and CTXII) were not found to be significatnly different between groups.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that after intra-articular ankle
   fracture the SF exhibits a largely pro-inflammatory and extra-cellular
   matrix degrading environment similar to that described in idiopathic
   osteoarthritis. IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-10 were
   significantly elevated and may play a role in the development of PTOA.
   Clinical Relevance: In addition to anatomic fracture reduction, these
   data lend credence to reducing acute intra-articular inflammation
   through the development of antagonists to these pro-inflammatory and
   degrading mediators. Likewise, intra-articular lavage might reduce this
   inflammatory burden.}},

Abstract = {{The conditional intensity function of a space-time branching model is
   defined by the sum of two main components: the longrun term intensity
   and short-run term one. Their simultaneous estimation is a complex issue
   that usually requires the use of hard computational techniques. This
   paper deals with a new mixed estimation approach for a particular
   space-time branching model, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model.
   This approach uses a simultaneous estimation of the different model
   components, alternating a parametric step for estimating the induced
   component by Maximum Likelihood and a non-parametric estimation step,
   for the background intensity, by FLP (Forward Predictive Likelihood).
   Moreover, proper graphical tools for diagnostics have been developed and
   collected, together with the used implemented code in a R package here
   introduced, named etasFLP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the role that the birth experience plays in brain
   and cognitive development. Recent research has suggested that birth
   experience influences the development of the somatosensory cortex, an
   area involved in spatial attention to sensory information. In this
   study, we explored whether differences in spatial attention would occur
   in infants who had different birth experiences, as occurs for caesarean
   versus vaginal delivery. Three-month-old infants performed either a
   spatial cueing task or a visual expectation task. We showed that
   caesarean-delivered infants' stimulus-driven, reflexive attention was
   slowed relative to vaginally delivered infants', whereas their
   cognitively driven, voluntary attention was unaffected. Thus, types of
   birth experience influence at least one form of infants' attention, and
   possibly any cognitive process that relies on spatial attention. This
   study also suggests that birth experience influences the initial state
   of brain functioning and, consequently, should be considered in our
   understanding of brain development.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean climate is expected to become warmer and drier during
   the twenty-first century. Mediterranean Sea response to climate change
   could be modulated by the choice of the socio-economic scenario as well
   as the choice of the boundary conditions mainly the Atlantic
   hydrography, the river runoff and the atmospheric fluxes. To assess and
   quantify the sensitivity of the Mediterranean Sea to the twenty-first
   century climate change, a set of numerical experiments was carried out
   with the regional ocean model NEMOMED8 set up for the Mediterranean Sea.
   The model is forced by air-sea fluxes derived from the regional climate
   model ARPEGE-Climate at a 50-km horizontal resolution. Historical
   simulations representing the climate of the period 1961-2000 were run to
   obtain a reference state. From this baseline, various sensitivity
   experiments were performed for the period 2001-2099, following different
   socio-economic scenarios based on the Special Report on Emissions
   Scenarios. For the A2 scenario, the main three boundary forcings (river
   runoff, near-Atlantic water hydrography and air-sea fluxes) were changed
   one by one to better identify the role of each forcing in the way the
   ocean responds to climate change. In two additional simulations (A1B,
   B1), the scenario is changed, allowing to quantify the socio-economic
   uncertainty. Our 6-member scenario simulations display a warming and
   saltening of the Mediterranean. For the 2070-2099 period compared to
   1961-1990, the sea surface temperature anomalies range from +1.73 to
   +2.97 A degrees C and the SSS anomalies spread from +0.48 to +0.89. In
   most of the cases, we found that the future Mediterranean thermohaline
   circulation (MTHC) tends to reach a situation similar to the eastern
   Mediterranean Transient. However, this response is varying depending on
   the chosen boundary conditions and socio-economic scenarios. Our
   numerical experiments suggest that the choice of the near-Atlantic
   surface water evolution, which is very uncertain in General Circulation
   Models, has the largest impact on the evolution of the Mediterranean
   water masses, followed by the choice of the socio-economic scenario. The
   choice of river runoff and atmospheric forcing both have a smaller
   impact. The state of the MTHC during the historical period is found to
   have a large influence on the transfer of surface anomalies toward
   depth. Besides, subsurface currents are substantially modified in the
   Ionian Sea and the Balearic region. Finally, the response of
   thermosteric sea level ranges from +34 to +49 cm (2070-2099 vs.
   1961-1990), mainly depending on the Atlantic forcing.}},

Abstract = {{The Se, Hg, and methylmercury (MeHg) levels in raw, cooked (boiled and
   grilled), and canned tuna (Thunnus spp.) were determined before and
   after an in vitro digestion, thereby enabling the calculation of the
   respective bioaccessibility percentages. A risk-benefit evaluation of
   raw and canned tuna on the basis of the Se and MeHg data was performed.
   Selenium bioaccessibility was high in tuna, though slightly lower in
   canned than in raw products. Mercury levels were high in raw and cooked
   tuna. Hg bioaccessibility percentages were low (39-48\%) in the cooked
   tuna and even lower (<20\%) in canned tuna. For the bioaccessible
   fraction, all molar Se:MeHg ratios were higher than one (between 10 and
   74). A probabilistic assessment of MeHg risk vs Se benefit showed that
   while a weekly meal of canned tuna presents very low risk, raw, boiled,
   and grilled tuna consumption should not exceed a monthly meal, at least,
   for pregnant and nursing women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) hyporesponsiveness index
   (EHRI) calculated as the weekly dose of EPO divided by weight (kg)
   divided by hemoglobin level (g/dL) has been considered useful to assess
   ESA resistance. Recent evidence suggests that active vitamin D,
   cinacalcet, and paricalcitol use may be related with lower ESA
   resistance. We conducted this observational cross-sectional study to
   investigate ESA resistance calculated by the EHRI among patients using
   calcitriol, cinacalcet, and paricalcitol. Participants underwent a
   medical history taken, physical examination, measurement of biochemical
   analysis, calculation of dialysis adequacy, and EHRI. Sixty-five
   patients did not receive any treatment regarding vitamin D,
   paricalcitol, and cinacalcet (group 1), 41 were taking only vitamin D
   (group 2), 50 were taking only paricalcitol (group 3), 19 were taking
   only cinacalcet (group 4), and 21 were taking paricalcitol+cinacalcet
   (group 5). The EHRI values for groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 11.36 +/-
   8.72, 11.58 +/- 5.72, 8.29 +/- 5.54, 9.49 +/- 4.61, and 8.91 +/- 4.44
   respectively (P=.034). Post hoc analysis showed that the EHRI differed
   between group 1 and group 3 (P=.017) and between group 2 and group 3
   (P=.006). In linear regression analysis, use of paricalcitol was
   independently associated with EHRI. In conclusion, paricalcitol use was
   associated with lower EHRI levels as a measure of ESA resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Binder jetting 3D printing is a popular type of additive manufacturing
   and a powerful tool for creating parts and prototypes. Due to continuous
   movement of dry powders inside printer chambers and injection of
   resin-like binder fluid during printing, binder jetting 3D printers are
   a potential emission source of fine particulate matters (PM) and
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, real-time measurements
   of total VOC (TVOCs) and aerosol (10 nm-10 mu m) during a 2-h continuous
   operation of a binder jetting printer were incorporated into a
   time-varying mass balance model to obtain the emission rates. The
   particle sizes between 205 and 407 nm had the highest emission rates by
   count. Time weighted average PM2.5 and PM10 and TVOC over a 24-h period
   all exceeded the USEPA ambient air quality standards. Continuous
   operation of the 3D printer led to a PM2.5 level 10 times greater than
   the standard (344 vs 35 mu g/m(3)) and a PM10 level 3 times higher than
   the standard (474 vs 150 mu g/m(3)). TVOC concentrations with a maximum
   value of 1725 mu g/m(3) exceeded upper limit concentrations recommended
   by the Environment Institute of European Commission, and USGBC-LEED.
   Ultrafine particles emitted from the binder jetting 3D printer were
   10(4)-10(5) times lower than those from typical fused deposition
   modeling (FDM) type of 3D printers using polylactic acid (PLA), but
   production of particles larger than 200 nm was significantly higher. The
   results suggest installing binder jetting 3D printers in an enclosure
   with proper ventilation for reducing the health risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming a reliable and useful instrument
   in monitoring and diagnostic services in the energy field. Operation and
   maintenance is a crucial factor for photovoltaic (PV) plant inspection
   and control activities, which currently are quite hard to be performed
   due to manual and dispersive procedures. The automation of the
   monitoring techniques will become, in future, an essential task in this
   market, and unmanned aerial system technology can play a role in it.
   This paper proposes a novel, comprehensive, and innovative approach in
   order to automate the inspection and prognostic procedure by means of
   designing a control system in order to provide accurate information on
   operating conditions of PV plants. The system is able to perform PV
   systems' monitoring, diagnosis, defects and failures reconnaissance, and
   data processing and to propose remedial actions. In the current
   experimental research, only infrared radiation sensor imaging was
   examined to evaluate thermographic behavior of the PV modules and to
   build the related image processing algorithm. However, it is possible to
   easily extend such a procedure in order to manage a larger amount of
   data. First results of this work have proven that the proposed procedure
   is very promising being fast, cost effective, and adaptable to large PV
   plants, which can be controlled during their entire lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{The well-known Huffman algorithm is an elegant approach to solve the
   basic problem of finding the optimal code among those with Kraft sums
   smaller than or equal to 1. In this paper, an extended problem is
   investigated, where the Kraft sum of the usable codes is limited to a
   given real number gamma, 0 < gamma < 1. Unlike the case gamma = 1 (i.e.,
   Huffman coding), for gamma < 1, the Kraft sum of the optimal code is not
   necessarily equal to gamma. However, we show that the Kraft sum of the
   optimal code lies in a finite set of rational numbers which depend on
   the value of gamma. This motivates us to first devise a recursive
   algorithm to obtain the optimal codelengths with Kraft sum equal to
   gamma', where gamma' has a finite binary representation and 0 < gamma' <
   1. To do so, the set of N-tuple codelength vectors with a specific Kraft
   sum gamma' is characterized. The binary representation of. plays a
   fundamental role in all problems that arise for gamma < 1.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological niche models have become very popular for analysing the
   potential distribution of species. Nevertheless, models are strongly
   influenced by many factors, such as spatial resolution, environmental
   variables and the quality of distribution records. In this paper, we
   evaluated how ecological niche models changed with the addition of
   records accumulated over four decades. Our model species was the
   stripe-headed round-eared bat (Tonatia saurophila). Thus, with data
   organized in chronological order, we could observe how the models
   changed in predicting distributions over time in comparison with all
   known point locations. We tested if partial models could predict the
   occurrence of new unpublished records for savannah areas in central
   Brazil, considering that the species is typically associated with forest
   environments. Our results indicate a high omission rate for models built
   with point localities from the 1970s and 1980s (58.5\% and 50.0\% of all
   known points respectively), and predicted that the species could occur
   in central Brazil. Although T.saurophila has indeed been recorded
   recently in central Brazil, it was found in places different from those
   predicted by the models using these restricted earlier data.
   Nevertheless, the environmental suitability of such areas is
   significantly different from sites largely described in earlier records
   from the Amazonia region, as shown by principal components analysis. We
   argue that populations of T.saurophila that occupy open habitats in
   central South America (including Caatinga, Cerrado, Chaco and
   semi-deciduous interior forests) deserve further study at the genetic
   level to determine if bats in these very different habitats are
   taxonomically distinct from Amazonian populations. Our results also
   suggest that models based on very limited datasets for species
   occurrence can lead conservationists or decision makers to wrong
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Following a request from the European Commission, an exposure assessment
   was carried out based on the maximum permitted levels (MPLs) authorised
   in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for thaumatin (E 957) and
   the proposed increase in its use level in flavoured drinks and proposed
   extension of use in several food categories at the levels proposed by
   the applicant. The safety of thaumatin as a food additive was previously
   evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1984 and 1988
   and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in
   1989. Following these assessments, thaumatin was considered acceptable
   for use, and the ADI was established as `not specified'. In these
   evaluations it was, moreover, noted that thaumatin, being a protein,
   undergoes digestion to normal food components. In providing a scientific
   opinion on the safety of the proposed extensions of use and use levels,
   the ANS Panel has decided that a comparison of the exposure resulting
   from the current uses and use levels with the exposure resulting from
   these additional proposed uses would be sufficient to address the safety
   of thaumatin. The Panel calculated that a maximum daily intake of 1.03
   mg/kg bw/day of thaumatin, resulting from the exposure assessment at the
   current proposed uses, or 1.10 mg/kg bw/day, at the proposed new Maximum
   Permitted Levels (MPLs), would represent 0.12 \% or 0.13 \%,
   respectively, of the total daily protein intake for an adult. These
   percentages would be even lower for children of all ages. The Panel
   concluded, based on the existing toxicological evaluations, that the
   proposed extension of uses and changes to use levels would result in a
   margin of safety of approximately 1 300 which would not represent a
   safety concern. (C) European Food Safety Authority, 2015}},

Title = {{Reactive transport modeling of leaking CO2-saturated brine along a

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{672-689}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One concern regarding the underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is
   its potential leakage from reservoirs. Over short period of time, the
   leakage risk is related mainly to CO2 as a separate supercritical fluid
   phase. However, over longer periods upon complete dissolution of
   injected CO2 in the fluid, the leakage risk is associated with dissolved
   phase CO2. Over the geological time scales, large-scale groundwater
   motion may cause displacement of brine containing dissolved CO2 along
   the conducting pathways. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   modeling framework that describes the reactive transport of
   CO2-saturated brine along a fracture in the clay caprock based on the
   future, hypothetical leakage of the dissolved phase CO2. This study
   shows that the transport of leaked dissolved CO2 is significantly
   retarded by a combination of various physical and geochemical processes,
   such as mass exchange between conducting fracture and the neighboring
   rock matrix through molecular diffusion, sorption and calcite
   dissolution in the rock matrix. Mass stored in aqueous and adsorbed
   states in the rock matrix caused retention of dissolved CO2 along the
   leakage pathway. Calcite dissolution reaction in the rock matrix
   resulted in consumption of leaking dissolved CO2 and reduced its mass
   along the leakage pathway. Consumption and retention of dissolved CO2

Abstract = {{An important requirement for interconnecting distributed generation is
   anti-islanding protection. This paper uses the capabilities of two
   methods, application region (AR) and power imbalance AR, to efficiently
   adjust frequency-based relays. The proposed method gives a proper simple
   and nonexpensive solution to the synchronous distributed generation
   islanding detection problem. It employs the common protection devices:
   frequency or rate of change of frequency relays. These relays are
   adjusted in order to satisfy the anti-islanding protection and safe and
   abnormal frequency variation requirements and also to discriminate
   between islanding and nonislanding disturbances. The procedure is
   applied to a real system, which is a portion of the Isfahan Regional
   Electric Network in Iran, to show the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{Recently, Andrews defined the combinatorial objects which he called
   singular overpartitions and proved that these singular overpartitions,

   function C-kappa, i(n) which gives the number of overpartitions of n in
   which no part is divisible by k and only parts equivalent to +/- i (mod
   k) may be overlined. He also proved that C-3,(1) (9n + 3) equivalent to
   C-3,C-1(9n + 6) equivalent to 0 (mod 3). Chen, Hirschhorn and Sellers
   then found infinite families of congruences modulo 3 and modulo powers

Abstract = {{Gamma radiation (100-500 kGy) induced effects on optical properties and
   single oscillator parameters of nanocrystalline diluted magnetic
   semiconductor thin films Cd1-xFexS (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) with different
   compositions prepared by electron evaporation techniques have been
   studied. The optical characterization of the films has been carried out
   from spectral transmittance and reflectance obtained by double beam
   spectrophotometer in the wavelength range from 190 to 2500 nm. It is
   clearly shown that the direct optical band gap decreases with the
   increase in gamma radiation dose. This is attributed to the defect
   number growth. The refractive index and extinction coefficient have
   shown clear changes with irradiation and found to increase with the
   increase of the doses of gamma radiation. This post-irradiation increase
   of the refractive index was interpreted in terms of the film density
   increase due to ionization and/or atomic displacements. Furthermore, the
   dispersion of the refractive index is discussed in terms of the
   Wemple-DiDomenico single oscillator model. The oscillator parameters,
   the single oscillator energy Eo, the dispersion energy E-d, the static
   refractive index no, average interband oscillator wavelength 2, and the
   average oscillator strength So, were estimated and revealed pronounced
   changes with irradiation. The observed changes in optical properties and
   single oscillator parameters clearly indicate the possibility of using
   Fe doped CdS thin films as a material for gamma radiation dosimeters (C)

Abstract = {{Soybean defoliating caterpillars are considered pests and must be
   controlled to prevent economic damages to producers. To minimize the
   harmful effects of the applied pesticides, effective techniques that
   minimize their use must be developed, such as the local application at
   the source of infestation. The objective of this work was to study the
   effects and the technical feasibility of using a localized control of
   soybean caterpillars. The experiment was conducted in the field in two
   soybean growing areas, totaling 26.44ha, in the crop years 2010/2011 and
   2011/2012. Samples were collected weekly within a sampling network of
   50x50m, recording the numbers of trapped Anticarsia gemmatalis,
   Chrysodeixis includens and Spodoptera eridania. Pesticide application
   maps were made to quantify the area infests by caterpillars, marking the
   boundaries on the ground and thereafter a localized application of
   insecticide was carried out only in areas that exceeded the threshold
   level and/or defoliation >15\%. The occurrence of a concentration of
   caterpillars in some regions of the lots, allows localized control and
   leads to an average of 57\% savings in insecticide. Caterpillars'
   control can be performed in a localized manner in areas where the
   population exceeds the control level, allowing for the maintenance of a
   defoliation percentage within the recommended levels.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of wet-dry and moist-dry cycling on the mechanical
   properties of reed (Arundo donax L.) were investigated. Because
   water-soluble extractives were lost through wetting, the reed shrunk in
   its tangential direction, and its dynamic Young's modulus and loss
   tangent decreased during wet-dry cycling. On the other hand, the reed
   swelled in its radial direction because of the recovery of cell
   collapse, which had been induced by drying from a green state.
   Consequently, the resonant frequency of the reed monotonically increased
   during wet-dry cycling, whereas no clear trend was seen in bending
   rigidity. During moist-dry cycling, the equilibrium moisture content of
   reed decreased slightly. Such a reduction in hygroscopicity was
   attributed to the aggregation of deliquescent extractives. The changes
   in the dimensions and vibrational properties of the reed specimens
   during moist-dry cycling were qualitatively similar to those during
   wet-dry cycling. These results suggest that the practical performance of
   woodwind reed changes irreversibly during continuous usage.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability has become a major concern for the construction industry.
   There has been a growing emphasis on green buildings in the last decade.
   Renovation is critical in terms of improving the energy efficiency of

   process of existing buildings in developing countries is investigated. A
   qualitative case study methodology has been employed to gain a better
   understanding of the critical success factors of the greening and
   certification process. In this respect, six leadership in energy and
   environmental design (LEED)-certified projects in Turkey are examined. A
   framework is used to analyze the components of this process, including
   the drivers, resources, green implementations, barriers, enablers,
   benefits, and impacts. Unavailability of approved materials, poor design
   of the buildings, and difficulties with the documentation process have
   been major barriers. The barriers have been overcome through the
   commitment of the owners, top management support, and collaborative
   working among project parties. The findings of this study are expected
   to guide construction professionals in certifying existing buildings in
   an effective manner. Similar studies may be conducted for existing
   buildings in different countries, where different regulations and
   conditions exist. The proposed framework can also be employed to
   investigate the certification process of new construction projects. (C)

Abstract = {{Clinical cases of babesiosis were evaluated, and the frequency of bovine
   Babesia and Theileria parasites was determined in cattle. Blood samples
   and thin blood smears were collected from 23 cattle exhibiting clinical
   signs of babesiosis. In addition, tick and blood samples were collected
   from 100 apparently healthy cattle cograzing from the same area. Egg
   masses obtained from fully engorged female ticks were included. DNA
   isolated from blood and tick samples was screened for Babesia and
   Theileria by reverse line blot assay. Piroplasms compatible with Babesia
   spp. were observed microscopically for symptomatic cattle as circular,
   oval, elongated, or pear-shaped bodies. Parasitemia ranged from 0.08 to
   0.9\% for Babesia bovis, 2.5 to 15.4\% for Babesia bigemina, and 7.4\%
   for Babesia divergens. Reverse line blot showed positivity in 13 (13\%)
   of the sampled clinically normal cattle and revealed the presence of
   three Babesia species. Babesia bovis was the most prevalent (9/100,
   9\%), followed by Babesia occultans (3/100, 3\%) and B. bigemina (1/100,
   1\%). One animal infected with B. bigemina was also infected with B.
   bovis. The single animal infected with B. divergens showed symptoms of
   babesiosis. Ticks were identified as Rhipicephalus annulatus,
   Rhipicephalus turanicus, and Ixodes ricinus. One female R. annulatus and
   its egg mass were infected with B. bigemina. Neither Theileria annulata
   nor Theileria buffeli/orientalis infections were observed in cattle or
   ticks. This is the first report of clinical babesiosis caused by B.
   divergens in cattle from Turkey.}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline deposit is a worldwide problem facing the process industry

   market nowadays for monitoring deposits but electrical capacitance
   tomography (ECT) technique in particular promises superior advantages as
   it is considered fast, compact, safe, easy to interpret, and cost
   effective. However, ECT still suffers from one disadvantage being the
   poor resolution, and thus, this paper suggests the use of ECT with
   limited region tomographic image reconstruction using a narrowbandpass
   filter to enhance the resolution of the produced images. The
   experimental results showed that different deposit regimes and fine
   deposits could be detected with high definition and high resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this experimental study was todetermine whether minimal
   levels of electromyographic activity in the masseter muscle are altered
   when individuals are in a verified hypnotic state. Experiments were
   performed on 17 volunteer subjects (8 male, 9 female) all of whom gave
   informed consent. Thesubjects were dentate and had no symptoms ofpain or
   masticatory dysfunction. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) were made from
   the masseter muscles and quantified by integration following full-wave
   rectification and averaging. The EMGs were obtained (i) with the
   mandible in resting' posture; (ii) with the mandible voluntarily lowered
   (but with the lips closed); (iii) during maximum voluntary clenching
   (MVC). The first two recordings were made before, during and after the
   subjects were in a hypnotic state. Susceptibility to hypnosis was
   assessed with Spiegel's eye-roll test, and the existence of the hypnotic
   state was verified by changes in ventilatory pattern. On average, EMG
   levels expressed as percentages of MVC were less: (i) when the jaw was
   deliberately lowered as opposed to being in the postural position: (ii)
   during hypnosis compared with during the pre- and post-hypnotic periods.
   However, analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests with multiple
   comparison corrections (Bonferroni) revealed that only the differences
   between the level during hypnosis and those before and after hypnosis
   were statistically significant (P<0.05). As the level of masseter EMG
   when the mandible was in resting' posture was reduced by hypnosis, it
   appears that part of that EMG is of biological origin.}},

Abstract = {{The Kosrat anticline structure in the northeastern part of Iraq has been
   studied from structural and tectonic points of view. The anticline was
   described and classified according to the field measurements. The
   southwestern limb is steeper and shorter than the northeastern one which
   makes it an asymmetrical double-plunged anticline verging towards the
   southwest. The folding kinematics model was based on the changing of the
   competency of the formations to have a flexural slip fold that is
   controlled by the compositions of the layers and the primary response of
   each rock unit to the deformation. Structural and tectonic history of
   the anticline was interpreted according to the study of faults that have
   been reactivated. The deduction of the reactivation was through the
   comparison between the thicknesses of the geologic formations in both
   limbs of the anticline. Parts that differ in lithology and show
   deformation or crushing zones in different levels were observed as a
   footwall shortcut and used to indicate inversion. Thin sections analysis
   for rock samples in extension fractures showed evidence of a faulting
   mechanism represented by the deformed crystals to give a clue of being
   inverted faults in the Kosrat anticline.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the impact of the flipped classroom on
   the promotion of students' creative thinking. Students were recruited
   from the Faculty of Education at King Abdulaziz University in Saudi
   Arabia during the first semester of 2014. A multiple method research
   design was used to address the research questions. First, a two-group
   quasi-experimental design was implemented. The first group utilised the
   lecture-based strategy (n=28), while the second group utilised the
   flipped classroom (n=27). Second, a survey questionnaire was distributed
   to assess the students' views about the flipped classroom, its role in
   the promotion of creativity and the difficulties students experienced
   with this strategy. The findings suggest that the flipped classroom may
   promote students' creativity, especially with regard to fluency,
   flexibility and novelty. Furthermore, the students viewed the flipped
   classroom as an approach that may significantly facilitate their
   creativity. However, several difficulties were associated with the
   flipped classroom, especially the students' limited preparation for this
   strategy. Accordingly, students must be prepared to utilise the flipped
   classroom and be provided with adequate e-learning tools. In addition,
   it is important to consider students' study load and to provide
   meaningful in-class activities.}},

   irrespective of the value of the wall roughness. Another rarefaction
   phenomenon, the bimodality of the temperature profile, with a local
   minimum (T-min) at the channel centerline and two symmetric maxima
   (T-max) away from the centerline, is also studied. We show that the
   inelastic dissipation is responsible for the onset of temperature
   bimodality (i.e. the `excess' temperature, Delta T = (T-max/T-min - 1)
   not equal 0) near the continuum limit (Kn similar to 0), but the
   rarefaction being its origin (as in the molecular gas) holds beyond Kn
   similar to O(0.1). The dependence of the excess temperature Delta T on
   the restitution coefficient is compared with the predictions of a
   kinetic model, with reasonable agreement in the appropriate limit. The
   competition between dissipation and rarefaction seems to be responsible
   for the observed dependence of both the mass-flow rate and the
   temperature bimodality on Kn and e(n) in this flow. The validity of the
   Navier-Stokes-order hydrodynamics for granular Poiseuille flow is
   discussed with reference to the prediction of bimodal temperature
   profiles and related surrogates.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine
   with chemokine-like functions and is a mediator in numerous inflammatory
   conditions. Depending on the context, MIF signals through 1 or more of
   its receptors cluster of differentiation (CD) 74, CXC-motif chemokine
   receptor (CXCR)2, and CXCR4. In addition, heteromeric receptor complexes
   have been identified. We characterized the atypical chemokine receptor
   CXCR7 as a novel receptor for MIF. MIF promoted human CXCR7
   internalization up to 40\%, peaking at 50-400 nM and 30 min, but CXCR7
   internalization by MIF was not dependent on CXCR4. Yet, by
   coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence microscopy, and a proximity ligation
   assay, CXCR7 was found to engage in MIF receptor complexes with CXCR4
   and CD74, both after ectopic overexpression and in endogenous conditions
   in a human B-cell line. Receptor competition binding and
   coimmunoprecipitation studies combined with sulfo-SBED-biotintransfer
   provided evidence for a direct interaction between MIF and CXCR7.
   Finally, we demonstrated MIF/CXCR7-mediated functional responses.
   Blockade of CXCR7 suppressed MIF-mediated ERK- and zeta-chain-associated
   protein kinase (ZAP)-70 activation (from 2.1- to 1.2-fold and from 2.5-
   to 1.6-fold, respectively) and fully abrogated primary murine B-cell
   chemotaxis triggered by MIF, but not by CXCL12. B cells from Cxcr7(-/-)
   mice exhibited an ablated transmigration response to MIF, indicating
   that CXCR7 is essential for MIF-promoted B-cell migration. Our findings
   provide biochemical and functional evidence that MIF is an alternative
   ligand of CXCR7 and suggest a functional role of the MIF-CXCR7 axis in
   Blymphocyte migration.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   within cotton (Gossypium spp.) canopies of varying architecture is
   presented. Based on this study, a computer model is formulated to
   estimate PAR distribution and photosynthetic rates of cotton canopies.
   The model is developed from photon flux densities (PFD) measured at
   several stages of development in row-planted cotton canopies. The photon
   transport equation is implemented into the model along with an algorithm
   to calculate canopy photosynthetic rates.
   The resulting model is then used to generate different scenarios of
   plant architecture to identify the canopy architecture with optimal
   canopy photosynthetic rates. The results demonstrate that the
   differences in light distribution within the different cotton canopies
   were successfully captured. The model reproduces PAR distributions
   successfully for the cotton cultivars included in the study (R-2 > 0.9
   for most cultivars).
   Photosynthetic rate estimations showed that the structure of the DP-50
   canopy is the most efficient canopy architecture by allowing PAR
   penetration throughout its canopy. This cultivar also uses the available
   sunlight more efficiently by enhancing PAR interception. The
   optimization process suggests that a cotton plant could increase its
   photosynthetic rate by 10\% by distributing leaves within the canopy
   similarly to that of DP-50, and with leaves shaped like small-to-medium
   PS-6 leaves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adult protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) often occurs in
   combination with neurological disorders affecting hand use and walking
   ability. The independent effects of PEM on motor function are not well
   characterized and may be obscured by these comorbidities.
   Objective: Our goal was to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of
   sensorimotor function with the onset and progression of PEM in an adult
   male rat model.
   Methods: In Expt. 1 and Expt. 2, male Sprague-Dawley rats (14-15 wk old)
   were assigned ad libitum access for 4 wk to normal-protein (NP) or
   low-protein (LP) diets containing 12.5\% and 0.5\% protein,
   respectively. Expt. 1 assessed muscle strength, balance, and skilled
   walking ability on days 2, 8, and 27 by bar-holding, cylinder, and
   horizontal ladder walking tasks, respectively. In addition to food
   intake and body weight, nutritional status was determined on days 3, 9,
   and 28 by serum acute-phase reactant and corticosterone concentrations
   and liver lipids. Expt 2 addressed the effect of an LP diet on hindlimb
   muscle size.
   Results: PEM evolved over time in rats consuming the LP diet. Total food
   intake decreased by 24\% compared with the NP group. On day 28, body
   weight and serum albumin decreased by 31\% and 26\%, respectively, and
   serum alpha 2-macroglobulin increased by 445\% (P < 0.05) in the LP
   group compared with the NP group. Forelimb dysfunction (173\% increase
   in adaptive flexed-arm-hang score) developed on day 2 in rats fed the LP
   diet (P < 0.001), whereas abnormal walking (34\% decreased incidence of
   correct hindlimb placement) developed by day 27 (P < 0.05). Relative to
   the NP diet, the LP diet reduced the cross-sectional area of
   gastrocnemius medialis (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: PEM in adult male rats causes a variety of sensorimotor
   abnormalities that develop at different stages of malnutrition. This
   model can be used 41 combination with disease models of sensorimotor
   deficits to examine the interactions between nutritional status, other
   treatments, and disease progression.}},

Volume = {{429}},

Abstract = {{The isotopic abundances of Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb, and Hf have been measured
   in nine lunar samples by MC-ICP-MS. The data were corrected for both
   instrumental mass bias and natural isotope fractionation. We used the
   data to calculate the total flux and energy spectrum of the neutrons
   absorbed by the rocks. We write the constitutive equations of the
   isotopic changes for these elements induced by neutrons and solve the
   inverse problem by computing local energy averages. Resonant absorption
   peaks can be used as convenient kernels to define the spectrum of
   epithermal neutrons. We find that Sm-149 and Gd-157 anomalies correlate
   with neutron flux density for E < 0.015 eV (r(2) > 0.98) and E
   approximate to 1 0.13 eV (r(2) > 0.85), while no significant correlation
   exists between the ratio of these anomalies and the epithermal/thermal
   flux ratio at any value of energy. Neutron flux density variations can
   be used to trace the proportions of neutrons scattered out of the
   samples. The spectrum in the thermal region follows the expected E-1/2
   dependence but with `notches' corresponding to neutron absorption. A
   major notch at the lowest end of the epithermal neutron spectrum
   (0.2-0.8 eV) is possibly due to absorption of neutrons by Eu-151,
   Er-167, and Sm-149. In general, we find a rather good correlation
   between the neutron flux density at specific energies and the exposure
   age, which suggests a mean residence time of the samples at the surface
   of the regolith of 2-300 Ma. Another correlation of epithermal neutrons
   with sample wt\% FeO + TiO2 is consistent with orbital reflectance
   observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantifying STM-tip induced directed hopping of Sb-2 dimers on Si(001):
   A kinetic Monte Carlo study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice gas model
   were performed to investigate the experimentally observed enhanced
   directed diffusion of Sb-2 ad-dimers on Si(001) during asymmetric
   scanning-one that uses invasive and noninvasive scanning tunneling
   microscope (STM) settings for leftward and rightward scanning,
   respectively. The authors model the invasive scanning by postulating an
   attractive interaction between the STM tip and the adsorbates. This is
   done by lowering (raising) the activation barrier by an adjustable
   energy difference Delta E for hopping of Sb-2 dimers toward (away from)
   the STM tip site. Effectively, Delta E is a measure of the severity of
   the STM tip's impact on surface kinetics. Additionally, they explore the
   effect of varying Delta E on the activation barrier for hopping of Sb-2
   dimers orthogonal to the Si dimer rows by setting its value to 0.1-0.4
   eV. Experimentally determined to be 1.2 eV, the authors found that for
   very small Delta E (Delta E < 0.1 eV) the activation barrier could be
   underestimated by no more than 0.03 eV, and as much as 0.13 eV for large
   Delta E (Delta E = 0.4 eV). Next, they ask if this model could induce
   asymmetry in the hopping frequency under asymmetric scanning, that is,
   STM runs in the invasive mode when moving from right to left, and
   noninvasive mode in the opposite direction. The authors found that
   indeed there is a net movement of Sb-2 dimers from right to left, or
   along the direction of the invasive scan. Moreover, they found that this
   directed motion becomes slightly more pronounced as the scanning speed
   decreases. These twin observations were explained by noting the
   asymmetry in the occupation probability of the sites immediately to the
   left and right of the STM tip-the site trailing the tip, or the site to
   its right, is more likely to be occupied compared than the one leading
   it. In this sense, according to their model, the STM tip gently drags
   the adsorbates it comes in contact with but falls short of precise,
   active manipulation even for large Delta E (Delta E = 0.4 eV). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: Valproic acid (VPA) is a commonly used drug for the
   treatment of epilepsy, acute manias and bipolar disorder. It is known
   that the use of AVP during pregnancy an produce congenital
   malformations, the fetal valproate syndrome and augment the risk for
   autism. This disorders haven been modeled in the laboratory by injecting
   VPA during the embryonic period rats, inducing additionally
   modifications in the cerebellar anatomy similar to those detected in
   people with autism.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to describe some congenital
   malformations observed in rats exposed prenatally to VPA and its
   correlation with the number of Purkinje cells from the cerebellar
   vermis.
   Methods: VPA (600mg/kg) was applied to pregnant rats during the 12th
   embrionic day; control rats were injected with saline during the same
   day. Rats with malformations and control rats were euthanized during the
   postnatal day 40 and the number of Purkinje cells was determined in
   sagittal sections from the medial vermis stained with Nissl technique.
   Results: The prenatal exposure to AVP produced different severity of
   tail malformations and toe polydactyly, as well as a decrease in the
   number of Purkinje cells in the lobules VI, VII, VIII y X. A lineal
   positive correlation between the malformation severity and the number of
   Purkinje cells was observed in the lobule VIII-B; however, no
   correlation was detected between those parameters in any additional
   lobe.
   Conclusion: There is not correlation between the severity of the
   malformations produced by VPA and the decrease in the number of Purkinje
   cells. These findings are relevant for a better understanding of the VPA
   experimental model in the rat.}},

   implementation of this approach, participative causal maps were used to
   identify the ex-post social impacts of the Porto Primavera and Rosana
   dams on the community of Porto-Rico, located along the High Parana
   River. We found that in the operation of dams there are intermediate
   causes of a political nature, stemming from decisions based on values

Abstract = {{Under discussion is recoverability of noble and rare metals from

   research follows one of three lines: stage-wise diagnostic sorption
   leaching, flotation with pre-milling in amino acetic acid and magnetic
   concentration. Based on the examination of scattered carbon substance in
   caustobioliths, it is supposed that concentrations of metals are
   asphaltene fractions of bitumoids (bitumen-like substance). The research
   results show prospect of using this nonconventional coal-bearing raw
   material as a source of noble and rare metals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a new exact iterative method for the following
   problem. Two decision makers, a leader and a follower, compete to
   attract customers from a given market. The leader opens facilities,
   anticipating that the follower will react to the decision by opening
   facilities. Each customer patronizes the closest opened facility. The
   goal is to find facilities for the leader to maximize his market share.
   It is known that this problem is -hard and can be presented as an
   integer linear program with a large number of constraints. Based on this
   representation, we design the new iterative exact method. A local search
   algorithm is used at each iteration to find a feasible solution for a
   system of constraints. Computational results and comparison with other
   exact methods show that the new method can be considered as one of the
   alternative approaches among the most advanced exact methods for the

Abstract = {{Smoking-induced lung diseases were extremely rare prior to the 20th
   century. With commercialization and introduction of machine-made
   cigarettes, worldwide use skyrocketed and several new pulmonary diseases
   have been recognized. The majority of pulmonary diseases caused by
   cigarette smoke (CS) are inflammatory in origin. Airway epithelial cells
   and alveolar macrophages have altered inflammatory signaling in response
   to CS, which leads to recruitment of lymphocytes, eosinophils,
   neutrophils, and mast cells to the lungs-depending on the signaling
   pathway (nuclear factor-kappa B, adenosine monophosphate-activated
   protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 3) activated. Multiple proteins are
   upregulated and secreted in response to CS exposure, and many of these
   have immunomodulatory activities that contribute to disease
   pathogenesis. In particular, metalloproteases 9 and 12, surfactant
   protein D, antimicrobial peptides (LL-37 and human beta defensin 2), and
   IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 have been found in higher quantities in the
   lungs of smokers with ongoing inflammation. However, many underlying
   mechanisms of smoking-induced inflammatory diseases are not yet known.
   We review here the known cellular and molecular mechanisms of CS-induced
   diseases, including COPD, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung
   disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia, chronic rhinosinusitis, pulmonary Langerhans cell
   histiocytosis, and chronic bacterial infections. We also discuss
   inflammation induced by secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure and the
   pulmonary diseases that result. New targeted antiinflammatory
   therapeutic options are currently under investigation and hopefully will
   yield promising results for the treatment of these highly prevalent
   smoking-induced diseases.}},

Title = {{A new fast scanning system for the measurement of large angle tracks in
   nuclear emulsions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear emulsions have been widely used in particle physics to identify
   new particles through the observation of their decays thanks to their
   unique spatial resolution. Nevertheless, before the advent of automatic
   scanning systems, the emulsion analysis was very demanding in terms of
   well trained manpower. Due to this reason, they were gradually replaced
   by electronic detectors, until the `90s, when automatic microscopes
   started to be developed in Japan and in Europe. Automatic scanning was
   essential to conceive large scale emulsion-based neutrino experiments
   like CHORUS, DONUT and OPERA. Standard scanning systems have been
   initially designed to recognize tracks within a limited angular
   acceptance (theta less than or similar to 30 degrees) where theta is the
   track angle with respect to a line perpendicular to the emulsion plane.
   In this paper we describe the implementation of a novel fast automatic
   scanning system aimed at extending the track recognition to the full
   angular range and improving the present scanning speed. Indeed, nuclear
   emulsions do not have any intrinsic limit to detect particle direction.
   Such improvement opens new perspectives to use nuclear emulsions in
   several fields in addition to large scale neutrino experiments, like
   muon radiography, medical applications and dark matter directional
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a 3D failure criterion identified through Arcan
   tests, to analyze the behavior of a laminate composite subjected to
   out-of-plane loadings. The proposed criterion is based on the Hashin's
   hypothesis and the interactions between tensile and shear out-of-plane
   loadings are taken into account. The out-of-plane stresses generated in
   the composite subjected to an Arcan test are studied using 3D Finite
   Element calculations in order to determine the stack sequence influence.
   Using different angles of the loading and different stacking sequences
   allows the ply to be subjected to complex 3D stress state. Using the
   experimental results and an inverse identification procedure, it is
   possible to identify the out-of-plane failure envelope. It is shown that
   a quadratic failure envelope, which takes into account a decrease of the
   apparent shear strength in the presence of out-of-plane tensile stress,
   permits the model to describe in a correct manner the experimental
   results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) are physically and functionally closely
   related areas of the hippocampus, but they differ in various respects,
   including their reactions to different insults. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the protective effects of chronic caffeine
   treatment on late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and its
   signalling cascade in the DG area of the hippocampus of rapid eye
   movement sleep-deprived rats. Rats were chronically treated with
   caffeine (300 mg/L drinking water) for 4 weeks, after which they were
   sleep-deprived for 24 h. L-LTP was induced in in anaesthetized rats, and
   extracellular field potentials from the DG area were recorded in vivo.
   The levels of L-LTP-related signalling proteins were assessed by western
   blot analysis. Sleep deprivation markedly reduced L-LTP magnitude, and
   basal levels of total cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB),
   phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB), and calcium/calmodulin kinase IV (CaMKIV).
   Chronic caffeine treatment prevented the reductions in the basal levels
   of P-CREB, total CREB and CaMKIV in sleep-deprived rats. Furthermore,
   caffeine prevented post-L-LTP sleep deprivation-induced downregulation
   of P-CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the DG. The current
   findings show that caffeine treatment prevents acute sleep
   deprivation-induced deficits in brain function.}},

   (n=58) were treated with 4 mu g buserelin (GnRH, n =30) and 500 IU eCG
   (eCG, n = 28) 10 days post-mating. The eCG ewes had more CLs (57.1\%)

   eCG ewes had more (P<0.01) serum P4 concentrations (8.1 +/- 0.79 ng/ml)
   than the GnRH ewes (3.9 +/- 1.02 ng/ml) at day 30 (during pregnancy).
   Similar trend was recorded at day 60 where serum P4 (8.5 +/- 0.79 ng/ml)
   remained elevated (P < 0.05) in the eCG compared to the GnRH ewes (6.0
   +/- 0.79 ng/ml) but not at day 90. Ewes treated with eCG had higher (P <

   ewes to have higher pregnancy rate (60.7\%, 17/28) compared to GnRH ewes
   (36.7\%, 11/30). Post-mating treatments with eCG improved the luteal

Title = {{When is a slur not a slur? The use of nigger in `Pulp Fiction'}},
Journal = {{LANGUAGE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{187-199}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Slurs are defined and shown to be determined by context of use and not
   lexical form. It has been proposed that words like nigger should be
   eradicated from the English language on the presupposition that the word
   itself is a slur and its eradication will eliminate the slur against
   African-Americans. This presumption is demonstrably false and in any
   case eradication of slurs is shown to be an unrealistic goal. In order
   to understand why nigger counts as a slur, the dysphemistic properties
   attributed to the word and its typical referents are described.
   Communities which are the target of a slurring term sometimes adopt that
   term as a mark of in-group solidarity and camaraderie; this has happened
   with nigger. It is against this background that I scrutinize the
   function of each occurrence of the word nigger within the film script of
   Quentin Tarantino's `Pulp Fiction'. I closely examine the style of
   language used within the film script, taking account of other potential
   slurs, obscenities, and instances of banter and repartee in order to
   judge if Tarantino uses nigger as a reasonable instrument within the
   development of a character and/or to make a dramatic point or, instead,
   whether the word occurs gratuitously in order to shock or cause offense.
   I conclude that in `Pulp Fiction' most occurrences of nigger are uttered
   by one African-American to or about another in the spirit of camaraderie
   (what Australians would call `mateship'). Where it is uttered by a white
   to a black friend it is also of this nature. The two instances where
   nigger is used by one white to another do show disrespect towards
   African-Americans but not malice, and they serve to make a dramatic
   point. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Contemporary rends in high-dose interleukin-2 use for metastatic renal

Journal = {{UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Targeted therapies (TTs) have revolutionized metastatic
   renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treatment in the past decade, largely
   replacing immunotherapy including high-dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2)
   therapy. We evaluated trends in HD IL-2 use for mRCC in the IT era.
   Methods: Our cohort comprised a weighted estimate of all patients
   undergoing HD IL-2 treatment for mRCC from 2004 to 2012 using the
   Premier Hospital Database. We assessed temporal trends in HD IL-2 use
   including patient. disease, and hospital characteristics stratified by
   era (pre-TT uptake: 2004-2006, uptake: 2007-2009, and post-TT uptake:
   2010-2012) and fitted multivariable regression models to identify
   predictors of treatment toxicity and tolerability.
   Results: An estimated 2,351 patients received HD IL-2 therapy for mRCC
   in the United States from 2004 to 2012. The use decreased from 2004 to
   2008. HD IL-2 therapy became increasingly centralized in teaching
   hospitals (24\% of treatments in 2004 and 89.5\% in 2012). Most patients
   who received HD IL-2 therapy were men, white, younger than 60 years, had
   lung metastases, and were otherwise healthy. Vasopressors, intensive
   care unit admission, and hemodialysis were necessary in 53.4\%, 33.0\%,
   and 7.1\%, respectively. Factors associated with toxicities in
   multivariable analyses included being unmarried, male sex, and multiple
   metastatic sites. African Americans and patients with single-site
   metastases were less likely to receive multiple treatment cycles.
   Conclusions: HD IL-2 therapy is used infrequently for mRCC in the United
   States, and its application has diminished with the uptake of TT.
   Patients are being increasingly treated in teaching hospitals,
   suggesting a centralization of care and possible barriers to access. A
   recent slight increase in HD IL-2 therapy use likely reflects
   recognition of the inability of TT to effect a complete response. (C)

Abstract = {{The care of patients with a psychiatric emergency is fraught with
   ethical challenges. Applying ethical reasoning to clinical challenges
   may help to improve care. Emergency providers should assess
   decision-making capacity using 4 criteria: communication, understanding,
   appreciation, and reasoning. Maintaining patient confidentiality is a
   strong imperative for emergency physicians and should be protected
   unless compelling additional concerns take precedence. The goal of
   involuntary treatment should be to protect patients from harm that they
   would not be exposed to were they capable of autonomous decision making,
   not dangerous, or not impaired by their psychiatric illness using the
   least restrictive means possible.}},

Abstract = {{Physical modeling of buildings founded on layers of liquefiable sand has
   produced insightful data describing ground and building performance. A
   new publicly available NEEShub database, ``FLIQ,{''} summarizes data
   from 9 large-scale centrifuge tests with 4 different lead
   experimentalists, various soil profiles, 49 stations of site and
   structure response, and more than 60 shaking events, that is, 405 events
   in total. Example correlations between ground-motion intensity measures
   and performance measures are presented to illustrate the usefulness of
   the database. The relationship between PGA at the surface and base is
   highly variable when liquefaction is observed; however, the relationship
   between the cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) at the surface and base
   is relatively linear, even when liquefaction occurs. Additionally, the
   CAV was found to correlate well with settlement and can account for
   settlement history. Contrary to intuition, foundation settlement in
   liquefied soil is not directly correlated to bearing pressure; larger
   bearing pressures can decrease liquefaction occurrence and related
   settlements. The database has potential to grow through future community
   input.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper an acoustic indoor location system that allows
   a simultaneous localization of sources with different location
   precisions. This is achieved by the use of the time reversal technique
   and the code-division multiple-access operation. The system was
   evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, and location delay.
   Simulations and experiments were carried out while varying the number of
   sources and that of the precision levels. The effect of the
   signal-to-noise ratio on system performance was also studied. Results
   showed that our location system can achieve accuracy of 1.5 cm with 83\%
   precision. Finally, we aimed to reduce the audibility of the location
   signal. An equalization filter based on the absolute threshold of
   hearing was applied to the emitted signal and a matched filter was
   introduced at the receiver. Results showed an improvement in location
   precision when compared with the location system without the
   equalization filter. A reduction in signal audibility was noted.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify and test the in vivo effectiveness
   of antihypertensive peptides present in a pea protein hydrolysate.
   Yellow field pea protein isolate was digested with thermolysin and the
   hydrolysate passed through a 3 kDa ultrafiltration membrane. The
   permeate was collected as the PPH-3 and separated on a reverse-phase
   HPLC column into 10 peptide fractions. Fractions 3-8 showed inhibition
   of in vitro renin activity that ranged from approx. 21-68\% while ACE
   activity was inhibited by fractions 2-10 in the range of 22-95\%.
   Fraction 7 had the highest dual inhibitions of the two enzymes with
   52.16 and 95.17\% for renin and ACE, respectively. Fraction 7 was
   therefore, chosen for peptide characterization by tandem mass
   spectrometry, which led to sequencing of the following five peptides;
   LTFPG (534 Da); IIPLEN (698 Da); LSSGDVF (724 Da); IFENLQN (877 Da); and
   FEGTVFENG (999 Da). LTFPG, IFENLQN and FEGTVFENG had significantly (P <
   0.05) higher inhibitions of ACE and renin activities and were orally
   administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg
   body weight. LTFPG showed significantly (P < 0.05) the fastest decrease
   in systolic blood pressure (SBP) with a maximum of 37 mmHg after 2 h. In
   contrast the maximum effects of IFENLQN ( 37 mmHg) and FEGTVFENG (-25
   mmHg) were observed after 4 h. Overall, the three peptides had
   significantly (P < 0.05) better SBP-reducing effects than the PPH-3,
   which gave a maximum of 14 mmHg after 6 h. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{G proteins are fundamental elements in signal transduction involved in
   key cell responses, and their interactions with cell membrane lipids are
   critical events whose nature is not fully understood. Here, we have
   studied how the presence of myristic and palmitic acid moieties affects
   the interaction of the Gull protein with model and biological membranes.
   For this purpose, we quantified the binding of purified G alpha i(1)
   protein and G alpha i(1) protein acylation mutants to model membranes,
   with lipid compositions that resemble different membrane microdomains.
   We observed that myristic and palmitic acids not only act as membrane
   anchors but also regulate G alpha i(1) subunit interaction with lipids
   characteristics of certain membrane microdomains. Thus, when the G alpha
   i(1) subunit contains both fatty acids it prefers raft-like lamellar
   membranes, with a high sphingomyelin and cholesterol content and little
   phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. By contrast, the
   myristoylated and non-palmitoylated subunit prefers other types of
   ordered lipid microdomains with higher phosphatidylserine content These
   results in part explain the mobility of G alpha i(1) protein upon
   reversible palmitoylation to meet one or another type of signaling
   protein partner. These results also serve as an example of how membrane
   lipid alterations can change membrane signaling or how membrane lipid
   therapy can regulate the cell's physiology. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Aims To examine temporal changes in incidence and 1-year mortality of
   first myocardial infarction (MI) in different age groups for both
   genders in Denmark over a 35-year period (1978-2012).
   Methods and results Patients aged 30 years or older admitted with first
   MI in Denmark from 1978 to 2012 were included (n = 316 790). Overall,
   first MI incidence per 100 000 person-years (/10(5) p.y.) decreased
   significantly from 500 to 297/10(5) p.y. for males and from 229 to
   156/10(5) p.y. for females. The decline was greatest among men aged
   70-79 from 1460 to 643/10(5) p.y. (256\%). The majority of age groups
   also experienced declining incidence. However, men aged 30-39 and >= 90
   years as well as females aged 30-49 and >= 90 years had increasing
   incidence during the study period. Moreover, the incidence decreased
   from 1978 to 1996 among males aged 40-49 and females aged 50-59 years,
   but increased in the remainder of the study period. One-year
   case-fatality declined significantly from 50 to 9\% of MI male patients,
   and from 53 to 15\% of MI female patients when comparing 1978 to 2012.
   Statistical analysis with Poisson models demonstrated that the mortality
   rate increased with age and decreased with time and indicated no
   significant difference between genders.
   Conclusions During the period from 1978 to 2012, there was a significant
   decline in MI incidence among most age groups for both genders; however,
   an incidence increase was observed in men under 50 and women under 60
   years, and >= 90 years for both genders. One-year case-fatality
   decreased constantly during the study period.}},

Abstract = {{Double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV) is a rare condition. Stenosis of
   DCRV is progressive, and early surgical intervention is recommended for
   patients whose symptoms and/or pressure overload of right ventricular
   (RV) inflow are progressive. However, there are few data regarding the
   postoperative course of DCRV, and the surgical indications for
   asymptomatic patients remain to be determined. We retrospectively
   investigated 38 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with DCRV and
   underwent surgical intervention from 1981 to 2009. Moreover, we
   identified 29 patients in whom long-term follow-up transthoracic
   echocardiographic data were available and investigated the postoperative
   recurrence of DCRV by evaluating the systolic pressure of RV inflow
   before, immediately, and in the long term after surgical intervention.
   The mean follow-up period was 11.0 +/- 8.8 years. There were no deaths
   and no surgical reinterventions during the long-term follow-up period.
   Among 29 patients with long-term follow-up echocardiographic data, there
   was no recurrence of DCRV. In these patients, the systolic pressure of
   RV inflow by echocardiography before, immediately, and long-term after
   surgical intervention was 80 +/- 26, 30 +/- 11, and 25 +/- 6 mm Hg,
   respectively. In conclusion, the surgical outcomes and postoperative
   prognosis beyond 10 years of DCRV are favorable, and neither recurrence
   of DCRV nor fatal arrhythmias develop during the long-term follow-up
   period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   It is also a special case of -distribution, recently studied by
   Arellano-Valle and Genton (Chil J Stat 2:17-34, 2010). We show that the
   proposed distribution can be expressed as a shape mixture of the
   multivariate extended skew-normal distribution. Applying this property
   leads to deriving stochastic representations for the proposed
   distribution. Also we give some basic properties for this new family.
   Computational techniques using EM-type algorithms are employed for
   iteratively computing maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, an
   application of the new distribution is illustrated using some real data

Abstract = {{Tuning of the electronic properties of presynthesized colloidal
   semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) by doping plays a key role in the
   prospect of implementing them in printed electronics devices such as
   transistors and photodetectors. While such impurity doping reactions
   have already been introduced, the understanding of the doping process,
   the nature of interaction between the impurity and host atoms, and the
   conditions affecting the solubility limit of impurities in nanocrystals
   are still unclear. Here, we used a postsynthesis diffusion-based doping
   reaction to introduce Ag impurities into InAs NCs. Optical absorption
   spectroscopy and analytical inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
   (ICP-MS) were used to present a two-stage doping model consisting of a
   ``doping region{''} and a ``growth region{''}, depending on the impurity
   to NC ratio in the reaction vessel. X-ray absorption fine-structure
   (XAFS) spectroscopy was employed to determine the impurity location and
   correlate between the structural and electronic properties for different
   sizes of InAs NCs and dopant concentrations. The resulting structural
   model describes a heterogeneous system where the impurities initially
   dope the NC, by substituting for In atoms near the surface of the NC,
   until the ``solubility limit' is reached, after which the rapid growth
   and formation of metallic structures are identified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a new sensorial approach to improving communication
   between partners during collaborative tasks taking place in abstract and
   non-visual virtual reality environments. The sensorial approach was
   investigated in the context of the search and identification of targets
   in a simplified 2D environment. It consists in finding a spatial
   configuration corresponding to a defined criterion such as a maximum,
   minimum, or defined score. During the collaborative search, users need
   to be aware of their results and also the results of their partners. In
   addition, they need to compare examined scores (e.g., docking score or
   physical value) with other results to make decisions. To support these
   features, an audio-haptic display was developed employing binaural audio
   with an inter-modal stimuli synthesis design to improve the
   collaborative search. This rendering tool allows for simultaneous use of
   the audio and haptic channels which enables an efficient individual
   search and comparison of results. In addition, it improves the
   communication and activity coordination between the partners. An
   experiment was carried out to evaluate the contribution of the tool to
   improve the collaborative search of targets in a 2D non-visual
   environment. The results clearly show a significant improvement in
   performance and working efficiency with the audio-haptic display as
   compared to a traditional haptic-only condition. Moreover, we observed a
   reduction in the need for verbal communication during some steps of the
   search process. However, this approach introduces some communication
   conflicts during the steps presenting high-level interactions between
   partners which reduce the working efficiency of some groups.}},

Abstract = {{Podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PCLP1), a CD34-related sialomucin involved
   in the regulation of cellular morphology and adhesion, is expressed by a
   number of normal cells and various tumor cells. In breast malignancies
   PCLP1 overexpression has been associated with the most aggressive,
   metastatic cancers and poor prognosis. These observations suggest that
   PCLP1 expression could provide a mechanism to evade the immune response,
   thereby promoting metastatic progression of cancer. In the present work,
   we aimed to determine the effect of PCLP1 overexpressed in MCF7 breast
   cancer cells on natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, dendritic cell
   maturation, and agonist-induced T cell proliferation. The results showed
   that PCLP1 expressed in MCF7 breast cancer cells confers resistance to
   NK cell-mediated cytolysis and impairs T cell proliferation.
   Furthermore, PCLP1 decreased the levels of NK cell activating receptors
   NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, DNAM-1, and CD16 on cell surface in a
   contact-dependent manner. Moreover, NK cells acquired PCLP1 from MCF7
   cells by a process known as trogocytosis. These data reveal a new
   function of PCLP1 expressed on tumor cells as an immunomodulatory
   molecule, which may represent a mechanism to evade the immune response.

Abstract = {{Background: Laccase has been considered important for the degradation of
   lignocellulose by wood rot fungi. The properties and functions of
   laccase in white rot fungi have been investigated extensively, but those
   from brown rot fungi remain largely unknown. In this paper, a laccase
   isoform Pplcc2 from the brown rot fungus Postia placenta MAD-698-R was
   expressed heterologously in Pichia pastoris GS115, purified and the
   properties of the enzyme were determined.
   Results: The molecular weight of the protein was determined to be 67 kDa
   using SDS-PAGE. It cannot oxidize syringaldazine (SGZ), but it can
   oxidize 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothialozin-6-Sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and
   2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP). Specific activity for ABTS was 1960 +/- 19
   Unit/mg. The catalytic constant (k(cat)) was 1213 +/- 18.3 s(-1) for
   ABTS and 293.2 +/- 21.9 s(-1) for DMP. K-m was 22.08 mu M for ABTS and
   11.62 mu M for DMP. The optimal pH for the oxidation of ABTS and DMP was
   3.5 and 5.0 respectively. The optimal temperature for the oxidation of
   ABTS and DMP was 60 degrees C.
   Conclusions: This is the first identified thermo activated and
   thermostable laccase in brown rot fungi. This investigation will
   contribute to understanding the roles played by laccases in brown rot
   fungi. (C) 2015 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism of information processing in the human brain
   remains a unique challenge because the nonlinear interactions between
   the neurons in the network are extremely complex and because controlling
   every relevant parameter during an experiment is difficult. Therefore, a
   simulation using simplified computational models may be an effective
   approach. In the present study, we developed a general model of neural
   networks that can simulate nonlinear activity patterns in the
   hierarchical structure of a neural network system. To test our model, we
   first examined whether our simulation could match the
   previously-observed nonlinear features of neural activity patterns.
   Next, we performed a psychophysics experiment for a simple visual
   working memory task to evaluate whether the model could predict the
   performance of human subjects. Our studies show that the model is
   capable of reproducing the relationship between memory load and
   performance and may contribute, in part, to our understanding of how the
   structure of neural circuits can determine the nonlinear neural activity
   patterns in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyneuropathy (A-CIDP) is an increasingly recognized CIDP subtype.
   Differentiating A-CIDP from Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is challenging
   but important, because there are different treatment outcomes. Methods:
   We report 3 patients with A-CIDP who were initially diagnosed with
   severe GBS but were later confirmed to have CIDP based on their clinical
   course and electrodiagnostic (EDx) studies. We also report on the
   long-term treatment of these patients and review the literature on EDx
   studies in this syndrome. Results: Three patients were initially
   diagnosed with GBS and responded to treatment. However, all 3 had arrest
   in improvement or deterioration during their rehabilitation phases. EDx
   studies showed prominent demyelinating changes many months after the
   initial presentation. All responded very well to immunotherapy.
   Conclusion: Although several features may suggest the diagnosis of
   A-CIDP at initial presentation, close follow-up of GBS patients during
   the recovery phase is also needed for accurate diagnosis. EDx studies
   may distinguish patients with A-CIDP from GBS patients. Muscle Nerve52:

Abstract = {{We quantify uncertainties in density functional theory predictions of
   several fundamental materials properties of amorphous dielectrics
   focusing on those that arise from the intrinsic atomic variability of
   the glass structures and those stemming from approximations in the
   theory. The intrinsic, or aleatoric, uncertainties are quantified by
   performing calculations over ensembles of structures obtained by
   annealing independent liquid samples. We estimate model form, or
   epistemic, uncertainties by comparing results from two exchange and
   correlation functionals that exhibit different bonding characteristics:
   the local density approximation (that typically overbinds), and the
   generalized gradient approximation (that often underbinds). In the case
   of density, bulk modulus, and point defect formation energies
   predictions obtained from systems containing between 72 and 192 atoms,
   typical of current state-of-the-art calculations, show that the
   intrinsic variability in the atomic structure leads to uncertainties a
   factor of two to four times greater than those originating from model
   form. While model form discrepancies remain important, our results
   emphasize the importance of using ensembles of structures to make
   predictions of amorphous materials. The use of such probabilistic
   atomic-level data as input in multiscale materials or device models is
   critical for predictions with quantified uncertainties but also to
   uncover how atomic variability affects device performance. (C) 2015

Title = {{Orexin A Phosphorylates the gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A Receptor

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Propofol activates the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor
   (GABA(A)R) and causes a reversible neurite retraction, leaving a thin,
   thread-like structure behind; it also reverses the transport of vesicles
   in rat cortical neurons. The awakening peptide orexin A (OA) inhibits
   this retraction via phospholipase D (PLD) and protein kinase CE (PKCE).
   The human SH-SY5Y cells express both GABA(A)Rs and orexin 1 and 2
   receptors. These cells are used to examine the interaction between OA
   and the GABAAR. The effects of OA are studied with flow cytometry and
   immunoblotting. This study shows that OA stimulates phosphorylation on
   the serine residues of the GABA(A)R beta(2) subunit and that the
   phosphorylation is caused by the activation of PLD and PKCE. OA
   administration followed by propofol reduces the cell surface expression
   of the GABA(A)R, whereas propofol stimulation before OA increases the
   surface expression. The GABA(A)R beta(2) subunit is important for
   receptor recirculation, and the effect of OA on propofol-stimulated
   cells may be due to a disturbed recirculation of the GABA(A)R. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Grain farmers have seen integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) as an
   alternative of great interest by providing cattle food supply, as well
   as improvement of the phisical properties of soil. This study aimed at
   evaluating the effect of grazing and nitrogen levels on soil physical
   properties and on corn yield in an integrated crop-livestock farming.
   The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a
   split plot arrangement of treatments and three replications per
   treatment; nitrogen doses were the main plots, and grazing presence or
   absence were the subplots. We applied four doses of nitrogen (0, 75,
   150, and 225 kg ha(-1)) in soils grown with ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum
   Lam.) and oat (Avena sativa Lam.) during winter. After the grazing
   period, the area was planted with corn (Zea mays Lam.) within summer.
   Sheep grazing with stocking rate control and herbage mass maintenance
   using oats and ryegrasses did not change soil density, macro, micro and
   total porosity in a Bruno Latosol (Oxisol). Grazing in
   nitrogen-fertilized areas did not impair corn yield. Previous nitrogen
   fertilization in winter grazing, in amounts equal to or higher than 150
   kg N ha(-1), ensures high corn yields in the absence of N applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this experimental study the effects of unheated auxiliary plate
   positions along the centerline of a vertical channel on combined natural
   convective in air and radiative heat transfer are investigated. The
   vertical channel is symmetrically heated and a uniform heat flux along
   the principal walls of the channel is assumed. Comparisons between
   experimental data carried out from different positions of the auxiliary
   plate and two surfaces emissivity values are given in terms of heated
   wall temperatures and radiative heat transfer. Average Nusselt numbers
   by means of experimental data are evaluated. Results are given for
   different thermal and geometrical dimensionless parameters. Results show
   that the lowest maximum channel wall temperatures are attained for the
   auxiliary plate placed at the channel exit for high channel Rayleigh
   numbers and heat flux values. Correlations for average Nusselt numbers,
   global average Nusselt numbers and dimensionless maximum wall
   temperatures in terms of channel Rayleigh numbers and auxiliary
   plate-to-channel height ratio, h/L, are evaluated in the ranges: 20 <
   Ra' < 1.5 x 10(5), 22 < Ra'{*} < 1.7 x 10(5) and 0 <= h/L <= 0.5 for
   inlet and outlet positions and walls emissivity equal to 0.9. The
   proposed correlations are in good agreement with correlation for simple

Abstract = {{Local activists engaged in contemporary environmental justice struggles
   not only fight against traditional forms of hazardous locally unwanted
   land uses (LULUs), they also organize to make their neighborhoods
   livable and green. However, urban environmental justice activism is at a
   crossroads: as marginalized neighborhoods become revitalized, outside
   investors start to value them again and they themselves invest in green
   amenities. Yet vulnerable residents are now raising concerns about the
   risk of displacement from their neighborhoods in consequence of
   environmental gentrification processes. Their fear is linked to
   environmental amenities such as new parks or remodeled waterfronts, as
   well as (most recently) healthy food stores. Using the case of a
   conflict around a new Whole Foods supermarket in Boston, MA, I examine
   how food venues and stores labeled as healthy and natural can create
   socio-spatial inequality together with privilege, exclusion and
   displacement in racially diverse neighborhoods. I analyze how high-end
   supermarket chains target inner-city neighborhoods for their growth and
   profit potential, and demonstrate that their arrival contributes to what
   I call supermarket greenlining'. This greenlining illustrates the
   process of food gentrification, and the manipulation of health and
   sustainability discourses about food by healthy and natural food
   investors and their supporters. The opening of high-end supermarkets
   thus converts such stores into new LULUs for historically marginalized
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{The purposes of the paper are to estimate the inactivating power of
   soils in relation to radiologically important long-lived radionuclides
   Zn-65 and Co-60 and to develop methodological approaches for assessing
   effects of edaphic factors on the radionuclides mobility in the
   soil-plant system.
   For the experimental studies, different soil samples were collected (16
   soil types, classes, and subclasses). A model experiment was carried out
   in a greenhouse where barley plants were grown under controlled
   conditions for 2 weeks on soils artificially contaminated by
   (ZnCl2)-Zn-65 and (CoCl2)-Co-60. The biological availability of stable
   ``natural{''} Zn, which is an aggregate of stable nuclides,
   radionuclides Zn-65 and Co-60, was determined using the concentration
   ratio (CR). The physical and chemical parameters of soil (pH, the sum of
   silt, and clay particles (< 0.01 mm) content, Fe mobile, P mobile, humus
   content, a ratio of humic and fulvic acid carbon (C-HA/C-FA), contents
   of mobile forms of elements (Co, Zn)) were determined. Experimental data
   were subjected to statistical analysis.
   An effort has been made to quantify the relationships between the
   parameters describing physical-chemical properties of soils and those
   that characterize Zn-65 and Co-60 bioavailability. A methodological
   approach has been used, which employs natural diversity of
   physical-chemical properties of different types and kinds of
   noncarbonate and carbonate soils in the European part of Russia, to find
   relevant relationships. The use of radioactive isotopes of trace
   elements provides an opportunity to predict the behavior of the
   technogenous origin metals in the soil-plant system.
   Methodological approach for estimation of soil characteristic
   contribution to common inactivating capacity in relation to radionuclide
   migration in the soil-plant system was suggested. On its basis, a scale
   of soil inactivating capacity can be developed. The derived results
   allow ranking of the selected physical-chemical parameters of soils by
   their influence on CR (Zn-65 or Co-60) value in barley.}},

Abstract = {{Ascorbic acid (AA) is a naturally occurring phenolic compound with
   antioxidant properties used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical
   products. In this study, the effect of AA on ferric nitrilotriacetate
   (Fe-NTA-induced hepatotoxicity in rats has been examined. Fe-NTA alone
   enhances ornithine decarboxylase activity to 4.5-fold and tritiated
   thymidine incorporation in DNA to 3.6-fold in livers compared with the
   corresponding saline-treated controls. The enhanced ornithine
   decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis showed a reduction to 3.02- and
   1.88-fold, respectively, at a higher dose of 2 mg AA per day per animal,
   compared with the Fe-NTA-treated groups. Fe-NTA treatment also enhanced
   the hepatic microsornal lipid peroxidation to 1.7-fold compared to
   saline-treated controls. These changes were reversed significantly in
   animals receiving pretreatment of AA. The present data shows that AA can
   reciprocate the toxic effects of Fe-NTA and can serve as a potent
   chemopreventive agent to suppress oxidant-induced tissue injury and
   hepatotoxicity in rats.}},

Title = {{Energy harvesting from controlled buckling of piezoelectric beams}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A piezoelectric vibration energy harvester is presented that can
   generate electricity from the weight of passing cars or crowds. The
   energy harvester consists of a piezoelectric beam, which buckles when
   the device is stepped on. The energy harvester can have a horizontal or
   vertical configuration. In the vertical (direct) configuration, the
   piezoelectric beam is vertical and directly sustains the weight of the
   vehicles or people. In the horizontal (indirect) configuration, the
   vertical weight is transferred to a horizontal axial force through a
   scissor-like mechanism. Buckling of the beam results in significant
   stresses and, thus, large power production. However, if the beam's
   buckling is not controlled, the beam will fracture. To prevent this, the
   axial deformation is constrained to limit the deformations of the beam.
   In this paper, the energy harvester is analytically modeled. The
   considered piezoelectric beam is a general non-uniform beam. The natural
   frequencies, mode shapes, and the critical buckling force corresponding
   to each mode shape are calculated. The electro-mechanical coupling and
   the geometric nonlinearities are included in the model. The design
   criteria for the device are discussed. It is demonstrated that a device,
   realized with commonly used piezoelectric patches, can generate tens of
   milliwatts of power from passing car traffic. The proposed device could
   also be implemented in the sidewalks or integrated in shoe soles for
   energy generation. One of the key features of the device is its
   frequency up-conversion characteristics. The piezoelectric beam
   undergoes free vibrations each time the weight is applied to or removed
   from the energy harvester. The frequency of the free vibrations is
   orders of magnitude larger than the frequency of the load. The device
   is, thus, both efficient and insensitive to the frequency of the force
   excitations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are
   dominantly-inherited autoinflammatory diseases. The uncontrolled IL-1
   beta overproduction observed in these patients is the rational basis to
   treat them with anti-IL-1 drugs. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the long-lasting
   fully humanised anti-IL-1 beta monoclonal antibody canakinumab in a
   Spanish cohort of patients with CAPS.
   Methods. Clinical and laboratory data of CAPS patients carrying a
   heterozygous germline NLRP3 mutation were obtained. The initial
   treatment scheme with canakinumab was 150 mg/8 weeks administered
   subcutaneously in adult patients and 2 mg/kg/8 weeks in paediatric
   patients.
   Results. Eight unrelated patients were enrolled. Canakinumab was the
   first anti-IL-1 drug used in three of them; five were already receiving
   anakinra. The clinical response to the initial canakinumab scheme was
   positive in all patients, and was quickly observed in the first 24-72
   hours. Four required increasing the frequency and/or dose of
   canakinumab. A limited or no efficacy in those symptoms related to
   consequence of the deforming arthropathy and neurosensorial deafness was
   observed. The adverse side effects were restricted to infectious
   complications in a small percentage of patients. The treatment was well
   tolerated by all patients, with no reactions at drug site injections.
   Conclusion. Canakinumab caused fast and sustained remissions in most
   clinical and biochemical manifestations in all enrolled patients, with a
   limited efficacy in the structural lesions. Dose adjustments seem to be
   necessary for children and/or for patients with the most severe CAPS
   phenotypes. Treatment was well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse
   effects.}},

Title = {{Comparative floral spur anatomy and nectar secretion in four
   representatives of Ranunculaceae}},
Journal = {{PROTOPLASMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{252}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1587-1601}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nectaries are common in Ranunculaceae. These secretory structures,
   however, have not been studied in detail despite their importance in
   plant-animal interactions, and data relating to the structure of nectary
   spurs, which are so characteristic of several genera of this family,
   remain scarce. In order to redress this imbalance, we sought, in the
   present paper, to analyze the anatomical and ultrastructural
   organization of the nectary spurs of four representatives of
   Ranunculaceae, i.e., Aconitum lycoctonum L., Aquilegia vulgaris L.,
   Consolida regalis Gray, and Delphinium elatum L. Nectary spurs were
   examined using light, fluorescence, scanning electron, and transmission
   electron microscopy. The floral nectaries of A. lycoctonum and A.
   vulgaris are situated at the apices of the spurs, whereas in C. regalis
   and D. elatum, the nectary is located along the floor surface of the
   spurs. Nectar in C. regalis and D. elatum is exuded through
   micro-channels in the cuticle, whereas in A. lycoctonum and A. vulgaris,
   it is released by means of cell wall disruption, indicating that the
   method of nectar secretion here is holocrine. Structurally, the nectary
   of all four investigated species is quite similar, and its cells are
   typical of nectar-producing cells described in the literature. It is
   proposed that in A. lycoctonum and A. vulgaris, disruption of the cell
   wall and the release of the entire cell contents into the spur cavity
   contribute to the composition of the nectar that the latter contains,
   enriching it with cytoplasmic components. We conclude that the manner of
   nectar exudation may vary considerably between closely related plant
   species, regardless of their geographical origin and phylogeny.}},

Abstract = {{We live in the Digital Era, where national frontiers are vanishing. In
   light of cultural globalization and digital identity, a contemporary
   re-interpretation of classical notions like citizenship is imperative.
   What does it mean to be a citizen in the Digital Era? To whom can we
   assign digital citizenship status? In order to discuss these questions
   we introduce the notion of hybrid beings. Our hypothesis is that the
   dynamical feedback relation between the physical and digital
   individual's experience promotes the embodiment of a hybrid identity
   from which the hybrid being emerges. It is important to stress that the
   hybrid identities of hybrid beings are not just alter egos or avatars
   created in the digital world, but that they express a new dynamic around
   the impossibility of distinguishing between ``physical{''} and
   ``digital{''} sides of an individuals' actions. It is precisely because
   of a hybrid being's participation in a merged physical/digital world
   that we believe the notion of hybrid beings is the most suitable
   paradigm to exemplify the role of the digital citizen and digital
   citizenship.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cancer studies have shown that body mass index (BMI),
   skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and adipose tissue indexes are linked to
   overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). New
   treatments (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide cabazitaxel, radium-223,
   sipuleucel-T) have improved patient outcomes in metastatic
   castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our objective was to
   analyse whether body composition parameters exert a prognostic role in
   mCRPC patients treated with next generation of androgen receptor (AR)
   axis inhibitors (abiraterone and enzalutamide).
   Methods: All mCRPC patients from our institution who were enrolled in
   two prospective trials, assessing the efficacy of abiraterone acetate
   and the efficacy of enzalutamide, were selected. SMM, visceral and
   subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) indexes were assessed with computed
   tomography imaging by measuring cross-sectional areas of the tissues.
   Results: In the 120 patients with available data, median OS and PFS were
   respectively: 16 months (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 12-19) and 4
   months (95\% {[}CI] = 3-6). OS was associated with the SAT index: median
   survival was 15 months (95\% {[}CI] 9-18) for patients with a SAT index
   < median value and 18 months (95\% {[}CI] 13-30) for patients with a SAT
   index above (P = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, only the occurrence
   of visceral metastasis (P = 0.004), pain (P = 0.015) and SAT index (P =
   0.036) were statistically significant predictors of OS. From baseline to
   3 months, the SMM index loss was 2.49 +/- 0.44 cm(2)/m(2) (P < 0.001)
   corresponding to nearly 3.4 kg of muscle loss.
   Conclusions: High volume of SAT is independently associated with overall
   survival in mCRPC patients treated with next generation AR axis
   inhibitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When treating bovine respiratory disease, it is important to consider
   the decision to initiate treatment, the treatment regimen used, and
   whether to continue treatment. It is necessary to define the duration of
   drug exposure and when a success/failure decision will be made. No data
   are available to define the optimal duration of antimicrobial exposure.
   A pattern seen in human pneumonia studies is that shorter durations of
   therapy were equivalent with longer durations. Some studies suggest
   defining success or failure based on pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics may lead to earlier than optimal intervention. Optimal
   intervals are best defined by randomized clinical trials.}},

Title = {{Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with inflammation

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an
   increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several of the proposed
   mechanisms for the development of CVD in OSA are similar to those
   proposed for the increased risk of CVD in obesity, so that it is
   difficult to determine the influence of OSA on these pathogenic
   mechanisms in obese individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the relationship of OSA with endothelial function, oxidative stress,
   inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic profile, sympathetic nervous system
   activity, and blood pressure (BP) in obese individuals.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 53 obese adults (28 women).
   Sleep study was performed with WatchPAT 200 (Itamar Medical, Caesarea,
   Israel) and the diagnosis of OSA was made when apnea-hypopnea index
   (AHI) >= 5 events/h (n = 33). All participants underwent evaluation of:
   body adiposity, BP, plasma catecholamines, high sensitivity C-reactive
   protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, malondialdehyde, glucose, insulin, lipid
   profile, and endothelial function (EndoPAT 2000).
   Results: In univariate analysis, participants with OSA compared with
   those without OSA exhibited higher values of neck circumference,
   glucose, noradrenaline, and systolic BP. After adjustment for
   confounders, including adiposity, only glucose and hs-CRP were
   significantly higher in OSA patients. In correlation analysis, after
   controlling for confounders, AHI was positively and significantly
   associated with neck circumference and hs-CRP, while minimum 02
   saturation was associated negatively and significantly with neck
   circumference, insulin and homeostatic model assessment insulin
   resistance (HOMA-IR).
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that in obese individuals OSA is
   independently associated with inflammation and insulin resistance, but
   not with BP, plasma catecholamines and endothelial function. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Material waste from the production of autoclaved aerated concrete, a
   porous material, should be considered as a valuable byproduct for use as
   a filler material for the rubber industry. Natural rubber (NR)
   composites filled with different loading (over the range of 0-60 phr) of
   autoclaved aerated concrete waste (AACW) as a new eco-friendly material
   were produced using two roll mills and then were studied for their cure
   characteristics, mechanical and aging properties, and morphology, and
   also compared with commercial fillers, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and
   silica (SiO2). In most cases, the cure characteristics and mechanical
   and aging properties of the SiO2-filled NR composites were significantly
   better than those of the AACW- and CaCO3-filled NR composites. However,
   these properties for AACW-filled composites appeared to be higher than
   CaCO3-filled composites. The reason for this could be due to a larger
   surface area which is both porous and of an irregular shape of the AACW
   filler used. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the
   morphology of the rubber filled with SiO2 was finer and more homogenous
   compared with the rubber filled with AACW or CaCO3. Overall results
   revealed that the reinforcement ability of AACW-filled NR composites was
   generally better when compared with CaCO3-filled NR composites;
   therefore, AACW can be used effectively as a cheaper filler for
   production of rubber products where end-use properties of a rubber
   product is specifically required. (c) 2014 Society of Plastics Engineer}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces are planar structures that locally modify the polarization,
   phase and amplitude of light in reflection or transmission, thus
   enabling lithographically patterned flat optical components with
   functionalities controlled by design(1,2). Transmissive metasurfaces are
   especially important, as most optical systems used in practice operate
   in transmission. Several types of transmissive metasurface have been
   realized(3-6), but with either low transmission efficiencies or limited
   control over polarization and phase. Here, we show a metasurface
   platform based on high-contrast dielectric elliptical nanoposts that
   provides complete control of polarization and phase with subwavelength
   spatial resolution and an experimentally measured efficiency ranging
   from 72\% to 97\%, depending on the exact design. Such complete control
   enables the realization of most free-space transmissive optical elements
   such as lenses, phase plates, wave plates, polarizers, beamsplitters, as
   well as polarization-switchable phase holograms and arbitrary vector
   beam generators using the same metamaterial platform.}},

Abstract = {{In light of recent debates between affect and emotions in geography,
   this article focuses on how the emotional landscape of spatial struggles
   in Oaxaca articulated people together, thereby generating solidarities
   and a collective sociality offering the potentiality of interconnection
   that geographers of affect emphasize. Through an analysis of a women's
   march, I demonstrate how social movements move people, mobilizing them
   both physically and emotionally, with effects that go beyond a
   movement's political demands. Engaging with how emotions do
   movement-building work means going beyond a focus on the relational
   construction of emotions and arguing instead for their collective
   agency, including their power to transform participants into activists.
   Highlighting the centrality of spatial struggles and emotions to the
   shifting, mobile politics of social movements brings into sharp relief
   the importance of a situated, historical analysis for theorists
   romanticizing the emancipatory possibilities of a revolutionary
   transnational articulation between social movements.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the commonest cancer in
   humans. NMSC treatment currently includes surgery, radiation therapy,
   and topical approaches. The objective was to analyze and compare the
   outcomes, toxicity, and cosmesis of NMSC treated by two hypofractionated
   high-dose-rate (HDR) plesiotherapy techniques.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective institutional clinical study of
   134 basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinomas treated at Radiation
   Oncology Department. Lesions were treated from November 2006 to December
   2011 with a moderate hypofractionated HDR plesiotherapy using a fixed
   applicator or a customized mold.
   RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 33 months, overall disease-free
   survival at 3 and 5 years was 95.12\% and 93.36\%, respectively. For
   Leipzig applicator, disease-free survival at 3 years was 94.9\% and
   94.9\% at 5 years, for customized mold was 93.1\% at 3 years and 88\% at
   5 years. Complete regression was achieved in 98\% of lesions. Two
   lesions persisted after treatment; both had been treated by a Leipzig
   applicator. Six lesions suffered local recurrence (five Leipzig
   applicators and three molds, p = 0.404). Grade <2 acute toxicity noted
   in 57.3\% of patients. Only 2.2\% of lesions had Grade 4 acute toxicity.
   Borderline significant increase of toxicity was associated with
   customized molds (p = 0.067). Larger tumors were associated with higher
   acute skin toxicity. The cosmesis outcomes were excellent or good in
   82\% of patients, fair in 13\%, and not available in 5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated HDR plesiotherapy is an effective and
   well-tolerated treatment for NMSC with different toxicity levels
   depending on the plesiotherapy technique used. (C) 2015 American

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{489-506}},

Abstract = {{In his recent attempt to make democracy more politically hospitable to
   religion, Habermas calls for the potential contributions of religion to
   democratic politics not to be neglected. He simultaneously calls for
   translating religious meanings into neutral reasons as a way of
   including them at the level of formal politics and for maintaining the
   necessity of an institutional translational proviso to immunize the
   neutral character of the state. This article presents three arguments.
   First, what Habermas effectively calls for is not conventional
   translation in which meaning is transferred from one language
   (signification system) into another. Rather, his call is for an anasemic
   translation which is an operation of de-signification of the truth
   contents of religious contributions and then a re-signification. Second,
   because Habermas calls for translation, he necessarily runs into the
   aporia of translation in the sense that certain aspects of religion are
   untranslatable into his generally acceptable language. Therefore,
   Habermas' translation proviso creates an asymmetry between religious and
   non-religious citizens, which is detrimental to the conditions of
   political legitimacy. Third, it is suggested that to address this
   problem the citizens must adopt an ethos of hospitality toward the
   untranslatable of religion as part of the conditions of political
   legitimacy.}},

   There was a delay of nine months to get a diagnosis in advanced stage,
   and 72 in early stage (p = 0.931). Three of the patients with advanced
   stage and two with early stage were from Nuevo Leon (Mexico) and the
   rest were foreign (p = 0.567). In the group with advanced stage, two had
   thyroid cancer familiar history, and none in the early stage group (p =
   0,452). Nine patients in advanced stage and three in early stage
   presented thyroid nodule as the first sign of illness. Six patients in
   advanced stage and one in early stage presented goiter (p = 0,590). None
   of the studied patients had radiation history. Six patients in advanced
   stage and one in early stage suffered from Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (p =
   0.590). Eleven in advanced stage and one in early stage had papillary
   histologic variety. Four in advanced stage and three in early stage had
   papillary histologic variety with a follicular patter (p = 0.083). Eight
   patients presented lung metastasis at time of diagnosis (p = 0.061).
   Conclusions: There are no factors associated with advanced stage thyroid
   cancer in pediatric populations. Although half of studied patients
   presented lung metastasis, treatment response and survival is
   satisfactory}},

Abstract = {{Titanium has been widely used as a preferred metallic biomaterial for
   bone tissue engineering scaffolds. So far, a number of techniques have
   been developed to produce porous-structured titanium, including the
   space holder method. However, a number of technological challenges are
   still present, such as the difficulties in controlling the geometry
   changes of space-holding particles during the compaction of
   titanium/space holder powder mixtures. In this research, a series of
   experiments were performed to investigate the compression behaviors of
   titanium/carbamide powder mixtures and determine maximum compacting
   pressures, considering the specific net energy expended during the
   process, the at-pressure relative density of powder compacts and the
   yield pressure derived from the load-displacement plots of powder
   compression cycles. The results showed that the titanium and carbamide
   powders exhibited dissimilar compression behaviors and
   titanium/carbamide powder mixtures exhibited intermediate compression
   behaviors of the monolithic titanium and carbamide powders. The yield
   pressures of titanium/carbamide powder mixtures, obtained from the
   Heckel plots and used as a measure for the appropriate compacting
   pressures, decreased with increasing volume fraction of carbamide in the
   mixture. The rule of mixtures was found to be applicable to predict the
   compression behaviors and the appropriate compacting pressures of
   titanium/carbamide powder mixtures. However, limitations of this model
   were recognized in the case of compacting mixtures with large volume
   fractions of carbamide space-holding particles (x > 50\%) and at high
   pressures (P > 300 MPa). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to compare serum and urinary HER2/neu levels between
   healthy control group and patients with non-muscle invasive bladder
   cancer. Additionally, we evaluated relationship of HER2/neu levels with
   tumor stage, grade, recurrence and progression.
   Materials and Methods: Fourty-four patients with primary non-muscle
   invasive bladder tumors (Group 2) and 40 healthy control group (Group 1)
   were included the study. Blood and urinary samples were collected from
   all patients and HER2/neu levels were measured by ELISA method. Blood
   and urinary HER2/neu levels and additionally, ratio of urinary HER2/neu
   levels to urinary creatinine levels were recorded. Demographic data and
   tumor characteristics were recorded.
   Results: Mean serum HER2/neu levels were similar between two groups and
   statistically significant difference wasn't observed. Urinary HER2/neu
   levels were significantly higher in group 2 than group 1. Ratio of
   urinary HER2/neu to urinary creatinine was significantly higher in group
   2 than group 1, (p=0,021). Serum and urinary HER2/neu levels were not
   associated with tumor stage, grade, recurrence and progression while
   ratio of urinary HER2/neu to urinary creatinin levels were significantly
   higher in high-grade tumors. HER2/neu, the sensitivity of the test was
   found to be 20.5\%, and the specificity was 97.5\%, also for the urinary
   HER2/neu/urinary creatinine ratio, the sensitivity and specificity of
   the test were found to be 31.8\% and 87.5\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Urinary HER2/neu and ratio of urinary creatinine urine were
   significantly higher in patients with bladder cancer compared to healthy
   subjects. Large series and controlled studies are needed for use as a
   tumor marker.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a volatility-based capital asset pricing model (V-CAPM) in
   which asset betas change discretely with respect to changes in
   investors' expectations regarding near-term aggregate volatility. Using
   a novel measure to proxy uncertainty about expected changes in aggregate
   volatility, i.e. monthly range of the VIX index (RVIX), we find that
   portfolio betas change significantly when uncertainty about aggregate
   volatility expectations is beyond a certain threshold level. Due to
   changes in their market betas, small and value stocks are perceived as
   riskier than their big and growth counterparts in bad times, when
   uncertainty about aggregate volatility expectations is high. The
   proposed model yields a positive and significant market risk premium
   during periods when investors do not expect significant uncertainty in
   near-term aggregate volatility. Our findings support a volatility-based
   time-varying risk explanation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Transplant nephrectomy (TN) is associated with significant morbidity and
   mortality and influences the outcome of subsequent renal
   transplantation. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for
   TN in a single transplant center in the United Kingdom and to determine
   the complication rate, effect on relisting and re-transplantation. We
   studied all the TNs in our center from January 2000 to December 2011.
   Detailed information including cause of allograft failure and reason for
   TN were analyzed. Of 602 renal transplants performed at our center
   during the period of the study, 42 TNs were performed on 38 (6\%)
   patients (24 men and 14 women). The median age of the patients at the
   time of transplantation who subsequently underwent TN was 56 years
   (range: 28-73 years) and 71\% of the allografts were donated after
   circulatory death. The mean human leucocyte antigen mismatch for these
   patients was 2.3. The most commonly used immunosuppression was a
   combination of prednisolone, mycophenolate and tacrolimus, which was
   used in 50\% of the patients. Twenty-five (60\%) of the TNs in this
   series were for allografts failing during the first month of
   transplantation. The most common indication for the TN was graft
   thrombosis (50\%), with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 9.5\%
   and a morbidity rate of 31\%. Seven of 19 patients listed underwent
   successful re-transplantation. Although TN is associated with a risk of
   significant morbidity and mortality, it does not preclude from listing
   for re-transplantation. The difficulty of access to complete information
   about transplant failures and TN highlights the need for a national
   registry.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, hybrid montmorillonite/cellulose nanowhiskers (MMT/CNW)
   reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposites were produced through
   solution casting. The CNW filler was first isolated from
   microcrystalline cellulose by chemical swelling technique. The partial
   replacement of MMT with CNW in order to produce PLA/MMT/CNW hybrid
   nanocomposites was performed at 5 parts per hundred parts of polymer
   (phr) fillers content, based on highest tensile strength values as
   reported in our previous study. MMT were partially replaced with various
   amounts of CNW (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 phr). The tensile, thermal,
   morphological and biodegradability properties of PLA hybrid
   nanocomposites were investigated. The highest tensile strength of hybrid
   nanocomposites was obtained with the combination of 4 phr MMT and 1 phr
   CNW. Interestingly, the ductility of hybrid nanocomposites increased
   significantly by 79\% at this formulation. The Young's modulus increased
   linearly with increasing CNW content. Thermogravimetric analysis
   illustrated that the partial replacement of MMT with CNW filler enhanced
   the thermal stability of the PLA. This is due to the relatively good
   dispersion of fillers in the hybrid nanocomposites samples as revealed
   by transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, partial replacements
   of MMT with CNW improved the biodegradability of hybrid nanocomposites
   compared to PLA/MMT and neat PLA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The spectral properties of an electromagnetically induced grating that
   is based on the spatial modulation of the Raman gain in the field of a
   standing pump wave in a three-level homogeneous medium have been
   discussed. It has been shown that, by varying the intensity or the
   frequency of the pump field, one can control the transmission and
   reflection spectra, while the transmission and reflection coefficients
   of the probe (Raman) wave can simultaneously be greater than unity. The
   influence of the nonideality of the standing wave on the spectral
   characteristics of the grating has been studied.}},

Abstract = {{In industrialized areas, the highest contribution to the fine and
   ultrafine particles comes from anthropogenic activities, namely from
   emissions of industrial combustion processes and traffic-related
   emissions. Peri-urban forests can act as a sink of these compounds
   through different mechanisms, helping to ameliorate air quality. Here,
   we present the preliminary results of a study to investigate the
   patterns of the aerosol particle distribution and their correlations
   with meteorological parameters. Concentration of particles with size
   down 2.5 nm in diameter was continuously measured above an evergreen
   Mediterranean forest from January to June 2014 inside the presidential
   estate of Castelporziano. Results indicate a strong effect of the
   boundary layer height on particle dispersion that determines higher
   particle concentration level at night and then diffusion in cleaner air
   during the day when turbulence enhances the vertical mixing. We found a
   pronounced reduction of particle concentration during the rain events,
   supporting the conclusion that rain events represent the major mechanism
   of particle deposition. By correlating wind direction and particle
   concentration, we hypothesize large marine aerosol contribution
   overlapping the anthropogenic sources, although we cannot discriminate
   yet between biogenic and anthropogenic origins of particulate.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose an inexpensive laboratory practice for an
   introductory physics course laboratory for any grade of science and
   engineering study. This practice was very well received by our students,
   where a smartphone (iOS, Android, or Windows) is used together with mini
   magnets (similar to those used on refrigerator doors), a 20 cm long
   school rule, a paper, and a free application (app) that needs to be
   downloaded and installed that measures magnetic fields using the
   smartphone's magnetic field sensor or magnetometer. The apps we have
   used are: Magnetometer (iOS), Magnetometer Metal Detector, and Physics
   Toolbox Magnetometer (Android). Nothing else is needed. Cost of this
   practice: free. The main purpose of the practice is that students
   determine the dependence of the component x of the magnetic field
   produced by different magnets (including ring magnets and sphere
   magnets). We obtained that the dependency of the magnetic field with the
   distance is of the form x(-3), in total agreement with the theoretical
   analysis. The secondary objective is to apply the technique of least
   squares fit to obtain this exponent and the magnetic moment of the
   magnets, with the corresponding absolute error.}},

Title = {{Disappointing Success of Electrical Cardioversion for New-Onset Atrial
   Fibrillation in Cardiosurgical ICU Patients}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the success of electrical cardioversion for the
   treatment of new-onset atrial fibrillation in critically ill patients
   and to evaluate the stability of sinus rhythm in responders during the
   subsequent 24 hours.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Twelve-bed cardiosurgical ICU at a university hospital.
   Patients: Seventy-two consecutive patients with postoperative new-onset
   atrial fibrillation (< 7 d of duration) treated by electrical
   cardioversion.
   Interventions: Electrical cardioversion using synchronized biphasic
   shocks.
   Measurements and Main Results: During 144 electrical cardioversions, 209
   shocks were delivered to 72 patients. Maximal energy (200 J) was used in
   85\% of shocks. Electrical cardioversion immediately restored sinus
   rhythm in 102 sessions (71\%). Pretreatment with amiodarone did not
   increase the success rates. During the follow-up, the percentages of
   sinus rhythm decreased from 43\% after 1 hour to 23\% after 24 hours.
   However, at ICU discharge, 54 patients (75\%) were in sinus rhythm. Of
   the 54 patients in sinus rhythm, only 18 (33\%) converted to sinus
   rhythm after repeated cardioversions, whereas the remaining 36 (66\%)
   did so spontaneously or with amiodarone.
   Conclusions: Biphasic electrical cardioversion in cardiosurgical ICU
   patients was immediately successful in restoring sinus rhythm in 71\% of
   sessions. However, early relapse of atrial fibrillation was common in
   the 24-hour follow-up. At ICU discharge, the majority of patients were
   in sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of repetitive electrical cardioversion
   in restoring sinus rhythm was disappointing.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the allelic and genotypic
   profiles of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5A
   (STAT5A), Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptors (FSHR) and Luteinizing
   Hormone Receptor (LHR) genes in five indigenous cattle breeds in Turkey.
   For this purpose, a total of 329 cattle from East Anatolian Red (EAR),
   South Anatolian Red (SAR), Turkish Grey (TG), Anatolian Black (AB) and
   Zavot were genotyped using by PCR-RFLP method. A 215 bp fragment of
   STAT5A, a 306 bp fragment of FSHR and a 303 bp fragment of LHR were
   amplified and digested with AvaI, AluI, and HhaI restriction enzymes,
   respectively. In this study two types of alleles C and T for STAT5A, C
   and G for FSHR and C and T for LHR were observed. The highest
   frequencies for STAT5A-C and STAT5A-T alleles were estimated for the
   Zavot and TG breeds (0.86) and the EAR breed (0.29) respectively. The
   highest frequency for FSHR-C and FSHR-G alleles was estimated for the
   Zavot breed (0.72) and the AB and SAR breeds (0.35) respectively. The
   highest frequency for LHR-C and LHR-T alleles was estimated for the EAR
   breed (0.75) and the AB breed (0.39) respectively. According to F (ST)
   values, a small level of genetic diversity was found among five cattle
   breeds. The F (ST) value was calculated 0.019 between AB and Zavot. And,
   the value was significant (p < 0.001), while the other F (ST) values
   were not significant. According to the genetic distance values (Nei),
   the highest genetic distance was found between AB and TG while the
   smallest genetic distance was found between Zavot and TG. The chi-square
   test showed that the TG and Zavot breeds were in Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium (HWE) for STAT5A gene; the EAR, SAR, TG and Zavot breeds
   were in HWE for FSHR gene and the EAR, SAR and TG breeds were in HWE for
   LHR gene. In conclusion, further investigation is required to determine
   the correlation of the FSHR and LHR genes with early puberty for the
   improvement of sexual precocity, and it is considered that the STAT5A
   gene may be used to improve the milk yield and milk yield trails of
   local cattle breeds, including those indigenous to Turkey.}},

   showed proteinase activity, 95.9\% showed DNase activity, 93.9\%
   produced siderophores, 85.7\% showed lecithinase activity, 53.1\% showed
   hemolysin activity and 30.6\% produced slime. Furthermore, cytotoxic
   (act, aerA and hlyA) and cytotonic enterotoxin (alt and ast) genes were
   found in 21 (42.9\%) strains. The strains carried at least one
   enterotoxin gene. Only one strain (A.hydrophila) carried all five genes.
   The act gene was the most frequently observed gene among all strains
   (22.4\%). In an antimicrobial susceptibility test, 100\% of strains were
   resistant to ampicillin followed by vancomycin (91.8\%). Multidrug
   resistance to at least three or more agents was observed in 66.7\% of
   A.hydrophila, 61.3\% of A.caviae and 33.3\% of A.veronii biovar sobria
   strains.
   Practical ApplicationsAeromonas spp. are ubiquitous aquatic organisms
   and are commonly isolated from food and water. They have emerged as an
   important human pathogen because of diarrhea related to foodborne
   outbreaks. Furthermore, these opportunistic bacteria have been
   associated with various human infections, such as peritonitis,
   endocarditis, septicemia and urinary tract infections. These bacteria
   are also predominantly pathogenic to aquatic animals, especially fish.
   This study indicates that the presence of motile Aeromonas spp. with
   virulence potential in meat may be a threat to public health. Thus, the
   potential health risk due to the consumption of inadequately cooked fish
   and ground beef harboring motile Aeromonas species should not be
   underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Permeable pavements with gravel base courses promote infiltration of
   stormwater and can improve water quality. However, finer grained
   particles on the surface of the pavements or their surrounding areas may
   enter the underlying void spaces along with stormwater due to their
   wash-off behavior and their smaller size. After entry into the void
   space, the smaller particles can act as a barrier that may reduce the
   infiltration over time. This can reduce the functionality of the
   pavement and can alter water quality by either sorbing or leaching
   chemicals present in the infiltrating stormwater. Factors affecting the
   particulate deposition in the void spaces include shape and size,
   hydrophobicity, natural organic matter, metals, and the surface charge
   of the particulate as well as the media. Red sand particles of three
   sizes < 10, 10-25 and 30-50 mu m with crankcase oil and without
   crankcase oil were mixed with semi-artificial stormwater and passed at a
   constant flow rate through a glass column containing aggregate with and
   without being pre-soaked in crankcase oil. This study focused on the
   resulting transport behavior of particles less than 50 mu m in diameter,
   which were generally not picked up by street sweeping. The results show
   that the particles with and without oil transported in the column at
   different scales. The presence of oil in the infiltration media and in
   the stormwater had a nearly 10 fold higher risk of becoming clogged than
   when no oil was present. Similarly the calculated serviceable life of
   pavement was reduced by a similar factor when oil was present.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption cooling systems employing membrane based components provide
   an interesting opportunity to use the technology for small scale
   applications. Steady-state heat and mass transfer analyses of a
   water-lithium bromide membrane based absorber are performed. CFD
   (computational fluid dynamics) tool ANSYS/FLUENT 14.0 is used to perform
   the simulation and investigate the behaviour of the heat and mass
   transfer mechanisms at local levels in the channels. Results show that
   the solution film thickness is an important parameter which
   significantly affects the mass transfer mechanism. It was observed that
   the absorption rate increased by a factor of 3 when the solution channel
   thickness was reduced from 2 mm to 0.5 mm. In addition, the absorption
   rate was increased by a factor of 2.5 when the solution inlet flow
   velocity was increased from 0.00118 m/s to 0.00472 m/s. The solution
   film thickness and velocity can be independently controlled in
   plate-and-frame membrane based absorbers. Therefore to design a compact
   and efficient plate-and-frame membrane absorber with water as a
   refrigerant, an optimum value of 0.5 mm for the solution channel
   thickness is suggested and a solution inlet velocity of about 0.005 m/s
   is recommended to achieve high absorption rates with acceptable pressure
   drop along the solution channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Optical packets contention in optical packet switched COPS) networks can
   lead to Optical packet loss which will reduce network performance. In
   this paper, a new contention avoidance technique is proposed which
   utilizes the combination of traffic shaping at ingress switches and a
   time slot reservation technique using the coordination of egress
   switches. This novel protocol is called egress coordination OPS (EGCOPS)
   suitable for buffer-less slotted-OPS networks. Simulation results show
   that the EGCOPS outperforms the original slotted-OPS protocol in terms
   of optical packet loss rate (PLR), with or without using wavelength
   conversion. However, the packet shaping feature of EGCOPS can increase
   the delay of users' packets at the queues of ingress switches. There is
   a trade-off between the PLR improvement and the additional delay applied
   to the users' packets. Still, EGCOPS parameters can be selected in such
   a way that additional delay can be tolerable by users' applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We have performed an experimental and modeling study of the partial
   melting behavior of the HED parent body and of the fractional
   crystallization of liquids derived from its mantle. We estimated the
   mantle composition by assuming chondritic ratios of refractory
   lithophile elements, adjusting the Mg\# and core size to match the
   density and moment of inertia of Vesta, and the compositions of Mg-rich
   olivines found in diogenites. The liquidus of a mantle with Mg\#
   (=100{*}{[}Mg/(Mg+Fe)]) 80 is similar to 1625 degrees C and, under
   equilibrium conditions, the melt crystallizes olivine alone until it is
   joined by orthopyroxene at 1350 degrees C. We synthesized the melt from
   our 1350 degrees C experiment and simulated its fractional
   crystallization path. Orthopyroxene crystallizes until it is replaced by
   pigeonite at 1200 degrees C. Liquids become eucritic and crystal
   assemblages resemble diogenites below 1250 degrees C. MELTS correctly
   predicts the olivine liquidus but overestimates the orthopyroxene
   liquidus by similar to 70 degrees C. Predicted melt compositions are in
   reasonable agreement with those generated experimentally. We used MELTS
   to determine that the range of mantle compositions that can produce
   eucritic liquids and diogenitic solids in a magma oceanmodel is Mg\#
   75-80 (with chondritic ratios of refractory elements). A mantle with
   Mg\# similar to 70 can produce eucrites and diogenites through
   sequential partial melting.}},

Title = {{Combined Versus Detailed Evaluation Components in Medical Student Global

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: To determine if there is any correlation between any of
   the 10 individual components of a global rating index on an emergency
   medicine (EM) student clerkship evaluation form. If there is
   correlation, to determine if a weighted average of highly correlated
   components loses predictive value for the final clerkship grade.
   Methods: This study reviewed medical student evaluations collected over
   two years of a required fourth-year rotation in EM. Evaluation cards,
   comprised of a detailed 10-part evaluation, were completed after each
   shift. We used a correlation matrix between evaluation category average
   scores, using Spearman's rho, to determine if there was any correlation
   of the grades between any of the 10 items on the evaluation form.
   Results: A total of 233 students completed the rotation over the
   two-year period of the study. There were strong correlations (>0.80)
   between assessment components of medical knowledge, history taking,
   physical exam, and differential diagnosis. There were also strong
   correlations between assessment components of team rapport, patient
   rapport, and motivation. When these highly correlated were combined to
   produce a four-component model, linear regression demonstrated similar
   predictive power in terms of final clerkship grade (R-2=0.71,
   CI95=0.65-0.77 and R-2=0.69, CI95=0.63-0.76 for the full and reduced
   models respectively).
   Conclusion: This study revealed that several components of the
   evaluation card had a high degree of correlation. Combining the
   correlated items, a reduced model containing four items (clinical
   skills, interpersonal skills, procedural skills, and documentation) was
   as predictive of the student's clinical grade as the full 10-item
   evaluation. Clerkship directors should be aware of the performance of
   their individual global rating scales when assessing medical student
   performance, especially if attempting to measure greater than four
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Arboreal animals often move on compliant branches, which may deform
   substantially under loads, absorbing energy. Energy stored in a
   compliant substrate may be returned to the animal or it may be lost. In
   all cases studied so far, animals jumping from a static start lose all
   of the energy imparted to compliant substrates and performance is
   reduced. Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) are particularly
   capable arboreal jumpers, and we hypothesized that these animals would
   be able to recover energy from perches of varying compliance. In spite
   of large deflections of the perches and consequent substantial energy
   absorption, frogs were able to regain some of the energy lost to the
   perch during the recoil. Takeoff velocity was robust to changes in
   compliance, but was lower than when jumping from flat surfaces. This
   highlights the ability of animals to minimize energy loss and maintain

Abstract = {{In the context of assisted reproduction, the term ovarian aging is often
   used to refer to declining potential of ovaries to produce oocytes in
   adequate number or quality in response to controlled ovarian stimulation
   (COS). Different aspects of COS have been modified with the intention to
   increase the number and quality of oocytes obtained for in vitro
   fertilization. In the setting of ovarian aging, suppression of the
   luteinizing hormone (LH) surge with gonadotropin-releasing hormone
   (GnRH) antagonist or short GnRH agonist protocol and stimulation with a
   daily gonadotropin dosage of300 IU/day seem to be appropriate first
   choices, and there is a strong need for well-designed randomized
   controlled trials investigating effects of addition of LH activity,
   estradiol priming, transdermal testosterone administration, and growth
   hormone supplementation. Given the lack of high-quality evidence showing
   effectiveness of one approach over another, other factors such as
   duration of stimulation, total gonadotropin consumption and cost of
   medication, patient friendliness, and possible side effect profiles must
   be considered in tailoring the COS protocol according to each
   individual's needs and desires.}},

Abstract = {{For spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, the IEEE 802.22
   standard requires the detection of primary signals with a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as -20 dB and receiver sensitivity as
   low as -116 dBm. Under such low-SNR levels, the performance of a
   conventional energy detector is analyzed in this paper. The analysis
   includes novel expressions for missed-detection probability and area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Thus, a unified
   framework covering fading channels, square-law diversity combining, and
   cooperative spectrum-sensing scenarios is developed. The detection
   threshold is optimized to minimize the total error rate subject to
   bounded false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities, which
   outperforms traditional detection threshold selection. Numerical results
   and Monte Carlo simulation results with the IEEE 802.22 sensing
   requirements are provided and discussed.}},

   temperatures of 165 degrees C and 175 degrees C for periods of 2 and 4 h
   with a total of 4 variations. With respect to the wood type, the samples
   of beech wood yielded the highest results for pull-off strength, while
   fir wood yielded the lowest. With respect to the varnish types, the
   highest pull-off strength was found in the samples of synthetic
   varnished beech (5,452 with a 37.2\% improvement) at 175 degrees C heat
   treatment for 4 h, while the lowest results were obtained in the samples

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDCheese whey is a rich by-product in nutritional terms,
   possessing components with high biological value, excellent functional
   properties, and an inert flavour profile. In the present study,
   mozzarella cheese whey was ultra-filtrated to remove lactose and
   mineral. The retentate was hydrolysed with food-grade enzyme alcalase
   and the hydrolysis conditions (pH, temperature and time) were optimised
   for maximum antioxidant activity using response surface methodology.
   RESULTSWhey protein hydrolysed for 8 h at pH 9 and 55 degrees C showed a
   maximum antioxidant activity of 1.18 0.015 mu mol Trolox mg(-1) protein.
   The antioxidant peptides were further enriched by ultra-filtration
   through a 3 kDa membrane. Seven peptides - -Lg f(123-131), -Lg
   f(122-131), -Lg f(124-131), -Lg f(123-134) , -Lg f(122-131), -Lg
   f(96-100) and -Lg f(94-100) - were identified by LC-MS/MS in the 3 kDa
   permeate of the hydrolysate. The incorporation of whey protein
   hydrolysate (WPH) in lemon whey drink (5-10 g L-1) increased the
   antioxidant activity from 76\% to 90\% as compared to control.
   CONCLUSIONHydrolysis of ultra-filtrated retentate of whey can be an
   energy- and cost-effective method for the direct production of WPH from
   whey compared to the industrial production of WPH from whey protein
   concentrate. This study suggests that WPH with good nutritional and
   biological properties can be effectively used in health-promoting foods
   as a biofunctional ingredient. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{The leaves of Catha edulis Vahl. Endl., known as Khat, are widely used
   as a ``natural amphetamine{''} stimulant in Africa and in the Arabian
   Peninsula. In recent years, there has been an increase in the amounts
   exported to the USA, Australia and Europe. Although the dried, powdered
   form of the young and mature leaves, as well as samples from different
   geographical origins, have similar physical appearance, they have not
   been proven to exhibit equipotent stimulatory activity. In this study,
   powdered young and mature leaves were differentiated using vibrational
   spectroscopy, which included mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR)
   spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and ultra performance
   liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC MS), in combination with
   chemometric data analysis. Samples originating from Ethiopia or South
   Africa could also be distinguished using chemometric models constructed
   from HSI data. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal
   projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was
   successfully applied to classify powdered Khat samples according to
   their geographical origin and level of maturity. The OPLS-DA model
   constructed from the MIR and UPLC MS data displayed the ability to
   clearly distinguish between young and mature leaves, as illustrated by
   the model statistics (R(2)Xcum and Q(2)cum >80\% and (RY)-Y-2> 90\%).
   Shortwave infrared hyperspectral imaging could distinguish Khat samples
   from two distinct geographical regions with good model statistics
   (R(2)Xcum = 0.91 and Q(2)cum = 0.92) and discriminate between the
   maturity levels (R(2)Xcum = 0.85 and Q(2)cum = 0.80). These models could
   prove valuable as rapid techniques for identifying confiscated Khat in
   forensic environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Osseous lesions of the glenoid cavity after anterior
   dislocation of the shoulder joint are a common accompanying pathology.
   The incidence ranges from 41\% after first time dislocations to 90\%
   with recurrent dislocations. Investigations searching for possible
   reasons for unsatisfactory results of Bankart operations with soft
   tissue stabilization alone have shown that in most cases such osseous
   lesions had not been taken into account when planning the individual
   surgical procedures.
   Diagnosis. Conventional x-ray imaging remains the main diagnostic tool
   for treatment of shoulder dislocations; however, assessment of the
   osseous integrity of the glenoid cavity can be problematic even with
   additional images. Therefore, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the
   shoulder joint is recommended even after first time dislocations.
   Therapy. If an osseous lesion of the glenoid cavity is diagnosed in
   time, refixation either by suture anchors or screws is indicated
   depending on the fragment size. This allows anatomical reconstruction of
   the glenoid cavity and most likely results in a stable shoulder joint.
   With chronic defects of the glenoid cavity and partially resorbed
   osseous fragments, bony augmentation either by the iliac crest is
   required to achieve permanent stability.
   Conclusion. Exact assessment of the osseous condition of the glenoid
   cavity is crucial for planning further therapeutic steps. In this
   respect a CT scan is recommended even after first time dislocation.
   Thus, early refixation of such fragments can avoid the possible
   necessity of autologous bone augmentation either by coracoid transfer or
   iliac crest graft.}},

   self-tapping screws with continuous threads and long embedment length
   being used as reinforcement in glue-laminated timber elements}},

Abstract = {{The use of self-tapping screws with continuous threads to reinforce and
   join timbers represents an effective, simple and economic method for the
   construction of slender and filigree timber structures. The high
   withdrawal resistance of the screws as well as its continuous bond with
   the wood enables an effect similar to steel reinforcement in concrete
   structures. To investigate the bond behaviour, the force transfer and
   the anchorage length of self-tapping screws several tests have been
   realized at the Chair of Structures and Structural Design in cooperation
   with the Institute for Building Material Research of the RWTH Aachen
   University. The experimental investigations include more than 160
   pull-out tests of screws with long embedment length and over 84 load
   distributions tests. In addition, several tests displaying the effect of
   longitudinal cracks in the surrounding wood as well as the effect of the
   screw tip have been realized. Through various analyses of the bond
   behaviour, the experimental investigations form the basis for the
   calibration and evaluation of the numerical models and allow a
   prediction of the force transfer of the screws in glue-laminated
   elements. Design rules that enable the safe and economic application of
   the self-tapping screws as reinforcement in timber elements have been
   derived from the knowledge obtained in the experimental and numerical
   investigations. This paper, which results from a research project funded
   by the German Research Foundation, presents the results of
   investigations on the bond behavior of self-tapping screws in
   gluelaminated timber elements. Part 1 elaborates on the experimental
   investigations whereas, part 2 illustrates the numerical analyses and
   presents a bond model, which enables the design of the transfer length
   and the safe application of the screws as reinforcement in timber
   elements.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the out-of-phase thermomechanical fatigue (OP-TMF)
   behavior of a cast aluminum-silicon-magnesium alloy, the A356.0 alloy
   which has been widely used in diesel engine cylinder heads, is compared
   to room-temperature and high-temperature low cycle fatigue (RT-, HT-LCF)
   behaviors. For this purpose, strain/temperature-controlled isothermal
   and non-isothermal fatigue tests were performed based on realistic
   loading conditions in cylinder heads. Fatigue tests results showed that
   the plastic strain increased during cycles under constant mechanical
   strain amplitude, while the specimen failed. Under LCF loadings, the
   cyclic hardening occurred at low temperatures for the A356.0 alloy and
   the cyclic softening occurred at high temperatures, as it was also
   observed in TMF tests. The radial and longitudinal temperature gradients
   during TMF tests were almost 2 and 3 degrees C, respectively. Comparing
   stress-strain hysteresis loops, tensile stresses at minimum temperatures
   under TMF loadings were more than tensile stresses at LCF cases, due to
   the out-of-phase loading condition in TMF tests. In this state, maximum
   temperatures occurred within compressive regimes and minimum
   temperatures occurred at tensile loads. In general, TMF lifetimes were
   less than LCF ones due to severe conditions and the temperature
   deviation in TMF tests.}},

Abstract = {{Carcinosarcoma (CS) of the uterus is rare and accounts for 1-2\% of all
   uterine malignancies, occur commonly in postmenopausal women. These are
   highly aggressive tumors with poor prognosis and often present at

   of endometrial carcinoma from 1 to 2 cases per 1000 women/ year and of
   uterine sarcoma from 0.04 to 0.17 cases per 1000 women/ year. TAM has
   weakly estrogenic properties that can produce endometrial cell
   proliferation and, consequently, TAM use increases the risk of
   endometrial cancer by approximately two-to three-fold. Currently, no
   consensus is present regarding the management of Uterine CS. However,
   surgery plays an important role in the management along with
   chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy as an adjuvant. We report a case of a
   woman who developed malignant mixed mullerian tumor of uterus after
   taking TAM for 6 years as adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To better understand clinical and epidemiologic patterns of
   blastomycosis, we report on a large series of blastomycosis in Indiana.
   METHODS: All microbiologically and histopathologically confirmed cases
   of blastomycosis from four hospitals serving Central Indiana from 1985
   to 2014 were identified. Available data were collected. Data on
   population estimates, annual precipitation, and construction in Indiana
   were evaluated for correlations with incidence rates of blastomycosis.
   RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were identified. The mean age was 44.4
   years; 27\% had diabetes mellitus, and 16\% were immunosuppressed. Most
   presented with pneumonia (90\%); 48\% had extrapulmonary disease (CNS
   involvement in 9\%), and 15\% developed ARDS. Cultures, cytopathology,
   and histopathology were positive in 86\%, 27\%, and 85\% of the sample,
   respectively, and fungal antigen was positive in 76\%. Amphotericin B
   was administered in 49\%, and 87\% received an azole. Total mortality
   was 12\%. Immunosuppression (OR = 3.0), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.9),
   and multilobar pneumonia (OR = 2.9) were associated with increased
   likelihood of ICU admission. There was a significant increase in
   incidence over time in Marion County. There was no correlation with
   amount of precipitation, but the rise in incidence coincided with a 2005
   state initiative to expand Indiana's highway infrastructure.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of blastomycosis in Central Indiana may be on
   the rise. Physicians in endemic areas should be aware of the potentially
   fulminant consequences of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning in higher education can be of great relevance in effective
   life-long learning education for sustainable development in a population
   of students who are simultaneously full time employees. The aim of this
   research was to assess the Education of Sustainable Development
   effectiveness through e-learning in higher education in a case study.
   The expectations and experience of students who enrolled in more than
   one programme in environmental and/or sustainability science (bachelor,
   master, and doctorate), offered by Universidade Aberta, the Portuguese
   Distance Learning University, were analysed. The six dimensions analysed
   were: general expectations; learning quality; teaching resources,
   pedagogical tools and evaluation; acquired competences in education for
   sustainable development; satisfaction and interactions; and reasons to
   pursue enrolment in a new programme at Universidade Aberta. Data was
   collected using semi-structured qualitative interviews. The results
   showed that the surveyed students felt that they attained a high level
   of motivation and satisfaction, and had reached an effective learning
   outcome of knowledge, competences, values, attitudes and behaviour in
   environment and/or sustainability sciences. For these reasons they were
   motivated to return to Universidade Aberta and enrol for further
   training in the sustainability area. These results are built upon
   previous work developed by the authors, and allow us to conclude that
   formal e-learning programmes can provide an effective alternative to
   face-to-face training, allowing students to pursue their studies, in a
   flexible, collaborative and interactive way, whilst holding down full
   time jobs. In this way, Education for Sustainable Development in an
   e-learning regime can contribute to, and have a role in, the transition
   to sustainable societal patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Sjogren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the
   exocrine glands associated with cardiovascular events. We aimed to
   evaluate postoperative complications in patients with Sjogren syndrome
   undergoing noncardiac surgery. Specifically, we tested the primary
   hypothesis that patients with Sjogren syndrome have a greater risk of
   postoperative cardiovascular complications than those without the
   disease. Our secondary hypotheses were that patients with Sjogren
   syndrome are at greater risk of thromboembolic complications,
   microcirculatory complications, and mortality.
   METHODS: We obtained censuses of 2009 to 2010 inpatient hospital
   discharges across 7 states. Sjogren syndrome was identified by the
   present-on-admission diagnosis code 710.2. Each Sjogren n syndrome
   discharge was propensity matched to 4 control discharges. A generalized
   linear model was used to compare matched Sjogren syndrome patients and
   controls on risk of in-hospital cardiovascular complications,
   thromboembolic complications, microcirculatory complications, and
   mortality.
   RESULTS: Among 5.5 million qualifying discharges, our final matched
   sample contained 22,785 matched discharges, including 4557 with Sjogren
   syndrome. Sixty-six (1.45\%) of the matched discharges with Sjogren
   syndrome and 213 (1.17\%) of the matched controls had associated
   in-hospital cardiovascular complications. The adjusted odds ratio (99\%
   confidence interval) was estimated at 1.14 (0.79-1.64), which was not
   statistically significant (P = 0.35). There were no significant
   differences in the odds of in-hospital thromboembolic complications
   (1.12 {[}0.82-1.53]; P = 0.36), in the odds of in-hospital
   microcirculatory complications (0.98 {[}0.77-1.26]; P = 0.86), or in the
   odds of in-hospital mortality (1.11 {[}0.76-1.61]; P = 0.49).
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Sjogren syndrome does not place patients at
   an increased risk for postoperative complications or in-hospital
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes phase-locked-loop (PLL) algorithms, which are
   employed to improve the performance related to the estimation of the
   phase angle, as well as the frequency, in three-phase systems under
   utility voltage disturbances. The proposed PLL schemes are based on the
   three-phase instantaneous active power (3pPLL), which is composed of
   non-autonomous adaptive filters (AFs) operating in conjunction with a
   positive-sequence detectors (PSDs), yielding the AF-PSD-3pPLL algorithms
   operating in both three-phase (abc-axis) and two-phase (-axis)
   stationary reference frames. The AFs are used to extract the fundamental
   components of the utility voltages, allowing an adequate rejection of
   harmonic disturbances, whereas the PSDs at fundamental utility frequency
   are employed for rejecting the power quality problem related to the
   utility unbalances. A complete stability analysis of the PLL systems is
   carried out. In addition, to validate the theoretical development, the
   dynamic response and the robustness of the proposed AF-PSD-3pPLL schemes
   are evaluated by means of simulation and experimental tests, taking into
   account utility disturbances, such as voltage harmonics and unbalances,
   voltage sags, phase-angle jumps and frequency variations. The
   effectiveness of the proposed PLL schemes are emphasised by means of a
   comparative analysis with the conventional 3pPLL algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is one of the most promising
   electroactive polymers with numerous potential applications in many

   involving each process were conducted to elucidate the effect of the
   sequence of treatments on the beta-phase transformation in the
   P(VDF-TrFE). By primarily using X-ray diffraction, microscopic analysis
   was conducted to investigate the effect of such treatments on the
   piezoelectric properties of the P(VDF-TrFE) films. It could be
   determined from the results that the annealing and cooling, electrical
   poling, and pressing treatments were all effective and the sequential
   treatments were also effective in enhancing the crystallinity of the
   beta-phase of the P(VDF-TrFE). The maximum beta-phase fraction (66.33\%)

Title = {{Metamorphic angrite Northwest Africa 3164/5167 compared to magmatic
   angrites}},
Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Northwest Africa (NWA) 3164 and 5167 are two angrites with a granulitic
   texture unlike that of other angrites, with a variable, up to millimeter
   grain size. Besides mineralogical and chemical similarities to other
   angrites, NWA 3164 and 5167 exhibit unique characteristics. Ca-rich
   olivine dominates (in NWA 3164: similar to 49 vol\%, Fo(57); NWA 5167:
   40 vol\%, Fo(59)). Fassaitic clinopyroxene is the second major phase (in
   NWA 3164: 29 vol\%; in NWA 5167: 36 vol\%) with a significant Tschermak
   component. In addition, two Al-rich phases are present: plagioclase
   An(99) and hercynitic spinel (similar to 6 and similar to 7 vol\%
   respectively for NWA 3164; 17 and 4 vol\% respectively for NWA 5167).
   Heavily weathered iron sulfide and kamacite, (9 wt\% in NWA 3164; 4 wt\%
   in NWA 5167) are the remaining minor phases, a unique feature among
   angrites. All mineral phases are homogeneous. Like other angrites, NWA
   3164 and 5167 exhibit a superchondritic Ca/Al ratio, with negligible
   amounts of alkalis and very low silica content. The presence of metal
   results from the incorporation of exogenous iron following impact.
   Subsequent annealing resulted in the observed granulitic texture. Major
   element composition indicates that both NWA 3164 and 5167 are derived
   from a picritic angrite precursor after incorporation of metal and
   annealing.
   After correction for iron and Fo(90) olivine incorporation, bulk rock
   REE abundances of both NWA 3164 and NWA 5167 appear lower than those of
   quenched angrites, showing the lowest absolute abundances among
   angrites. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of clinopyroxene, olivine and anorthite indicate
   that difference of Rare Earth Element (REE) abundances between NWA 3164
   and NWA 5167 can be explained by adding traces of phosphate to NWA 3164.
   NWA 3164/5167 trace elements abundances are similar, showing depletion
   in volatile elements and enrichment in refractory lithophile elements
   such as Ca, Ti, and Al. The most incompatible elements are depleted as
   well, unlike other angrites. This indicates that the source of these
   younger angrites was more depleted in incompatible elements when
   compared to the older magmatic angrites. The low Hf/W is understood as
   the result of exogenous iron incorporation and therefore the Hf/W and
   Wisotopic heterogeneity of the angrite parent body (APB) mantle is
   secondary. Comparison with other angrites suggests that iron
   incorporation may be necessary to explain their low Hf/W and W isotopic
   compositions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the psychometric properties of an Italian version of
   the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia (EdFED-I) Scale.
   Background: The EdFED Scale is the only validated instrument that
   measures difficulty with feeding in older people with dementia. The
   original English version of the EdFED had three factors measuring:
   behavioral aspects of feeding difficulty (obstinacy/passivity);
   indicators of feeding difficulty; and nursing interventions.
   Methods: Participants affected by dementia and living in nursing homes
   (n = 210) were selected. Data collectors were trained to observe the
   residents' eating problems and their food intake. The data were analyzed
   using Mokken scaling and Pearson's correlation.
   Results: The Italian version of the EdFED Scale formed a Mokken scale
   which correlated in the expected direction with measures of residents'
   weight, Body Mass Index, time taken to eat, Mini Mental State
   Examination score and Barthel Index according to the unmet needs model
   of Cohen-Mansfield.
   Conclusions: The EdFED-I shows reasonable psychometric properties and
   can be used for the assessment of feeding difficulty in Italian samples
   of older people with dementia. However, further work with larger samples
   is required to test the utility of the whole range of items and the
   necessity of their inclusion in the EdFED-I. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{An improved hybrid interface substructural component modal synthesis
   method (IHISCMSM) is proposed to increase the computational efficiency
   of mistuned bladed disk assemblies (BDA) under the condition of meeting
   the computational accuracy for a large amount of calculation via the
   classical hybrid interface substructural component modal synthesis
   method (CHISCMSM). The parametric models of the blades and the disk are
   built to investigate each substructural finite element model. They are
   synthesized by the double coordinating conditions of the displacement
   and the force to obtain natural frequency and vibratory output response
   which will ensure the computational accuracy. Compared with the high
   fidelity integral structure finite element method (HFISFEM), the
   computational time is shortened by 23.86-31.56\% and the modal deviation
   is 0.002-0.157\% via IHISCMSM. It is faster by 4.46-10.57\% than the
   CHISCMSM. Meanwhile, the factors which impact the frequency are
   researched by IHISCMSM, including rotational speed, gas temperature, and
   geometry size. It is shown that the rotational speed makes the frequency
   increased, the gas temperature makes it declined, the rotational speed
   has greater influence on the low-order modal, but the temperature has
   greater influence on the high-order modal. The frequency of the BDA does
   not change much when the rotational speed and temperature are both
   considered. However, the geometric dimensioning almost has no influence
   on the frequency. The vibratory output response is enlarged with the
   mistuned level increasing and multiple peaks are observed. The reason is
   that the combined action of the mistuning and the resonance. When the
   mistuned level is 0-3\%, the incremental saltation of the output
   response is obvious. When the mistuned level is continuing increasing,
   the localization phenomenon of the output response does not much
   different from the mistuned level 3\%. The above research lays a solid
   foundation for the further study on the probabilistic analysis of the
   mistuned BDA.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to the problem of tracking objects moving
   along smooth trajectories using a network of simple inexpensive binary
   sensors. Specifically, we consider object trajectories that can be
   well-approximated by piecewise linear curves and sensors that can only
   detect whether an object is in their sensing range. We start by
   considering objects moving along straight-line trajectories with an
   unknown speed and show that such objects can be tracked using the
   measurements of just three generically placed binary sensors whose
   sensing ranges intersect the trajectory. Next, we present an asymptotic
   analysis that shows that a trajectory consisting of a finite number of
   straight line segments can be recovered with high probability using an
   arbitrarily low spatial density of sensors in the limit when the area to
   be covered gets larger and larger. We also present efficient algorithms
   that effectively recover piecewise linear trajectories. Finally we
   present analysis and simulations to demonstrate the high tracking
   accuracy of our approach and its robustness to sensing errors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Delamination is a typical form of damage in composite plates.
   Identification of delamination in plates has been a focus of increasing
   research interest in relatively recent years. This study develops a new
   approach, termed a scale waveform dimension analysis of two-dimensional
   mode shapes, to identify delamination in composite plates. The scale
   waveform dimension analysis comprises two components: decomposition of a
   mode shape into scale mode shapes and waveform dimension analysis of
   scale mode shapes. The first component acts as a splitter that broadly
   splits a noisy mode shape into three sets of trend-, noise-, and
   damage-scale mode shapes, from which the damage scale mode shapes can be
   selected for use in damage characterization; the second component
   functions as a detector to detect abnormalities of damage scale mode
   shapes, to indicate the presence and location of delamination. The
   efficacy of the method is numerically studied and experimentally
   examined using composite plates containing small delamination. The
   results show that the proposed method can identify delamination with
   great accuracy in noisy conditions, needing no intact baseline mode
   shapes nor any prior knowledge of either the material properties or
   boundary conditions of the plate being inspected.}},

Abstract = {{This study is related to the removal of organics and other pollutants
   from drinking water using an integrated treatment system consisting of
   coagulation-sedimentation, ozonation and granular activated carbon
   (GAC)-enhanced sand filtration. Standard methods and instruments were
   employed to measure turbidity, chemical oxygen demand determined by
   using the permanganate method as permanganate index (CODMn), UV254,
   total organic carbon (TOC), ammonia and nitrite of raw and treated water
   under controlled laboratorial conditions. The experimental results
   demonstrated that the total removal rates of turbidity, CODMn, UV254 and
   TOC were in the range of 98-99.9, 21-71, 33-73 and 20-47\%,
   respectively, in different units of the integrated treatment system.
   GAC-enhanced sand filtration significantly removed ammonia and nitrite,
   and the average removal efficiency was attained to 88 and 98\%,
   respectively. In addition, most of the organic matter concentrations
   were observed to be reduced in GAC-enhanced sand filtration and only
   small molecular weight compounds were detected in the effluent. All
   these pollutant reductions were noticed in the upper 350 mm of the
   activated carbon column in GAC-enhanced sand filtration. The findings
   from this study suggest that the integrated treatment process can
   efficiently remove organics and other toxic pollutants from drinking
   water and can be a better alternative to conventional treatment.}},

   Cond Res 29(11): 3188-3196, 2015This study sought to determine the level
   of association between bilateral force production symmetry assessment
   methods (standing weight distribution {[}WtD], unloaded and lightly
   loaded jumps, and isometric strength) and to determine whether the
   amount of symmetry carry-over between these tasks differs for strong and
   weak athletes. Subjects for this study included male (n = 31) and female
   (n = 32) athletes from National Collegiate Athletic Association Division
   I sports. Athletes performed WtD, unloaded and lightly loaded (20 kg)
   static and countermovement jumps, and isometric midthigh pull (IMTP)
   assessments on 2 adjacent force plates. Ground reaction force data were
   used to calculate symmetry variables and performance-related variables.
   Using Pearson zero order correlations, evaluations of the amount of
   symmetry carry-over were made. Weight distribution correlated strongly
   with jump peak force (PF) (r = 0.628-0.664). Strong relationships were
   also observed between loading conditions for jump variables (r =
   0.568-0.957) as were the relationships between jump types for PF, peak
   power, and net impulse (r = 0.506-0.834). Based on the pooled sample,
   there was a lack of association between IMTP and WtD for jump symmetry
   variables. However, when examining strong and weak groups, rate of force
   development showed moderate to strong symmetry carry-over in the
   strongest athletes (r = 0.416-0.589). Stronger athletes appear to
   display similar explosive strength symmetry characteristics in dynamic
   and isometric assessments, unlike weaker athletes. Strength seems to
   influence the amount of force production symmetry carry-over between
   bilateral assessments. There may be optimal loads and variables for
   symmetry assessment, but these may differ based on population
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT The Brain Trauma Foundation has published guidelines on the
   surgical management of traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH). However, no
   data exist on the proportion of patients with SDH that can be selected
   for conservative management and what is the outcome of these patients.
   The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to establish what proportion
   of patients are initially treated conservatively; 2) to determine what
   proportion of patients will deteriorate and require surgical evacuation;
   and 3) to identify risk factors associated with deterioration and
   delayed surgery.
   METHODS All cases of acute traumatic SDH (869 when inclusion criteria
   were met) presenting over a 4-year period were reviewed. For all
   conservatively treated SDH, the proportion of delayed surgical
   intervention and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were taken as outcome
   measures. Multiple factors were compared between patients who required
   delayed surgery and patients without surgery.
   RESULTS Of the 869 patients with acute traumatic SDH, 646 (74.3\%) were
   initially treated conservatively. A good outcome was achieved in 76.7\%
   of the patients. Only 6.5\% eventually required delayed surgery, and the
   median delay for surgery was 9.5 days. Factors associated with
   deterioration were as follows: 1) thicker SDH (p < 0.001); 2) greater
   midline shift (p < 0.001); 3) location at the convexity (p = 0.001); 4)
   alcohol abuse (p = 0.0260); and 5) history of falls (p = 0.018). There
   was no significant difference in regard to age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale
   score, Injury Severity Score, abnormal coagulation, use of blood
   thinners, and presence of cerebral atrophy or white matter disease.
   CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients with SDH are treated
   conservatively. Of those, only 6.5\% later required surgery, for raised
   intracranial pressure or SDH progression. Patients at risk can be
   identified and followed more carefully.}},

   contributed to changes in frost risk in south-eastern Australia include
   greenhouse gas concentration, El-Nino southern oscillation and other
   effects. Some of the climatic indices representing these effects have

   varying effect on observed data. Other indices are constructed from
   grid-referenced physical models, which creates a point-to-area problem.
   To address these issues we use a spatiodynamic model, which comprises a
   blending of spatially varying and temporally dynamic parameters. For the

Abstract = {{The transplantation of stem cells from a matched unrelated donor (MUD)
   or a haploidentical mismatched related donor (MMRD) is a widely used
   variant of curative treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency
   (PID). Currently, different strategies are used to reduce the risk of
   post-transplant complications and enhance immune reconstitution. We
   report the preliminary results of MUD and MMRD transplantation with TCR
   alpha beta/CD19 depletion in patients with PID (trial registered at
   www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02327351). Thirty-seven PID patients
   (median age, 2.6 years; range, .2 to 17) were transplanted from MUDs (n
   = 27) or haploidentical MMRDs (n = 10) after TCR alpha beta(+)/CD19(+)
   graft depletion. The median numbers of CD34(+) and TCR alpha beta(+)
   cells in the graft were 11.7 x 10(6)/kg and 10.6 x 10(3)/kg,
   respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in 8
   patients (22\%), without a statistically significant difference between
   MUDs and MMRDs; 7 of these patients had grade II acute GVHD and
   responded to first-line therapy, whereas 1 patient had grade IV acute
   GVHD with transformation to extensive chronic GVHD. Primary and
   secondary graft failure (non-engraftment or rejection) was observed in
   10 patients (27\%), 9 of whom were treated with 1 alkylating agent in
   the conditioning regimen. All these patients were successfully
   retransplanted with different rescue protocols. Preliminary data on
   immune reconstitution were very encouraging. Most patients had
   significant numbers of T lymphocytes detected on the first assessment
   (day +30) and more than 500 T cells/mu L, on day +120. Based on our
   preliminary data, no significant difference was seen between MMRD and
   MUD hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With a median
   follow-up period of 15 months, the cumulative probabilities of overall
   patient survival and transplant-related mortality were 96.7\% and 3.3\%,
   respectively. Based on the results, the ability to control the main
   post-transplant complications and the immune reconstitution rates are
   the main factors leading to successful outcome in patients with PID
   after TCR alpha beta(+)-depleted HSCT. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Seasonal abundance patterns for Japanese encephalitis vectors along
   climatic variations were studied in the coastal areas of Alappuzha
   district from June 2012 to May 2013. A total of 10563 female mosquitoes
   belonging to eleven species were collected. Culex gelidus Theobald
   (50.04\%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (26.50\%), and Cx. sitiens
   Wiedemann (7.55\%) were found to be most common in these areas. Cx.
   sitiens females were collected from each sampling occasion from early
   monsoon season June to late summer May with a distinct peak in April at
   7.18 electrical conductivity (EC). Cx. sitiens abundance increased
   rapidly when monthly salinity level consistently exceeded 7.76,
   occurring in March at 7.76 and April at 7.18 electrical conductivity
   (EC). While analyzing correlation of Cx. sitiens density with salinity
   and rainfall was significant. High density of Cx. gelidus was greatly
   influenced by total rainfall and it was found to be significantly
   correlated with Per Man Hour (PMH) (P<0.05), whereas salinity was
   inversely correlated with mosquito density (P<0.001). The abundance of
   Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was lowest in June (rainy season) and increased in
   October, with densities increasing sharply during summer season in April
   (83 PMH). During summer, due to increased salinity Cx. sitiens density
   increased. These areas may develop in to brackish and saline water
   populated by Cx. sitiens, which can be new vectors for Japanese
   encephalitis or West Nile virus in these areas.}},

   hydrolysis of the glucosinolate sinigrin were assessed on an Armillaria
   mellea strain in Petri dishes. The fumigation with sinigrin at 100 mu M

   fungistatic effect. The application of increasing rates of solid and
   liquid biofumigant formulations on A. mellea inoculated potted peach
   plants showed an increase of soil nitrate concentration, basal
   respiration, microbial biomass, leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll
   concentration. These effects indicated a stimulating effect of
   Brassicaceae derivatives on soil biological activity and plant growth.
   The application of a rate of meal higher than 6.42 g kg(-1) soil caused
   a stunted growth and the death of some plants showing a clear phytotoxic
   effect of the treatments. The inhibition of A. mellea growth observed in

Abstract = {{Objective: Despite the advantages of robotically assisted cardiac
   surgery over conventional open sternotomy, robotically assisted surgery
   may be associated with substantial postsurgical pain arising from
   multiple incisions and access ports. This single-site, retrospective
   chart review evaluated the impact of liposome bupivacaine compared with
   bupivacaine HCl on postsurgical pain management in patients undergoing
   robotically assisted endoscopic cardiac surgery.
   Methods: Sequential patient cohorts undergoing robotically assisted
   cardiac surgery received either 0.25\% bupivacaine HCl (100 mg in 40 mL,
   n = 30) or liposome bupivacaine (266 mg in 20 mL, expanded to 40 mL with
   0.9\% sterile normal saline, n = 30) intraoperatively via equal-volume
   infiltration across port sites. Outcome measures, collected from the day
   of surgery through postoperative day 3, were daily and total use of
   opioid analgesics (converted to morphine equivalents), pain intensity
   (11-point numeric rating scale), and incidence of postoperative nausea
   and vomiting.
   Results: Median length of hospital stay was 4 days in the liposome
   bupivacaine group and 3 days in the bupivacaine HCl group. Patients
   receiving liposome bupivacaine had numerically lower mean pain scores
   (at six of seven time points), reduced mean opioid consumption, and a
   reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared with
   those receiving bupivacaine HCl, although none of the differences
   reached statistical significance.
   Conclusions: Results from this small retrospective, observational study
   suggest that liposome bupivacaine may improve postsurgical pain relief
   and reduce postsurgical opioid consumption, in comparison with
   bupivacaine HCl, in patients undergoing robotically assisted cardiac
   surgery. Larger prospective studies of liposome bupivacaine in this
   setting are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of perioperative stroke and the benefits of carotid
   endarterectomy (CEA) remain uncertain in the case of an ipsilateral
   intracranial stenosis. The aim of this observational study was to
   analyze the early and late outcomes of CEA in patients with a carotid
   tandem lesion (CTL), defined as a severe stenosis at the bifurcation
   with any concomitant lesion a parts per thousand yen50 \% involving the
   intracranial portion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery or the
   main trunk of the anterior or middle cerebral artery.
   From 2000 to 2009, 1143 patients underwent CEA for symptomatic or
   asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis according to the NASCET and
   ACAS recommendations, respectively. CTLs were diagnosed in 219 patients
   (19.2 \%) by extracranial and transcranial color-coded Doppler
   sonography combined with noninvasive brain imaging studies. The primary
   endpoints of the study were perioperative (30-day) stroke and death, and
   any ipsilateral ischemic adverse events during the follow-up, which
   ranged from 0.1 to 10 years (mean 4.9 +/- A 3.3 years). The rates of the
   primary endpoints were compared between patients with (group I) and
   without CTL (group II).
   Overall, 219 CEAs were performed in group I and 924 in group II. Nearly
   two in three of the carotid lesions (777 of 1143, 68 \%) were
   symptomatic at presentation (62.1 \% in group I vs 69.4 \% in group II;
   p = 0.03), with a 23.8 \% rate of stroke (21.9 \% in group I vs 24.2 \%
   in group II; p = 0.85). There were 2 (0.9 \%) perioperative ipsilateral
   strokes in group I and 5 (0.5 \%) in group II (p = 0.62), and no deaths.
   The 5-year ipsilateral stroke-free, any stroke-free, and overall
   survival rates did not differ significantly between patients with and
   without CTL.
   This study has shown that patients with and without CTL who underwent
   CEA had a similar occurrence of perioperative adverse events (probably
   due to the extremely low incidence of perioperative complications) and
   comparable late outcomes, suggesting that the presence of CTL does not
   justify refusing CEA for patients who could benefit from it.}},

Abstract = {{TP53 mutations are major prognostic factors in many hematological
   malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
   syndromes (MDS). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has improved the
   detection of such mutations by identifying small mutated clones but
   functional method like FASAY (functional assay of separated allele in
   yeast) may prove interesting. We compared the detection of TP53
   mutations by FASAY and NGS in 91 patients with AML or MDS. By FASAY,
   91\% of assays were evaluable and 47 patients (57\%) had a functional
   and 36 (43\%) a non-functional p53 protein. FASAY could not conclude in
   8 cases (9\%), mainly because of poor RNA quality. No TP53 mutation was
   found using NGS in 50 cases (55\%), and at least one mutation was
   detected in 41 cases (45\%). The p53 status was concordant between FASAY
   and NGS in 95\% (79183) of cases. The four discordances included
   mutations detected by FASAY only in two cases, and by NGS only in two
   cases. Mutations not detected by NGS consisted of insertions in intronic
   regions, which were not analyzed by this assay. Mutations not detected
   by FASAY were mutations for which the percentage of mutated allele was
   less than 10\%, including one mutation reported as non-deleterious in
   the IARC database. Overall, our data suggest that FASAY is an effective
   and reliable method to detect TP53 mutations in AML and MDS, which
   allows the assessment of the protein functionality, contrary to a
   sequencing approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An improved methodology to estimate the clear-sky direct normal
   irradiance based on an anisotropic clear-sky model using a
   Multi-Pyranometer Array (MPA) is analyzed in this paper. The MPA is a
   static platform with four sensors on surfaces at different tilt and
   azimuth angles, which measured solar irradiance can be used to estimate
   the normal incident component without the tracking devices that involve
   more detailed installation and maintenance. The array's sensors are of
   the photovoltaic type, which require both the spectral and
   angle-of-incidence corrections.
   Based on the general expressions for the solar radiation on each of the
   MPA sloped surfaces and using a hybrid model that includes an
   anisotropic sky diffuse component, in this work an improved procedure is
   presented that estimate the normal direct solar irradiance by grouping
   two expressions of a couple of MPA sensors and analytically look for a
   satisfactory solution; one set for the horizontal and south sensors, and
   another for the east and west sensors. The solution for the east and
   west sensors is expanded to two new solutions by mirroring their
   readings according to the solar noon. A final switching scheme based on
   the expressions denominator size provides the satisfactory direct normal
   irradiance estimation. The analysis of the results for the analyzed days
   showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by around
   14-43\% in comparison with previous results reported in the literature.
   The proposed methodology is a promising new approach for MPA. (C) 2015

   the time-varying spectra, revealing that some molecular vibrational
   modes showed strong correlation with the gold nanoparticle motion. This
   type of time-space-spectrum variable analysis will enable us to
   visualize molecular dynamics such as dissociation of proteins in

Abstract = {{Psychological contracts are dynamic, but few studies explore the
   processes driving change and how employees influence them. By adopting a
   process approach with a teleological change lens, and drawing upon the
   sensemaking and coping literatures, this study positions individuals as
   active and adaptive agents driving contract change. Employing a mixed
   methodology, with a four-wave longitudinal survey (n=107 graduate
   newcomers) and qualitative interviews (n=26 graduate newcomers), the
   study focuses on unfolding events and develops an adaptive remediation
   process model aimed at unraveling contract dynamics. The model
   demonstrates how breach or violation events trigger sensemaking,
   resulting in initially negative employee reactions and a withdrawal of
   perceived contributions, before individuals exercise their agency and
   enact coping strategies to make sense of, and adapt and respond to,
   these discrepancies. A process of contract repair could then occur if
   the coping actions (termed remediation effects) were effective, with
   individuals returning to positive exchange perceptions. These actions
   either directly addressed the breach and repaired both it and the
   psychological contract (termed remedies) or involved cognitive
   reappraisal of the broader work environment and repaired the contract
   but not the breach (termed buffers). The results highlight the
   unfolding, processual nature of psychological contracting. Copyright (c)

   coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, and
   two-sided t-test.
   Results: In 38 of the 51 individuals (74.5 \%), the diagnosis of Marfan
   syndrome was established according to the criteria of the Ghent-2
   nosology. Cine-MRI measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva revealed a
   strong correlation with echocardiography (r = 0.929), but a
   statistically significant bias of -1.0mm (p < 0.001). The mean absolute
   diameter for sinuses of Valsalva obtained by cine-MRI was 32.3 +/- 5.8
   mm as compared to 33.4 +/- 5.4 mm obtained by echocardiography.
   Interobserver agreement of measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva was
   higher for cine-MRI than for echocardiography (p = 0.029).
   Conclusion: Despite small, but statistically significant differences in
   terms of agreement and reproducibility, cine-MRI and echocardiographic
   measurements of aortic root diameters provide comparable results without
   a significant clinical difference. Therefore both techniques may be used
   for monitoring of the aortic root in patients with Marfan syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Background:HIV elite controllers suppress HIV viremia without
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet previous studies demonstrated that
   elite controllers maintain an activated T-cell phenotype. Chronic immune
   activation has detrimental consequences and thus ART has been advocated
   for all elite controllers. However, elite controllers are not a
   clinically homogenous group. Since CD4\% is among the best predictors of
   AIDS-related events, in the current study, we assessed whether this
   marker can be used to stratify elite controllers needing
   ART.Methods:Sixteen elite controllers were divided into two groups based
   on CD4\% (EChi > 40\% and EClo 40\%), and T-cell subsets were analyzed
   for markers of memory/differentiation (CD45RA, CCR7, CD28), activation
   (CD38/HLA-DR), immunosenescence (CD57), costimulation (CD73, CD28) and
   exhaustion (PD-1, CD160, Tim-3). Monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16) were also
   analyzed and sCD14 levels were quantified using ELISA.Results:In the
   EChi group, expression of activation, exhaustion, and immunosensescence
   markers on T cells were significantly reduced compared with the EClo
   group and similar to the seronegative controls. The EChi group expressed
   higher levels of costimulatory molecules CD28 and CD73 and had lower
   levels of monocyte activation (HLA-DR expression) with a reduced
   frequency of inflammatory monocyte (CD14(++) CD16(+)) subset.
   Furthermore, the EChi group maintained a stable CD4\% during a median
   follow-up of 6 years.Conclusion:Elite controllers with preserved CD4(+)T
   cells (EChi) have normal T-cell and monocyte phenotypes and therefore
   may have limited benefit from ART. CD4\% can be an important marker for
   evaluating future studies aimed at determining the need for ART in this
   group of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{SNPs in candidate genes for immune response DC-SIGN and SP110 have been
   reported for resistance /susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans as
   well as in animals. They are potential strong candidates for
   investigating genetic basis of disease resistance. Therefore the
   objective of this study was to explore the association of SNPs to
   susceptibility and resistance against TB infection in cattle. In case of
   SP110 gene both SNPs under study (rs41256732 and rs134537150) revealed
   polymorphism. Whereas in case of DC-SIGN gene two of SNPs (rs137338039
   and s208436798) were found to be polymorphic while one SNP (rs134731570)
   revealed monomorphism. These findings point to the presence of these
   SNPs in our resource population. However, for the SNPs under
   investigation, the genotype as well as allele had nonsignificant effect
   on occurrence of bovine tuberculosis. Heterozygosity, PIC and allelic
   diversity values were estimated as low for rs208436798 while
   corresponding values for other.SNPs were observed as moderate. Apart
   from rs134537150, the population was not in HWE for all the other the
   SNPs studied. In conclusion none of the SNPs studied were found to be
   associated but further validation in independent, large resource
   population and biological characterization are warranted with more
   effective case-control identification.}},

Title = {{Illness perception in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: The roles
   of alexithymia and depression}},
Journal = {{COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{88-95}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Alexithymia and depressive mood have been described as
   important dimensions of several medical diseases. Systemic lupus
   erythematosus is a chronic condition characterized by unpredictable
   clinical manifestations. The relationships between alexithymia,
   depression, and illness perception were examined in systemic lupus
   erythematosus patients. The interrelationships between psychological
   factors, such as alexithymia and depressive mood, were explored in
   systemic lupus erythematosus patients, and associations between these
   factors and illness perception in SLE were examined We hypothesized that
   alexithymia and negative perceptions of illness would be associated in
   SLE patients, and depression would mediate this relationship.
   Methods: Subjects were 100 consecutive systemic lupus erythematosus
   patients attending the outpatient clinic at the University of Pisa
   rheumatology unit. They completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Beck
   Depression Inventory, and Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire.
   Clinical variables were measured, disease activity was evaluated using
   the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure, and damage was assessed
   using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American
   College of Rheumatology Damage Index.
   Results: There were no associations between clinical variables,
   alexithymia, and depression. The results highlight the existence of
   significant links between alexithymia and illness perception for
   systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Moreover, our data suggest that
   some of these links are mediated by depression, which is the direct
   predictor of different aspects of perceived health.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that studying the role of psychological
   factors, such as alexithymia and depression, may contribute to a more
   comprehensive perspective of systemic lupus erythematosus, including
   their impact on patients' beliefs about treatment effectiveness and
   emotional adaptation to chronic disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{There is a widespread recognition that above- and below-ground organisms
   are linked through their interactions with host plants that span
   terrestrial subsystems. In addition to direct effects on plants, soil
   organisms such as root herbivores can indirectly alter interactions
   between plants and other community members, with potentially important
   effects on plant growth and fitness. We manipulated root herbivory by
   Acalymma vittatum in Cucumis sativus to determine indirect effects on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, leaf herbivory, the leaf pathogen downy
   mildew and pollinators. We also manipulated pollen receipt by plants to
   determine whether root herbivory reduced plant reproduction through
   changes in pollinator visitation. Overall, root herbivory had strong net
   negative effects on plant growth and fitness, with 34\% reductions in
   both leaf and fruit production by high root damage levels relative to
   control, despite reduced infection by downy mildew. High root herbivory
   also reduced floral visitation by 39\%, apparently due to lower flower
   production, as flower size and scent were unaffected. Above-ground
   herbivory was not affected by root herbivores. Although root herbivory
   reduced pollinator visits, pollen receipt manipulations had no effect on
   fruit set, indicating that reduced pollinator service did not affect
   plant reproduction.Synthesis. Root herbivory had indirect effects on a
   range of community members, including mutualists and antagonists both
   above- and below-ground. Although reduced pathogen infection associated
   with root herbivory would be expected to benefit plants, root herbivory
   had an overall strong negative effect on plant growth and reproduction,
   indicating that direct negative effects over-rode any potential indirect
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{We present R-c-band surface photometry for 170 of the 203 galaxies in
   GHASP, the Gassendi H-alpha survey of spirals, a sample of late-type
   galaxies for which high-resolution Fabry-Perot H alpha maps have
   previously been obtained. Our data set is constructed using new R-c-band
   observations taken at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, supplemented
   with Sloan Digital Sky Survey archival data, obtained with the purpose
   of deriving homogeneous photometric profiles and parameters. Our results
   include R-c-band surface brightness profiles for 170 galaxies and ugriz
   profiles for 108 of these objects. We catalogue several parameters of
   general interest for further reference, such as total magnitude,
   effective radius and isophotal parameters (magnitude, position angle,
   ellipticity and inclination). We also perform a structural decomposition
   of the surface brightness profiles using a multi-component method to
   separate discs from bulges and bars, and to observe the main scaling
   relations involving luminosities, sizes and maximum velocities. We
   determine the R-c-band Tully-Fisher relation using maximum velocities
   derived solely from H alpha rotation curves for a sample of 80 galaxies,
   resulting in a slope of -8.1 +/- 0.5, zero-point of -3.0 +/- 1.0 and an
   estimated intrinsic scatter of 0.28 +/- 0.07. We note that, unlike the
   Tully-Fisher relation in the near-infrared derived for the same sample,
   no change in the slope of the relation is seen at the low-mass end (for
   galaxies with V-max < 125 km s(-1)). We suggest that this different
   behaviour of the Tully-Fisher relation (with the optical relation being
   described by a single power law while the near-infrared has two), may be
   caused by differences in the stellar mass-to-light ratio for galaxies
   with V-max < 125 km s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open
   kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function
   in the ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
   Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week
   duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a
   standardised rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group
   trained as did the STAND group but with the addition of seated knee
   extensor open kinetic chain resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20
   repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee
   laxity and measurements of physical and subjective function were
   performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six subjects were tested
   at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, HIGH n = 12).
   The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity
   between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the
   STAND groups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee
   laxity decreased an average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while
   remaining the same in the other two groups.
   Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training at
   loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in
   the ACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any
   significant short-term functional advantages when compared to a standard
   rehabilitation protocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be
   decreased with resistance training of the thigh muscles.

Abstract = {{Wastewater reclamation is an upcoming approach that will significantly
   affect wastewater treatment systems. Despite the fact that technology
   for treating wastewater to an effluent water quality that meets various
   quality standards for reuse is already available and applied, the reuse
   of water is not just a simple and straightforward road. Significant
   additional energy and civil infrastructure is required to treat the
   water to a standard that allows it to be safely reused. The total impact
   of treating and reusing water may be higher than the environmental
   benefits. Thus, it is crucial the life-cycle impacts from upstream and
   downstream processes of various reuse technologies, i.e. production of
   chemicals, energy use, eutrophication, sludge handling, etc. The present
   paper provides a comprehensive evaluation considering different reuse
   purposes, treatment technologies and plant size. The results of this
   study suggest that all these factors are highly significant for the
   environmental impact of wastewater treatment systems for non-potable
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Poorly understood genetic structure throughout a species' range can
   impede the implementation of effective management strategies. Leopard
   sharks (Triakis semifasciata) are known to form seasonal aggregations
   along the California coastline, but little is known about broad-scale
   movement patterns once aggregations disperse. If aggregations represent
   isolated populations, increased protective measures of known aggregation
   sites may be required to reduce the risk of local extirpation. Five
   highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to analyze the
   genetic population structure of T. semifasciata. A total of 382
   individuals were genotyped from six locations in California and one
   location in Mexico, spanning approximately 1800 km of coastline. In
   addition, the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced for five
   individuals in Mexico to compare to a previous analysis of T.
   semifasciata haplotypes found in California. Analyses of the genetic
   data show that T. semifasciata does not form one panmictic population
   and significant population structure is present. Pairwise F-ST tests and
   Bayesian clustering analyses show significant differentiation between
   northern and southern California populations (north and south of Point
   Conception, CA). Based on limited sampling, analyses of both
   microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA indicate that the Mexican
   population is genetically isolated from the California populations,
   making it more susceptible to local decline. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An opening-wedge osteotomy is well recognised for the management of limb
   deformity and requires an understanding of the principles of geometry.
   Translation at the osteotomy is needed when the osteotomy is performed
   away from the centre of rotation of angulation (CORA), but the amount of
   translation varies with the distance from the CORA. This translation
   enables proximal and distal axes on either side of the proposed
   osteotomy to realign. We have developed two experimental models to
   establish whether the amount of translation required (based on the
   translation deformity created) can be predicted based upon simple
   trigonometry. A predictive algorithm was derived where translational
   deformity was predicted as 2(tan alpha x d), where a represents 50 \% of
   the desired angular correction, and d is the distance of the desired
   osteotomy site from the CORA. A simulated model was developed using
   TraumaCad online digital software suite (Brainlab AG, Germany).
   Osteotomies were simulated in the distal femur, proximal tibia and
   distal tibia for nine sets of lower limb scanograms at incremental
   distances from the CORA and the resulting translational deformity
   recorded. There was strong correlation between the distance of the
   osteotomy from the CORA and simulated translation deformity for distal
   femoral deformities (correlation coefficient 0.99, p < 0.0001), proximal
   tibial deformities (correlation coefficient 0.93-0.99, p < 0.0001) and
   distal tibial deformities (correlation coefficient 0.99, p < 0.0001).
   There was excellent agreement between the predictive algorithm and
   simulated translational deformity for all nine simulations (correlation
   coefficient 0.93-0.99, p < 0.0001). Translational deformity following
   corrective osteotomy for lower limb deformity can be anticipated and
   predicted based upon the angular correction and the distance between the
   planned osteotomy site and the CORA.}},

   analyzed by gender, age and years of professional experience using SPSS
   15.0.18,8\% of dentists reported latex glove allergies. The symptoms
   were manifested on the hands skin by redness (74.5\%), itching (42.4\%)
   and swelling (20.1\%), suggesting an allergic dermatitis. Other symptoms
   include allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, cough and wheezing.
   The age group between 37 and 48 years old was more affected in terms of

Abstract = {{We report new imaging polarimetry observations of the Galactic compact H
   II region K3-50 using CanariCam at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use
   a standard polarimetric analysis technique, first outlined by Aitken, to
   decompose the observed polarization images centred at 8.7, 10.3, and
   12.5 mu m into the emissive and absorptive components from silicate
   grains that are aligned with the local magnetic field. These components
   reveal the spatially resolved magnetic field structures across the
   mid-infrared emission area of K3-50. We examine these structures and
   show that they are consistent with previously observed features and
   physical models of K3-50, such as the molecular torus and the ionized
   outflow. We propose a 3D geometry for all the structures seen at
   different wavelengths. We also compute relevant physical quantities in
   order to estimate the associated magnetic field strengths that would be
   implied under various physical assumptions. We compare these results
   with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of protostar formation that predict
   the magnetic field strength and configuration. We find that the magnetic
   field may be dynamically important in the innermost 0.2 pc of the
   molecular torus, but that the torus is more likely to be rotationally
   supported against gravity outside this radius. Similarly, magnetic
   fields are unlikely to dominate the global physics of the ionized
   outflow, but they may be important in helping confine the flow near the
   cavity wall in some locations. Ours is the first application of the
   Aitken technique to spatially resolved magnetic field structures in
   multiple layers along the line of sight, effectively a method of
   `polarization tomography'.}},

   Undergraduate students (N = 833) completed measures of counterfactual

Abstract = {{Lianas (woody vines) can have profound effects on tree recruitment,
   growth, survival, and diversity in tropical forests. However, the
   dynamics of liana colonization soon after land abandonment are poorly
   understood, and thus it is unknown whether lianas alter tree
   regeneration early in succession. We examined the liana community in 43
   forests that ranged from 1 to 31yr old in central Panama to determine
   how fast lianas colonize young forests and how the liana community
   changes with forest succession. We found that lianas reached high
   densities early in succession, commonly exceeding 1000 stems/ha within
   the first 5yr of forest regeneration. Lianas also increased rapidly
   during early succession in terms of basal area but did not show evidence
   of saturation within the 30yr of our chronosequence. The relative
   contribution of lianas to total woody plant community in terms of basal
   area and density increased rapidly and reached a saturation point within
   5yr (basal area) to 15yr (density) after land abandonment. Our data
   demonstrate that lianas recruit early and in high density in tropical
   forest regeneration, and thus lianas may have a large effect on the way
   in which secondary forests develop both early and throughout succession.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study of a sludge subjected to the
   (ATAD) process - Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion occurring in
   a two-stage installation operated in a municipal wastewater treatment
   plant in Olecko, Poland. The study of the sludge and the analysis of
   obtained results were conducted over 2011 and 2014. The subject of the
   study was a thickened sludge in an intermediate tank from which it was
   next transferred to facility reactors. The stabilization of processed
   sludge was evaluated analyzing the change in the dry mass (DS) content
   in the sludge. Measurements were carried out in thickened sludge samples
   and after the ATAD process. Collected results were then subjected to a
   statistical analysis and it was determined to which extent as resulted
   from the subject process the dry mass and the dry organic mass (VS)
   content was changing in the sludge. Also, it was analyzed how the oxygen
   chemical demand (COD) was changing. The dry mass content in the
   thickened sludge was from 60 g/1 to 160 g/1. After the process, this
   amount was from 35 to 76 g/1. Similarly, the organic mass content in a
   dry sludge mass changed from initial values within a range of 44-135 g/1
   to 23-60 g/1 after the ATAD process. Also, the organic substance content
   expressed as COD decreased from 80 to 467 g O-2/1 in a thickened sludge
   to 51-261 g O-2/1 in the sludge after the process. The article presents
   conclusions from the result of the conducted study as well as personal
   experience. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {{Relationship between fragmented QRS and paradoxical septal motion in

Abstract = {{Paradoxical septal motion (PSM) can cause confusion in the assessment of
   ventricular function with scintigraphy even in the absence of
   ventricular septal damage and ischemia. Fragmented QRS (fQRS) is
   associated with various cardiac disorders. In this study, we aimed to
   determine the correlation between paradoxical septal motion and fQRS
   after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
   We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records showing scintigraphic
   images and electrocardiograms (ECG) of the patients who had undergone
   CABG. The patients were classified based on the evaluation of motion and
   thickening of the septal wall. The patients with regular thickening of
   the septal wall and abnormal motion were classified as PSM (+) group.
   The patients with normal motion and thickening of the septal wall were
   classified as PSM (-) group. fQRS complexes are defined as various RSR
   patterns either with or without Q-waves on a 12-lead resting ECG.
   PSM was found to be more common in fQRS patients (p < 0.001). PSM was
   seen in 91.4 \% of cases with fQRS and in 79.8 \% of cases without fQRS.
   No significant differences were found in the phase analysis parameters.
   A correlation was found between septal wall motion values and the
   presence of fQRS (r = 0.197, p = 0.012).
   fQRS was associated with PSM. fQRS may cause PSM in patients with CABG
   without left bundle branch block due to a conduction defect. PSM and
   fQRS are predictive of cardiac mortality. Patients diagnosed with PSM
   and fQRS, should be monitored closely.}},

Abstract = {{The paper concerns the definition and performance evaluation of a new
   multi-hop routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks. Our
   solution, termed CARP for Channel-aware Routing Protocol, exploits link
   quality information for data forwarding, in that nodes are selected as
   relays if they exhibit recent history of successful transmissions to
   their neighbors. CARP avoids loops and can successfully route around
   connectivity voids and shadow zones by using simple topology
   information, such as hop count. The protocol is also designed to take
   advantage of power control for selecting robust links. The performance
   of CARP has been compared with that of two other protocols for
   underwater routing, namely, the Focused Beam Routing (FBR) and a
   flooding-based solution (EFlood). Metrics of interest include packet
   delivery ratio, end-to-end packet latency and energy consumption, which
   have been investigated through ns2-based simulations and experiments at
   sea. The in-field trials have been conducted at two European locations,
   namely, a Norwegian fjord and the Mediterranean Sea. The tests in the
   Mediterranean Sea have been performed jointly with the NATO Science and
   Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation
   (STO CMRE), under a collaboration agreement between the University of
   Roma and CMRE. Our results show that CARP robust mechanism for relay
   selection doubles the packet delivery ratio of FBR and EFlood. CARP also
   outperforms FBR and EFlood in terms of energy consumption, and delivers
   packets significantly faster than FBR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Prediction of anxiety and depression in general surgery inpatients: A

Abstract = {{Introduction: Surgery is a major stress factor for patients, and is
   associated with significant anxiety or depression. The Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale is one of the most common instruments used for
   assessment of patients' psychological stress. Here, we aimed to identify
   predictors of anxiety and depression in surgical inpatients.
   Methods: The study group consisted of consecutive two-hundred patients
   who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire. A
   patient scoring more than cut-off values (10 for anxiety and seven for
   depression) was considered as being at risk of anxiety or depression.
   Demographical data, socioeconomic status, education level and diagnoses
   were recorded. The Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney,
   Kruskal-Wallis tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used
   to identify the predictive parameters for anxiety and depression.
   Results: It was found that female patients, patients older than 35
   years, patients with low socioeconomic status and low education level
   had a relatively higher risk of anxiety. In addition, patients with low
   education and a hospital stay greater than seven days were at risk of
   depression. Logistic regression analysis revealed that socioeconomic
   status and education level were strongly predictive for anxiety.
   However, presence of anxiety was shown to be strongly predictive for
   depression.
   Conclusion: Healthcare providers should be aware of their patients'
   psychology and, therefore, it is recommended to consider predictive
   factors for anxiety and depression. (C) 2015 IJS Publishing Group
