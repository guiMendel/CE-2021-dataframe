Title = {{STATISTICAL-METHODS FOR POLYPLOID RADIATION HYBRID MAPPING}},
Journal = {{GENOME RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Radiation hybrid mapping is a somatic cell technique for ordering
   genetic loci along a chromosome and estimating physical distances
   between adjacent loci. This paper presents a model of fragment
   generation and retention for data involving two or more copies of the
   chromosome of interest per clone. Such polyploid data call be generated
   by initially irradiating normal diploid cells or by pooling haploid or
   diploid clones. The current model assumes that fragments are generated
   in the ancestral cell of a clone according to an independent Poisson
   breakage process along each chromosome. Once generated, Fragments are
   independently retained in the clone with a common retention probability.
   On the basis of this and less restrictive retention models, statistical
   criteria such as minimum obligate breaks, maximum likelihood ratios, and
   Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to decide locus order.
   Distances call be estimated by maximum likelihood. likelihood
   computation is particularly challenging, and computing techniques from
   the theory of hidden Markov chains prove crucial. Within this context it
   is possible to incorporate typing errors. The statistical tools
   discussed here are applied to 14 loci on the short arm of human
   chromosome 4.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{The relative areas of soil profile classes are found to show an
   unexpected regularity in various landscapes (where relative area is
   defined as the proportion of the total soil-covered area of a region
   which is occupied by a particular soil class). If i classes are ordered
   by their relative areas (A(1), A(2),..., A(i)) then a plot of the
   cumulative relative area CA(n) (the sum of relative areas for classes 1
   to n in the sequence) against A(n), may be approximated by a straight
   line. The slope of this line, which must pass through the origin, may be
   estimated from the relative areas of the commoner soil classes which may
   be identified in a reconnaissance soil survey of a region. From the
   slope it is then possible to predict the total number of soil classes in
   the region whose relative areas exceed some threshold. This procedure is
   offered as a technique to aid reconnaissance soil survey, particularly
   where a surveyor must derive a soil classification from a set of samples
   obtained by a random sampling procedure. An estimate of the number of
   soil classes which occur may help in the planning of additional
   purposive sampling to produce a satisfactory classification on which to
   base a map legend.}},

Abstract = {{The object of the study was to determine whether dexamethasone improved
   the efficacy of the serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonist granisetron in
   controlling acute (within 24 h) emesis in cancer patients receiving
   high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy and to ascertain whether continuation
   of granisetron after 24 h reduces the occurrence of delayed emesis. This
   randomised, double-blind, multicentre, three-arm study was conducted at
   21 medical centres. A group of 292 nausea- and emesis-free patients with
   cancer, who had never had chemotherapy and were scheduled to receive at
   least 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin, were given 3 mg granisetron i.v. in a 15-min
   infusion with or without 10 mg dexamethasone i.v. completed 5 min prior
   to high-dose cisplatin and 1 mg granisetron p.o. at +6 h and +12 h.
   Primary study end-points were control of emesis and nausea. Patients
   completed a self-report diary every 6 h for the first 24 h. At the end
   of the 24-h period, the patients who received dexamethasone had a
   significantly higher complete protection rate from emesis (64\% compared
   to 39\%) than those who received no steroid. Similarly, the
   dexamethasone-treated group had a significantly higher complete plus
   partial (0-2 emetic episodes) protection rate (84\% compared to 64\%).
   This study shows that dexamethasone markedly enhances the antiemetic
   efficacy of granisetron for acute-onset emesis in high-dose cisplatin
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Random samples have been used to link social support to a diversity of
   positive outcomes. When viewed within an interaction system, however,
   social support appears within a context of contention and disserves some
   while serving others. The manner in which social support is generated
   can both induce and suppress outcome inequalities. This is shown in the
   effects of fan support on team performance in major league sports. For
   the sports most dependent on partisan local publics, fan support
   functions to suppress the performance inequalities that leagues build
   into competition. For the sports that have cultivated expectation-driven
   national publics, fan support functions to induce performance
   inequalities that leagues seek to eliminate from competition. A computer
   simulation reveals that the entire amount of actual performance
   inequality in national public-oriented NFL football can be explained by
   this perverse effect of supportive publics. Perverse effects, it is
   argued, are essential to the functioning of interaction systems.}},

Abstract = {{The primary production of rangelands in the Sudanian zone of Mali was
   estimated using a method which aims to describe the situation in an
   average and/or a dry rainfall year. This method, proposed by Breman and
   De Ridder (1991), distinguishes 3 approaches differing in accuracy
   level. Two of them, the `'rough'' approach and the `'semi-detailed''
   approach, were applied to rangelands near 3 villages. The `'rough''
   approach derives primary production from purely theoretical functions
   and available data on rainfall and soil parameters, while the
   `'semi-detailed'' approach includes data from a year of field work.
   The `'rough'' approach produced reasonably accurate estimates in one
   village but not in 2 others. We consider that changes in the vegetation
   as a result of more intensive use of rangelands in the 2 villages meant
   that the theoretical functions were no longer applicable there. As this
   is generally the case in the Sudanian zone of Mali, the method of Breman
   and De Ridder appears unsuitable for this region. However, the `'rough''
   approach can be used as a reference to quantify vegetation changes.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic peptide strategy was used to study structure-function
   relationships between residues 32 to 46 of the glycoprotein hormone

   amide corresponding to this region {[}GPH-alpha-(32-46)] inhibited boil?
   I-125-hFSH and I-125-hCG binding to their respective calf testis
   membrane receptors. The concentration at which GPH-alpha-(32-46) peptide
   amide inhibited FSH binding by 50\% (IC50) was 36 mu M, and for hCG it
   was 54 mu M. GPH-alpha-(32-46) peptide amide also inhibited
   FSH-stimulated estradiol biosynthesis in cultured I nr Sertoli cells. in
   order to determine the involvement of individual residues within this
   region of the glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit iii receptor binning
   inhibitory activity, truncated and alanine-substituted peptide analogs
   were synthesized and rested in both FSH and hCG radioligand receptor
   competition assays. Based on the relative potency of each peptide, we
   conclude that Phe-33, Arg-35, Arg-42, Ser-43 and Lys-44 may be
   important, and Cys-32 is required, for inhibition of FSH and hCG binding
   to their respective receptor. Our results demonstrate involvement of the
   glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit in receptor binding, identify
   residues 32 to 46 as a receptor binding domain, and define the relative
   importance of specific residues within this region of the alpha subunit

Abstract = {{A three-stage model of the charge-exchange reactions pi(-)p --> flux
   tube --> pi(0)n is considered. The first stage (pi(-)p --> flux tube) is
   the formation of a flux tube by the annihilation of a mesonic (u) over
   bar quark and a protonic u quark at low relative rapidity. The second
   stage is the stretching of the flux tube, with the d and ud spectators
   placed at its ends, with the relative rapidity ins. The third stage is
   the rupture of the flux tube (flux tube --> pi(0)n), resulting in the
   production of a d (d) over bar pair with low relative rapidity, followed
   by the evolution of the flux tube fragments into a physical pi(0)n
   system. The analysis of experimental data in this model leads to the
   following conclusions: (1) in the spin-flip amplitude, the annihilation
   (production) of quarks occurs predominantly in the P-3(0) state; (2) the
   annihilation probability in this state is close to unity, so that the
   annihilating quarks can be called `'black''; (3) in the non-spin-flip
   amplitude, the P-3(0) mode interferes destructively with other
   annihilation modes (e.g., S-1(0)); (4) the parameters of quark
   annihilation prove to be identical in the reactions pi(-)p --> pi(0)n
   and pi(-)p --> eta n, while the observables of these reactions (i.e.,
   cross sections, the ratio of the spin-flip amplitude to the
   non-spin-flip amplitude, etc.), from which the quark-annihilation
   parameters are deduced, differ strongly in magnitude. The
   quark-annihilation parameters for charge-exchange reactions are compared
   with the corresponding quantities for the production of ordinary
   resonances in the Isgur-Kokoski model.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, our laboratory and others have demonstrated that human
   peripheral blood T and NK lymphocytes directly inhibit the growth of
   Cryptococcus neoformans, In this study, we further define the conditions
   under which lymphocyte-mediated fungistasis against C. neoformans occurs
   and examine whether mechanisms implicated in lymphocyte-mediated
   activities against other target cells are also involved in
   anticryptococcal activity, The addition of whole or broken heat-killed
   C. neoformans modestly inhibited lymphocyte-mediated fungistasis,
   whereas other particulates had no effect, The hydroxyl radical scavenger
   catechin, but not diethyl urea or propyl gallate, profoundly inhibited
   fungistasis. Salicylic acid inhibited fungistasis in a dose-dependent
   fashion, However, two other cyclooxygenase inhibitors, piroxicam and
   indomethacin, had no effect, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition
   by salicylic acid was cyclooxygenase independent, Reagent prostaglandin
   E(2), at concentrations shown by others to inhibit NK cell-mediated
   bactericidal and tumorlytic activities, had no effect on
   lymphocyte-mediated fungistasis, The addition of selected monoclonal
   antibodies or ligands reactive with receptors on human lymphocytes had
   no significant effect on lymphocyte-mediated fungistasis, Acapsular,
   small-capsuled, and large-capsuled C, neoformans organisms were
   inhibited by lymphocytes to an approximately equal extent, These data
   demonstrate that lymphocyte-mediated activity against C, neoformans
   proceeds regardless of the presence of capsule and by mechanisms at
   least in part dissimilar from those seen with other target cells.}},

Abstract = {{It is found that the quasilinear modification of magnetic field produces
   a nonlinear Lorentz force opposing the linear driving force and slowing
   down the vortex flow. A new algebraic growth appears due to this damping
   mechanism to oppose the linear growth of the tearing mode. This effect
   was eliminated in Rutherford's model {[}Phys. Fluids 16, 1903 (1973)]
   under the flux average operation and the assumption partial
   derivative/partial derivative t much less than eta/delta(2) (here eta is
   the resistivity, delta is the resistive layer width). A unified
   analytical model is developed by using standard perturbation theory for
   the linear and nonlinear growth of the tearing mode. The inertia effect
   and quasilinear effects of both the current density and the magnetic
   field have been included. A nonlinear evolution equation is analytically
   derived for the tearing mode to describe the linear growth, Rutherford's
   behavior, and the new behavior. The classical linear result is exactly
   recovered as the quasilinear effects are negligible It is shown that a
   more slowly algebraic growth like Psi(1) proportional to(t) can become
   dominant in the nonlinear phase instead of Rutherford behavior like
   Psi(1) proportional to t(2) provided the tearing mode in the linear
   phase is strongly unstable. Here Psi(1) is the magnetic flux

Abstract = {{The critical period of flower bud induction in `Red Fuji' `Ralls Janet'
   apple trees were studied for two years. The onset and duration of flower
   bud induction were found to be dependent upon crop load of trees and
   type of fruiting-wood. Floral induction took place earlier and its
   duration was longer for buds on `on-year' trees compared to those on
   `off-year' trees. In general, most of the buds on light cropping or
   `off-year' trees of `Red Full and `Ralls Janet' apples had been induced,
   for 10 to 20 days from 10 June to 30 June while a critical period of
   flower bud induction lasted about 40 days from late May to early July on
   heavy cropping or `on-year' trees of `Ralls Janet' apples. Spur buds
   were the first to enter into their physiological conversion process of
   floral induction, followed by the terminal buds of medium new shoots.
   The onset of floral induction was most delayed on the terminal buds of
   long new shoots. However, the induction process finished almost at the
   same time regardless of the types of buds, consequently the duration of
   the flower induction was longer on spur buds than that on the terminal
   buds of new shoots. Moreover, by comparing with the classical methods,
   fruit and leaf removal, the possibility of using GA(3) sprays was
   confirmed as a suitable method for investigating the critical period of
   flower bud induction in apple trees in these studies. 45 to 200 mg I-1
   were the suitable range of GA(3) rate for evaluating the critical period
   of flower bud induction. However, a rate of 100 mg I-1 was recommended.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the characterization of wheel profiles using
   fractal analysis and the Data Dependent Systems approach. The wheel
   profiles studied are profilometry data taken from the surfaces of
   resinoid diamond wheels. Fractal analysis of wheel profiles reveals that
   wheel surfaces exhibit fractal characteristics over a linear range,
   limited by the traced length at larger scales and the measuring method
   at smaller scales. This study finds that: (i) the fractal dimension for
   the wheels studied range from 1.006 to 1.015; (ii) the fractal dimension
   of a coarser wheel is larger than that of a finer wheel; and (iii)
   fractal dimension is highly correlated to the grinding responses, i.e.,
   normal force, power, and surface finish. It is concluded that fractal
   analysis is comparable to the Data Dependent Systems (DDS) approach for
   wheel profile characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells that contain a mutation within rad9 are
   sensitive to ionizing radiation, UV light and hydroxyurea, relative to
   wild-type strains. In addition, the mutants are moderately hypomutable
   by UV and unable to delay initiation of mitosis after treatment with
   radiation or hydroxyurea. Three radioresistant derivatives of rad9::ura4
   cells were isolated, and each contained a single unique extragenic
   suppressor responsible for the acquired resistance. The suppressor loci
   also conferred radioresistance upon cells containing rad9-192, which
   differs from rad9(+) by a single base pair change. The suppressors
   additionally enhanced the radioresistance of cells containing rad3-136,
   a mutation that leads to phenotypes similar to those mediated by
   rad9::ura4. None of the derivatives of rad9::ura4 cells recovered the
   ability to delay cycling in G2 after exposure to ionizing radiation or
   UV light. All three suppressor derivatives, relative to the parental
   rad9::ura4 strain, also exhibited a moderate increase in resistance to
   the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea without gaining the ability to
   stop progression into mitosis despite the inhibition of DNA synthesis.
   Results are discussed in terms of models to explain the putative role of
   rad9 and the suppressor genes in promoting radioresistance and mediating
   checkpoint controls responsive to DNA damage or incomplete DNA

Abstract = {{The first malacological successions covering the Late-glacial period and
   the early Holocene are reported from archaeological, sites in northern
   France. Five malacological zones (S1-5) are recognized which are related
   to the regional lithostratigraphy, Upper Palaeolithic/Mesolithic
   archaeology and to a radiocarbon chronology. The zone S1, which contains
   an assemblage of low species diversity but with abundant Vallonia,
   allows attribution of the basal loess (reworked as a rainwashed silt in
   the valley bottom) to the early Late-glacial, rather than the
   Pleniglacial. Overlying the loessic sediments is an organic silt, known
   as the `Belloy soil' at Belloy, which has yielded birch pollen (but no
   pine) allowing attribution to the early part of `'Allerod'' phase of the
   Late-glacial. The molluscan faunas from this level (S2) are richer and
   more diverse. Helicopsis striata (Muller) appears to be typical of this
   period. Above the Allerod deposit is a minerogenic silt containing
   rhizomes, but this is only represented in the valley floors. The
   malacofaunas from this unit (S3) are similar to those of the Allerod
   silt but contain a higher proportion of hygrophilous taxa. These faunas
   are assigned to the Younger Dryas, a conclusion supported by radiocarbon
   dating of bones associated with the terminal Upper Palaeolithic
   `'Industrie a pieces machurees'' which occur at the top of the unit. The
   Late-glacial succession is overlain by organic silts of Holocene age,
   which at several sites have yielded Mesolithic artefacts. The molluscan
   faunas are much more diverse than the earlier Late-glacial assemblages
   and contain abundant shade-demanding taxa (S4), then a fall in species
   diversity and a reversion to faunas of open-ground occur (S5).
   Comparison of these successions with similar sites in Burgundy, the
   Paris basin and southeastern England demonstrate a closer affinity to
   the molluscan sequences of Kent rather than to the French sites,
   although Late-glacial molluscan faunas are still poorly known from
   France. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{Photodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be an important
   natural decomposition mechanism. As most PCB congeners do not strongly
   absorb wavelength above 300 nm, sensitizers are used in the transfer of
   light energy to the PCB molecule in order to enhance their degradation.
   The objectives of this study were to determine the rate-order of
   reaction and the photodegradation rates of PCB congeners by simulated
   sunlight in the presence of diethylamine. Five PCB congeners (66, 101,
   110, 118, and 138) with diethylamine were exposed to simulated sunlight
   from 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, to 24 hr. These five congeners constitute 45.45 \%
   of all the Aroclor 1254 congeners. Half-lives of these congeners, after
   exposure to simulated sunlight and diethylamine, ranged from 3.4 to 9.9
   hr. The photodegradation rate constant of the PCB congeners varied from
   0.07+/-0.01 to 0.20+/-0.04 hr(-1). The photodegradation rate was
   proportional to the concentration of the PCB congener suggesting a
   pseudo first order reaction of PCB photodegradation. The data also
   indicated that the photodegradation is independent of the concentration
   of diethylamine. Degradation of congener 101 was 5 times faster with
   simulated than with natural sunlight. The product quantum yield of PCB
   congeners ranged from 2.6+/-0.3 to 7.5+/-0.2 x10(-4) in the presence of

   distinguished by some statistical dependence between the observed value
   of one component and the reliability of the estimate of the value of
   another is examined. Such a dependence is typical of multidimensional
   speckled images formed by remote sounding means.
   The proposed approach allows one to approach the segmentation procedure
   from unified positions, independently of the features of the physical
   processes which shaped the analyzed images, provided the indicated
   conditions ate satisfied. A formula of the decision rule for segmenting
   the image by the criterion of maximum a-posteriori probability is
   obtained for a normal distribution of the parameter estimates. Each
   segmented region is assigned its index in this case. Simultaneously, the
   algorithm allows one to analyze somewhat the original scene, since the
   algorithm outputs not only a segmented image but also the
   characteristics of each of the regions it isolates.}},

Abstract = {{The relative uptake rates of N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Al
   were estimated in beech seedlings pot cultured in the field in six acid
   soils (treatments). The relative uptake rates were compared with the
   relative growth rates. The relative uptake rates of N, K and Ca agreed
   well with the growth rates of the seedlings irrespective of widely
   differing soil conditions (acid sand-clayey till, pH 4-6). The relative
   uptake rates of P, Fe, and Al differed from that predicted by the growth
   rate. The uptake rates of Fe and Al were highest at the lowest growth
   rates, and the P uptake rate was lower than the growth rate in these
   treatments. Thus the P availability probably limited growth in an
   eluvial (E) horizon of a podzol, and possibly in the illuvial (B)
   horizon of a podzol and in an acid clayey till (Dystric Cambisol). Low P
   uptake was associated with a tendency towards higher relative root
   growth rates. In terms of the concept of steady state nutrition the high
   relative root growth rate in some treatments may be interpreted as an
   acclimation to low P supply. The P limitation seemed to be related to
   interactions among Fe, Al and organic compounds of the soil solution.}},

   solutions, and the steady-state magnetic flux density is proportional to
   the square root of the power input. The polarity of the induced magnetic

Abstract = {{Bimonthly beam-trawling from April 1991 to May 1992 and diver
   observations were used to assess distribution and large-scale movement
   of snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, over depths of 4-140 m in a bay of
   the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Megalopae settled during October
   1991. Immature crabs of instars I-IV (i.e., 3.3-9.7 mm mean carapace
   width, CW) were found predominantly on bottoms approximate to 50-80 m
   deep and were cryptic and sedentary. Most immature crabs of instars
   V-VIII (i.e., 14.1-34.5 mm mean CW) and adolescent males (i.e.,
   producing sperm but not terminally moulted) migrated in winter to
   subtidal grounds, where they moulted. Movement to shallow waters was
   massive and resulted in a mean density of 860 crabs per 1000 m(2) at
   approximate to 15 m in December 1991. Adult males (i.e., producing sperm
   and terminally moulted) of <70 mm mean CW also moved to the shallow
   grounds from October to December 1991, where some mated with
   pubescent-primiparous females (i.e., adult, first brood) from January to
   April 1992. Adult males of >90 mm mean CW were mainly found at depths
   >80 m over most of the year, but from March to May 1992 an increase in
   mean CW of adult males at <80 m indicated some upslope movement,
   probably to mate with multiparous females (i.e., adult, second or
   ulterior brood). Adult females were more gregarious and sedentary than
   adult males. We expand on the hypothesis that interannual variability in
   recruitment to adulthood tends to reflect differences in year-class
   strength, and that year-class strength varies in accordance with
   megalopal supply and (or) survivorship of cryptic instars.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an answer-perturbation model for the protection of
   statistical databases. Compared to previous approaches, this model saves
   both space and time since neither a copy of the original database nor an
   extra processing of the query set is needed. The modularity of our
   protection mechanism (perturbation is applied after the query
   processing, not during it or upon data entry, as in the other
   approaches) facilitates the implementation. The method presented is
   user-oriented and since the usability (accuracy) of the statistically
   altered answers can be fine-tuned, the balance between usability and
   protection (security) is under the control of the database
   administrator.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of progesterone (P-4), estradiol-17 beta (E(2)), and 8-bromo
   (br)-cAMP to inhibit smalt granulosa cells (GCs) from undergoing
   insulin-dependent mitosis was examined. Small GCs were isolated from
   immature and eCG-primed rats and separated by Percoll fractionation.
   Small GCs were cultured for 24 h with various combinations of insulin,
   steroids, steroid receptor antagonists, and 8-br-cAMP. Before and after
   culture, the number of GCs was counted. Small GC proliferation was
   expressed as a percentage increase over the initial value. P-4 inhibited
   insulin-dependent mitosis of small GCs isolated from both immature and
   eCG-primed rats. The effects of P-4 were dose-dependent,
   steroid-specific, and reversed by the progesterone antagonist RU486,
   E(2) inhibited insulin-dependent mitosis of small GCs isolated from
   immature but not eCG-primed rats. The action of E(2) was dose-dependent
   and inhibited by the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen, Additional studies
   were conducted in which small GCs from immature rats were cultured with
   insulin in the presence of both P-4 and E(2) and their respective
   antagonist. Both antagonists were required for insulin to induce GC
   mitosis in the presence of P-4 and E(2). Further, the ability of P-4 to
   suppress insulin-dependent mitosis was reduced if it was not present
   during the first 6 h of culture. In contrast, E(2) could be added up to
   12 h after insulin exposure and still completely prevent GC mitosis,
   8-br-cAMP also prevented insulin-dependent GC proliferation. The actions
   of 8-br-cAMP could not be reversed by aminoglutethimide or RU486, This
   indicates that 8-br-cAMP does not block mitosis by increasing steroid
   synthesis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that insulin-dependent
   mitosis of small GCs isolated from immature rats is negatively regulated
   by P-4, E(2), and 8-br-cAMP. Each of these regulators appears to mediate
   their antimitotic action through different cellular pathways, Further,
   in vivo treatment with eCG induces changes within small GCs that result
   in the loss of E(2)'s anti mitogenic action.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To compare volume-controlled inverse ratio ventilation
   (VCIRV) with volume-controlled ventilation with conventional inspiratory
   to expiratory (I:E) ratio (VCV PEEP) at equal levels of end-expiratory
   pressure.
   Design: Animal study using an oleic acid lung injury model with random
   application of VCV PEEP and VCIRV.
   Setting: Experimental investigation at the Department Of Clinical
   Physiology at Uppsala University.
   Animals: Seven pigs.
   Interventions: VCV PEEP, VCIRV at an end-expiratory pressure level of 10
   cm H2O.
   Measurements and results: Lung mechanics, hemodynamics, gas exchange,
   and functional residual capacity. Recruitment of lung tissue, regional
   lung density, and distribution of inspired gas by computed tomography,
   Mean and peak airway pressures were 22+/-4 and 41+/-8 cm H2O with VCIRV
   and 18+/-2 and 45+/-7 cm H2O with VCV PEEP, Cardiac output and arterial
   oxygen tension were equal with VCV PEEP and VCIRV as were static
   compliance, physiologic dead space, and functional residual capacity.
   End-expiratory, end-inspiratory, and er densities during a full
   ventilatory cycle were not statistically different and the amounts of
   nonaerated and poorly aerated lung areas were of equal size with VCV
   PEEP and VCIRV.
   Conclusions: VCIRV was comparable to VCV PEEP at similar PEEP levels in
   alveolar recruitment, aeration of the lung tissues, and in oxygenating
   the blood. Since cardiac output also remained unchanged, oxygen delivery
   to peripheral tissues did not differ significantly between the two
   modes. Neither method has thus proved superior to the other one.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the influences of habitat, temperature, stream discharge,
   and the timing of spawning on the nesting success of smallmouth bass
   Micropterus dolomieu. Smallmouth bass began spawning when temperatures
   reached 15 degrees C, and high how disrupted spawning five times. Larger
   males spawned earlier than smaller males; a log-linear relation between
   male length and degree-days accumulated was significant (r = -0.63, P <
   0.01). In all, 45 of 105 nests (43\%) and 42 of 81 males (52\%) produced
   free-swimming larvae. Production of free-swimming larvae was variable
   and lower than previously reported, ranging from 98 to 1,802 (mean,
   608). Large males (>305 mm total length) accounted for the highest
   production of free-swimming larvae and also made the most renesting
   attempts, which suggests that large males can have a strong influence on
   year-class strength. Stepwise discriminant analysis distinguished
   successful nests from unsuccessful nests by higher flow at time of nest
   construction, higher mean temperatures, lower mean stream discharge
   during nest incubation, and shorter distance to shore. High flow (>10
   m(3)/s) was responsible for most nest failures (85\%). Increased water
   velocity at nest sites with increased stream discharge was the most
   likely cause of nest failures. The increase of mean velocity with
   increased stream discharge was significantly lower for successful nests
   than for unsuccessful nests, which showed that nest location determines
   the degree of exposure to high Rows. The temporal pattern of streamflow
   fluctuation appears to be the most important abiotic factor determining
   nesting success or failure for smallmouth bass in this perennial stream.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted disruption of the mouse Ftz-F1 gene, which encodes the orphan

   developmental abnormalities, all Ftz-F1-disrupted mice died in the
   immediate postnatal period and had very low glucocorticoid levels, In
   this report, we show that treatment with corticosteroids markedly
   prolonged survival of the Ftz-F1-disrupted mice, proving that steroid
   hormone deficiency causes their death, We also generated SF-1-specific
   knockout mice with a targeting construct that specifically disrupted the
   SF-1 coding sequence without impairing the ELF protein, The phenotype of
   the SF-1-specific knockout mice was indistinguishable from that observed
   in Ftz-F1-disrupted mice that lack both SF-1 and ELF. Taken together,

   linearly with depth. The governing equations for the drain-soil system

Abstract = {{We herein evaluated 36 cases of combined hepatocellular and
   cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) (including 29 surgically resected and seven
   autopsy cases) by the immunohistochemical methods of anticytokeratin
   antibodies 7 and 19, and then analyzed the clinicopathologic features by
   comparing cHCC-CC with ordinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
   cholangiocarcinoma (CC). The results indicated that even if mucin
   production could not be confirmed, nine cases with HCC areas that showed
   a histological resemblance to CC also showed immunohistological biliary
   differentiation. Therefore, we advocate that these HCC with biliary
   differentiation based on an immunohistochemical analysis should thus be
   included in the criteria of cHCC-CC in broad terms. Regardless of the
   extent of mucin production, the cHCC-CCs as indicated by an
   immunohistochemical analysis are considered to have a similar background
   to that of ordinary HCCs regarding such factors as the average age,
   male:female ratio, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C
   virus antibody (HCVAb) positivity, alpha-fetoprotein level, and the
   presence of cirrhosis. However, cHCC-CCs tend to metastasize to many
   organs and the lymph nodes, and, as a result, have a poor prognosis.

   conclusions are drawn: (1) humans think, (2) human thinking influences
   human behavior, and vice-versa, and (3) dialogues on this topic would be

Abstract = {{Clinically, orthodontists are often faced with the difficulties of
   bonding to porcelain crowns, veneers, or bridges. Traditional methods of
   dealing with this are often time-consuming and generally esthetically
   unacceptable to patients. Current interest involves the use of
   organosilane primers with or without NTG-GMA and BPDM resins to aid in
   chemically bonding porcelain with traditional orthodontic adhesives.
   This study compared the bond strength of three types of adhesion
   promoters: Ormco Porcelain Primer (OR) (Ormco Corp., Glendora, Calif,),
   All-Bond2 (AB2) (Bisco Dental Products, Inc., Itasca, III.), and
   Scotchprime Ceramic Primer (SP) (3M, St, Paul, Minn,) with two
   orthodontic adhesives: Phase II (Reliance, Inc., Itasca, III.) and
   Rely-a-bond (Reliance, Inc., Itasca, III.). Eighty ceramometal samples
   were fabricated and hydrated for 1 week in distilled water before
   bonding. Next, the samples were etched with 2.5\% HF acid for 90
   seconds, rinsed and upper central incisor metal orthodontic brackets
   were bonded with the various primers and adhesives. After 24 hours they
   were sheared off with an MTS machine at a rate of 0.5 mm/min, and the
   bond strength was measured. The mean shear bond strengths (MPa) with
   Phase II were as follows: Control 0.44 (sigma = 0.22), AB2 8.40 (sigma =
   3.61), OR 13.31 (sigma = 5.79), SP 13.53 (sigma = 3.34). With
   Rely-a-bond, the shear bond stengths were Control 0.41 (sigma = 0.67),
   AB2 4.34 (sigma = 1.88), OR 9.73 (sigma = 4.58), and SP 12.40 (sigma =
   3.05). An analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests were run
   on the data, and it was found that there was a significant difference
   between the types of resin/primer combinations and the bond strength
   obtained. Overall, there were significant differences between all the
   primer/adhesive combinations except for Scotchprime and Ormco primers
   that were not statistically different. Scotchprime did tend to have more
   consistent results on the basis of standard deviations alone.
   Furthermore, Phase II resin resulted in higher bond strengths but
   consequently increased the incidence of porcelain fracture on debonding.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in
   post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) in Greece we prospectively followed 143
   transfusion recipients, receiving 790 units of blood and/or products
   from 789 donors, between October 1989 and December 1991. The mean number
   of units transfused per patient was 5.52. PTH was observed in 18
   patients (12.59\%). One patient (0.70\%) developed hepatitis B, in four
   (2.80\%) hepatitis could be attributed to CMV infection, 10 (6.99\%)
   developed hepatitis C and three (2.10\%) showed only raised alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT) levels, The risk of PTH per 1000 units transfused
   was 22.8. The patient who developed hepatitis B (PTH-B) was transfused
   with four units, one of which was positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBe.
   Seven of the 10 patients (70\%) who developed hepatitis C (PTH-C) were
   transfused with at least one unit seropositive in the anti-HCV screening
   with 2nd-generation tests (ELISA-2 and RIBA-2), whereas 9/10 of PTH-C
   cases (90\%) were transfused with at least one unit positive in
   3rd-generation assays. Of the three patients who showed only ALT
   elevation, none was transfused with anti-HCV seropositive blood,
   although one of them was transfused with at least one unit with elevated
   ALT levels. We conclude that: (1) the incidence of PTH in Greece remains
   high, (2) screening of all donations for anti-HCV with an ELISA-2 does
   not exclude transmission of HCV and (3) ELISA-3 and RIBA-3 seem to be
   more sensitive in blood donor screening and in detecting seroconversions
   than ELISA-2 and RIBA-2.}},

Abstract = {{The present study explores the possible chanelling of pyruvate generated
   by either pyruvate kinase or NADP-malate dehydrogenase to lactate
   dehydrogenase in cross-linked and permeabilized erythrocytes. The
   generation of both unlabelled and C-14-labelled pyruvate and lactate was
   measured in rat erythrocytes, which were prepared for cross-linking with
   dimethyl suberimidate and permeabilization by digitonin and then exposed
   to unlabelled or C-14-labelled malate and/or phospho-enol-pyruvate. Rat
   erythrocytes were found to display NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity.
   Under conditions in which the generation rates of pyruvate from either
   phospho-enol-pyruvate (15 mu M) or malate (0.5 mM) were not vastly
   different from one another, a greater fraction of the 2-keto acid was
   converted to lactate when produced from phospho-enol-{[}1-C-14]pyruvate
   rather than {[}U-C-14]malate. This difference was most obvious when the
   availability of exogenous NADH was close to or somewhat below that
   theoretically required to ensure full conversion of endogenously formed
   pyruvate to lactate. These findings are compatible with the view that
   pyruvate generated at the pyruvate kinase level is converted to lactate
   more efficiently than pyruvate produced in the reaction catalysed by
   NADP-malate dehydrogenase.}},

Abstract = {{Native parasitoid species became associated with the galls of
   Trichilogaster acacinelongifoliae (Froggatt) within two years of its
   deliberate introduction into South Africa during 1982 for biological
   control of Acacia longifolia (Andr.) Willd., a perennial, leguminous
   shrubby weed from Australia. Emergence of adult parasitoids from galls
   collected during the 1994 austral summer indicated that levels of
   parasitism were low (0.6 \%) and had not increased from previous years.
   Inspections of immature T. acaciaelongifoliae within galls showed that
   the incidence of parasitism was much higher (8.6 \%) than was deduced
   from adult emergence. Levels of parasitism varied from 0 \% to 21.3 \%
   at four different localities. Most parasitoids were found in chambers
   located close to the surface of the gall, irrespective of gall size or
   the numbers of chambers per gall, and only a small proportion of the
   occupants of deep-seated chambers were parasitized. There were no
   parasitoids in the galls until late-November by which time adult
   emergence of T. acaciaelongifoliae was well advanced. Consequently, T.
   acaciaelongifoliae is protected, both by its physical position and by
   its asynchronized phenology, from the generalist parasitoids it has
   acquired, and the wasp persists as an important biological control agent
   of A. longifolia in South Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Salivary gland degeneration in ixodid ticks is triggered by an
   ecdysteroid hormone. We used {[}H-3]ponasterone A (PoA) as a specific
   ligand to detect the ecdysteroid receptor in the salivary glands of
   large, partially fed female ticks (Amblyomma hebraeum Koch; Acari:
   Ixodidae). Binding of {[}H-3]PoA was thermolabile and sensitive to
   pronase, but not to DNase or RNase, indicating that the ligand binds to
   a protein. Scatchard analysis of {[}H-3]PoA binding strongly suggested
   the presence of an ecdysteroid receptor in cytosolic and nuclear
   extracts of the tissue. The K-d and B-max for PoA binding in cytosol
   were 0.72 +/- 0.09 nM and 175 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein, respectively (n =
   8). Corresponding figures for nuclear extract were 1.1 +/- 0.5 nM and
   282 +/- 35 fmol/mg protein, respectively (n = 3; P > 0.05 compared to
   cytosol). The relative ability of unlabeled ecdysteroids to compete for
   {[}H-3]PoA binding was (in descending order): PoA > muristerone A >
   makisterone A > 20-hydroxyecdysone > mesylinokosterone > ecdysone. The
   K-d estimated for 20-hydroxyecdysone (probably the natural hormone)
   correlates very well with its physiological potency in inducing salivary
   gland degeneration in vivo and in organ culture. None of the vertebrate
   steroids tested (estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, and
   corticosterone) was able to displace PoA binding at a concentration
   10(5) times higher than PoA. The cytosolic form of the receptor migrated
   to the 3.2 S region of a 10-40\% sucrose density gradient. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed for finding all epsilon-feasible solutions
   for certain classes of nonlinearly constrained systems of equations. By
   introducing slack variables, the initial problem is transformed into a
   global optimization problem (P) whose multiple global minimum solutions
   with a zero objective value (if any) correspond to all solutions of the
   initial constrained system of equalities. All epsilon-globally optimal
   points of (P) are then localized within a set of arbitrarily small
   disjoint rectangles. This is based on a branch and bound type global
   optimization algorithm which attains finite E-convergence to each of the
   multiple global minima of (P) through the successive refinement of a
   convex relaxation of the feasible legion and the subsequent solution of
   a series of nonlinear convex optimization problems. Based on the form of
   the participating functions, a number of techniques for constructing
   this convex relaxation are proposed. By taking advantage of the
   properties of products of univariate functions, customized convex lower
   bounding functions are introduced for a large number of expressions that
   are or can be transformed into products of univariate functions.
   Alternative convex relaxation procedures involve either the difference
   of two convex functions employed in alpha BB {[}23] or the exponential
   variable transformation based underestimators employed for generalized
   geometric programming problems {[}24]. The proposed approach is
   illustrated with several test problems. For some of these problems
   additional solutions are identified that existing methods failed to
   locate.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is presented for efficient generation of high-quality two-
   or three-dimensional unstructured grids of triangular or tetrahedral
   elements. The present procedure uses an iterative point creation and
   insertion scheme wherein points are created using advancing-front type
   point placement. Initially, the connectivity for these generated points
   is obtained by directly subdividing the elements which contain them,
   without regard to quality. This connectivity is then improved by
   iteratively using local reconnection subject to a quality criterion. For
   two dimensions, a min-max criterion is used and for three dimensions, a
   Delaunay in-sphere criterion followed by a min-max type criterion is
   used. The overall procedure is applied repetitively until a complete
   field grid is generated with a desired point distribution. Grid quality
   and performance statistics are presented for a variety of two- and
   three-dimensional configurations. The combined quality and efficiency
   attributes of this procedure appear to be a substantial improvement over
   existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Inadequate adaptation of a filling material to a gold crown can promote
   the passage of bacteria; thus, recontamination of sound dentin and/or

   the marginal microleakage between two different amalgams (Tytin and
   Valiant PhD-XT), three different composites (Tetric, Charisma, and
   Polofil Molar), and one glass-ionomer cement(Ketac Silver) and gold cast
   crowns using a helium gas microleakage method. In order to standardize
   the research parameters, gold washers with standardized dimensions were
   used as study models together with a helium leakage testing device,
   Standardized cavities were punched into the gold washers, The cavities
   were filled according to the manufacturers' recommendations with the
   different materials. The amount of helium passing the marginal interface
   between the fillings and cavities was measured with a mass spectrometer
   48 hours after the fillings were placed and after 100, 1000, and 2000
   thermocycles (5 degrees C-55 degrees C). The results showed that amalgam
   allowed the least microleakage. Ketac Silver showed the greatest
   microleakage. Statistically significant differences were found between
   the composites and both amalgams and Ketac Silver between the 48-hour
   and 100-thermocycling groups. Yet, Ketac Silver showed a significant
   ascending tendency when compared to the composites and amalgams after
   100, 1000, and 2000 thermocycles.}},

Abstract = {{The present study addressed the investigation of the basic fundamentals
   of the behaviour of celestite (SrSO4), strontianite (SrCO3) and calcite
   (CaCO3) in aqueous solutions in the presence and absence of sodium
   oleate. The results showed that the isoelectric point (IEP((aq))) of
   aqueous suspensions of strontianite and calcite takes place at pH 8 and
   8.2, respectively; from thermodynamics, the IEP((aq)) of the minerals
   takes place at pH 8 and 8.3, respectively. Similarly, a thermodynamic
   analysis of the celestite-aqueous solution equilibrium open to the
   atmosphere showed celestite transforms to strontium carbonate in
   alkaline slurries (pH greater than or equal to 7.75). This phenomenon is
   due to the chemical reaction of celestite with the carbonate ion that
   forms in the solution as a result of the dissolution of the atmospheric
   CO2. The results of the mineral-aqueous solution equilibrium,
   electrokinetic and infrared spectroscopy studies appear to confirm such
   a superficial transformation. The electrokinetic studies showed the
   isoelectric point (IEP) of celestite and strontianite takes place at pH
   5.4 and 7.4, respectively.
   The floatability of the minerals was investigated in the pH range 5 to
   11 and varying the concentration of sodium oleate from 10(-6) to 10(-4)
   M. The results showed that celestite floatability had a maximum in the
   pH range 7 to 9; at higher pH values its floatability tended to decrease
   as a result of its surface transformation to strontium carbonate. The
   floatability of strontianite and calcite was substantially lower than
   that of celestite and tended to increase with the pH (pH greater than or
   equal to 7) and concentration of sodium oleate. It is proposed that in
   alkaline slurries sodium oleate was adsorbed on the celestite,
   strontianite and calcite surfaces by a chemisorption mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Vitronectin is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of
   the immune system and blood coagulation. Here we report that the
   expression of vitronectin is developmentally regulated in the embryonic
   retina of the chicken. Vitronectin immunoreactivity was detected in
   chicken retinas from embryonic day 5, encompassing the cell bodies of
   most neuroepithelial cells. At this developmental stage, alpha v
   integrin subunit expression was distributed across the retina,
   suggesting a ligand/receptor interaction. Expression of both vitronectin
   and alpha v increased during development and reached a maximum at
   embryonic day 9, a time when most differentiated neurons grow processes
   and initiate synapse formation. At this age, vitronectin
   immunoreactivity appeared to be located predominantly in the fiber and
   inner plexiform layers of the differentiated stratified retina. alpha v
   immunoreactivity and mRNA expression was seen associated with all layers
   formed by differentiated neurons, being most abundant in the ganglion
   cell and inner nuclear layers. Later in development, levels of
   vitronectin decreased and immunoreactivity appeared exclusively
   associated with the fiber layer. In accordance with this pattern of
   expression, vitronectin as a substrate sustained both proliferation and
   differentiation of cultured neuroepithelial cells from embryonic day 5
   retinas. At later stages, vitronectin supported survival and neurite
   outgrowth of most differentiated neurons.
   Our data suggest that vitronectin is a ubiquitous component of the
   retinal extracellular matrix, serving as a substrate for developmental
   processes such as proliferation, differentiation of neuron progenitors,
   cell survival, and axonal and dendritic growth of differentiated
   neurons.}},

Abstract = {{A new computational scheme integrating ab initio and molecular mechanics
   descriptions in different parts of the same molecule is presented. In
   contrast with previous approaches, this method is especially designed to
   allow the introduction of molecular mechanics corrections in full
   geometry optimizations concerning problems usually studied through ab
   initio calculations on model systems. The scheme proposed in this
   article intends to solve some of the systematic error associated with
   modeling through the use of molecular mechanics corrections. This
   method, which does not require any new parameter, evaluates explicitly
   the energy derivatives with respect to geometrical parameters and
   therefore has a straightforward application to geometry optimization.
   Examples of its performance on two simple cases are provided: the
   equilibrium geometry of cyclopropene and the energy barriers on S(N)2
   reactions of alkyl chloride systems. Results are in satisfactory
   agreement with those of full ab initio calculations in both cases. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to establish the preparation method of high-quality CuInSe2
   single crystals, we have investigated the chemical reaction process of
   CuInSe2 by differential thermal analysis and by powder X-ray diffraction
   measurements. It is confirmed that CuInSe2 compound undergoes a phase
   transition from chalcopyrite to sphalerite structure at 815 degrees C
   and melts at 996 degrees C. In the chemical reaction process of a
   Cu+In+2Se mixture, an explosive exothermic reaction occurs at 250
   degrees C, which is ascribed to the formation of intermediate products
   of the In-Se system. In the chemical reaction process of a CuIn+2Se
   mixture, an explosive selenization reaction forming CuInSe2 compound
   occurs at 575 degrees C. It is concluded that the selenization of CuIn
   alloy at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C suppresses the formation
   of lattice defects and heterogeneous products.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrafunctional silicon monomers have been incorporated into soluble
   branched polysilanes. Tetrakis(chlorodimethylsilyl)silane has been
   homopolymerized to form an irregular branched polymer which may contain
   some spiro and some bicyclic units. This polymer shows weak absorption
   at approximate to 300 nm, the region of the linear polysilane chains. It
   emits broadly in the region from 400 to 500 nm. The copolymers of
   tetrakis( chlorodimethylsilyl)silane with dichlorodimethylsilane are
   also soluble and in the presence of large amount of the tetrakis monomer
   emit in the region from 400 to 500 nm. By contrast, copolymers with
   phenyltrichlorosilane emit strongly at 450 to 650 nm, due to the
   phenylsilane hyperbranched structure. Small amounts of tetrachlorosilane
   can be incorporated into soluble polysilanes. Incorporation of =Si=
   units into polymers with n-hexyl substituents is very inefficient but
   leads to minor changes in emission spectra. Incorporation into polymers
   with phenyl substituents affects luminescence and increases molecular
   weights and broadens polydispersities. Reaction with
   dimethyldichlorosilane provides soluble low molecular weight oligomers
   and polymers. Polymers prepared with a small proportion of
   tetrachlorosilane show absorption and emission typical for linear
   polymers. Polymers synthesized with higher proportion of
   tetrachlorosilanes emit broadly at 400 to 500 nm, indicating the
   presence of Si clusters. The silicon clusters entrapped into soluble
   polymers are very easily oxidized as seen by the siloxane peaks in Si-29
   NMR spectra and they should be treated under complete exclusion of
   oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{The separation of time and space in processing a sample greatly
   simplifies the design of automation for clinical testing. The efficient
   spatial arrangement of analytical units and sample manipulators has
   become a more complex task because of the degree of automation required
   on today's state-of-the-art analyzer. Minimization of sample volume and
   the reduction of overall analyzer size further complicate the design
   problem. We report the development of a proprietary method of decoupling
   the temporal and spatial elements required for analysis of samples. This
   process is based on number theory and can be used to optimize the
   distance between the physical processing stations while allowing these
   same stations to operate on samples over a substantial range of times.
   The technique is versatile and can also be used when it is desirable to
   sequentially move groups of items from location to location.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore seismic reflection profiles crossing the Caledonian orogenic
   front (locally, ?Moine thrust) between Shetland and the Scottish
   Highlands show a singular coherent east-dipping reflection underlain by
   a highly reflective dipping zone in the middle crust extending down to
   the Moho discontinuity. This reflector pattern varies spatially with
   respect to the eastern edge of the Precambrian Lewisian foreland as well
   as to previously mapped locations of the Moine thrust. Southwest of
   Shetland, the reflector pattern coincides with the offshore projection
   of the Moine thrust, but further south, toward the Highlands, the
   reflector diverges to the west of the thrust and actually underlies
   autochthonous Lewisian foreland basement. Where this reflector pattern
   diverges from the Moine thrust, two interpretations are possible: the
   prominent reflector is part of a basement imbricate thrust duplex within
   the footwall (or `lower plate') of the Moine thrust that merges with the
   thrust zone further north and/or it was originally a Proterozoic normal
   fault which, further north around Shetland, was reactivated or
   over-printed by the Moine thrust. The latter interpretation supports the
   importance of pre-existing crustal structure in controlling Caledonian
   compressional deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The appropriate management of partially lacerated digital flexor tendons
   in zone 2 is controversial. Tenorrhaphy has been advocated by some on
   the basis of improving tendon gliding function, whereas others have
   recommended foregoing tenorrhaphy because of the negative impact of
   repair on the tensile strength of the tendon. In light of this division,
   we undertook a study of the effect of varying degrees of partial
   laceration on the structural properties of the canine flexor digitorum
   profundus tendon. Lacerations up to 90\% of the tendon cross-sectional
   area were surgically fashioned. We conclude that the structural
   properties of the tendon are increasingly adversely affected as
   laceration size increases. However, based on previous estimates of in
   vivo forces, even tendons with up to 60\% cross-sectional area
   involvement may be strong enough to withstand an early active
   mobilization regimen. Further, we conclude that neither calipers nor
   naked-eye estimates provide a reliable means of assessing the extent of
   tendon laceration.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that blocking GABA(A) receptors with
   bicuculline in the dorsal and lateral quadrants of the rostral
   two-thirds of the midbrain central gray (MCG) in rats reduces the
   lordosis quotient (LQ) and preceptive behaviors without increasing the
   defensive index (McCarthy, Pfaff, and Schwartz-Giblin, 1991b),
   indicating that tonic release of endogenous GABA in the MCG has a
   primary facilitatory effect on reproductive behaviors. The present study
   tests whether two modulators of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine-receptor
   complex, diazepam and the progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone,
   facilitate female receptivity as well as open-field behavior.
   Ovariectomized estradiol benzoate (EB)-treated rats were bilaterally
   infused in the MCG with vehicle, diazepam, or allopregnanolone and
   tested 20 min after diazepam and 12 min after allopregnanolone. Animals
   were tested once each for both receptive or open-field behavior with
   testing sessions being at least 1 week apart in a crossover design
   between vehicle and one of the two drugs. Both diazepam and
   allopregnanolone significantly increased the lordosis quotient in a
   dose-dependent manner, the lowest effective dose tested being 100 and
   250 ng, respectively. In the open-field test, infusion of diazepam (100
   ng) in EB-treated rats significantly increased the ratio of central
   squares entered to total squares entered (C/T) without a change in total
   activity. Rats without EB elicited comparable C/T ratios when tested
   with five times as much diazepam. Diazepam infusions at more dorsal
   sites in the midbrain and in overlying cortex were without effect on C/T
   ratios in EB-treated rats. Allopregnanolone (500 ng) infusions in MCG of
   EB-treated rats did not alter C/T ratios compared to animals without EB.
   Our results are consistent with diazepam and allopregnanolone acting
   through the GABA(A) receptors of the MCG to enhance female sexual
   receptivity and with estradiol potentiating the effect of diazepam in
   the MCG to increase open-field behavior. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of viral and cellular oncogenes on a human erythroleukemic
   cell line (TF-1) were investigated. The TF-1 cell line required
   granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for growth but
   this factor-dependency was abrogated by the constitutive expression of
   either viral (v-fms, v-Ha-ras and v-src) or cellular oncogenes (BCR-ABL
   and Delta N-raf). Furthermore the overexpression of the human
   insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor could substitute the
   dependency on GM-CSF with a requirement for either IGF-1 or insulin as a
   proliferative signal. An autocrine cytokine, (GM-CSF) was found in the
   supernatant of cells transformed by Delta N-raf (and to a lesser extent
   in cells infected with other oncogenes. The level of GM-CSF secreted by
   the Delta N-raf transformants was sufficient to support the
   proliferation of the parental cell line. GM-CSF mRNA transcripts were
   detected in the Delta N-raf-infected but not in the parental cells. No
   structural alterations of the GMCSF locus were seen in these cells.
   Together these observations indicated that overexpression of a raf
   oncogene resulted in the expression of GM-CSF transcripts. The rates of
   glucose transport were elevated above basal levels by GMCSF and by
   oncogene expression indicating that this pivotal control point of
   metabolism correlated with mitogenesis and malignant transformation.
   These studies indicate the importance of raf in growth regulation as its
   deregulation can lead to autocrine synthesis of cytokines in certain
   hematopoietic cells. Furthermore these results suggest a synergy between
   oncogene and cytokine gene regulation leading to autocrine growth factor
   expression and tumor progression.}},

Abstract = {{Am-241 was determined radiochemically in the tissues of USTUR Case 246,
   a 76-y-old man who died of cardiovascular disease 11 y after massive
   percutaneous exposure following a chemical explosion in a glove box.
   This worker was treated extensively with a chelation drug, DTPA, for
   over 4 y after exposure. The estimated Am-241 deposition at the time of
   death was 540 kBq, of which 90\% was in the skeleton, 5.1\% in the
   liver, and 3.5\% in muscle and fat. Among the soft tissues, the highest
   concentrations were observed in liver (22 Bq g(-1)), certain
   cartilaginous structures such as the larynx (15 Bq g(-1)) and the red
   marrow (9.7 Bq g(-1)), as compared with the mean soft tissue
   concentration of approximately 1 Bq g(-1). Concentration in muscle was
   approximately that of the soft tissue average, while concentrations in
   the pancreas, a hilar lymph node and fat were less than the average.
   Concentrations in bone ash were inversely related to the ratio of ash
   weight to wet weight, a surrogate for bone volume-to-surface ratio. The
   distribution of activity in this case is reasonably consistent with that
   observed in another human case, when allowance is made for chelation
   therapy, and also tends to support more recent models of Am-241
   metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS: Goodman, Price,
   Rasmussen, Mature, Fleischman, Hill, Heninger and Charney, 1989a, b,
   Archives of General Psychiatry, 46, 1006-1016), a widely used measure of
   obsessions and compulsions, is typically used by summing the items to
   yield a global measure of symptom severity. However obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD) is characterized by two distinct groups of symptoms (i.e.
   obsessions and compulsions), and so it was hypothesized that OCD, as
   assessed by the Y-BOCS, may be two dimensional. In other words, the
   items assessing obsessions may be factorially distinct from the items
   assessing compulsions. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
   conducted using responses from 83 OCD patients to determine whether OCD
   as assessed with the Y-BOCS is unidimensional or forms two distinct
   dimensions. Results supported a two-factor solution, and suggest that
   items assessing obsessions should be scored as one subscale, and items
   assessing compulsions scored as a separate subscale. Depression, as
   assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, (Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock
   and Erbsugh, 1961, Archives of General Psychiatry, 4, 561-571), was
   correlated with both subscales. Trait anxiety, as assessed by the
   State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Speilberger, 1983, Manual for the
   Slate-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y). Palo-Alto, CA: Consulting
   Psychologists Press), was correlated with the obsessions subscale but
   not with the compulsions subscale.}},

Abstract = {{Damselfishes are an important element of the fauna of coral reefs. This
   study describes spatial patterns in the distribution of 15 species of
   damselfishes at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The
   aim of the work was to identify the spatial scales at which major
   changes in the composition and abundance of the fauna occurred. These
   patterns were then compared with previous studies in an attempt to
   determine if distributions followed general patterns at a range of
   localities. The assemblage found at Lizard Island was similar to that of
   reefs in the central GBR. The most important changes in the composition
   of the fauna occurred among reef zones. Shallow zones (the reef flat and
   crest) were dominated by herbivorous species while planktivorous and
   omnivorous species were most abundant in deeper zones (the reef slope).
   Densities of herbivorous damselfishes in shallow reef zones at Lizard
   Island averaged 45.5 individuals per 80 m(2), a value comparable to
   densities found in similar zones on reefs in the central and southern
   GBR and at one locality in the Caribbean. Comparisons of relative
   distributions suggested that abundant species tend to be widely
   distributed among zones and habitats, while rare species have restricted
   distributions at Lizard Island. However, computer simulation of the
   sampling program suggested that the ability of our study to describe the
   distribution patterns of rare species was limited, despite intensive
   sampling. Correlations between breadth of distribution and abundance may
   have occurred simply because rare species were less likely to be
   recorded within a transect. Our results suggest that it will be
   difficult to compare the distribution patterns of species among studies.
   Furthermore, the interpretation of relative patterns of distribution at
   a single locality in terms of ecological specialization or partitioning
   may first require an assessment of the ability of the sampling program
   to accurately record spatial patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmacodynamic variables of enrofloxacin were investigated in a
   neutropenic mouse Escherichia coli and staphylococcal thigh infection
   model. Enrofloxacin pharmacokinetics in clinically normal mice and dogs
   were compared to confirm that doses evaluated in the mouse model would
   include enrofloxacin doses appropriate for use in dogs. Mice were made
   neutropenic by treatment with cyclophosphamide and injected in the thigh
   muscle with approximately 10(6) colony-forming units of E coli (n = 2)
   or a staphylococcal (n = 2) clinical isolate. Enrofloxacin dosages
   tested ranged from 0.78 to 50 mg/kg of body weight and 6.25 to 200 mg/kg
   in the E coli and staphylococcal infection trials, respectively. In each
   24-hour dosage trial, enrofloxacin was administered SC as a single dose
   or in divided doses given every 3, 6, or 12 hours. Comparison of log(10)
   colony-forming units per thigh muscle in untreated control mice and mice
   treated with enrofloxacin was used as a measure of efficacy. Two-way
   ANOVA was used to determine that the enrofloxacin total dose, but not
   the dose frequency, was significant in determining drug efficacy.
   Pharmacokinetic values analyzed by use of multivariant stepwise linear
   regression analysis indicated that the area under the concentration-time
   curve, but not time above minimum inhibitory concentration, was
   significant in predicting efficacy of enrofloxacin treatment. We
   conclude that enrofloxacin killing of E coli and staphylococci is
   concentration dependent and not time dependent.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, growing efforts to control violence against women

   new possibilities for protecting women from male violence. It offers new
   gender identities to both women and men. Battered women are offered
   legally endowed selves while men encounter the criminalization of
   violent behavior viewed as `'natural'' to men. By endowing women with
   autonomous selves who can chose to stay or leave a violent man, but by
   failing to provide the economic means to leave such men, the discourse
   of the courts reconstructs women who fail to leave as undeserving of
   help. The study focuses on a violence control program in a small town in
   Hawaii during a period of rapid social and economic change which has
   opened a space for new legal initiatives against domestic violence.}},

Abstract = {{Concomitant resistance is a tumor growth dynamic which results when the
   growth of a second tumor implant is inhibited by the presence of the
   first. Recently, we modeled tumor growth in the presence of a
   regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (Michelson and Leith, Bull.
   Math. Biol. 57, 345-366, 1995), with an interlocking pair of growth
   control triads to account for the accelerated growth observed in both
   tissues. We also modeled tumor dormancy and recurrence as a dynamic
   equilibrium achieved between proliferating and quiescent subpopulations.
   In this paper those studies are extended to initially model the
   concomitant resistance case.
   Two interlocking model systems are proposed. In one an interactive
   competition between the tumor implants is described, while in the other
   purely proportional growth inhibition is described. The equilibria and
   dynamics of each system when the coefficients are held constant are
   presented for three subcases of model parameters.
   We show that the dynamic called concomitant resistance can be real or
   apparent, and that if the model coefficients are held constant, the only
   way to truly achieve concomitant resistance is by forcing one of the
   tumors into total quiescence. If this is the true state of the inhibited
   implant, then a non-constant recruitment signal is required to insure
   regrowth when the inhibitor mass is excised. We compare these
   theoretical results to a potential explanation of the phenomenon
   provided by Prehn (Cancer Res. 53, 3266-3269, 1993).}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed images derived from several sources were combined with
   in situ samples to estimate suspended sediments discharged from three
   rivers into Mayaguez Bay, Puerto Rico. Multispectral data were acquired
   using the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS) and the
   Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). CAMS data were used to produce spatial
   maps of suspended sediment concentrations in Mayaguez Bay during low to
   moderate discharge for 1990-1992. Images of band cover/land use during
   1975 and 1985 were generated from a supervised density slicing technique
   applied to a mosaicked image of digitized aerial photos and from an
   unsupervised classification of the TM image. A geomorphic hydrologic
   model was used to simulate runoff and sediment yield from the drainage
   basin of the Guanajibo river; because land cover within the basin did
   not change significantly during 1975-1985, the hydrologic model provided
   estimates of sediment discharged by the Guanajibo river into the bay
   during this time period. Growth rates of the coral Montastrea annularis
   of Rodiguez reef were obtained from a previous study. Annual growth
   rates as determined from coral banding decreased significantly (r =
   0.69) with increased sediment loading to the bay (tons/year). Evidence
   from remote sensing and hydrologic modeling suggests that sediment
   reaches the reef only during episodic, high-discharge events. During low
   to moderate discharge, sediments, both suspended within the river plume
   and resuspended sediments, are restricted to the near-shore regions by
   the prevailing circulation. Hence, a direct relationship between river
   runoff and coral growth rates was established in this study.}},

   following injury, and in response to changing environmental conditions.
   Functional alterations in signal transduction pathways and in
   neurotransmitter receptor expression are possible mechanisms for the
   expression of such plasticity. In the present report, we demonstrate
   that exposure of astrocytes to specific growth factors alters both the
   functional activity and the protein levels of a specific glutamate
   receptor. Exposure of astrocytes to basic fibroblast growth factor,
   epidermal growth factor, or transforming growth factor-alpha produced
   marked increases in the ability of metabotropic glutamate receptor
   (mGluR) agonists to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Using Western
   immunoblotting, we demonstrate that an increase in the levels of one of
   the phosphoinositide-coupled mGluR subtypes, mGluR5, accompanies the
   increased ability of mGluR agonists to stimulate phosphoinositide
   hydrolysis. In contrast, another phosphoinositide-coupled subtype of
   this receptor family, mGluR1 alpha, was not present at detectable levels
   in these cultures. The enhanced stimulation of phosphoinositide
   hydrolysis showed little sensitivity to pertussis toxin, and appeared to
   be selective to mGluR agonists, as there was not a similar increase in
   the ability of norepinephrine or carbachol to stimulate phosphoinositide
   hydrolysis. These findings demonstrate that expression of mGluRs in
   astrocytes is plastic, and indicate a novel pathway through which
   specific growth factors may selectively modulate neurotransmitter
   action.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, it is argued that perfective aspect in Serbo-Croatian
   is licensed in the syntax. Licensing of Aspect requires the presence of
   a hierarchically higher category. In compound tenses, perfective aspect
   is licensed by a governing auxiliary in Infl while, in the present tense
   forms, it may only be licensed by an overt complementizer in Comp. A
   Comp-Aspect Agreement mechanism is proposed based on the requirement for
   licensing in the present tense forms. This agreement also obtains
   between a covert complementizer and perfective aspect in imperative
   constructions (perfective imperatives move to an empty Comp position to
   satisfy the Aspect licensing requirement) and between an overt
   complementizer and the auxiliaries in compound tenses (auxiliaries move
   to an empty Comp to satisfy the Tense licensing requirement). Although
   Tense may be licensed by any governor in root sentences, the presence of
   an overt complementizer, which is a hierarchically higher category,
   takes precedence for licensing in embedded sentences.}},

Abstract = {{Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) have been introduced as lipid
   substrates in parenteral nutrition because of their rapid and complete
   oxidation. Although there are many clinical studies on the use of MCTs
   in parenteral nutrition there are only a few studies on their kinetics;
   most of these studies used indirect methods (such as light scattering)
   to determine MCT concentrations in plasma. We determined the hydrolysis
   rate of MCTs to medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and the disposition
   rate of MCFAs in nine healthy volunteers who received an intravenous
   bolus of MCTs as 10\% MCT + 10\% long-chain triglyceride solution. MCTs
   and MCFAs were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. One linear
   compartment model was used and its parameters were numerically
   estimated. The first-order transformation constant of the hydrolysis
   step from MCT to MCFA was 0.0964 +/- 0.0152 min(-1) (for 8- and
   10-carbon pooled together); the rate constant for tissue MCFA uptake
   from plasma was 0.0725 +/- 0.0230 min(-1). The apparent volumes of
   distribution were about 4.5 L for MCT and 19 L for MCFA in a typical
   70-kg subject. The plasma half-life of MCT was 11 min and that of MCFA
   was 17 min. The limiting step in the clinical use of MCTs seems to be
   tissue uptake of MCFAs.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to show that unintentional preconditioning can be
   induced in the isolated perfused heart during the preparation procedure.
   The following four groups were compared: hearts were placed in ice cold
   saline and cooled for 5s and then mounted to the Langendorff apparatus
   (n = 5; cool immediate group); hearts were cooled for 60 s and mounted
   (n = 5; cool delay group); hearts were mounted directly to the apparatus
   within 15 s after the isolation without cooling (n = 5; non cool
   immediate group); hearts were mounted without cooling, but the mounting
   was delayed for 60 s after the isolation (n = 5; noncool delay group).
   All hearts were paced at a fixed rate of 300 bpm, and an occlusion of
   left coronary (LCA) for 60 min was performed, which was followed by
   reperfusion for another 60 min. Coronary flow (CBF)? left ventricular
   developed pressure (LVDP), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release did
   not change among the four groups during ischemia. At the end of
   reperfusion the LVDP values were 70 +/- 1\%, 66 +/- 2\%, 62 +/- 3\%, and
   73 +/- 2\% of preischemic values in cool immediate, cool delay, noncool
   immediate and noncool delay groups, respectively. CPK values were 116
   +/- 4, 121 +/- 7, 138 +/- 6, and 29 +/- 1 x 10(3) U/g myocardium, and
   percentage necrosis/risk areas were 24 +/- 1.0\%, 21 +/- 1.7\%, 38 +/-
   2.6\%, and 13 +/- 0.5\% in cool immediate, cool delay, noncool
   immediate, and noncool delay groups, respectively. The noncool delay
   group demonstrated high LVDP, least amount of CPK release, and smallest
   size of necrosis. These results indicate that an unintentional
   preconditioning effect can be induced when the cooling procedure is not
   applied and perfusion is delayed.}},

   indicates that both interest rates and inflation contain unit roots.
   Furthermore, there are indications that the variables have non-standard

   the correct small sample distributions of test statistics we make use of
   Monte Carlo simulations. These tests indicate that while a long-run
   Fisher effect seems to exist, there is no evidence of a short-run Fisher
   effect. This suggests that, while short-run changes in interest rates
   reflect changes in monetary policy, longer run levels indicate
   inflationary expectations. Thus, the longer run level of interest rates
   should not be used to characterize the stance of monetary policy.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen and carbon stable-isotope profiles and intracrystalline amino
   acid profiles (free and total) were determined for the New Zealand giant
   Pliocene oyster Crassostrea ingens by sampling annual growth increments
   along a sagittal section. These profiles reflect both ontogenetic and
   environmental change over the life-time of the oyster (approximately 20
   years). There is a gradual increase in delta(18)O from the umbo towards
   the shell margin and a subsequent levelling-off about halfway along the
   shell. This pattern probably reflects a decrease in the growth rate of
   the oyster rather than a temperature effect. The delta(13)C profile
   initially increases sharply at the umbo and then gradually decreases
   towards the shell margin. This maybe due to kinetic or metabolic effects
   associated with the development of a fast-growing juvenile into a
   slower-growing, sexually mature adult, or it may be due to the influence
   of C-13-depleted carbon derived from the oxidation of organic matter in
   the surrounding sediment. The amino acid profile reveals a gradual
   decrease in abundance from the umbo to the shell margin, indicative of a
   progressive increase in the relative amounts of inorganic carbonate to
   protein over the life of the oyster, that may also be a consequence of
   decreasing growth rate. Glycine and alanine are the two most common
   amino acids in both the free and total amino acid profiles: free (i.e.
   naturally hydrolysed) amino acids account for about three quarters of
   the total amino acids present.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of low production of seeds capable of producing

   A tubular floret produced abundant pollen; however, the pollen flow to
   ray stigmas was limited due to the infrequent visitation by pollinators.
   Moreover, in the double-flowered capitula, newly opened ray petals
   overlapped on the pistils that unfolded the previous day. These
   phenomena were considered to cause low seed set in double-flowered
   plants. Actually, capitula with more tubular florets produced more seeds
   than those with fewer tubular florets. Pollen germination and plants
   near zinnias had additional possible influences on seed production of

   survival by eliminating the effects of age, Pa-O2 Pa-CO2 \%VC, and
   FEV(1)/FVC. The mean survival periods of the women who died during
   follow-up periods were also significantly longer than those of men (0.41
   yr in COPD, 1.84 yr in TBsq, and 0.78 yr in IP). From these findings, we
   conclude women have a better prognosis than men when they start
   receiving LTOT, regardless of the cause of respiratory failure.}},

Title = {{INDUCTION OF LONG-LASTING POTENTIATION IN THE SECONDARY SOMATOSENSORY
   CORTEX BY THALAMIC-STIMULATION REQUIRES CORTICOCORTICAL PATHWAYS FROM

Abstract = {{We have investigated the role of cortico-cortical inputs from the
   primary somatosensory cortex in the induction of long-lasting
   potentiation in the secondary somatosensory cortex. Long-lasting
   potentiation of evoked potentials in the feline secondary somatosensory
   cortex is induced by high frequency stimulation of the ventral
   posterolateral thalamic nucleus. The secondary somatosensory cortex
   receives two projections from the ventral posterolateral thalamic
   nucleus; a direct pathway from the ventral posterolateral thalamic
   nucleus and a cortico-cortical pathway via the primary somatosensory
   cortex. The present study was designed to examine dominance of these
   pathways in the induction of long-lasting potentiation in the secondary
   somatosensory cortex. Long-lasting potentiation was evaluated by changes
   in the amplitude of field potentials and current source densities
   elicited by ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus test stimulation
   (0.1 Hz) following conditioning stimulation. The con ditioning
   stimulation, consisting of 20 trains of 200 Hz bursts, was delivered to
   the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus or the primary somatosensory
   cortex. Field potentials in the secondary somatosensory cortex were
   simultaneously recorded at 16 points placed vertically at 150 mu m
   intervals from the cortical surface and current source density was
   computed using these field potentials. First, we blocked inputs from the
   primary somatosensory cortex to the secondary somatosensory cortex by
   intracortical injection of lidocaine into the primary somatosensory
   cortex. The amplitudes of the field potentials recorded in the secondary
   somatosensory cortex diminished within 5 min after lidocaine injection.
   Current source density analysis showed a marked decrease in the sink
   currents in layers II/III (at depths of 450-600 mu m). In this
   condition, high frequency stimulation of the ventral posterolateral
   thalamic nucleus produced no potentiation in evoked potentials. After
   the amplitudes of field potentials had recovered to the control value
   (300 min after lidocaine injection), long-lasting potentiation was
   induced by a second high frequency stimulation under the same conditions
   in the same animal and sink currents in layers II/III were remarkably
   increased. High frequency stimulation delivered directly to the primary
   somatosensory cortex induced long-lasting potentiation in the secondary
   somatosensory cortex in the same manner as that delivered to the ventral
   posterolateral thalamic nucleus. This long lasting potentiation was also
   associated with an increase in sink currents in layers II/III.
   Our results showed that the input from the primary somatosensory cortex
   was required for inducing the long-lasting potentiation in the secondary
   somatosensory cortex by thalamic stimulation. They thus imply that
   corticocortical inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex play a role
   in cortical plasticity in the feline secondary somatosensory cortex.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of exotoxin A (EXA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on

   EXA was detected in the plasma of mice infected with P. aeruginosa
   PA103, and its presence correlated with increasing numbers of bacteria
   in the blood and internal organs. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) against
   EXA prevented the death of the mice if it was given simultaneously with,
   or 2 h before, infection with strain PA103. The number of PMNLs in
   murine blood decreased by 50 \% within 30 min of intravenous injection
   of EXA, but this decrease was prevented by simultaneous or prior
   injection of MAb to the toxin. EXA inhibited in-vitro phagocytosis and
   killing of P. aeruginosa by human and murine PMNLs and decreased the
   number of the PMNLs by between 60 and 68 \%. Collectively, these results
   not only confirm that EXA is toxic in vivo, but also suggest that this
   toxin accelerates the growth of virulent P. aeruginosa in mice.}},

Abstract = {{An ICP-MS instrument with a quadrupole filter is hampered by its limited
   resolution, in particular polyatomic ions are a major source of
   interference, With a double focusing magnetic sector mass analyser,
   operated at high resolution, most of these interferences are eliminated,
   In addition, these mass analysers are characterized by a low
   instrumental background, yielding superior detection limits at low
   resolution. In this work a new type of double focusing ICP-MS
   instrument, the `Element' from Finnigan MAT (Bremen, Germany), was
   tested, The instrument can be used with low resolution (m/Delta m=300,
   10\% valley definition) and at high resolution settings (3000 and 7500),
   At low resolution, a linear response versus mass curve was observed
   {[}response of 180 x 10(6) counts s(-1) per pg ml(-1) (ppm) for U and 6
   x 10(6) counts s(-1) for Ee]. The sensitivity decreases by roughly a
   factor of 14 when going from resolution 300 to resolution 3000 and by a
   factor of 10 from 3000 to 7500, An instrumental detection limit at low
   resolution of about 8 fg ml(-1) (8 ppq) was measured at m/z 240, The
   detection limit for most elements is not determined by the instrument
   but by the blank level and laboratory procedures will need to be
   improved in order to make optimal use of the detection power of the
   instrument, The stability and the relative abundance of oxide and doubly
   charged ions are comparable to the values found in quadrupole ICP-MS,
   Matrix effects were compared for measurements with the `Element' and
   with a Perkin-Elmer Elan 5000 quadrupole instrument of In-115 in the
   presence of 500 mu g ml(-1) of Cs and of 2.5\% of ethanol. Though in the
   `Element' ions are accelerated over 8 kV immediately after the skimmer,
   matrix effects were found to be similar to those observed for the `Elan
   5000', The instrument was used to determine Pt in an environmental
   material (grass).}},

   Intracellular recordings were made 2, 4 and 6 hr after ethanol

   membrane potentials were standardized to -60 mV by using constant
   current injection. The fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials were
   isolated by adding DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, bicuculline and
   nitrendipine to the bathing solution and injecting QX-314 into the
   recording cell; stimulation then evoked a monophasic depolarization with
   a maximum of 16.3 mV at about 30 msec after stimulation, which was
   inhibited by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinozaline-2,3-dione. At 4 and 6 hr after
   withdrawal, but not at 2 hr, the estimated fast excitatory postsynaptic
   potential conductance in slices from ethanol-treated mice was
   significantly larger than in those from control animals. There were no
   changes in stimulus/response relation or voltage-dependency of the
   depolarization. In the presence of these blocking agents, the thresholds
   for elicitation of field potentials was decreased at 6 hr from

   adding DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid,
   6-cyano-7-nitroquinozaline-2,3-dione and bicuculline to the bathing
   solution; stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers then evoked a
   monophasic hyperpolarization with a maximum of 5.7 mV at about 180 msec
   after stimulation, which was inhibited by the gamma-aminobutyric acid(B)
   antagonist saclofen. At the three time points, the stimulus/response
   relation, voltage dependency of the hyperpolarization and estimated slow
   inhibitory postsynaptic conductance in ethanol-treated mice did not
   differ from control animals. These results suggest that increased fast
   excitatory transmission may make a substantial contribution to the
   increased hippocampal hyperexcitability seen during ethanol withdrawal.}},

   morphogenesis. Trehalase, which is secreted into the cell envelope
   during starvation and bud-formation, displayed similar extraction
   kinetics in starved, germ tube-forming, and bud-forming cells,
   indicating that the mother cell wall remains largely unchanged during

   is similar. N-acetylglucosaminidase, which is secreted specifically
   during morphogenesis, was released eightfold more rapidly from germ
   tube-forming than bud-forming cells, reflecting major differences in
   porosity between bud and germ tube. In addition, by assaying DTT

   transwell system. Endothelial cells, as well as smooth muscle cells (in
   the bottom of the chamber), were stimulated with IL-1 beta. Then
   transendothelial lymphocyte migration was determined in the presence of
   CS1 and RGD (fibronectin) peptides, blocking alpha(4) beta(1) and
   alpha(5) beta(1) integrin receptors on lymphocyte surfaces,
   respectively. A 55-70\% inhibition of lymphocyte migration was observed
   when compared to control peptides. The combination of CS1 and RGD
   peptides did not significantly enhance the inhibitory effect of either
   peptide alone. A similar decrease in lymphocyte transendothelial
   migration toward smooth muscle cells was documented using a monoclonal
   antibody to cellular fibronectin. Furthermore, using smooth muscle cell
   conditioned medium, we reproduced the enhanced transendothelial
   lymphocyte migration as well as the inhibition with blocking peptides or
   fibronectin antibodies. Our data suggest that cytokine-mediated
   fibronectin synthesis in vascular cells recruits inflammatory cells
   through interactions of specific peptides with cell surface alpha(4)
   beta(1) and alpha(5) beta(1) integrins. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   A comparison was made between samples treated with
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium citrate (alone or with 1\%
   glucose), and sent to the laboratory packed in ice. In general, the
   number of samples yielding positive results by the MH technique showed
   the least variation during the first 24-36 h after sample collection.
   Survival varied with the anticoagulant used, but it declines rapidly
   from 48 h after collection, although live parasites were still observed
   in lip to 10\% of samples until the seventh day. On the basis of the
   results obtained the authors recommend the nse of sodium citrate in
   treating equine blood samples for the parasitological diagnosis of T.

Abstract = {{In the last decade, nuclear microanalytical methods have been developed
   in order to study the distribution of elements of specific interest in
   natural glasses involving melt (or glass) inclusions trapped in minerals
   of magmatic origin. The study of these small objects represent a very
   original application of the microbeam techniques in general. With the
   nuclear microprobe, we have focused our research in two main directions:
   (1) the determination of light elements by nuclear reaction analysis (C,
   N, F, Li, B) and elastic recoil detection analysis in transmission mode
   (H), contributing to the knowledge of the magmatic thermodynamic
   conditions (pressure, temperature, gas solubility), to the
   quantification of volatile budget and to the volcanoes atmospheric
   contribution; (2) the determination of trace elements as geochemical
   markers with PIXE, contributing to the knowledge of magmatic processes.
   In this paper, after a brief review of the methods developed for light
   elements and their application in volcanology, we present with more
   details simultaneous use of microPIXE-microPIGE to characterize
   strontium and fluorine in melt inclusions. The experiments were carried
   out both with the Bruyeres Le Chatel nuclear microprobe (of first
   generation) and with the new nuclear microprobe of the Pierre Sue

Abstract = {{Ceramic-matrix-composites (CMCs) are fast replacing other materials in
   many applications where the higher production costs can be offset by
   significant improvement in performance. However, due to their lack of
   toughness they are prone to catastrophic failures. Hence, the important
   consideration in the design of CMCs is to achieve satisfactory
   toughening. Recent experimental studies of whisker-reinforced ceramics
   have shown that substantial improvements in fracture toughness can be
   achieved via the mechanisms of whisker bridging, whisker pull-out and
   crack deflection. This paper demonstrates the use of finite element
   method to model the whisker/matrix interface through isoparametric
   interface elements. A micro mechanical finite element model which uses
   isoparametricformulation has been presented. The micro mechanical finite
   element model is then validated by characterising the non-linear
   force-displacement response of alpha-SiC ceramic whisker embedded in
   Al2O3 ceramic matrix and comparing it with the simplified analytical

Abstract = {{The serum glycoprotein alpha(2)-macroglobulin can be converted into a
   potent macrophage-activating factor that promotes the Fc gamma
   receptor-mediated phagocytosis of macrophages, through modification of
   the sugar moiety with liposome-treated B-cell glycosidase(s). This pager
   discusses the activation mechanism of B-cell membranous glycosidase by
   liposomes using mouse splenic B cells. B-cell membranous
   beta-galactosidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase were significantly
   activated by liposome treatment: and this process can be regulated by
   trypsin-sensitive protein. To clarify the contribution of
   trypsin-sensitive protein to enzyme activities, the B-cell surface
   antigen receptor was studied. With the addition of a Fab' fragment of
   anti-mouse IgM but not IgD antibody, the activation of both glycosidases
   induced by liposomes was significantly inhibited and was essentially the
   same as that of saline-treated glycosidase activities. Consequently,
   interactions of liposomes with cell-surface IgM may cause B-cell
   membranous glycosidase activation. A significant decrease in membrane
   fluidity, particularly near the membrane surface rather than deep within
   the membrane, was observed in liposome-treated B cells using electron
   spin resonance. Liposomes would thus appear to interact with B cells via
   cell-surface IgM, with a consequent decrease in membrane fluidity, as
   well as the activation of B-cell membranous glycosidases, causing
   alpha(2)-macroglobulin to be converted into a macrophage activating
   factor.}},

   suitable error estimates we apply Monte Carlo techniques which are also
   used to deal with incompleteness effects in the data. In agreement with
   other authors our results indicate a relative lack of low luminosity
   ellipticals compared to other morphological types. The best fitting

Abstract = {{We have characterized the factor V protein and cDNA of a patient
   displaying factor V deficiency (parahemophilia) and correlated the
   reduced activity with a missense mutation of Ala(221)-to-Val, Plasma
   from the subject individual (C1) presented reduced factor V antigen
   (39\% of normal) that displayed reduced activity (approximately 26\% of
   normal). Factor V purified from this individual by standard techniques
   shows normal migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and a normal
   pattern of activation by thrombin. Purified antigen from sibling C2
   gives a much reduced specific activity of 263 U/mg (17\% of normal).
   Sibling C3, the mother, and the father have antigen within the normal
   range (57\% to 200\%) that has approximately normal specific activity.
   The cDNA encoding the factor Va heavy and light chains of the subject
   individual was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and sequenced and
   revealed an A-to-G substitution at position 3 of codon 51 (silent
   mutation), a C-to-T substitution in position 2 of codon 221
   (Ala(221)-Val), a T-to-C substitution at position 3 of codon 708 (silent
   mutation), and a G-to-A substitution at position 1 of codon 2185
   (Thr(2185)-Ala). The latter mutation was also observed in control
   individuals and is proposed to be a possible polymorphism. Restriction
   analyses demonstrated the presence of one mutant and one normal allele
   in the father, The subject individual (C1) and sibling C2 carry only the
   mutant allele. The mother and sibling C3 carry only the normal allele,
   The inheritance pattern suggests the presence of a missing or
   nonexpressed allele in the mother that is passed on to all the siblings.
   Expression of only the mutant allele by the subject individual (C1) and
   sibling C2 is consistent with reduced factor V antigen and activity in
   these patients. We have designated this mutant as Factor V-New
   (Brunswick). (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

   xenon-X xenon-H, xenon-L, xenon-S, xenon-U, SUCOR (surface correlated
   xenon), BEOC (Bern Oberflachen-Correliert) xenon, and so on. It is often
   assumed that they represent the isotopic compositions of more or less
   `pure' or `primordial' components of xenon. If one attempts to interpret
   the existing xenon isotope data for meteorites and lunar samples,
   assuming that they are `pure' or `primordial', however, one encounters
   all sorts of problems and no coherent theory concerning the variation of
   the isotopic composition of xenon in the solar system emerges. We have
   therefore re-examined over 4,000 sets of existing xenon isotope data for
   meteorites and lunar samples. The results indicate that these strange
   xenon components are mixtures of Pu-244 fission xenon and atmospheric
   xenon, whose isotopic compositions have been altered by the processes of
   a) mass-fractionation, b) spallation and c) neutron-capture reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Responses to autobiographical questions are known to represent more than
   simply retrieval of information from memory; inference, cuing, and
   `'availability'' all play a role. Using responses to items in four
   different surveys, we find that respondent motivation and ability,
   together with contextual cues, help determine how survey respondents
   answer knowledge questions about the world around us. Thus, we extend
   the domain of factual items for which the role of inferential processes
   is recognized, and we specify more precisely the kinds of factors that
   respondents use in answering such questions. We also find suggestive
   evidence that attitudes influence answers to information questions, thus
   extending as well the kinds of factors seen as likely to affect reports
   about facts.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the capability of the
   Periotest(R) device in detecting and monitoring functional changes in
   the periodontal as well as in the peri-implant damping characteristics.
   In the first part of this study, 107 teeth were splinted by means of 40
   full acrylic fixed prostheses (AFP) and another 37 teeth were splinted
   by means of 14 ceramometallic fixed prostheses (C-MFP). The Periotest(R)
   measurements of individual teeth were done the day the fixed prostheses
   were cemented temporary (PTV 1), and again after a mean observation
   period of 27.4 days (PTV 2). In the 2nd part, 78 osseointegrated
   two-stage implants were splinted by means of 23 full acrylic fixed
   prosthesis (AFP) and other 18 implants were left without it. Using the
   same abutment length, Periotest(R) measurements were performed, at
   abutment connections and before installation of the final prosthesis. In
   a 3rd part, using both implants and teeth as abutments, 29
   osseointegrated implants were connected with 25 abutment teeth by means
   of 7 AFP. The measurements were performed at the beginning of the
   prosthetic treatment and 2, 4 and 6 weeks later. After splinting teeth
   by means of AFP for the observation period, no statistically significant
   reduction in PTVs was found. When on the other hand, a C-MFP was used,
   PTV 2 showed a significant reduction. The PTVs at abutment connection
   went down after a period of time, during which some implants were
   interconnected by means of an AFP and others were not. Although this
   difference was not significant, it was more notable in the implants that
   received a AFP. In this study, the establishment of a connection between
   teeth and implants, did not induce any significant change in the damping
   characteristics of the periodontal tissues detectable by the
   Periotext(R) even after a period of 6 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of captopril on the activity of matrix

   invasiveness in vitro. On gelatin zymography, captopril inhibited
   gelatinolytic activities in the culture media of T98G cells. This
   inhibitory effect was reversed by the presence of excess zinc. In an in
   vitro invasion assay, invasion into the reconstituted basement
   membrane(Matrigel) by T98G glioma cells was inhibited by captopril in a
   dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was also reversed by the
   addition of zinc to the culture media. However, at the effective
   concentration of captopril for the prevention of tumor cell invasion it
   did not inhibit the motility, adhesion to Matrigel or proliferation of
   T98G cells. These findings suggest that captopril inhibits the
   invasiveness of T98G glioma cells due to its MMP inhibitory activity,
   chelating zinc ions at the active center of MMPs.}},

Abstract = {{Carbendazim (methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate; MBC) has been reported to
   disrupt the microtubules of Sertoli cells in the rat, suggesting that
   the cells exposed to carbendazim would fail to maintain their shape due
   to the loss of their cytoskeleton. The present study was performed to
   determine whether exposure to carbendazim induced Sertoli cell
   deformation. For this purpose, changes in the shape and position of
   Sertoli cell nuclei, that appear to be associated with changes in the
   shape of the cells themselves, were observed in stage VI-VII
   seminiferous tubules of rat testis at 3 hours following treatment. Light
   microscopy and computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction were also
   performed to survey the outline of the body. In the controls,
   parallel-positioned nuclei (nuclei with their longer axis parallel to
   the basement membrane), perpendicular-positioned nuclei (nuclei with
   their longer axis perpendicular showing a round or regular triangular
   profile) accounted for approximately 52\%, 35\%, and 13\% of the total,
   respectively. In Sertoli cells showing carbendazim-induced sloughing of
   germ cells, however, parallel-positioned nuclei accounted for 21\% and
   the round-shaped nuclei for 51\% of the total. Approximately 69\% of
   perpendicular-positioned nuclei were located in the basal part of the
   cells in the controls, compared with 95\% in tubules showing
   carbendazim-induced sloughing. These changes in individual parameters
   were significantly different (alpha < 0.05). Light microscopy and
   computer-aided reconstruction indicated that the body region of Sertoli
   cells in the control testis was columnar in shape, whereas that of
   Sertoli cells that showed sloughing was conical. These findings suggest
   that Sertoli cell cytoplasm, following carbendazim-induced sloughing,
   moves toward the base of the cellular axis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a laboratory investigation into the adoption of the

   Laboratory-prepared concrete cores (75 mm diameter, 175 mm long) were

   stress-strain response at low stress level was determined. The area of
   hysteresis of the lend-unload loops and other characteristics of the
   response such as the degree of concavity, the loading chord modulus, the
   unloading modulus and the residual plastic strain provide a quantitative
   measure of the extent of structural damage caused by thermal exposure.
   Fire-damaged specimens were also monitored by measuring the ultrasonic
   pulse velocity. The microstructure of the damaged specimens was studied
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and II-ray diffraction. 320
   degrees C marked the onset of significant modification in the
   characteristics of the stress-strain response loops, with a sudden
   increase in the damage index (area of hysteresis loops). The ultrasonic
   pulse velocity in the fired concrete showed similar variation with
   temperature to that of the elastic properties. At temperatures higher
   than 320 degrees C, SEM photographs showed significant cracks in the

Abstract = {{Examination by direct DNA sequence analysis of the X-linked visual
   pigment genes in 27 males with normal color vision reveals that almost
   half have two or more different genes encoding a
   long-wavelength-sensitive cone pigment. This is counter to the
   conventional theory proposed from results of Southern hybridization
   studies that there is a single long-wave pigment gene per X-chromosome,
   Further, the sequences and consideration of the structure of the
   X-linked pigment gene array suggest that the majority of the observers
   (as many as 2/3) have hybrid (or fusion) genes like those that have been
   proposed to underlie color anomaly. In some observers the long-wave
   hybrid genes contain a substantial amount of middle-wave sequence, e.g.
   five observers have hybrid long-wave genes that contain middle-wave
   sequences that include exon 4. Three of those five have the hybrid as
   their only long-wave gene, and thus have no other gene that could
   potentially encode a long-wave pigment, In these subjects, it is the
   hybrid gene that produces their normal long-wavelength-sensitive cone
   pigment. The high frequency of hybrid genes indicates that they are
   normal variant forms of the long-wave gene. Contrary to what is commonly
   believed, the introduction and the expression of hybrid genes is not
   sufficient to cause color vision defects.}},

Abstract = {{In a random block field experiment, life-history traits associated with
   colonizing ability of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes of Capsella
   (Brassicaceae) were compared. These were germination, flowering,
   growth-form parameters, and leaf shape. Data are not in favour of
   differences in germination behaviour between the diploid and tetraploid
   Capsella species, as germination rate and capacity are highly influenced
   by inception and release of seed dormancy. Although our data at first
   glance seem to suggest that diploid C. rubella start flowering later
   than tetraploid C, bursa-pastor's, considerable ecotypic variation for
   flowering in both species makes it difficult to assign an effect
   specifically to ploidy level. We also conclude that plant height,
   rosette diameter, and branching number are not directly determined by
   ploidy level. In contrast however, leaf shape is clearly determined by
   ploidy level. In the light of all available data including data of
   previous experiments, we suggest that gene duplication by
   polyploidization may have been a key element that provided C,
   bursa-pastoris with additional genetic flexibility. It is not primarily
   the gain of colonization ability, as both species are weeds and
   colonizers. Rather, the greater genetic flexibility enabled C,
   bursa-pastoris to extend its range beyond that of C. rubella.}},

Abstract = {{Reductions in rates of cell and tissue growth are a commonly observed
   response to water deficits resulting from drought or soil salinity.
   These can lead to reductions in plant size and yields. More severe
   stress can lead to accelerated death and complete loss of yields. This
   review deals with the final biophysical links in the chain of events
   underlying inhibition of growth in crop plants exposed to water
   deficits. It first examines and rejects the notion that a stress-induced
   reduction in cellular turgor pressure is necessarily a primary cause of
   growth inhibition, Data supporting the involvement of an additional and
   often overlooked biophysical response to water deficits are then
   reviewed: This response involves changes in tissue extension capacity,
   as a result of hardening (or softening) of expanding cell walls, and is
   termed cell wall adjustment. Wall hardening should increase the capacity
   of expanding cells to maintain turgor pressure but also acts to inhibit
   rates of cell expansion growth. The inhibition of cell expansion can
   lead to reductions in leaf area that limit rates of transpirational toss
   of soil water reserves; in nonirrigated crops exposed to terminal
   drought environments, this adaptation may prolong survival and allow
   time for completion of reproductive development. Conversely, wall
   hardening responses to intermittent water deficit episodes, e.g., in
   irrigated crops, could be undesirable. The survival of irrigated crops
   is largely assured and induction of wall hardening in the intervals
   between irrigation could unnecessarily reduce growth and yields.
   Appropriate manipulation of cell wall adjustments, via selection,
   breeding, or genetic engineering, could prove useful for the development
   of more stress-resistant crop plants suited to irrigated or nonirrigated
   environments.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{421-424}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Regional variations in the incidence of
   cr-thalassaemia have been reported from Saudi Arabia. In a recent study,
   we observed that approximately 6-7\% of the Saudi Arabian National Guard
   (SANG) newborn population had very low mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
   (less than or equal to 100 fl) at birth. The main objective of this
   study was to determine if the low MCV detected at birth could be of
   relevance in the detection of ol-thalassaemia at birth.
   Materials and Methods: All the cord blood was subjected to haemoglobin
   (Hb) electrophoresis and levels of Hb Bart's were estimated by CM-52
   microcolumn chromatography. DNA analyses were performed on 31 (15 male;
   16 female) randomly selected newborns with low MCV (less than or equal
   to 100 fl) and 46 neonates (24 male; 22 female) with normal MCV (>100
   fl).
   Results: The restriction analyses data showed that 28 of 31 (90\%) with
   low MCV (less than or equal to 100 fl) compared with 3 of 46 (7\%) had
   alpha-thalassaemia. Of the above 28 neonates, 17 were heterozygous for
   alpha-thal(2) (-alpha(3.7)/alpha alpha, rightward deletion). Bgl II
   restriction fragment in one newborn with low MCV suggested -alpha(4.2)
   deletion (leftward). The remaining 10 newborns were homozygous for
   alpha-thal(2) gene (-alpha(3.7)/-alpha(3.7)).
   Conclusion: Our results therefore suggest that low MCV (less than or
   equal to 100 fl) together with decreased mean corpuscular haemoglobin
   (MCH) (less than or equal to 32 pg) at birth is a useful diagnostic
   parameter for the detection of alpha-thalassaemia in newborns and it is
   recommended that all Saudi neonates should have a complete blood count
   at birth to alert the physician to the possibility of having
   alpha-thalassaemia and consequently saving the newborns from
   inappropriate therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of empty nuclear positions in syllable structure goes
   back to the early 80s. Since then, empty nuclei have been proposed in
   phonological analyses to account for vocalic epenthesis (vowel/0
   alternation). The analysis of Gen put forth in this article argues for
   empty nuclei although no vowel/0 alternation can be observed in the
   language. Nevertheless, on the basis of the tonal patterns of Gen, it is
   shown that empty positions must be part of the underlying representation
   of syllables in the language. Another aspect of the study deals with
   consonant clusters. Thus far, all analyses supporting empty positions
   within a cluster have also referred to the absence of cooccurrence
   restrictions among the consonants surrounding the empty vowel. This
   paper provides new insights since, in Gen, the consonant clusters in
   which empty nuclei are proposed are typical of those observed in
   branching onset languages (like French, Italian and English) or in
   languages having light diphthongs. We argue that all attested consonant
   clusters in Gen are heterosyllabic.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically transformed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., cv. Zajecarska 83)
   plantlets were obtained by inoculating somatic embryos with
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains A281/pGA472 and LBA4404/pBI121. Single
   somatic embryos, 5-7 mm long, were released from a repetitively
   embryogenic culture, wounded, and cocultivated with the bacteria. The
   agar-solidified culture medium contained mineral salts, vitamins, 40 g
   1(-1) sucrose, 1 g 1(-1) yeast extract and 0.05 mg 1(-1) BA. Five
   clones, transformed with A281/pGA472, and 4 clones transformed with
   LBA4404/pBI121, were selected for proliferation by repetitive somatic
   embryogenesis, on media containing 100 mg 1(-1) of kanamycin. The
   transformation of kanamycin-resistant clones was confirmed by assaying
   the activity of neomycin phosphotransferase II and/or beta-glucuronidase
   enzymes, and by the Southern blot analysis. It is suggested that the
   transformation/regeneration system based on somatic embryogenesis may be
   suitable for establishing transgenic alfalfa Lines. The relatively low
   frequency of embryo transformation is compensated for by abundant
   proliferation in secondary somatic embryogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{For evaluation of thermal shock resistance of ceramics by the quenching
   method, it is important to estimate the thermal stress distribution and
   history in the specimen, Thermal stress under quenching can not be
   measured directly in the experiment, Therefore, the temperature
   distribution generated by quenching was numerically calculated and the
   transient thermal stress distribution was estimated for the ceramic
   disk, The calculated maximum thermal stress and the time required were
   proposed as the correlative equations, respectively, The former equation
   of maximum thermal stress is useful to evaluate the thermal shock
   resistance of ceramics, The fracture time can be estimated by the latter
   equation of the time at the maximum thermal stress, If the experimental
   fracture time agrees with the calculated one, it is considered that the
   fracture occurs only by the thermal stress. Furthermore, these equations
   were compared with those of slab specimens to discuss the differences in
   thermal stress history and distribution. The effects of temperature
   dependence of thermal constants on thermal shock resistance have been
   evaluated, The strain energy accumulated in the disk during the fracture
   process was also calculated by the tensile thermal stress at the
   surface.}},

   16\% for ascarids, 0.9\% for hookworms, 4.0\% for tapeworms, 2.4\% for
   Giardia spp. and 4.2\% for coccidia. The overall mean monthly prevalence
   of canine infections was 5.7\% for ascarids, 9.7\% for hookworms, 9.7\%
   for whipworms. 1.8\% for tapeworms, 4.7\% for Giardia spp. and 3.1\% for
   coccidia, There was a significant downward trend in the prevalence of
   hookworms and heartworms in dogs (P < 0.001 in both cases). There was a
   significant upward trend in the prevalence of tapeworms in cats (P <
   0.05). There were no significant long-term trends in any of the other
   time series. The smoothed data were analyzed for seasonal trends. None
   of the autocorrelation analyses gave incontrovertible evidence of
   seasonality. The repeated peaks at the 6, 12 and 24 month lags in the
   case of ascarid infections were suggestive of a 12 month seasonality
   with a peak prevalence in December, but the results were not
   statistically significant at the 5\% level. Hookworms and whipworms in

Abstract = {{Functional capillary density (FCD) is one of the parameters obtained by
   intravital microscopy using epi-illumination of the tissue surface or
   trans-illumination of thin tissue layers. FCD, defined as the length of
   red cell-perfused capillaries per observation area (cm(-1)), has been
   used as an indicator of the quality of tissue perfusion in various
   animal models. Quantitative analysis of FCD in randomly selected regions
   of the tissue is performed by means of a computer-assisted video
   analysis system which allows calculation of the length of RBC-perfused
   capillaries. Basically, two different mathematical approaches can be
   employed: the first approach is based on the addition of the distances
   between two neighboring points (pixels) on the video screen (Pythagorean
   principle). The second approach uses the superimposition of a grid
   system that allows estimation of the capillary length by counting the
   number of intersections between the capillaries and the grid lines
   (stereological approach), The immanent error has been calculated in our
   laboratory to be +/- 1\% with the Pythagorean and +/- 5\% with the
   stereological method. Beside these systematic errors of computerized
   measurement, the individual (user-dependent) errors occurring during
   recognition and redrawing of the capillaries on the video image with use
   of a digitizing tablet are in the range of +/- 10\% (intraindividual)
   and +/- 70\% (interindividual) for the recognition and +/- 3\%
   (interindividual) for the redrawing procedure, Our studies indicate that
   the errors resulting from the use of a computer-assisted calculation
   (Pythagorean or stereological approach) or the user-assisted redrawing
   of the capillaries are negligible when compared to the errors made
   during recognition of the capillaries on the video screen. The methods
   are applied for assessment of FCD in two different microcirculation
   models of skin muscle and pancreas yielding highly reproducible,
   user-independent results under physiologic conditions and the
   pathophysiologic conditions of ischemia-reperfusion.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between hawthorn psyllids and their main natural
   enemies was studied in Upper Frankonia (Bavaria, Germany) for 4 years.
   Throughout this period, the most abundant psyllid species were
   Cacopsylla melanoneura and C. peregrina (Psyllidae) which passed through
   their larval periods on the hawthorn in spring. Only a few individuals
   of Cacopsylla crataegi were recorded, with a seasonal occurrence of the
   larval instars of this species in the summer months. Psyllid larvae were
   observed to be heavily attached by a multitude of arthropod predators
   and psyllid densities on branches where predators had been excluded were
   significantly higher than on branches with predators present. The
   heteropterans Anthocoris nemorum, A. nemoralis (Anthocoridae) and
   Atractotomus mall (Miridae) were considered to be the most important
   natural enemies of hawthorn psyllids; they regularly reached high
   densities on hawthorn shrubs and showed a close synchronization with the
   development of psyllid larvae in each year. All three species exhibited
   a positive numerical relationship with the abundance of psyllid larvae
   with A. nemoralis and A. mali exploiting this food resource more
   effectively than A. nemorum, which is known to be a very polyphagous
   species. Despite high predation pressure on psyllid larvae, it is
   concluded that these heteropteran predators are not able to prevent
   outbreaks of psyllids under favourable climatic conditions as their
   numerical response to growing psyllid densities occurs with a distinct
   time delay.}},

   months. For 22 injections and reinjections, 14 (63.7\%) showed an
   excellent result, five (22.7\%) good and three (13.6\%) null. In the
   hemifacial spasm group, eight were female and two male; the mean age was
   52.6 years; the mean time of the disease duration was 7.4 years; eight
   were essential and two post-paralytic. The mean dose used was 32 U. From
   the total of 15 injections and reinjections, all of them (100\%) had an
   excellent result, with a mean time of benefical effect of 3.4 months.
   Among the cervical dystonic patients, eight were male and three female;
   the mean age was 44.2 years; the mean time of the disease duration was
   12.2 years; six had essential dystonia, three had used neuroleptic drugs
   and two had familial history for similar disease. The mean dose used was
   238.6 U, with the mean duration of effect of 3.5 months. From the total
   of 20 injections and reinjections, 18 (90\%) had good result, one (5\%)
   mild and one (5\%) null. Ptosis, facial palsy and dysphagia were the
   most common side effects seen. We conclude that botulinum toxin is
   effective for the treatment of such disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to explore the involvement of endogenous
   dopamine in furosemide excretion and in the actions of the diuretic on
   tubular sodium reabsorption. The dose-response relationship for the
   diuretic effect of furosemide given as i.v. bolus injections (0.2-7.5 mg
   . kg(-1)) was studied by clearance technique in
   pentobarbital-anesthetized rats treated with vehicle, benserazide (BZ)
   (25 mg . kg(-1) i.v.) or SCH 23390 (50 mu g . kg(-1) + 10 mu g . kg(-1)
   . min(-1) i.v.). Furosemide induced the maximal diuresis 15 to 30 min
   after i.v. administration. The diuretic response was dose-dependent and
   was reduced in the animals treated with BZ and SCH 23390. Fractional
   sodium excretion was also increased by furosemide from 1.8 to 7.5\%
   during the same period. This effect was reduced by both BZ or SCH 23390
   by 35 to 50\%. The effects of furosemide on proximal and distal renal
   tubules were dissected by measuring the renal lithium clearance (CLi+).
   Furosemide effects on proximal tubular sites (measured by FE(Na) + prox
   = CLi+/Cln) were completely abolished by BZ and SCH 23390, whereas both
   drugs reduced furosemide effects on distal tubular sites (measured by
   FE(Na) + distal= CNa+/CLi+) by 20 to 40\%. Furosemide excretion rate
   during the peak response to the diuretic was measured in the urine. BZ
   and SCH 23390 diminished furosemide excretion by 45 to 80\% as compared
   with vehicle-treated animals. The furosemide tubular effects and the
   proximal and distal functions measured by CLi+ determined during the
   peak response were correlated to the maximal excretion rate of
   furosemide in the urine. Excretion-response curves were similar for
   urine flow, fractional sodium excretion and distal fractional sodium
   reabsorption in the vehicle-, BZ- or SCH 23390-treated animals, but they
   were different for proximal fractional sodium reabsorption. Our findings
   suggest that the stimulation of D-1 receptors by endogenous dopamine can
   facilitate the excretion of furosemide and that D-1 tubular receptors
   are also involved in the inhibition of proximal fractional sodium
   reabsorption elicited by the diuretic.}},

Abstract = {{To study the influence of the cellular environment on the functional
   activity of leukocyte integrins and to analyze their involvement in
   hematopoietic cell differentiation, we have developed stable
   transfectants of LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95 (CD11a-c/CD18) leukocyte
   integrins in cultured cell lines whose differentiation can be induced in
   vitro. As on circulating leukocytes, the integrins expressed on U937 or
   K562 cells were expressed in a constitutively inactive state, as
   demonstrated by the lack of adhesion to their cellular counterreceptors
   or soluble ligands, the absence of CD18-dependent intercellular
   aggregation, and their inability to mediate adhesion to protein-coated
   plates. However, while leukocyte integrin adhesive functions in U937
   cells were induced upon treatment with cellular agonists (e.g., PMA),
   their function in K562 cells could be upregulated only with activating
   monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating the cell-type specific regulation
   of the adhesive capabilities of the three leukocyte integrins in
   hematopoietic cellular environment. On the other hand, the expression of
   either CD11b/CD18 or CD11c/CD18 in U937 myeloid cells before induction
   of differentiation greatly affected the adhesive phenotype of
   differentiating cells by abrogating the CD11a/CD18-CD54-dependent
   homotypic aggregation. Unlike that of mock-transfected U937 cells,
   differentiation of CD11b/CD18- or CD11c/CD18-transfected U937 cells led
   to cell adhesion and spreading on the tissue culture plates, with an
   almost total absence of homotypic aggregates. These results confirm the
   role of CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 in myeloid cell adhesion and spreading
   and suggest that the CD11b/- and CD11c/CD18-mediated recognition of
   substrate-bound ligands competes or interferes with LEA-1-dependent
   intercellular adhesion. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Small wars are often mixed civil-international wars characterized by
   extremes of mutual hatred. Still, the international law of war sets the
   standards for all armed conflicts. War-decision law regulates recourse
   to armed force. War-conduct law governs belligerent practice. There are
   two justifications for recourse to armed force: enforcement action
   ordered by the U.N. Security Council and individual and collective
   self-defense. Despite the principle of nonintervention, interventions
   have been frequent in small wars. The difficulty with applying
   war-decision law to small wars arises from the fact that such wars are
   often not conventional wars, making determination of aggression
   difficult. Application of war-conduct law confronts difficulties with
   determining belligerent status, dealing with guerrilla and terror
   tactics, preserving the ban on chemical and biological weapons, and
   protecting prisoners of war and occupied populations in small wars. The
   best sanction for the laws of war is self-enforcement by responsible
   belligerents.}},

Abstract = {{In the years following `first contact' in the 1930s, shields disappeared
   from the material repertoire of the Wahgi people of the New Guinea
   Highlands, as the Australian Administration suppressed local warfare.
   More recently, however, shields have been reinvented for the resurgent
   fighting of the 1980s, but they now include new figurative designs
   featuring motifs from advertising, written allusions to sin and to
   Superman, and also draw upon team idioms derived from the sport of rugby
   league. This article recounts the remarkable discontinuous history of
   these shields to propose, first, an analytical distinction between two
   kinds of `recontextualization'; and secondly, that the changes
   associated with modernity have invested linguistic analogies with a
   fresh relevance as a model for interpreting local aesthetic systems.}},

Abstract = {{To examine how the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA) affects baroreflex regulation, reflex heart rate and renal nerve
   responses were recorded in anesthetized rats after bilateral injections
   of muscimol or bicuculline into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS).
   Blood pressure, heart rate, and renal nerve activity were increased by
   the GABA agonist muscimol and decreased by the GABA antagonist
   bicuculline. Control injections of the vehicle alone were ineffective.
   More importantly, all reflex responses later induced by infusing
   phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside intravenously were reduced by
   muscimol. The magnitude of the reflex bradycardia and sympathoinhibition
   caused by phenylephrine, as well as that of the reflex tachycardia and
   sympathoexcitation caused by sodium nitroprusside, diminished after NTS
   injections of muscimol. By contrast, the same reflex responses tended to
   be enhanced after NTS injections of bicuculline, but most changes were
   not significant. If GABA acts on receptors located on second-order
   neurons in the NTS, then muscimol would inhibit those neurons, whereas
   bicuculline would prevent endogenous GABA from reaching them. Thus
   muscimol would reduce reflex responsiveness by inhibiting all
   second-order neurons, whereas bicuculline would enhance it by protecting
   the same neurons from inhibition by endogenous GABA.}},

Abstract = {{Locoregional infusion. therapy has several theoretical advantages over
   systemic therapy for the treatment of primary or metastatic liver
   tumors. At present, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy clearly
   improves the response rate over systemic therapy (approximately 40 -
   60\% vs. 10 - 20\%). However, no definite survival benefit has been.
   demonstrated, We have utilized immuno-chemocombined locoregional therapy
   to treat liver malignancies, and are convinced that such therapy will
   bring promising results in liver malignancies for the following reasons:
   First, the liver is a large immunologic organ and possesses a large
   amount of lymphocytes/macrophages (Kupffer cells) whose antitumor
   activities are enhanced in a tumor-bearing state. Our strategy is to
   anticipate growth inhibition of the tumor and use combined chemotherapy
   at relatively low doses so as not to impair the anti-tumor activities of
   the lymphocytes. Moreover, some kinds of chemotheraperatic agents induce
   immnoaugmentation when low to moderate doses are used. Based on these
   reasons, we have conducted a pilot study of IL-2-based
   immunochemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable liver metastases,
   and have obtained promising results. In this review, we have tried to
   delineate the locoregional immuno-chemotherapy in liver malignancies at
   present and future perspectives.}},

   means of peritoneal injection of a monoclonal anti-c-Kit antibody
   (ACK2), which blocks c-Kit functions. The mice were injected once or
   more with ACK2 at various intervals after birth. In experiment 1, skin
   samples were examined on day 10 post-partum and in experiment 2 they
   were examined daily until day 10 post-partum, We studied melanocytes in
   the hair follicles, epidermis, and dermis by light and electron
   microscopy with dopa reactions and immunohistochemistry. Epidermal
   melanocytes in untreated mice were dopa negative and c-Kit positive on
   day 0 post-partum but became dopa positive soon thereafter, In
   ACK2-treated mice, the earlier the mice received ACK2 injections after
   birth, the fewer melanocytes they had, not only in the epidermis, but
   also in follicles. In these mice, melanocytes that had undergone
   apoptosis in the dermis and the follicles were detected
   ultrastructurally. Some appeared to have produced tyrosinase, because
   they had dopa-positive melanosomes, These results suggest that
   melanocytes in newborn mice are c-Kit dependent and undergo apoptosis
   when c-Kit receptors are blocked by ACK2 in the early days after birth.
   During this c-Kit-dependent period, melanocytes differentiate from dopa
   negative to positive and migrate from the epidermis to hair follicles.}},

Abstract = {{Surface acoustic wave (SAW) measurements are a fast and reliable way to
   obtain information about the elastic properties of thin film coatings.
   Measuring the surface wave phase velocity which is dependent on
   frequency and performing the inverse solution of dispersion relation for
   surface wave propagation in coated materials enable us to determine the
   elastic parameters of the film and substrate material. Measuring
   equipment is used where wide-band surface wave impulses are generated by
   short laser pulses and received with a piezoelectric transducer. The
   surface wave phase velocity is obtained by Fourier transforming the
   impulse form.
   In this work we are interested in Young's modulus of the him material
   and its relation to the defects in the interface region of the
   substrate. Young's modulus is a characteristic material parameter,
   depending on atomic composition and on the microscopic structure of the
   material. It is theoretically and experimentally established that, if
   defects such as flaws are incorporated, Young's modulus is reduced in
   comparison with that of bulk material.
   The examined samples mere steel pieces (42CrMo4) coated with TiN by ion
   plating, During the deposition process we have only varied the duration
   of the ion etching process, while keeping all other technological
   parameters constant. The ion etching is responsible for the adhesion of
   the coating by removing residual contamination from the substrate
   surface, In this way a more or less non-defective interface zone is
   built up. The procedure of varying only the etching time allows us to
   obtain different interface properties while leaving him properties
   constant. Film properties were characterized by means of Auger, X-ray
   texture and dynamic hardness measurements.
   It was shown that there is a correlation between Young's modulus and
   conventional scratch test results. The acoustic emission was used to
   evaluate the coated material behaviour in the scratch test. From a
   Weibull diagram of the acoustic emission signals an initial crack load
   Li was determined. It could be proved that the initial crack load and
   the Young's modulus correlate with a coefficient R = -0.78.}},

Abstract = {{The role of fungal pathogens in damage of grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.;
   cv. Chardonnay) associated with grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira
   vitifoliae FITCH) was investigated. Seven different genera of secondary
   fungi were isolated from surface-disinfected feeding sites of phylloxera
   but none from surface-disinfected root tissues undamaged by phylloxera.
   Damage in vines infested with phylloxera and infected with Fusarium
   solani (MART.) or with F. solani and Pythium ultimum TROW. was
   significantly greater than damage in vines infested with phylloxera
   only. In a greenhouse experiment, total biomass was reduced by 16\% in
   vines infested with phylloxera and 24 to 29\% in vines infested with
   phylloxera and infected with fungus in comparison with control vines.
   Chlorophyll content, average internode length, shoot biomass, and root
   biomass in the uninfested, uninfected vines were significantly greater
   than vines infested with phylloxera or vines infested with phylloxera
   and infected with F. solani or P. ultimum, or both. Preventative
   treatment with metalaxyl, benomyl or copper quinolinolate fungicides
   significantly decreased damage in phylloxera-infested vines in
   comparison with untreated vines. The implications of this research with
   respect to management of grape phylloxera are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To learn more about collaboration between family planning agencies and
   managed care plans, telephone interviews were conducted with staff at
   ten sites across the country, including offices of Planned Parenthood
   and other agencies. These examples of collaboration indicate that the
   development of each partnership is influenced by contextual factors such
   as the penetration of managed care into the local market, the patient
   profile of the clinics, government regulations, and the political
   environment. Although establishing relationships with family planning
   agencies is often not a high priority for the health plan organizations,
   they prefer to deal with networks of providers when the need for a
   family planning referral arises, Family planning agencies are
   increasingly moving toward expansion of services into primary care to
   make themselves more attractive to managed care plans. Developing
   strategies for sharing information while maintaining patient
   confidentiality represents an important challenge to family planning
   agencies as they move toward integration with managed care plans. Family
   planning providers also face obstacles because they are not usually
   organized to handle the complex financial and contractual issues that
   come with collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been and will continue to be

   and its specificity is without substitute. This article attempts to give
   an historical perspective, an accounting of its present status, and its
   promise for the future through a few select examples. Human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-disease is used because it is a major
   component of medicine today. TEM has been critical in our understanding
   of HIV and the opportunistic pathogens that are a major scourge of the
   immunodeficiency that characterizes HIV infection. The author hopes this
   brief presentation will convey a sense of how exciting, important, and

   bis-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)methane (U3), which are the natural antioxidants
   of Curcuma longa L. (turmeric), to tetrahydrocurcuminoids (THU1, THU2,
   and THU3, respectively) by hydrogenation, and evaluated their
   antioxidative activity by using linoleic acid as the substrate in an
   ethanol/water system, Further, we used the rabbit erythrocyte membrane
   ghost and rat liver microsome as in vitro systems and determined the
   antioxidative activity of these curcuminoids. When we evaluated their
   antioxidative activity by these assays, it was found that THU1 had the

   in vivo {[}Holder et al., Xenobiotica, 8, 751-768 (1978)], These results

   for patients with anxiety disorders. Following the intake interview 4
   2-hour group sessions were conducted over a period of 2 weeks with 2
   groups of together 14 (5 and 9, respectively) patients. Main aims were:
   to increase knowledge about anxiety disorders, to enhance awareness
   regarding interactions between anxiety symptoms and other problems in
   life, to teach self application of exposure in vivo. Self-help books
   were used in group sessions and recommended specifically for individual
   patients' needs. Mean treatment time for each patient was about 3 h. It
   was to be studied whether and for whom this might be sufficient help or
   help to overcome long waiting times for intense behavior therapy with
   less suffering.
   10 of the 14 patients reported a reduction of anxiety symptoms after
   participation in the group. Agoraphobics and patients with panic attacks
   unrelated to specific situations gained the most from this minimal
   intervention. The responders among the agoraphobics did successful
   self-exposure mainly in areas most relevant for their daily life
   conduct, such as the use of public transport, shopping, and similar
   activities.
   The preliminary results indicate that the primary care of anxiety
   patients could be improved by a minimal intervention with motivation for
   home-based treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in
   lymphocyte subpopulations that have led to immune system alterations
   after amalgam restorations were placed.
   Methods. A controlled, quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was
   used to investigate the immune effects of sliver amalgam restorations in
   a sample of 60 individuals (30 experimental and 30 control subjects)
   aged 18 to 21 y. Two blood samples were obtained 15 d apart from each
   participant. In each experimental subject, two amalgam restorations were
   placed in posterior teeth immediately after the first blood sample was
   collected. The changes in lymphocyte subpopulations in the two groups
   were compared by multivariate analysis.
   Results. There was a greater change in T8 lymphocytes in experimental
   than in control subjects; increases in B, DR, NK, and CD45R lymphocytes
   were smaller in experimental than in control subjects;the changes in T3
   and T4 lymphocytes did not differ significantly between the two groups.
   Significance. Despite the statistical significance of some differences
   between the two groups, the differences are not considered to be
   clinically relevant for the 2 wk time period after placement.}},

Abstract = {{The major justification for field analysis is the production of data and
   information that allows decisions to be made in a timely fashion for
   effective mitigation and/or efficient remediation of environmental
   contamination. Secondary benefits include lower cost per sample, more
   samples analyzed per work shift, and improved monitoring for worker
   safety. However, all of these applications require production of field
   analytical data of high quality and documented consistency and
   integrity. These data quality requirements place special constraints on
   the analytical instruments that are used for field analysis. The
   application and analytical capabilities of a dual silicon micro
   fabricated gas chromatographic instrument, with dedicated microprocessor
   control of all analytical functions, are discussed in relation to
   fieldable analytical chemistry. This small, rugged and very fast
   instrument provides for redundancy in analytical results, or,
   alternatively, the use of different modes of separation to achieve a
   wide variety of analytical capabilities within a portable instrument
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine if certain growth factors and
   bacterial products induce pleural mesothelial cells (PMC) to produce
   nitric oxide (NO). Confluent monolayers of rat PMC were exposed to
   epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) individually and in various combinations for
   24-72 h. Concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were quantified and used
   as an indirect measure of NO production. LPS stimulation resulted in a
   significant increase in nitrite/nitrate concentration, but neither EGF
   nor PDGF alone or combined had any significant effect relative to
   control. However, LPS combined with either EGF or PDGF caused a
   significant increase in nitrite/nitrate concentration relative to LPS
   alone and growth factor alone. The highest level of nitrite/nitrate
   concentration was observed with the triple combination of LPS, EGF, and
   PDGF. Nitrite/nitrate accumulation was significantly increased at 24 h
   by all combinations, and continued to increase, with the highest
   concentration observed after 72 h of exposure. Nitrite/nitrate
   production was significantly inhibited by N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl
   ester and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of L-arginine,
   suggesting that nitrite and nitrate were derived from the
   L-arginine-dependent formation of NO. These data indicate that PMC can
   be induced to produce relatively large amounts of NO in response to
   growth factors combined with LPS.}},

Abstract = {{THERESA (Transferts Hydriques Evalues par le REtrait des Sols Argileux)
   is a method for estimating the water content of vertisols in the field
   by measuring the vertical deformation of the solid. Deformation is
   controlled by changes in the water content of the day matrix, and only
   the matric water component of the total water content can be determined
   with this method. The relationship between matric water storage or
   reserve (Sm and Rm(i)) calculated from deformation data and three
   indicators of water status in the soil and plants were studied, so as to
   find out more about the actual meaning of this parameter in terms of
   water uptake by plants. The three indicators used were: total water
   storage and reserves (S and R(i)) which control the amount of water
   available, relative transpiration (Ep/ETm) which is the outcome of the
   balance between water availability and plant requirements, and the
   growth rate of an organ (Delta L/Delta t) which indicates how water
   stress affects plant growth. Evaluating matric water contents from
   changes in the thickness of soil layers (measured with THERESA
   transducers) was tested in three settings: in grassland from 1985 to
   1988 and during two sugar cane growth cycles from 1989 to 1991. By
   measuring vertical solid displacements and the gravimetric water
   content, the soil shrinkage curve in the field and changes in the
   thickness of soil layers were available. These were then used for
   removing the bias in water storage calculation introduced when the
   changes in bulk density and thickness are ignored. Matric water contents
   measured with THERESA corresponded to a low availability domain.
   Relative transpiration (Ep/ETm) and stem growth rate (Delta L/Delta t)
   decreased significantly as soon as the matric reserve was drawn from.
   These results give confirmation that matric water contents measured by
   THERESA are an appropriate indicator for rationing water and for
   monitoring irrigation in swelling clay soils.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on the type of uni-modal (cuspoid) catastrophe which governs
   the local behavior of a structure at a simple critical point, correct
   prediction of the post-critical path requires an accurate estimation of
   a number of terms in the Taylor series expansion of the total potential
   function at the critical point. This imposes certain conditions on the
   accuracy of the adopted non-linear elements. These conditions are mainly
   related to the quality of the kinematic assumptions which underlie the
   strain definition used in the model. If these assumptions are not
   accurate enough, the fourth and higher order terms in the Taylor
   expansion of the total potential function will not be correctly
   represented. As a consequence, the model will fail to predict correctly
   even the initial post-buckling behavior whenever the criticality at hand
   is more complex than the fold (limit point, asymmetric bifurcation).
   This proves to be the case for the so-called `technical' beam models.
   This inability is inherited by any constructed finite element model,
   regardless of the interpolation function used in its definition and of
   the number of elements used in the discretization. An improved
   non-linear model based on the treatment by Antman (Bifurcation problems
   in non-linearly elastic structures, in: P.H. Rabinowitz, ed.,
   Application of Bifurcation Theory, Academic Press, NY, 1977), is
   adopted, and several finite elements are developed on the basis of this
   model. These elements are tested for a number of problems for which the
   critical behavior is governed by fold, cusp and butterfly singularities.
   The numerical results outline the importance of the `small' kinematic
   terms, especially in conjunction with the occurrence of higher-order
   uni-modal singularities. Some risks for numerical locking are pointed
   out and remedied. The recommended element leads to a computational cost,
   which is comparable to an implemented `shallow arch' element.}},

Abstract = {{We have critically tested the application of the diffusion approximation
   to describe the propagation of ultrasonic waves through a random,
   strongly scattering medium. The transmission of short ultrasonic pulses
   has been measured through a concentrated suspension of glass beads
   immersed in water. The transmitted sound field is found to exhibit
   temporal fluctuations with a period determined by the width of the
   incident pulse. Provided that appropriate boundary conditions are used
   to account for the reflectivity of the interfaces, the time dependence
   of the ensemble-averaged transmitted intensity is shown to be well
   described by the diffusion equation. This enables us to determine both
   the diffusion coefficient for the sound waves as well as the inelastic
   absorption rate. The consistency of these results is established by
   varying the experimental geometry; while the transmitted pulse shape
   changes markedly, the values for the diffusion coefficient and
   absorption rate obtained through a description using the diffusion
   approximation remain unchanged. We have also measured the absolute
   transmitted intensity of the sound as the sample thickness is varied;
   this provides an accurate measure of the transport mean free path and
   thus also the energy transport velocity. These results convincingly
   demonstrate the validity of using the diffusion approximation to
   describe the propagation of sound waves through strongly scattering

Abstract = {{The vertical structure of the water column and the spatial distribution
   and semidiurnal variability of bacteria were investigated at six
   stations in the upper St, Lawrence estuary. The sigma(t) profiles
   indicate that the upper St. Lawrence is a partially mixed estuary.
   Stratification results from buoyancy input from the freshwater outflow
   of the St. Lawrence River, and its variability is controlled by tidal
   and, to a lesser extent, wind mixing. Calculations show that tidal
   mixing largely exceeds mixing caused by wind. Free and attached bacteria
   presented different patterns of spatial distribution and temporal
   variability. Free bacteria exhibited highest mean concentrations at the
   freshwater station (3.5-4.4 10(6) ml(-1)) and lowest concentrations at
   the downstream stations (0.3-0.5 10(6) ml(-1)); their numbers declined
   exponentially relative to salinity. Attached bacteria had highest mean
   concentrations (3.2-5.5 10(6) ml(-1)) at salinities between 0.5 and 5
   and were virtually absent at downstream stations (<0.05 10(6) ml(-1)).
   The importance of semidiurnal variability was demonstrated. Over the
   tidal cycle, variability of attached bacteria was always greater than
   that of free bacteria. The analysis of causal models between salinity
   and free and attached bacteria, showed that the two types of bacteria
   are uncoupled and that both types have a strong relationship with
   salinity. Physical processes are thus important controlling factors of
   the distribution and variability of bacteria. Results suggest that
   large-scale processes, such as freshwater outflow and residual
   circulation, largely control free bacteria, whereas short-term and more
   local processes (e.g., sediment resuspension caused by wind) may also be
   important in the control of attached bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental survival of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) is
   an important public health concern. Survival of HIV in waste water is of
   particular interest to those who work at treatment facilities and to the
   general public who have contact with rivers or ocean water receiving
   treated sewage effluent. Other researchers have reported that HIV can be
   detected in waste water. Their studies, however, detected homologous
   nucleic acid sequences but did not attempt to determine infectivity. The
   current study tested primary and secondary effluent from a major
   metropolitan sewage agency for the presence of HIV-1 using reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), HIV-1 p24 antigen
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and infectivity testing. For RT-PCR,
   primers SK38/SK39 and M667/AA55 were used to identify HIV-1 RNA
   sequences from concentrated and extracted sewage samples. Infectivity
   assays employed donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
   stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Coxsackievirus B4, echovirus 7, and
   poliovirus 1, enteroviruses normally present in sewage, were tested for
   replication in PBMCs. Poliovirus 1 was found to infect the PBMCs. To
   eliminate other enteroviruses that may also infect the PBMCs and
   interfere with HIV-1 testing, concentrated sewage was treated with human
   immunoglobulin (free of HIV antibodies) and poliovirus antisera before
   infectivity assays were performed. All treated sewage samples tested
   negative for HIV-1 by all methods used. HIV-1 seeded into sewage,
   however, remained infectious in the assay, indicating that the sewage
   water sample did not interfere with HIV infectivity nor was it toxic to
   the PBMCs.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that
   extracellular calcium entry through the NMDA subtype of glutamate
   receptors in hippocampal neurons selectively down-regulated ligatin gene
   expression in a rapid and long-lasting manner. Here we investigated the
   molecular mechanism that underlies this phenomenon. We demonstrate that
   glutamate receptor activation transiently increased the transcriptional
   activity of the ligatin gene and simultaneously shortened the half-life
   of its message. Using nuclear run-on assays and northern analyses of
   total RNA from alpha-amanitin-treated cells, we measured the effects of
   glutamate on the transcriptional activity and mRNA stability of the
   ligatin gene. The transcriptional activity of ligatin was found to be
   transiently increased (1.4-fold) 20 min after the addition of glutamate,
   with a return to basal levels by 60 min. Thus, the glutamate-dependent
   decrease in ligatin message could not be explained by a decline in its
   synthesis. Instead, concurrent with transcriptional up-regulation,
   glutamate shortened the half-life of the ligatin message from 10 h to 58
   min, leading to a net decrease (0.7-fold) in its steady-state levels by
   60 min. This posttranscriptional destabilization of ligatin mRNA was
   mimicked by the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, but not by
   puromycin. This finding indicated that the stability of ligatin mRNA was
   translation independent and distinguished this post-transcriptional
   regulatory mechanism from those previously described. Moreover, using in
   situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we showed that control of
   message stability occurred both in the cell body and in the dendritic
   regions distant from the nucleus, The selective glutamate-induced
   changes in the synthesis and stability of mRNA indicated that
   transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression
   may be part of the normal receptor-mediated regulatory program of
   plasticity and may play an important role in local modulation of
   neuronal phenotype by neurotransmitters. Our results provide the first
   description of a receptor-modulated, calcium-dependent mechanism that
   rapidly destabilizes mRNA in neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Co-agglutination (coagg) and latex agglutination (LA) tests were used
   for the detection of Salmonella serotype Typhi Vi and Barber protein

   consisted of 30 blood culture-positive cases of typhoid fever and group
   B consisted of 30 suspected cases of typhoid fever who had sterile blood
   cultures but positive Widal tests. Thirty cases of pyrexia of unknown
   origin (PUO) were placed in group C, while group D consisted of 15 cases
   of septicaemia caused by organisms other than Salmonella serotype Typhi.
   Group E comprised 50 normal healthy individuals with no history of
   typhoid fever or TAB vaccination in the previous 5 years. The Vi-LA test
   performed best with 96.7 \% of group A sera and 90 \% of group B sera
   giving positive results. No false positive results and only 2.58 \%
   false negative results were obtained with this test. Considering
   patients with positive blood culture results or positive Widal tests as
   true positives, the sensitivities of the Vi-LA, BP-LA, Vi-coagg and
   BP-coagg tests were 93.3, 91.7, 83.3 and 86.7 \%, respectively. The
   specificities of these tests were 100, 98.5, 98.5 and 98.5 \%,
   respectively. It is suggested that the Vi-LA test can be used for the
   rapid and early diagnosis of typhoid fever.}},

Abstract = {{The 50 texts which make up Max Weber's `'Early Writings'' have been
   largely ignored by analysts of his works. Yet there are important
   differences between Weber's positions in those texts and the more
   familiar positions he exposed later. In the Early Writings, there is a
   nearly complete absence of epistemological preoccupations on themes
   which will later become central. One also notes the essential primacy of
   the political sphere over the scientific, in the form of the German
   Nation's transcendence as the condition for the protection of ethical
   ideals. This article argues that Weber's nationalist aggressiveness in
   his Early Writings is conditioned by the relative poverty of their

Journal = {{DIABETES CARE}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the effects
   of a behavioral intervention focusing on either calorie restriction
   alone or calorie plus fat restriction on weight loss and changes in
   lipids and glycemic control in individuals with non-insulin-dependent
   diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or a family history of diabetes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We recruited 44 obese women with NIDDM and
   46 obese women with a family history of NIDDM and randomly assigned
   these subjects to calorie restriction (GAL) or to calorie plus fat
   restriction (CAL+FAT). All subjects participated in a 16-week behavioral
   weight loss program, with training in diet, exercise, and behavior
   modification. Subjects assigned to the CAL condition were given a
   1,000-1,500 kcal/day goal and self-monitored calories consumed. Subjects
   assigned to the CAL+FAT condition had the same calorie goal, but were
   also given a fat goal (grams of fat/day), to produce a diet with <20\%
   of calories from fat; this group monitored both calories and fat grams.
   RESULTS - Among NIDDM subjects, weight loss of the subjects in the
   CAL+FAT condition was significantly greater than subjects in the CAL
   condition (7.7 vs. 4.6 kg) and the CAL+FAT condition group also
   maintained their weight loss better at the 1-year fellow-up (5.2 vs. 1.0
   kg). Significant decreases in glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
   cholesterol, and total cholesterol were seen after 16 weeks of treatment
   among NIDDM subjects; these changes were similar in CAL and CAL+FAT
   groups, but a greater proportion of subjects in CAL condition required
   oral hypoglycemic medication. At the 1-year follow-up, all parameters
   had returned to baseline in NIDDM subjects, except HDL cholesterol,
   which continued to be significantly below baseline. No significant
   differences in weight loss or physiological changes were seen between
   CAL and CAL+FAT conditions in subjects with a family history of
   diabetes.
   CONCLUSIONS - These results suggest that using the combination of
   calorie and fat restriction may help promote weight loss in obese NIDDM
   patients. No other long-term benefits of this regimen were observed.}},

   comparison between our results and those calculated by the most used
   method, i.e., the transfer matrix method, is carried out in terms of
   power attenuation coefficient and total radiation loss. Quantitative and
   qualitative discrepancies between the two methods are widely discussed.
   In particular, an oscillatory variation of radiation loss with grating
   depth and gap thickness in contrast to the monotonic behavior predicted
   by the transfer matrix method has been found.}},

   highest rate of exposures (10\%) as a group. Contributing risk factors
   include trauma or emergency orthopaedic procedures, high patient blood
   loss, long procedures and holding tissue by hand while suturing.
   However, across occupations, nurses and other health workers experience
   greater risks than surgeons regarding potentially infectious exposures.
   Preventive measures such as the HBV vaccine and protective devices (i.e.
   self-capping needles, needle-free i.v. systems and improved barrier
   materials) have reduced the occupational risk of acquiring a blood-borne
   infection, which allows attention to be given to the psychosocial risks
   which may be more significant, yet are often overlooked. Doctors are at
   greater risk of divorce, alcoholism, substance abuse and suicide than
   are members of comparable professional groups. One study found that
   general surgeons had the highest rates of suicide of all doctors.
   According to family surveys, surgeons tend to be oblivious to the
   effects of work stressors, and may benefit from greater self-awareness;
   sharing of feelings and responsibilities with colleagues, family and
   patients; being willing to delegate work to others; setting work limits;
   and broadening perspectives in their approach to work.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of adrenal steroids on synaptic plasticity were investigated
   in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Experiments were performed in
   either adrenalectomized or intact (non-adrenalectomized), anesthetized
   rats. High-frequency stimulation was applied to the medial perforant
   pathway at three different frequencies; 100, 200 or 400 Hz, either post-
   or pre- and post-administration of the specific Type-II adrenal steroid
   receptor agonist RU 28362. High-frequency stimulation prior to RU 28362
   administration produced a frequency-dependent long-term potentiation of
   the population spike, with 100 Hz showing no long-term potentiation and
   400 Hz the highest degree of potentiation. In contrast, following
   administration of RU 28362, high-frequency stimulation produced a
   long-term depression (in comparison to baseline). In the experiments in
   which high-frequency stimulation was applied both pre- and post-RU 28362
   administration, the size of the population spike was initially
   potentiated and then depotentiated after the RU 28362 injection. This
   effect was also frequency dependent, although opposite to the long-term
   potentiation effect. That is, 400 Hz was the least effective frequency
   for inducing long-term depression/depotentiation, while 100 Hz was the
   most effective. Long-term depression/depotentation was inmediate
   following high-frequency stimulation and lasted for the extent of the
   recording session, in some cases longer than 1 h. Similar to the finding
   reported in the accompanying paper, induction of long-term potentiation
   was substantially suppressed by RU 28362. However, in a number of
   experiments long-term potentiation could still be induced after RU 28362
   administration, even after long-term depression/depotentiation had been
   established. In these cases, stimulation at the higher frequencies was
   necessary.
   The present results, along with the results reported in the companion
   paper, demonstrate that glucocorticoids can have potent suppressive
   effects on hippocampal plasticity. This is the first clear example of
   high-frequency stimulation producing homosynaptic long-term depression.
   This long-term depression may provide an explanation for the behavioral
   deficits seen with elevations in glucocorticoids.}},

   of analog indicators in tasks of this type and also indicated that the

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure changes in self-reported risk behaviour for HIV
   infections and HIV seroprevalence among injecting drug user (IDU)
   clients of an outreach harm-reduction programme in Kathmandu, Nepal.
   Methods: The Lifesaving and Lifegiving Society (LALS) of Kathmandu began
   providing sterile injecting equipment and education to Nepalese IDU in
   1991. A sample of these IDU were interviewed and tested for HIV each
   year from 1991 through 1994.
   Results: Indicators of unsafe injecting fell, as knowledge of HIV rose
   more in 1994 for those who had been in touch with LALS for longer.
   Indicators of unsafe sex did not change. HIV seroprevalence remained
   low, 1.6\% in 1991 and 0\% in 1994.
   Conclusion: We conclude that programmes for the prevention of HIV spread
   among IDU are possible and effective in Asia, and are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{During mid-1992, a remedial workover program was implemented offshore
   within the Gulf of Mexico on low-rate marginal-reserve sand-producing
   wellbores. A process called through-tubing gravel packing (TTGP) was
   used on five offshore wells and one U.S. gulf coast land well. This
   technique involved the placement of ceramic beads and prepacked screen
   within existing completions with coiled tubing (CT) to eliminate sand
   production (Fig. 1). The basic steps of ?TGP consist of wellbore
   cleanup, CT counter correlation, injectivity testing, running a dummy
   assembly, ceramic bead placement, prepacked screen placement, and
   installation of an isolation device. The TTGP method demonstrated
   versatility in adapting to individual well conditions. This remedial
   sand control technique was successfully applied in highly deviated
   wellbores, in the upper zones of a dual completion, and within existing
   gravel packs for screen repair.
   TTGP's were performed offshore in as little as 5 days with a CT unit at
   a cost of \$63,500. Five wells were mechanically successful, bur only
   three wells wee considered economic successes. Simple individual payouts
   for the wells ranged from 46 to 77 days, with an associated production
   gain of 2,020 Mcf/D and 39 BOPD. Economic success improved over time as
   mechanical success increased. Project incremental production was 1,070
   Mcf/D and 38 BOPD. The total cost of the project was \$571,807. The
   average offshore workover cost was \$110,761, and the workover cost for
   the onshore well was \$18,000.
   Throughout the implementation of this program mechanical problems wee
   addressed that led to improvements in subsequent workover programs. This
   paper details the TTGP program and recommends mechanical improvements
   for performing future through-tubing gravel packs.}},

Abstract = {{Since the late 1980s, federal legislation has required industries to
   publicly report their annual emissions of toxic compounds. Industry
   reports show the largest contributor to toxic emission levels in Texas
   is the massive concentration of petrochemical industries along the Gulf
   Coast. It is interesting to note that although Texas produces over 50\%
   of the nation's synthetic chemicals, it discharges less than 8\% of the
   nation's toxic emissions. However, in response to growing concerns about
   the effects of these toxic emissions, the Texas Natural Resource
   Conservation Commission (TNRCC) initiated a long-term program for
   monitoring toxic chemicals in the air. This article provides details of
   this monitoring program as well as industry-funded toxic monitoring
   networks in Texas. This includes information on the technology currently
   being used for sample collection and analysis as well as plans for
   implementing methods that are on the technological horizon. Finally,
   details of some key measurements from the state's air toxics monitoring
   network will be provided along with an explanation of how they impact

Abstract = {{Corynebacterium melassecola, a glutamate producing bacteria, has been
   cultivated in a 4-l batch aerated fermenter with glucose and fructose
   mixtures of various proportions as carbon sources and mineral ammonium
   as nitrogen source. Experimental results are analysed in order to obtain
   the specific rates and the conversion yields. A data reconciliation
   technique is used to manage with the experiments performed in similar
   conditions. The redundant experimental informations are used to test the
   carbon, nitrogen, available electrons, phosphorus and protons balances.
   The measurement of dissolved oxygen tension and volumetric oxygen
   transfer coefficient indicates that oxygen was never a limiting
   substrate in the experimental device though the oxygen demand was up to
   70 mmoles/I.h and the heterogeneity of the liquid phase. The highest
   specific growth rate (0.59 h(-1)) and the highest biomass production
   yield (0.48 gX/gS) are obtained with glucose as the sole carbon source.
   These two parameters progressively decrease with the increase of the
   proportion of fructose in the medium down to 0.43 h(-1) and 0.38 gX/gS
   on fructose so that the specific carbon uptake rate remains constant and
   equal to 0.04 C-mole/gX h.
   From a metabolic point of view, this decrease of the carbon conversion
   efficiency into cellular material is correlated to a lower carbon flux
   through the pentose pathway as the fructose proportion is increased.
   This is correlated with an accumulation of fructose 1,6-biphosphate
   which further activates the lactate deshydrogenase resulting to lactate
   production though the metabolism remains strictly aerobic.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the mechanism of action by which angiotensin-converting
   enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower hematocrit in patients with posttransplant
   erythrocytosis, indices of red blood cell production and red blood cell
   destruction were obtained serially for 6 months from 10 renal transplant
   patients receiving treatment with enalapril for this problem. Before
   treatment, five patients had an elevated red blood cell mass, four had
   plasma volume contraction, and one had both. The mean hemoglobin
   concentration decreased by 2 g/dL (range, 0.5 to 3.3 g/dL), from 17 +/-
   1 g/dL to 15 +/- 1 g/dL (P = 0.001) following 6 months of enalapril
   therapy. Similarly, the mean hematocrit decreased by 8\% (range, 3\% to
   12\%), from 52\% +/- 2\% to 44\% +/- 3\% (P = 0.001) during the same
   period. The mean reticulocyte count tended to decrease, although the
   change was not significant. The red blood cell mass decreased
   dramatically by 15\% to 50\%, from 32 +/- 9 mL/ld to 23 +/- 4 mL/kg (P =
   0.008). Although serial erythropoietin levels declined steadily in two
   patients, there was no consistent change in the other patients. Mean
   levels decreased modestly, from 20 +/- 11 mU/mL at baseline to 12 +/- 5
   mU/mL at 6 months, a change that was not statistically significant. Mean
   levels at each time point were not statistically different from the mean
   pretreatment value. Furthermore, during enalapril therapy, there was no
   correlation between mean circulating erythropoietin level and mean
   hematocrit (r = 0.43, P = 0.20) or hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.36, P
   = 0.30) or between changes in these parameters. Indices of red blood
   cell destruction, including haptoglobin, bilirubin, and lactic
   dehydrogenase, were unchanged by enalapril therapy, as was calculated
   plasma volume at the beginning and end of the study. The current data
   suggest that enalapril improves posttransplant erythrocytosis by
   impairing red blood cell production without affecting red blood cell
   destruction or plasma volume. Furthermore, hematocrit decreased in most
   patients without a concomitant decrease in circulating erythropoietin
   levels. These results suggest that an inhibition of erythropoietin
   synthesis is not an essential component of the mechanism by which
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lower hematocrit in most
   patients with posttransplant erythrocytosis. An inhibitory effect (ie,
   erythropoietin resistance) at the level of the bone marrow appears more
   likely, a hypothesis that would have to be proven by ferrokinetic
   studies in patients or by direct studies of erythropoiesis in vitro. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of the beam size, aggregate size, and compressive strength on
   the specific fracture energy of plain concrete is studied, based on
   three-point bending (TPB) static tests on single-edge notched (SEN)
   beams. Most of the beams with target concrete cylinder compressive
   strengths of 28 and 55 MPa and two maximum aggregate sizes of 6 and 25
   mm were tested under crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control.
   The CMOD, applied load, load-point deflection (LPD), and stroke were
   recorded. The LPD was measured by two direct current displacement
   transducers (DCDTs), supported by an aluminum frame attached to both
   sides of the beam at its mid-height. Three beam sizes (S1, S2, S3), a
   constant width b = 127 mm, span-to-depth ratio S/d = 4, and notch
   length-to-depth ratio a(o)/d = 0.3, were considered. Two beams with a
   shorter notch length of a(o) = 0.1 d were tested to compare their
   postpeak response. The measured RILEM G(F)(R) values are consistently
   higher than the calculated G(f)(SEM) values {[}Bazant's size effect
   model (SEM)] and the equivalent G(Ic) values based on LEFM and the Jenq
   and Shah two-parameter model (TPM). A macro- and microscale effect is
   observed in the fracture energy values. The RILEM C-F(R) values for the
   smaller d(max) (6 mm) increased by only 35 to 59 percent, which is four
   times the increase in beam size (S1 to S3), while the larger d(max) (25
   mm) only increased by 24 to 36 percent, which is two times the increase
   in beam size (S2 to S3), The G(F)(R) values are influenced more
   drastically by d(max). Increasing d(max) from 6 to 25 mm, G(F)(R)
   increased independently by about 100 percent of the beam size. The
   G(F)(R) values are influenced rather mildly by the concrete compressive
   strength. For d(max) = 25 mm and normal concrete compressive strength,
   rougher crack surfaces are observed and higher G(F)(R) values are
   obtained, compared to those for d(max) = 6 mm. Symptoms of a possible
   snap-back instability were detected in the load-LPD diagram of the beams
   with the shot rer notch a(o) = 0.1 d. Depending on the relative
   stiffness of the beam and testing frame, snap-back may occur in the
   load-stroke diagram, Extraneous influence of the load actuator stroke
   signal on the measured LPD may result in an `'apparent'' instability in
   the load-LPD diagram that may be inadvertently presumed to be a true
   snap-back instability.}},

Abstract = {{A cDNA coding for arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19)has been
   isolated from a cDNA library of parthenocarpic young fruits of Pisum
   Sativum (L.). The deduced aminoacid sequence is 74\%, 46\% and 35\%
   identical to ADCs from tomato, oat and Escherichia coli, respectively.
   When the pea ADC cDNA was put under the control of the galactose
   inducible yeast promoter CYC1-GAL10 and introduced into Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, it conferred galactose-regulated expression of the,ADC
   activity. The ADC activity expressed in S. cerevisiae was inhibited 99\%
   by alpha-DL-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA), a specific inhibitor of ADC
   activity. No activity was detected in the untransformed S. cerevisiae,
   nor when it was transformed with an antisense ADC construct. This
   provides direct evidence that the ADC cDNA from pea encoded a
   functional, specific ADC activity and that S. cerevisiae is able to
   process correctly the protein. In the pea plant, gene expression of
   the;ADC is high in young developing tissues like shoot tips, young
   leaflets and flower buds. Fully expanded leaflets and roots have much
   lower, but still detectable, levels of the ADC transcript. In the ovary
   and fruit, they are developmentally regulated, showing high levels of
   expression during the early stages of fruit growth, which in pea is
   mainly due to cell expansion. The observed changes in the steady-state
   levels of ADC mRNA alone, however, cannot account for the differences in
   ADC activity suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must be acting.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of structure factor phases determined from electron
   microscope images is determined mainly by the level of statistical

   It is shown here that Fourier transforms of small image fields of purple
   membrane (a two-dimensional crystal consisting of bacteriorhodopsin and
   endogenous lipids) can be combined to provide the same quality of phases
   as are obtained from Fourier transforms of large image fields of the
   same total area. Although Fourier transforms of such small image fields
   are statistically significant only at lower resolution, the data from
   many such image fields can be averaged at the calculated positions of
   high-resolution reciprocal lattice points to give accurate phases. More
   specifically, when images of a size that can be recorded with CCD
   cameras are processed individually, key parameters including lattice
   vectors, defocus, crystal and beam tilts, and common phase origin can be

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined gender differences on three measures of
   thought disturbance among patients with schizophrenia and the relation
   between thought disturbance and social competency. Method: Fifty-three
   male and 34 female patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to
   the DSM-III-R criteria were assessed on measures of thought disturbance:
   subscales of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS),
   subscales of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Ego
   Impairment Index. Gender differences on the three measures of thought
   disturbance and the relation of these measures to demographic variables
   and other variables, such as social competency, were examined. Results:
   Male and female schizophrenic patients demonstrated similar degrees of
   thought disturbance on the pertinent subscales of the SAPS and the BPRS,
   but the male schizophrenic patients had scores showing greater
   impairment on the Ego Impairment Index. Furthermore, a relationship
   between thought disturbance and social competency was confirmed.
   Conclusions: These findings support other studies in which female
   patients were found to have a `'milder'' form of schizophrenia,
   generally characterized by better social functioning, than their male
   counterparts. The literature regarding gender-related differences in
   thought disturbance in schizophrenia has been unclear and complicated by
   design issues such as obtaining adequate samples of subjects and
   optimizing measurement selection. The findings of this study suggest
   that use of a converging-measures strategy allows a better assessment of
   thought disturbance in severely ill schizophrenic patients and an
   understanding of the importance of thought disorder with respect to
   gender-related patterns of clinical characteristics, such as social
   competency.}},

Abstract = {{Anordiol(2 alpha,17 alpha-diethynyl-A-nor-5 alpha-androstane-2 beta,17
   beta-diol) has been variously characterized as an estrogen and as an
   antiestrogen. To more completely understand the pharmacological
   properties of this contraceptive steroid, simultaneous responses were
   studied in uterine, vaginal, and hepatic tissues. Rats received 4 daily
   sc injections with either anordiol, clomiphene citrate (CC), or the
   vehicle alone (C+) starting on the first day of pseudopregnancy. Uteri
   were traumatized on day 4 of pseudopregnancy, and rats were sacrificed 5
   days later. A pseudopregnant group without uterine trauma served as a
   negative control (C-). Mean uterine weights per animal and cytosolic
   estrogen (E(c)R) and progesterone (P(c)R) receptor activities per g of
   DNA were all 5- to 7-fold greater in the C+ group than in the other
   groups (all p<0.05). However, anordiol and CC suppressed uterine weight
   without suppressing the stromal proliferative response; the DNA content
   of the uteri of anordiol and CC-treated rats was similar to that of C+
   rats. Vaginal tissue exhibited estrogenic responses to anordiol and CC
   with an increase in epithelial stratification compared to the C+ and C-
   groups even though no difference in levels of E(c)R/g of DNA were
   expressed 5 days after the last antiestrogen dose. Binding affinities
   and serum E(2) and progesterone (P) concentrations were not
   statistically different among the groups. In conclusion, anordiol
   produced responses in the uterus and vagina of the pseudopregnant rat
   which were indistinguishable from those of CC, and, therefore, we
   conclude that anordiol acts on these tissues as an antiestrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Impaired vitamin K metabolism is associated with under-carboxylation of
   the non-collagenous bone-matrix protein osteocalcin, which is required
   in its fully carboxylated state for normal bone formation.
   Post-menopausal women have under-carboxylation of osteocalcin which
   increases with age and is marked in the elderly. A similarly marked
   degree of impaired carboxylation occurs during coumarin therapy, and a
   key question is whether this may lead to accelerated loss of bone mass
   which is clinically important. We measured axial and peripheral bone
   mineral density (BMD) in 40 male patients on warfarin and 40 controls
   individually matched for age, disease and other drug therapy. A
   consistent trend for reduced BMD at all sites was observed in the
   warfarin-treated patients. This was particularly marked in the
   cancellous bone at the distal radius (9\% reduction, p = 0.023) and at
   the cancellous rich lumbar spine site (10.4\% reduction, p < 0.004). No
   significant relationship was observed between warfarin dose,
   International Normalized Ratio (INR) or duration of therapy and bone
   density. Because of the biochemical similarity, this study provides a
   new lead on post-menopausal osteoporosis, and supports tbe hypothesis
   that impaired carboxylation of osteocalcin plays a role in the
   pathogenesis of bone loss in the elderly through deficiency in vitamin K
   metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Solvation of lauric acid {[}CH3(CH2)(1)0COOH] has been investigated in
   different solvents (apolar, polar-aprotic, and protic solvents) by
   infrared absorption and Raman scattering in a large molar ratio range in
   order to investigate the intermolecular interactions between fatty acids
   and molecules of different types of solvents. Temperature effects on
   these mixtures have also been investigated between 24 and 95 degrees C.
   We have especially concentrated on the carbonyl stretching region
   (between 1600 and 1800 cm(-1)), the hydroxyl stretching region (between
   2500 and 3600 cm(-1)), and the C-H stretching region (2800-3000 cm(-1)).
   Chloroform behaves, with respect to lauric acid, almost as an apolar
   solvent. In acetone and in DMSO, a dynamical equilibrium between both
   cyclic dimers and II-bonded lauric acid molecules with solvent molecules
   seems to occur, the proportion of the two species depending on the
   lauric acid concentration. Cyclic dimers appear for a lauric acid : DMSO
   molar ratio x > 0.5 (x > 0.2 in acetone). In alcohols, cyclic dimers are
   present from x approximate to 0.2. For x < 0.2, two different complexes
   exist, in contrast with results from recent literature. These may be
   monosolvate and disolvate complexes. When the alcohol is deuterated,
   exchange between hydroxyl groups of both components is observed.
   Finally, Raman scattering appears as a powerful tool to clarify IR
   spectra in the case of solvated carboxylic acids.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism for a blunted thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) response
   to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in alcoholics is not known. We
   performed a combined TRH and gonadoliberin stimulation test on three
   well-defined groups of nondepressed alcoholic men. Group A comprised
   patients with acute withdrawal symptoms (n = 28), group B patients
   abstinent for 5-8 weeks (n = 29) and group C patients who had been
   abstinent for >2 years (n = 16). Twenty-two healthy male volunteers were
   used for comparison. A blunted TSH response to TRH (delta TSH < 5 mu
   U/1) occurred only in groups A (39\%) and B (17\%). In group A delta TSH
   showed a significant negative correlation with the severity of
   withdrawal symptoms and a significant positive correlation with serum
   magnesium levels. In group B, patients with a family history of
   alcoholism had significantly lower delta TSH levels than those without
   such a family history. Groups did not differ with respect to basal and
   delta prolactin, and TSH responses were not significantly associated
   with vitamin deficiency, cortisol levels or free thyroid hormone levels.
   We conclude that TRH stimulation test blunting appears to be related to
   factors operating in the withdrawal state and improves with continued
   abstinence. A possible role of genetic factors and serum magnesium needs
   to be further explored.}},

Abstract = {{The study of phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to
   express different phenotypes as environments change, is becoming a
   central focus of ecological genetics and evolutionary theory. To help
   address the most pressing questions about plasticity (its genetic
   control, ecological relevance, and macroevolutionary consequences) we
   advocate the use of Arabidopsis thaliana (and eventually other related
   species of the same genus) as a model system. In this study we present
   experimental data concerning: (a) the extent of reaction norm variation
   to two levels of nutrients in a worldwide collection of 26 A, thaliana
   populations; and (b) the existence of multivariate associations among
   key phenotypic characters, and their reaction to changes in the
   environment. We found significant among-population genetic variation for
   eight of the nine traits measured, as well as plasticity in four traits.
   Five traits showed significant differences in genetic variation between
   the two environments. The multivariate association of the nine traits
   defines four major groups of covarying characters, each of which may be
   plastic or not, depending on the particular population. The use of
   populations that can be easily obtained by any researcher, because they
   are part of a worldwide collection, implies that it will be easy to
   build on our results during future investigations of phenotypic
   plasticity in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The fluid mechanics associated with the flow of a ceramic slurry during
   the tape casting process is analyzed in this paper. The rheology of the
   slurry is described in generalized terms using the Ostwald-de Waele
   power-law equation, tau = m\textbackslash{}gamma\textbackslash{}(n),
   where the yield constant, m, and the shear rate exponent, n, are
   empirical functions of the particle loading in the slurry, the particle
   shape and size distributions in the slurry, and the slurry temperature.
   The effects of an imposed pressure gradient due to the height of the
   slurry in the casting head, as well as those of the drag due to the
   moving substrate on the slurry flow, are accounted for by modeling the
   slurry discharge as a generalized planar Couette flow. The model yields
   an analytical expression for the tape thickness as a function of various
   slurry and process parameters. The influence of the physical parameters
   of the slurry and the geometrical dimensions of the casting head on the
   tape thickness are examined in the context of a commonly used BaTiO3
   system. It is shown that the various parametric effects may be
   represented concisely in the form of a nondimensional design plot
   employing (a) a flow parameter, alpha, (b) a shrinkage parameter, beta,

Abstract = {{Alpha activity occurring during sleep is generally considered to reflect
   arousal processes and a shift toward wakefulness. This long-standing
   interpretation is based on physiological and behavioural arousal
   correlates of alpha activity presumed to have an occipital focus. In
   addition to the application of this interpretation to sleep/wake state
   determinations, there have been reports of nonrefreshing or
   nonrestorative sleep in clinical populations exhibiting dramatic amounts
   of alpha intrusion during sleep in the absence of awakening. Reports of
   the presence of alpha activity during sleep in normal subjects without
   sleep disruption or complaints of daytime sleepiness call into question
   the interpretation that this activity is associated with arousal. A
   re-examination of this literature, incorporating the results from recent
   investigations employing multi-site EEG recordings, electronic
   processing and source dipole analyses of this activity, suggests the
   existence of alpha activity which differs in generation site (thalamus),
   scalp distribution (frontal-central), and behavioural correlates (e.g.
   enhancement to stimulation during wakefulness, concentration in the
   first-half of the night during sleep, and absence of sleep disturbance)
   from occipital alpha activity. Such marked differences in defining
   characteristics imply different functional correlates for these
   activities. In this context, it is proposed that this fronto-central
   alpha activity is associated with sleep-maintaining processes which may
   be enhanced in response to sleep-disturbing events.}},

   mixture of closely related variants-quasispecies. The ratio of
   non-silent to silent nucleotide mutations registered in the S genes/N

Abstract = {{In insect parasitoids, the mating structure of the population depends on
   the emergence pattern of adults and on their behaviour after emergence.
   In order to study some aspects of these characteristics in four species
   of egg parasitoid of the genus Trichogramma, laboratory experiments
   using automatic video analysis are performed. Adult emergence is
   concentrated in the morning, with an earlier time for males. The
   variability of the time of emergence is under genetic control. The
   relationships between the emergence pattern and the locomotor activity
   are considered by measuring individually: first, the delay between the
   emergence and the first locomotion which is significantly greater in
   females than in males and, second, the activity of newly emerged males,
   which is maximum at the time of the emergence of females. The locomotor
   activity is influenced by mating; mated females are much more active
   than virgin ones, mated males are less active than virgin ones. The
   adaptive values of the rhythmicity of emergence and of protandry are
   discussed together with their relationship with the patterns of
   locomotor activity. The results are also considered with respect to
   mating strategies in insect parasitoids; they actually support the
   hypothesis of mating occurring principally among individuals native to
   the same host patch in Trichogramma species.}},

Abstract = {{New computer technologies to aid group communication and decision making

   groups using the GDSS with groups using the same procedural structures
   incorporated in the GDSS manually and with groups using no procedural
   structures. A flexible phase mapping method was employed to map group
   decision paths. The resulting set of seven decision paths varied in both
   sequence and number of decision phases. An optimal matching procedure
   was used to compute similarity measures among the 40 paths, and cluster
   analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to generate an empirical
   taxonomy of decision paths. Results indicated that the nature of
   decision paths varied both across the three conditions and within
   conditions. The decision path types were also related to three outcome
   variables: consensus change, perceived decision qualify, and decision
   scheme satisfaction. Results indicated that those decision paths that

Abstract = {{As a model for understanding the appearance of narrow lines in positron
   singles and electron-positron sum energy spectra found in heavy-ion
   collisions close to the Coulomb barrier, we propose the following
   scenario: After the Coulomb scattering both heavy nuclei are very likely
   in low (less than or equal to 2 MeV) excited states, which subsequently
   decay by correlated monoenergetic (e(+),e(-)) pair conversion (MPC) and
   internal conversion (IC) processes thereby producing an asymptotic
   (e(+),e(-)) pair with the sum energy of the two nuclear transitions. We
   only consider processes where the two nuclear transitions are correlated
   by an intermediate bound electron state (the 1 sigma orbital) of the
   nuclear scattering system. Since this orbital is only weakly time
   dependent and persists for similar to 10(-19) s, we obtain rather
   narrow, Gamma(e)+(e)- similar to 20 keV, sum energy lines for the
   (e(+)e(-)) pair from this process. We, however, find that correlated
   EO-EO-transitions have cross sections at least 8 orders of magnitude too
   small and can safely be excluded as the cause of the narrow sum energy
   spectra observed experimentally. A rough estimate of the cross section
   indicates that correlated E1-E1 transitions occur with a substantially
   larger cross section and should thus be investigated in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The land snails (and semi-terrestrial molluscs) of the four islands that
   comprise the Pitcairn group are reviewed and the indigenous species
   illustrated. The strictly terrestrial molluscan faunas from the two
   atolls (Oeno and Ducie) are poor, like many other atolls in the Pacific.
   Each supports less than six species with wide geographical ranges. In
   contrast the terrestrial molluscan fauna from Henderson Island, an
   uplifted atoll, is more diverse with at least 16 species belonging to
   seven families. Over half these taxa appear to be endemic, at least at
   the level of sub-species. Two species of semi-terrestrial molluscs have
   also been found on Henderson. Analyses of archaeological deposits in
   caves near the North Beach have revealed that at least a further six
   species of land snail formerly occurred on Henderson. The volcanic
   island of Pitcairn, the only island in the group still inhabited,
   supports the greatest number of terrestrial molluscs. Twenty-six species
   of land snail (and one semi-terrestrial pulmonate) were found living
   there during the recent expedition and a further three taxa were
   recognized amongst museum material. At least seven of these species are
   thought to be recent adventives and a further three are likely to have
   been prehistoric introductions. One Henderson (Georissa hendersoni) and
   three Pitcairn endemics (Pacificella filica, Sinployea pitcairnensis and
   Diastole tenuistriata) are formally described as new species. Some of
   the Pitcairn endemics occur in very restricted areas (less than a
   hectare) and it is important that measures should be taken to prevent
   the spread of invasive plants, such as rose-apple, that would threaten
   their survival. (C) 1995 The Linnean Society of London}},

Abstract = {{The annual variation of the dissolved silica contributions to the ria of
   Vigo and its spatial distributions on the silicate sediment is
   considered using a box model. During winter, the silicate freshwater
   flux is high, about 10 mol Si s(-1). This mixes with the ria water and
   is exported to the ocean. During the rest of the year, the most
   important source of dissolved silicate is the subsurface incoming flux
   of marine water to the ria which provides from 52\% to 65\% of the
   total. In these seasons, the redissolution of biogenic silicate is the
   second source and causes up to 46\% of silicate inputs to the photic
   zone. The utilisation of dissolved silicate by the diatoms was 1 mol Si
   s(-1), but increased to 11 mol Si s(-1) in the event of upwelling. The
   abundance of silicate in sediments in different parts of the ria of Vigo
   is a consequence of the cited fluxes. The bottom of the inner middle
   zone in the ria receives diatoms in spring and summer when no upwelling
   occurs (from 50 to 120 mg Si m(-2) d(-1)), and silicate is resupended
   due to sediment stirring during winter. The external mid-zone of the ria
   is richer in remains of diatoms and opal, there being no resuspension
   and sedimentation is greater than in other areas during upwelling events
   (172 mg Si m(-2) d(-1)), as indicated by the relative abundance of
   Chaetoceros spp. spores.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of the Earth's thermal history (the mechanisms of heat
   energy and heat flow change in time) has been done based on the
   previously estimated evolution of magmatism during geological stage of
   the planet progress considering some initial conditions. The
   regularities obtained give evidence of the Earth's thermal hystory
   initiated by a short and intensive impulse quickly produces an
   autooscillating thermal flow. Such thermal flow is well preserved during
   subsequent hystory and accompanied by exponential decreasing of heat
   energy with time. Two levels of cycles of the heat flow oscillation can
   be distinguished leading to mega- and macrocycles. We suggest the
   cyclisity was caused by transformation of the heat energy into another
   kind of energy. The megacycles are caused heat transformation into
   connective flows energy and secondary homogenization of mantle, whereas
   the macrocycles - by the energy transformation at the mantle/core
   boundary leading to plumes formation. Ideas was supported on the quick
   Earth's accretion (during approximate to 10 Ma) and melting during the
   first approximate to 500 Ma. The regularities obtained in the
   reconstruction show correlation with the known geological, geochemical

Abstract = {{Since the creation of the saprobic system in Germany in the beginning of
   this century by Kolkwitz \& Marsson, a great number of biological
   methods for the measurement of the quality of running waters has been
   elaborated. Directly stemming or simply derived from the saprobic
   system, these methods are essentially based on the study of the
   invertebrate fauna. However, starting in the 50s, methods were proposed
   which are based on the study of the algal, and more particularly diatom,
   flora. The major part of these methods engendered numerical indices.
   Indices of Japanese origin were tested in France, unsuccessfully because
   of the numerous endemic forms they use. Among the European indices, the
   IPS elaborated by CEMAGREF, seems to be the most performing one. It uses
   all the species present and accounts for organic pollution, real and
   potential eutrophication as well as water salinity. This index is,
   however, not easily applied, as it requires high-level knowledge in
   systematics. This is why an index similar in formula was proposed
   already 10 years ago, for wider application by the services in charge of
   the management of water quality. This index proved to be perfectible,
   and a pratical diatom index was recently proposed for the North of
   France. This index is based on the identification of 45 genera and 87
   species. The elaboration of a national practical diatom index is at
   present underway in the framework of an inter-Agencies study. This study
   should result in the proposal of a complete methodology including
   sampling and sample treatment techniques, appropriate identification
   keys and index-based calculation software. The index will probably be
   based on the determination on a species level of a limited quantity of
   species considered as indicators. A training course for the application
   of this index is already programmed within the framework of the
   Inter-Agencies studies.}},

Abstract = {{A cross-sectional study of vertebral morphometry in 449 unscreened
   postmenopausal women, from the ages of 40 to 80, is reported. The wedge
   angles of thoracic vertebrae T4-12 were found to increase exponentially
   as a function of age, up to 70 years. In addition to age, the wedging
   phenomenon was found to be accentuated by increased bone turnover due to
   low calcium intake, reduced physical activity, each successive delivery,
   and breast feeding. Most of these variables were not correlated with
   isolated vertebral wedge angles, but rather with the sum of them (Sigma,
   Sigma), assumed to assess the impact of those variables on thoracic
   kyphosis. In a subset of women, Sigma was found to be inversely
   correlated with low spinal mineral density at L2-4. T-11 and T-12 were
   the vertebrae most frequently deformed (wedge angle exceeding mean +/- 3
   SD in a group of 50 young healthy women, 25-45 years old). The
   distribution of deformed vertebrae was found to be significantly
   different from those qualified as `'fractured'' according to Kleerekoper
   et al.'s (1984) and Melton et al.'s (1989) criteria. The overall
   information afforded by past and present data indicates that in
   postmenopausal women, vertebral deformation may occur with the help of
   mechanical solicitations plus high bone remodeling rates, as well as by
   structural collapse (fracture). The information obtained does not allow
   one to quantify the relative contribution of each set of factors to the
   wedging phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects on CSF dynamics at the foramen magnum and the
   clinical significance of the abnormal tonsillar motion in 14 patients
   with Chiari type I malformation and 14 control subjects using cine
   phase-contrast MRI. Dynamic MRI consisted of axial and sagittal cine
   phase-contrast sequences. CSF and tonsillar motion were qualitatively
   and quantitatively evaluated, and the subarachnoid space at the foramen
   magnum measured. In Chiari patients, cine phase-contrast MRI detected
   the abnormal pulsatile motion of the cerebellar tonsils, which produced
   a selective obstruction of CSF flow from the cranial cavity to the
   spine. The amplitude of the tonsillar pulsation and the severity of the
   arachnoid space reduction were associated with the symptom of
   cough-strain headache, but not with the presence of syringomyelia. The
   finding of abnormal valve dynamics of the cerebellar hernia revealed by
   cine phase-contrast MRI conforms to the pathophysiologic mechanisms
   suggested in pressure register studies and opens a new possibility in
   the presurgical assessment of Chiari patients with exertional symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Reported are five cases of an unusual histological variant of glomus
   tumor that we have designated epithelioid glomus tumor, Unlike
   conventional glomus tumors, which consist of small polygonal cells with
   dark round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, the epithelioid lesions were
   composed of large polygonal to spindle-shaped cells with abundant
   eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, irregularly shaped nuclei: The cells
   had both epithelioid and myoid qualities, Two of the cases studied were
   predominantly epithelioid, with small remnants of conventional glomus
   tumor at the periphery. The three other lesions were purely epithelioid,
   Epithelioid glomus tumors are of particular importance because they may
   be mistaken for other lesions histologically, Both benign and malignant
   epithelial lesions may be considered in the differential diagnosis;
   spindle-cell lesions, such as schwannoma, leiomyoma, hemangiopericytoma,
   and others, are in the histological differential diagnosis,
   Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies indicated that
   epithelioid glomus tumors had characteristics identical to those of
   conventional glomus tumors: the cells showed features consistent with
   smooth muscle derivation, The epithelioid areas frequently exhibited
   cytological atypicality-features that we believe to be a manifestation
   of cellular degeneration or senescence (analogous to `'ancient'' change
   in schwannomas or symplastic change in leiomyomas) rather than evidence
   of neoplastic progression, Simple surgical excision seems to have been
   curative (mean duration of follow-up of 4 years in the three cases in
   which such information was available). To our knowledge, no similar
   cases have previously been reported. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders

Abstract = {{The influence of microstructure on the tensile properties and the plane
   strain fracture toughness (K-Ic) of unalloyed austempered ductile cast
   iron (ADI) was examined in room temperature ambient atmosphere. The
   crack growth mechanism during fracture toughness tests was determined
   through detailed fractographic studies. Compact tension and round
   cylindrical specimens were prepared from unalloyed ADI and were given
   four different austempering heat treatments to produce four different
   microstructures. Tensile properties and fracture toughness of these four
   differently heat-treated materials as well as cast materials were
   determined as per relevant ASTM standards.
   The results of the present investigation demonstrate that the fracture
   toughness of unalloyed ADI increases with increase in volume fraction of
   ferrite in the matrix and reaches a peak when the ferrite content of the
   matrix is around 65\%. Both yield and ultimate tensile strength of the
   unalloyed ADI was found to increase with increase in volume fraction of
   ferrite in the matrix. The ductility of ADI, on the other hand, was
   found to increase with increase in volume fraction of austenite in the
   matrix. The crack growth mechanism was found to be predominantly by the
   microvoid coalescence. The crack path appears to connect the graphite
   nodules along the way.}},

Abstract = {{Different potato genotypes expressing extreme resistance to potato virus

   S. vernei is conferred by Rx genes (Rx(cha), Rx(cur), Rx(juz), and
   Rx(vrn), respectively) that employ the same mechanism of interaction
   with the PVX coat protein as Rx, Rx(acl), and RX(adg). Although S.

   with surface and not bulk properties; hence surface characterization of
   these implants is critical for their clinical success. A goal of this
   study was to characterize the Ti (ASTM F67) samples after conducting
   three different surface treatments. in this article, the results of
   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy performed on
   surface-modified Ti samples, and also samples immersed in
   alpha-modification of Eagle's medium and in phosphate buffered saline
   solution after different surface treatments, are presented. Surface
   analysis prior to immersion revealed an amorphous oxide layer on all the
   samples similar in composition to TiO2. No significant difference in
   oxide thicknesses was observed. After exposure to the two media an
   amorphous or finely crystalline Ca-P layer was exhibited on all Ti
   surfaces, having a chemistry similar to brushite. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{The carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of rabbit cytochrome P450 2C2 are
   markedly different from those of other rabbit cytochrome P450 2C family
   members and, substitution of the equivalent amino acids of other
   cytochrome P450s can confer novel steroid hydroxylase activity to P450
   2C2 while the normal lauric acid hydroxylase activity is retained. To
   determine the basis for the novel steroid hydroxylase activity, amino
   acids of cytochrome P450 2C1 were substituted for those of cytochrome
   P450 2C2 and the mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. There are 13
   differences between the sequences of cytochrome P450 2C2 and P450 2C1 in
   this region, including five nonconservative exchanges of charged and
   uncharged amino acids, However, only substitution of valine for Ser-473
   increased steroid hydroxylase activity to the maximum level expected in
   a modified cytochrome P450 2C2, which contained additional substitutions
   in the 368-388 region to maximize progesterone hydroxylase activity.
   Introduction of this single substitution into cytochrome P450 2C2
   resulted in 21-progesterone hydroxylase activity similar to that
   resulting from substitution of all 28 carboxyl-terminal cytochrome P450
   2C1 amino acids. None of the substitutions, with one exception,
   substantially affected either lauric acid hydroxylase activity or the
   amount of immunologically reactive cytochrome P450 that was expressed. A
   glycine substitution for Val-477 reduced activity of both lauric acid
   hydroxylase and progesterone hydroxylase and altered the
   regioselectivity of the hydroxylation for both, Homology modeling of
   cytochrome P450 2C2, based on the cytochrome bacterial P450cam sequence,
   indicated that the side chains of residue 473 and the other five
   residues previously shown to affect substrate specificity face the
   substrate pocket. For four of the six residues, smaller and more
   hydrophobic residues increased progesterone relative to lauric acid
   hydroxylation.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the hypothesis that the D-1 subtype of DA
   receptors is critically involved in reward-related learning. The effects
   of SKF 38393, a D-1-specific agonist, on amphetamine-produced
   enhancement of responding for conditioned reward were tested. We exposed
   69 male Wistar rats to an experimental design consisting of three
   phases. The preexposure phase consisted of five sessions during which
   the rats were exposed to an operant chamber containing two levers. One
   lever produced a lights-off stimulus (3 s) and the other a tone stimulus
   (3 s). This was followed by four conditioning sessions during which the
   levers were removed and the rats were exposed to pairings of the
   lights-off stimulus with food. This phase was followed by two test
   sessions during which the levers were present and the number of
   responses made on each lever was calculated as a ratio of the number of
   responses made during the preexposure phase. A group receiving saline
   during the test sessions showed a higher ratio of responding for the
   lights-off stimulus than the tone stimulus, demonstrating that the
   lights-off stimulus had become a conditioned reward. Amphetamine {[}2.0
   mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP), 5 min before the test] enhanced
   responding specifically on the lever producing the conditioned reward.
   Groups receiving SKF 38393 (5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg, IP, 5 min before
   the test) failed to show significantly greater responding for the
   lights-off stimulus than the tone, indicating a reduction or elimination
   of the conditioned reward effect. Moreover, SKF 38393 dose dependently
   reduced the amphetamine-produced enhancement of responding for
   conditioned reward. The possible role for D-1 receptors in
   reward-related learning is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An autochthonous case of epididymal histoplasmosis masquerading as

   patient's main complaints were painful epididymal swelling, occasional
   fever and cough. He was treated successfully by excision of epididymis
   and vas deferens combined with amphotericin B therapy. This is believed
   to be the first case of epididymal histoplasmosis to be reported outside
   the American continent and the fourth of its type reported in the
   English literature. The case is also noteworthy in that H. capsulatum
   was isolated for the first time from semen, and it underlines the

Abstract = {{The stability properties of six natural mutants of the TEM-1
   beta-lactamase have been studied. The glutamate to lysine substitution
   at positions 104 and 240 stabilize the enzyme, Conversely, the G238S
   mutant's decreased stability might reflect an altered conformation of
   the active site and thus be related to the modified substrate profile,
   The relative stability of the R164S and R164H mutants is explained by
   the formation of a hydrogen bond between these residues and Asp-179
   conferring a somewhat different structure to the omega loop and thus
   also explaining the extended substrate profile of these mutants. The
   loss of stability of the R164H mutant with increasing pH values can be
   explained by the titration of a hydrogen bond between the N delta of
   His-164 and the O delta of Asp-179, The properties of the G238S + E104K
   double mutant which is the most active against third-generation
   cephalosporins result from a balance of destabilizing and stabilizing
   substitutions, and their effects seem to be additive, The behavior of
   the R164S + E240K mutant might be explained on the basis of a similar
   compensation phenomenon. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), pheromone trap capture, larval
   infestation and adult emergence was monitored in corn in the Lower Rio
   Grande Valley (26.2 degrees N, 98.0 degrees W), Uvalde (29,2 degrees N,
   99.7 degrees W), and Lubbock (33.5 degrees N, 101.8 degrees W), Texas.
   On a regional scale, larval infestation of fruiting corn and emergence
   from pupae excavated from maturing corn fields provided discrete
   population events that were well separated by location. In most
   instances trap capture of adults appears, on a local scale, to be
   related to these two events. However, in early season, the variability
   observed in trap capture and larval infestations on vegetative corn
   within regions provide difficulty in temporally defining the occurrence
   of meaningful events related to these variables across regions. When
   ambient air temperatures and wind velocity occurring during trap capture
   peaks were compared to those occurring two days prior and two days after
   after the peaks only minor correlations were observed. The implications
   are that trap capture values did not abruptly change with either
   significantly warmer or cooler temperatures or with increased or
   decreased zonal or meridional wind speed. We conclude that the
   atmospheric factors used as independent predictor variables were not
   correlated with the response of corn earworm males to pheromone traps,
   or with the long-distance atmospheric transport of populations into the
   trapping area. Our data further show that simulated nocturnal within
   regions, provide a mechanism for determining the atmospheric systems
   available to transport moths from one region to another.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of nucleated erythrocytes in maternal circulation provides
   a potential source for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. We have
   evaluated the use of a three-stage procedure to determine the number of
   cells that are of fetal rather than maternal origin. First, monoclonal
   antibodies specific for CD45 and CD14 were used in conjunction with a
   magnetic (MACS) column to deplete unwanted leukocytes from maternal
   blood. This was followed by a positive MACS enrichment for nucleated
   erythrocytes, using an anti-CD71 (transferrin receptor) monoclonal
   antibody. To discriminate between fetal nucleated erythrocytes and those
   of maternal origin, enriched fractions were simultaneously stained with
   an anti-fetal haemoglobin (HbF) antibody and hybridized with probes
   specific for X and Y chromosomes. Samples were then subjected to blind
   analysis along with negative control samples from non-pregnant
   volunteers. Using this dual analysis, we were able to determine that
   less than one nucleated erythrocyte per ml of maternal blood was of
   fetal origin. Small numbers of these fetal cells were found in 87.5\% of
   pregnancies, ranging from 6 to 35 weeks gestational age. Comparison of
   HbF and X/Y probe data also suggests that the fetal cells are less
   suitable for fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis than
   similar preparations from other sources.}},

Abstract = {{In the general frame of analysing the interactions amongst the

   to assess the integrity of a defective structure (such as fracture
   mechanics), the aim of the paper is to analyse and compare, in terms of

   trials to acheive assessments of capabilities and limitations.
   A structural integrity/fracture mechanics approach for evaluating and
   comparing results from non destructive techniques is presented. Safety
   factors can be associated to flaws detected and characterized by
   inspections (estimated flaws) and to flaws actually present (reference
   flaws). The mismatch between safety factors associated to estimated
   flaws and safety factors associated to reference flaws can be used to
   assess capabilities and limitations of procedures and techniques in use
   for inspections.
   As an example, to show how the above procedure is applied and its
   potential as a method of data evaluation and comparison, the NDE results
   produced by the PISC (project for the inspection of steel components)
   activity have been considered.}},

   to the other sources (p < 0.05), Self-reporting of the duration of
   recent exposure was a proxy measure of the integrated dose as assessed

Abstract = {{After successful stent implantation, the residual luminal diameter of
   the stented vessel is usually smaller than the maximal stent-expanded
   balloon diameter. The goal of this study was to determine whether
   immediate vessel diameter recoil after Palmaz-Schatz stenting is
   affected by the final expanding balloon diameter used during stent
   deployment.
   Single Palmaz-Schatz balloon expandable stents were successfully placed
   in 108 stenotic lesions. There were 68 patients with 75 saphenous vein
   graft (SVG) and 30 patients with 33 native coronary artery lesions,
   including 26 restenotic and 82 de novo occlusive (> 50\% diameter
   stenosis) lesions. Quantitative coronary angiography was used for the
   assessment of stent recoil, defined as the difference between the
   minimal diameter of the fully expanded balloon and the postprocedure
   minimal lumen diameter divided by minimal diameter of the fully expanded
   balloon.
   A strong correlation (r = 0.94) was found between the minimal diameter
   of the fully expanded balloon and poststenting minimal lumen diameter.
   Immediate recoil was 11.3 +/- 7.5\%, responsible on an average for 0.4
   +/- 0.2-mm acute lumen loss. Recoil was less in SVG than in coronary
   arteries (9.7 +/- 6.6\% vs. 14.0 +/- 7.8\%; P = 0.004, and 0.3 +/- 0.2
   vs. 0.4 +/- 0.2 mm; p = 0.01), Lesions were divided into four subgroups,
   based on the final stent expanding balloon diameter: (1) less than or
   equal to 3.0 mm (n = 33); (2) > 3 less than or equal to 3.5 mm (n = 43);
   (3) > 3.5 less than or equal to 4 mm (n = 23); and (4) > 4 mm (n = 9),
   For the four subgroups, the percentage recoil values were 15.0 +/- 5.7,
   10.4 +/- 8.2, 9.0 +/- 5.4, and 4.7 +/- 2.0, respectively (P < 0.001).
   Mean values of diameter stenosis, lesion length, maximal balloon
   pressure, balloon-to-artery ratio, relative vessel stretch, and absolute
   recoil were not statistically different.
   Immediate vascular recoil in single implanted Palmaz-Schatz stent is a
   function of the final expanding balloon diameter, with recoil larger at
   small-balloon diameters and almost eliminated at large inflation
   diameters. This finding could contribute to less acute gain, increased
   restenosis, and higher stent thrombosis rates after stenting vessels of
   < 3-mm diameter. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{An example of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is the facility
   location problem, in which n facilities are assigned, at minimum cost,
   to n sites. Between each pair of facilities, there is a given amount of
   flow, contributing a cost equal to the product of the flow and the
   distance between sites to which the facilities are assigned. Proving
   optimality of QAPs has been limited to instances having fewer than 20
   facilities, largely because known lower bounds are weak. We compute
   lower bounds for a wide range of QAPs using a linear programming-based
   lower bound studied by Z. Drezner (1995). On the majority of QAPs
   tested, a new best known lower bound is computed. On 87\% of the
   instances, we produced the best known lower bound. On several instances,
   including some having more the 20 facilities, the lower bound is tight.
   The linear programs, which can be large even for small QAPs, are solved
   with an interior point code that uses a preconditioned conjugate

Abstract = {{An experimental laboratory investigation has been carried out into the
   hot gluing of solid wood layered boards made out of 5.3 mm thick
   solid-wood lamellas, the latter being produced by the lengthwise veneer
   cutting technique, the object of the research being to determine some of
   the reasons (humidity of wood before heating, temperature of wood before
   cutting into lamellas, and temperature and pressure during the gluing of
   boards) for the permanent thickness loss which occurs during gluing.
   Spruce wood (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was used in the experimental
   tests. Before cutting into lamellas, this wood was classified into two
   humidity groups, and heated to three different temperatures. The dried
   lamellas were used, after suitable preparation, for the two outer
   layers, which were glued, together with a middle layer of sawn lamellas,
   by the hot gluing process. A total of 162 laboratory boards, of length
   500 mm, width 475 mm and thickness from 24 to 25 mm, were hot glued,
   using melamin-urea-formaldehyde glue, at three different gluing
   temperatures and three different gluing pressures. Regression analysis
   of the measured results of thickness loss showed that the influence of
   the studied factors on thickness loss was linear, and that thickness
   loss depends the most on gluing pressure, followed by gluing
   temperature. It was also found that a higher wood humidity results in a
   slightly greater thickness loss than the wood's temperature before
   cutting into lamellas.}},

Abstract = {{Toe lipidic polymer, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), is found in the
   plasma membranes of Escherichia coli complexed to calcium polyphosphate
   (CaPPi). The composition, location, and putative structure of the
   polymer salt complexes led Reusch and Sadoff (1988) to propose that the
   complexes function as Ca2+ channels. Here we use bilayer patch-clamp
   techniques to demonstrate that voltage-activated Ca2+ channels composed
   of PHB and CaPPi are in the plasma membranes of E. coli. Single channel
   calcium currents were observed in vesicles of plasma membranes
   incorporated into planar bilayers of synthetic 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl
   phosphatidylcholine. The channels were extracted from cells and
   incorporated into bilayers, where they displayed many of the signal
   characteristics of protein Ca2+ channels: voltage-activated, selective
   for divalent over monovalent cations, permeant to Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+,
   and blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by La3+, Co2+, Cd2+, and
   Mg2+, in that order. The channel-active extract, purified by size
   exclusion chromatography, was found to contain only PHB and CaPPi. This
   composition was confirmed by the observation of comparable single
   channel currents with complexes reconstituted from synthetic CaPPi and
   PHB, isolated from E. coli. This is the first report of a biological
   non-proteinaceous calcium channel. We suggest that
   poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/calcium polyphosphate complexes are evolutionary
   antecedents of protein Ca2+ channels.}},

   enrichment programs were established according to Cross-cutting (Gender
   x Religiousness) or Convergent boundaries. Social acceptance of outgroup
   children was measured at the first session and after 6 weeks. At the
   tenth session generalization was measured. Results comparing the sixth
   session to the first, showed an increase in social acceptance towards
   religious outgroup members among ingender persons only, and for task
   oriented classes only. Generalization results indicated that the

   EXAMPLE}},

Volume = {{96}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The increasingly competitive health care environment may
   undermine effective traditional regional organizations. It is urgent to
   document the benefits of perinatal regionalization for the emerging
   health care system. We present a case study that illustrates many of the
   challenges to and benefits of perinatal regionalization in the 1990s.
   Background. The controversy in Hartford was sparked by a proposed merger
   of two major pediatric services into a full-service children's hospital.
   Community hospitals reacted with plans to upgrade their
   obstetrics/neonatal facilities toward level II (intermediate) or IIS
   (intensive) neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The fear that
   unrestricted competition would drive up overall health care costs
   prompted the hospital association and Chamber of Commerce to retain
   consultants to evaluate the number and location of regional NICU beds.
   Methods. The consultant team interviewed stakeholders in area hospitals,
   health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, businesses, state
   agencies, and community groups, and analyzed quantitative data on
   newborn discharges.
   Results. The existing system worked remarkably well for clinical care,
   training, referrals, and provider and patient satisfaction. There was a
   high level of inter-hospital collaboration and regional leadership in
   obstetrics and pediatrics, but strong and growing competition between
   their hospitals. Hospital administrators enumerated the competitive
   threats that obligated them to compete and the financial disincentives
   to support the regional structures. Business leaders and insurance
   executives emphasized the need to control costs. Analysis of discharge
   data showed marginal adequacy of NICU beds but maldistribution between
   NICUs, particularly between level III and level II units. The
   consultants recommended no new beds based on population projections,
   declining lengths of stay nationally, and substantial gains available
   from aggressive back-transport of convalescing infants. The consultants
   emphasized the need for all stakeholders to support the regional
   infrastructure (referral, transport, education, evaluation, quality
   assurance) and to modify competition when it impaired effective
   regionalization.
   Conclusions. Regionalization permits better care at lower cost, yet
   competition may disrupt this effective system. Active cooperation by
   stakeholders is vital. Substantial new research is required to define
   optimal regional organization.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To identify the types of home remedies used for common

   Design: Survey of 51 Hispanic caregivers, mostly mothers.
   Setting: A pediatric primary care facility in an urban Hispanic

   Main Outcome Measures: Remedies used for common pediatric illnesses and
   for the traditional folk illnesses: mal ojo (evil eye), empacho (blocked

   Results: A combination of herbs and pharmaceuticals was used for many
   illnesses. Teas were most commonly used for colic, upper respiratory
   tract symptoms, and abdominal pain. Pharmaceuticals were most commonly
   used for upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and diarrhea. Belief
   in folk illnesses was common: 36 (70\%) had experience with mal ojo, 33

Abstract = {{The benefit of internal mammary artery (IMA) grafting as a long-lasting
   intervention for coronary artery disease is well recognized. However,
   largely because they are less invasive, catheter based alternatives are
   frequently chosen, particularly to treat single or double vessel
   disease. To retain the advantages of the IMA graft, and to offset the
   invasiveness of conventional coronary artery bypass grafting, we
   developed a new minimally invasive method using an anterior
   mediastinotomy for treating left anterior descending (LAD) or right
   coronary artery disease, or both. Feasibility studies using 16 pigs and
   a human cadaver led to approval by the Institutional Review Board for
   use of this procedure to treat six patients (four men, two women; mean
   age, 63.8 +/- 13.6 {[}SD] yrs) who granted informed consent. Pedicle
   dissection of the IMA, using video assisted thoracoscopy if necessary,
   was made through a 2- to 3-inch horizontal anterior mediastinotomy. The
   underlying LAD artery was grafted during femoral vessel cardiopulmonary
   bypass, with cooling to 30 degrees C, induced ventricular fibrillation,
   and left ventricular venting if required. Transesophageal
   echocardiography performed after bypass showed that two patients
   maintained. normal wall motion and four had improvement from the
   original impairment. One patient suffered a recurrence of angina 4 weeks
   after the procedure; recatheterization showed an acutely angled IMA,
   subsequently corrected by balloon angioplasty. The results of follow-up
   dobutamine echocardiographic stress tests were negative in all patients.
   With this minimally invasive approach, the procedure should provide the
   benefits of IMA grafting with shorter hospital stay, more rapid
   recovery, and less overall cost.}},

Abstract = {{Although the tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) syndrome of filarial.
   aetiology has very distinctive clinical and immunological features, its
   clinical profile is not unique; other helminths sometimes induce similar

   TPE-like syndromes and found that serological tests based on detection
   of `antifilarial' immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgG4, and IgE antibodies that
   are usually considered diagnostic for filarial TPE were equally elevated
   in patients with non-filarial, TPE-like syndromes and were therefore
   unhelpful diagnostically. The apparent reasons were immunological
   hyperresponsiveness of such individuals and the shared (i.e.,
   cross-reactive) antigenicity found in the filarial antigen preparations
   used routinely for diagnosis. Because appropriate treatment for those
   different pulmonary eosinophilia conditions requires different drugs and
   management, and because delay in effective treatment results in
   significant morbidity in such patients, diagnostic capabilities must be
   improved by identifying and obtaining unique antigens that can
   serologically discriminate between filarial TPE and other similar, but

Abstract = {{Mutation of the MER2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confers meiotic
   lethality. To gain insight into the function of the Mer2 protein, we
   have carried out a detailed characterization of the mer2 null mutant.
   Genetic analysis indicates that mer2 completely eliminates meiotic
   interchromosomal gene conversion and crossing over. In addition, mer2
   abolishes intrachromosomal meiotic recombination, both in the ribosomal
   DNA array and in an artificial duplication. The results of a physical
   assay demonstrate that the mer2 mutation prevents the formation of
   meiosis-specific, double-strand breaks, indicating that the Mer2 protein
   acts at or before the initiation of meiotic recombination. Electron
   microscopic analysis reveals that the mer2 mutant makes axial elements,
   which are precursors to the synaptonemal complex, but homologous
   chromosomes fail to synapse. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of
   chromosome-specific DNA probes to spread meiotic chromosomes
   demonstrates that homolog alignment is also significantly reduced in the
   mer2 mutant. Although the MERE gene is transcribed during vegetative
   growth, deletion or overexpression of the MER2 gene has no apparent
   effect on mitotic recombination or DNA damage repair. We suggest that
   the primary defect in the mer2 mutant is in the initiation of meiotic
   genetic exchange.}},

Abstract = {{The sequence of RS CVn seasonal light curves obtained at Catania
   Astrophysical Observatory since 1963, complemented with Keller and
   Limber (1951), Popper (1961) and Ludington (1978) data, are analysed in
   the framework of the starspot hypothesis (Eaten and Hall 1979) to deduce
   the spot evolution in the last 45 years. In the adopted modelling
   technique the star surface is divided into small elements, the specific
   intensities of which are iteratively adjusted, by a chi(2) optimization,
   to fit the residual flux modulation, after the proximity effects and
   eclipses have been taken into account. Satisfactory fits are obtained
   assuming that spots are located only on the K2 subgiant. Maps of the
   spot distributions are presented, together with an improved value for
   the luminosity ratio between the two components in the V band
   (L(1v)/L(2v) = 0.9375 +/- 0.025). The yearly spot distributions are
   analysed to derive general activity characteristics. The spot pattern
   appears to consist of two components, one evenly and the other unevenly
   distributed in longitude, the latter being suggestive of preferential
   longitudes. Spots at latitudes higher than 35 degrees are not required
   to reproduce the observed light curves within the data accuracy. The
   total area covered by spots ranges from about 17\% to 37\% of the active
   star photosphere and shows a periodic variation with a period of 19.7
   +/- 1.9 years with maxima in 1967 and 1984-1988 and minima in 1973 and
   1993. The same periodic variation affects also the area of the evenly
   distributed spot component. The area of the unevenly distributed
   component shows the same behaviour up to the 1973 minimum, but the
   subsequent maximum occurs in 1981, a few years earlier than the maximum
   of the total spotted area. The longitude of the maximum of the spot
   distribution migrates in time at a variable speed with respect to a
   reference frame corotating with the orbital motion, as defined by the
   times of eclipses. The migration rate remains approximately constant at
   similar to 0.1 deg/day during the interval 1963-1984 and does not change
   with the phase of the activity cycle suggested by the cyclic variation
   of the total spot area. In the years 1988-1993, the migration rate
   accelerates to similar to 0.34 deg/day while the spot activity decreases
   toward a cycle minimum. In the latter time interval a solar-like model
   applies, suggesting a systematic decrease of the latitude of the spot
   formation vs. cycle phase and a surface differential rotation between
   5\% and 20\% of the solar one.
   These new results allow us to address also the problem of the orbital
   period variation. Specifically, the orbital period shows a long-term
   variation on a timescale of the order of a century, upon which a
   short-term modulation is superposed. A correlation between the rate of
   change of the period and the migration rate of the photometric wave is
   also suggested by the available data. This evidence supports the model
   proposed by Applegate (1992), but an improvement of the theory is
   required for a quantitative explanation of the observed phenomenology.}},

Abstract = {{Children have physiologic and behavioral characteristics that make them
   vulnerable to damage from environmental chemicals. In the past, there
   have been episodes in which children became ill or died from
   environmental exposures that spared adults or affected them less
   severely. Among the characteristics leading to children's sensitivity
   are their limited diets, dividing cells, differentiating organs and
   organ systems, slow or absent detoxification mechanisms, long life
   expectancy with the resulting ability to express damage with delayed
   consequences, and the severe metabolic demands of growth. There have
   been large outbreaks of poisonings involving children in Asia and
   Turkey, and some of the less obvious effects of chemicals have appeared
   in children in the United States. Although the United States has been
   spared a widespread outbreak of severe poisoning. such an incident is
   possible and would likely have greater consequences for children than

Abstract = {{A problem in the evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between
   prednisolone and cortisol is that both steroids bind to cortisol binding
   globulin (CBG) and albumin. The binding of both steroids to CBG is
   saturable in the therapeutic concentration range. General drug binding
   equations were applied to two drugs and two binding sites and two
   implicit cubic equations were derived. These equations cannot be solved
   algebraically. However, the free concentration can be calculated using
   spreadsheet programs on a personal computer. A spreadsheet for these
   equations was developed using EXCEL 5.0 and its SOLVER option. Free
   concentrations of prednisolone and cortisol were determined as a
   function of total concentrations of both ligands. The simulations show
   that the protein binding of cortisol remains relatively constant in the
   physiological range but changes when exogenous corticosteroid is
   present. However, the degree of protein binding of exogenous
   corticosteroids that bind to CBG depends on the cortisol concentration
   which competes for binding sites. At the same time, the exogenous
   corticosteroid suppresses the release of endogenous cortisol. The
   presented approach is able to take all of these pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic interactions into account leading to a more accurate
   estimation of active free corticosteroid concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A hospital-based case-control study, including 131 cases of esophageal
   cancer and 381 controls, was carried out in Paraguay to investigate the
   role of hot and cold mate drinking in esophageal cancer risk. Detailed
   information on mate drinking and on tobacco smoking, alcohol
   consumption, and dietary habits was obtained by interview.
   Amount and duration of cold or hot mate drinking were not associated
   with esophageal cancer risk. However, temperature at which mate was
   drunk was significantly associated with risk. As compared to drinkers of
   warm or hot mate, drinkers of very hot mate had an increased risk for
   esophageal cancer even after adjusting for the strong effects of alcohol
   and tobacco consumption (adjusted odds ratio = 2.4; 95\% confidence
   interval = 1.3-4.3). This effect seemed to be mainly due to the
   temperature at which mate cocido (one of the two ways in which hot mate
   is prepared) was drunk (odds ratio = 6.5; 95\% confidence interval =
   3.2-13.2), As expected, very strong dose-response associations were
   found for alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, After correcting
   for these and the consumption of other food groups, diets rich in fats
   and red meats, especially beef, were associated with esophageal cancer
   risk.
   In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that cold mate
   drinking does not increase the risk of esophageal cancer. This study
   identifies the very hot temperature at which mate is drunk, and not the
   amount or the duration, as an important risk factor for esophageal
   cancer in this population. Alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking remain,
   nevertheless, the main risk factors for esophageal cancer in Paraguay.}},

Abstract = {{Four peptides were characterized in extracts of bovine neutrophil
   granules: an Arg-rich dodecapeptide, maintained in a cyclic structure by
   a disulfide bridge; a Trp-rich tridecapeptide named indolicidin; and two
   43- and 59 amino acids long peptides, named Bac5 and Bac7, with frequent
   repeats of the triplets Arg-Pro-Pro and Pro-Arg-Pro, respectively.
   The full length cDNA of the first three of these peptides was
   characterized recently. Sequence analysis showed that the prosequences
   of the predicted precursors of all the three peptides are highly
   identical and exhibited also a remarkable similarity to cathelin, a
   porcine inhibitor of cathepsin L. Purified proBac5 actually proved in in
   vitro assays to inhibit cathepsin L, but not other cysteine proteinases
   such as cathepsin B. Unlike proBac5, proBac7 is selectively chemotactic
   to monocytes.
   Several fragments of Bac5 and Bac7 (from 6 to 35 residues) were
   synthesized by the Fmoc method. The results of antibacterial assays show
   that the N-terminal portion, the most cationic one in both Bac5 and
   Bac7, is essential for the antimicrobial activity and that the minimal
   length necessary to arrest the growth of susceptible bacteria is 18-20
   residues.}},

Abstract = {{The Seal Lake Group of eastern Labrador unconformably overlies the 1273
   +/- 1 Ma (2 sigma) Harp Dyke Swarm. In its lower parts, the Seal Lake
   Group includes conglomerates, quartzites, and red-bed sediments, and
   both the lower and middle parts are intruded by olivine gabbro sills.
   This magmatism was coeval with the emplacement of basaltic volcanic
   rocks in the middle and upper sections of the Seal Lake Group. Two
   different gabbro varieties yield baddeleyite and zircon U-Pb ages of
   1250(-7)(+14) Ma and 1224(-5)(+6) Ma, respectively. The older age
   corresponds to the emplacement of a fine- to medium-grained voluminous
   olivine gabbro, whereas the younger age was obtained on a coarse-grained
   gabbro that intrudes the fine-grained gabbro. These ages place magmatism
   in the Seal Lake area in the ca. 1270-1220 Ma phase of extension-related
   magmatism of Laurentia and Baltica that was associated with voluminous
   mafic dyke swarms. Such extension-related mafic Mesoproterozoic
   magmatism occurs on both cratons during three distinct intervals at
   1460-1420, 1270-1220, and 1180-1070 Ma, respectively, suggesting that

   1-alkynyl-zinc chlorides, arylzinc chlorides or aryltributylstannanes
   and alkyl (Z)- and (E)-2,3-dibromopropenoates, (Z)- and (E)-2,
   respectively. The catalyst precursor consisting of a mixture of Pd on
   carbon and 3.9 equivalents of AsPh(3) as well as that obtained by
   treatment of Pd(OAc)(2) with 4 equivalents of AsPh, in THF at 60 degrees
   C can conveniently replace Pd(PPh(3))4 in the reactions between (Z)- or
   (E)-2 and aryl or 1-alkynylzinc halides. On the other hand, a
   representative alkyl (Z)-3-alkyl-2-bromopropenoate has been prepared by
   reaction of a 9-alkyl-9-BBN derivative with (Z)-2a in DMF solution, in
   the presence of K2CO3 and a catalytic quantity of PdCl2(dppf). Some
   applications demonstrate the synthetic utility of 3-aryl-substituted
   alkyl (Z)- and (E)-propenoates, (Z)- and (E)-4. Thus, ethyl
   (E)-2-bromo-3-{[}(2-methoxymethoxy)phenyl]propenoate, (E)-4e, represents
   a direct precursor to 3-bromocoumarin, 7, and compound (Z)-8, which is
   obtained by acidic hydrolysis of (Z)-4e, undergoes a Pd-catalyzed
   intramolecular carbonylation reaction, which affords
   3-ethoxycarbonylcoumarin, 9, in high yield. Moreover, treatment of
   compounds (2)- and (E)-4 with organo-zinc or organotin derivatives, in
   the presence of catalytic amounts of a suitable Pd catalyst, affords,
   stereospecifically and in satisfactory to excellent yields,
   trisubstituted alpha,beta-unsaturated esters, (E)- and (Z)-10,
   respectively, which cannot be easily prepared in stereoisomerically pure
   form by classical procedures. One of these esters, i.e. compound
   (E)-10c, represents a direct precursor to an isoaurone, i.e.
   (E)-3-benzylidene benzofuran-2-one, (E)-11. Finally, a representative

   The essential element of the new machine calender concept is the new
   multizone NIPCORECT roll for sensitive direct fine profiling of the
   paper thickness without additional external components. New materials
   and the compensation of remaining crown of the counter roll enable
   linear loads of less than or equal to 10 N/mm with geometrically even

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations of the bond fluctuation model of symmetrical
   polymer blends confined between two `'neutral'' repulsive walls are
   presented for chain length N-A = N-B = 32 and a wide range of film
   thickness D (from D = 8 to D = 48 in units of the lattice spacing). The
   critical temperatures T-c(D) of unmixing are located by finite-size
   scaling methods, and it is shown that T-c(infinity) - T-c(D)
   proportional to D--1/nu 3, where nu(3) approximate to 0.63 is the
   correlation length exponent of the three-dimensional Ising model
   universality class. Contrary to this result, it is argued that the
   critical behavior of the films is ruled by two-dimensional exponents,
   e.g., the coexistence curve (difference in volume fraction of A-rich and
   A-poor phases) scales as phi(coex)((2)) - phi(coex)((1)) =
   B(D){[}1-T/T-c(D)](beta 2), where beta(2), is the critical exponent of
   the two-dimensional Ising universality class (beta(2) = 1/8). Since for
   large D this asymptotic critical behavior is confined to an extremely
   narrow vicinity of T-c(D), one observes in practice `'effective''
   exponents which gradually cross over From beta(2) to beta(3) with
   increasing film thickness. This anomalous `'flattening'' of the
   coexistence curve should be observable experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{The CYP2C23 gene is expressed constitutively in the rat liver and
   kidney, It exhibits different profiles of expression in the two tissues,
   suggesting that several regulation processes could exist, In this paper,
   we report the structure of the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2C23 gene;
   4.5 kbp were sequenced and analyzed, The CYP2C23 gene is present as a
   single copy into the rat genome and an unique transcription start site
   is used in both liver and kidney, Four DNase I hypersensitive sites have
   been mapped to the distal part of the hepatic promoter and three are
   detected in the kidney: only one site is present in the two tissues
   (L3/K1), In the proximal region, one site is specific for the kidney and
   one is detected in all the tissues tested, Footprint experiments allowed
   precise identification of the sequence of protected regions: HNF4 and
   CREB binding moths are present in the distal liver-specific sites, moths
   for AP-1, NF-1, and XRE-Bf are in the distal kidney site, and a Tf-LF1
   binding site is localized in the L3/K1 protected site, In the proximal
   region, a sequence protected in all tissues contains a SP1/NF kappa B
   moth whereas a sequence containing a HNF-4 binding moth is exclusively
   protected by kidney nuclear extracts, Altogether, the data clearly
   demonstrate that trans-acting factors involved in CYP2C23 gene
   expression differ in liver and kidney.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) is a fulminant infection associated with

   aegyptius isolates, I sought to determine the possible role of P145, a
   145-kDa surface protein of BPF case H, influenzae biogroup aegyptius
   clone isolates, in virulence, First, I compared the virulence of two
   case-associated clone isolates from the blood of children with BPF from
   Serrana, Brazil, which differed in P145 expression but were identical in
   all other phenotypic and genotypic characteristics studied, Twenty-four
   hours after intraperitoneal inoculation of infant rats, there was a
   significantly higher incidence (51 versus 26\%; P = 0.035) and magnitude
   (2.9 +/- 5.8 versus 0.7 +/- 2.0 CFU/0.01 mi; P = 0.024) of bacteremia in
   rats inoculated with the P145-expressing strain, I next compared the
   virulence of a P145 expressing case-associated clone strain with two
   P145-nonexpressing phase variants of this strain, One variant exhibited
   a lower mean magnitude of bacteremia and one displayed a similar
   magnitude of bacteremia compared with that displayed the P145 expressing
   parental strain, P145-expressing revertants of the P145-nonexpressing
   strains exhibited the same virulence as the P145-negative variants from
   which they were derived, Colonies grown from blood cultures maintained
   the P145 phenotype of the inoculated strain, These results suggest that
   P145 expression does not contribute to the virulence of the BPF case
   clone strain for infant rats following intraperitoneal inoculation.}},

   catfish Ictalurus furcatus, channel catfish I. punctatus, freshwater
   drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and gizzard shad Dorosonia cepedianum
   collected from dike fields (river kilometers 669.0-883.2 upstream from
   the mouth) in September and October 1987-1990. Growth increments of the
   four fishes were determined from cross sections of otoliths (freshwater
   drum and gizzard shad) or spines (blue and channel catfishes), and we
   used regression analysis to assess the effects of annual variability in
   15 physicochemical variables on growth. We hypothesized that growth of
   these fishes would be positively related to the extent and duration of
   the annual flood pulse, as it is in tropical floodplain systems.
   However, growth increments of age-0 blue catfish, channel catfish, and
   gizzard shad were related only to length of the growing season. Further,
   positive relationships between growth and total organic carbon levels
   (age-1 blue catfish), and negative relationships between growth and
   total hectares hooded (age-1 gizzard shad) and discharge (age-0 and
   age-1 freshwater drum) indicated that these fishes exhibited highest

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate gender differences in
   the prevalence rates, short-term reliability, and internal consistency
   of the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder for DSM-III-R,
   DSM-III, and Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). Method: A total of 37
   men and 57 women methadone patients were diagnosed according to
   DSM-III-R, DSM-III, and RDC antisocial personality disorder criteria.
   Results: The diagnostic rates, reliability, and internal consistency
   were lower for women than for men in all systems. DSM-III criteria
   resulted in the highest reliability for women, but for men, the DSM-III
   criteria were the least reliable. Examination of endorsement rates of
   individual antisocial personality disorder criteria revealed several
   significant gender differences on the majority of childhood criteria and
   on several adult criteria. Item-total correlations revealed that for
   women, the violent and aggressive childhood criteria in DSM-III-R that
   had not been included in DSM-III or RDC had a negative or no correlation
   to the assessment of antisocial personality disorder for women.
   Conclusions: The change in DSM-III-R from DSM-III childhood criteria
   appears to have resulted in a decrease in internal consistency and rates
   of antisocial personality disorder for women, but not for men. The
   results of this investigation indicate that the psychometric properties
   of the current antisocial personality disorder scales are weak for
   women, compared with men. To assess antisocial personality disorder in
   women it may be necessary to revise current, or develop new, diagnostic
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of dietary
   supplemental folic add and methionine on the performance of starting
   broiler chicks for 18 d. Four levels of dietary folic acid (.24,.54,
   1.14, and 2.34 mg/kg) and four levels of dietary methionine
   (.45,.53,.61, and .69\%) were fed in a factorial design. There were
   three replicates of eight chicks each per each treatment. The basal diet
   was based on corn, isolated soybean protein, meat and bone meal, and
   fish meal. It contained adequate amounts of all nutrients except
   methionine and folic add. Increased growth was observed in chicks fed
   the basal diet supplemented with either folic acid or methionine. Total
   dietary folic acid and methionine plus cysteine requirements for maximum
   growth were estimated to be 1.80 mg/kg and .85\% in Experiment 1 and
   1.47 mg/kg and .87\% in Experiment 2, respectively. There were
   interactions between dietary folic add and methionine on weight gain in
   both experiments. Chicks fed the diet containing 2.34 mg folic acid/kg
   tended to have depressed growth, as in previous experiments.
   There was a significant Linear feed conversion response to folic acid in
   Experiment 1 and to methionine in Experiment 2. There were both Linear
   and quadratic liver folic add responses to dietary folic acid in both
   experiments. There was no indication that dietary methionine had any
   effect on liver folic acid content. No differences in bone ash,
   hemoglobin, hematocrit, or incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia were
   detected due to methionine or folic acid supplementation.}},

Abstract = {{When applied to literary study, Rogerian psychological theory will yield
   fruitful results in four areas: the theory of literary creativity,
   method of interpretation, analysis of character, and value theory. (a)
   The origin of a literary work is the author's personal, experiential
   insight into the nature of reality; the writer then plays with this
   insight until it jells into a form that `'feels right'' to him or her.
   (b) A literary work contains a system of values that can be apprehended
   by the reader through his or her emotional responses to the work. (c)
   Character analysis proceeds by recognizing incongruence between the
   character's internally experienced reactions and those the character
   feels obligated to have because of pressures from the environment. (d)
   Literature has value for the reader because it increases awareness of
   the reader's own organismic experience.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Background: Immunosuppression after severe head injury has been
   characterized by a depressed CD4 (T-helper/inducer)-CD8
   (T-suppressor/cytotoxic) ratio and decreased T-lymphocyte
   responsiveness. Some investigators propose that this immunocompromized
   state is the result of an injury-associated hypermetabolic response and
   inadequate nutrient delivery during the immediate postinjury recovery
   phase. Previous observations from our institution demonstrated a
   preserved CD4-CD8 ratio in severe closed-head injury (CHI) patients
   receiving early parenteral nutrition (PN). It was unclear whether early
   PN or other aspects of patient care eliminated the characteristic
   depression in cellular immunity. The purpose of this study was to
   further investigate the effect of early PN on the immune function of CHI
   patients. Methods: Nine patients sustaining severe CHI were
   prospectively randomized to either early PN (n = 4) at day 1 or delayed
   PN (n = 5) at day 5. Total nutrient administration was delivered at 2 g
   of protein/kg per day and 40 nonprotein kcal/kg per day for at least the
   first 14 days of hospitalization. Analysis for T-lymphocyte expression
   of CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens and interleukin-6 was performed on
   days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of hospitalization. T-lymphocyte activation in
   response to stimulation by concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin
   (PHA), and pokeweed mitogens (PWM) was also assessed on these days.
   Results: Significant increases in total CD4 cell counts (2048 +/- 194 to
   2809 +/- 129 vs 1728 +/- 347 to 1825 +/- 563, p < .05) and CD4\% (42.6
   +/- 4.4\% to 56.2 +/- 2.6\% vs 36.6 +/- 6.6\% to 36.6 +/- 11.3\%, p <
   .05) were observed at day 14 in patients receiving early vs delayed PN.
   An improved lymphocyte response from baseline to day 14 after Con A
   stimulation was demonstrated in the early PN group (3850 +/- 1596 to
   16144 +/- 5024 cpm, p < .05). A significant rise in the CD4-CD8 ratio
   over baseline to day 14 was also noted in the early PN group (1.43 +/-
   0.17 to 2.38 +/- 0.54, p < .05). Conclusions: The early aggressive
   nutrition support of CHI patients appears to modify immunologic function
   by increasing CD4 cells, CD4-CD8 ratios, and T-lymphocyte responsiveness
   to Con A.}},

   The powder has been vacuum-treated with SbF5 and BF3 vapor and then

   enhancement of the ionic conductivity with a slope that is
   characteristic for F--vacancy migration. A simple homogeneous doping by

   to oxygen impurities introduced by the heat-treatment: this is shown by
   preparation in different gas atmospheres. A quantitative estimation of
   the enhanced conductivity assuming space-charge effects is presented.
   Conductivity results on thin films also confirmed the assumption of

   levels was investigated. Both H- and L-soils were taken from the topsoil
   of a greenhouse for spinach cultivation and a nearby fallow field,
   respectively. In the II-soil inorganic ions had accumulated due to the
   high rates of application of fertilizer. Among the ions, the

   higher than those in the L-soil. Among the inorganic ions tested (K+
   Na+, Ca2+ Mg2+, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-), Ca2+ was found to be the most
   inhibitory on the growth of isolates. In addition, the isolates from the
   H-soil were more Ca2+-tolerant than those from the L-soil.
   Consequently, the growth tolerance to Ca2+ stress of the total 80
   isolates, 40 each from the H-soil and L-soil, was compared at 150 mM
   Ca2+. Most isolates from the W-soil showed a significantly higher
   tolerance. The higher tolerance to Ca2+ of the isolates from the H-soil
   may have been acquired through selection under increasing Ca2+ stress in
   the field. The Ca2+ tolerance of the fluorescent pseudomonad strains may
   account for their survival and root-colonizing activity in soils with

Abstract = {{The ion optics for a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer
   with electrostatic sector analyzers have been investigated. The multiple
   focusing (triple isochronous focusing and triple spacial focusing)
   conditions can be achieved by using a symmetrical arrangement of the
   sectors in a mass spectrometer. Both high mass resolution and high ion
   transmission can be accomplished simultaneously. The principles of MS/MS
   and MS/MS/MS analyses using a TOF mass spectrometer with electrostatic
   sector analyzers have been proposed. Product ion spectra can be obtained
   by measuring the total night times and the kinetic energy of the
   products without any additional separation processes, any coincidence
   techniques or any special timing circuits. In an experiment, MS/MS and
   MS/MS/MS mass spectra have been obtained. The first generation product
   ions have been produced by a metastable decay, and the second generation
   products have been produced by a sequential decay.}},

Abstract = {{A promoter which controls expression of the pristinamycin multidrug
   resistance gene (ptr) in Streptomyces pristinaspiralis could be induced
   by physiological stresses in both Streptomyces spp. and Escherichia
   coli. In S. pristinaspiralis, the ptr promoter (Pptr) was induced by
   pristinamycin I (PI) or pristinamycin II (PII). Streptomyces lividans
   was adopted as a convenient heterologous host for studies of Pptr
   regulation since it has no known pristinamycin biosynthetic genes. Two
   key regulatory features were documented in these studies: many (19 of
   70) antibiotics and chemicals with no common targets or structural
   features induced the Pptr; induction with PI was most efficient during a
   transition phase when antibiotic biosynthetic genes are switched on. In
   Streptomyces coelicolor, Pptr activity was similarly inducible by PI and
   not dependent on sigma factors HrdA, HrdC, or HrdD. In E. coli, Pptr
   cloned in the bifunctional promoter probe vector pIJ2839 was functional
   and activated upon entry into stationary phase in the absence of
   exogenous inducer. Finally, gel-retardation studies demonstrated a
   Pptr-binding protein in S. lividans (where its activity was
   PI-inducible), S. coelicolor and S. pristinaespiralis. The fact that
   this activity was not detected in E. coli suggested the existence of
   another regulatory system perhaps also present in Streptomyces.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate information on prevalence and status of blood pressure control
   among US hemodialysis patients is lacking, We have surveyed the status
   of blood pressure control in 649 hemodialysis patients (89.8\% black)
   from 10 dialysis units in Mississippi. Our results show a hypertension
   prevalence of 72\% (hypertension defined as mean arterial pressure prior
   to dialysis session greater than or equal to 114 mm Hg). This mean
   arterial pressure did not differ among black patients compared with
   white patients (P = 0.51). The majority of hypertensive patients (80\%)
   had elevation of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Isolated
   systolic hypertension was present in only 20\% of hypertensive patients
   and was not different between black and white patients (P = 0.10). Three
   hundred eighty-one patients (58.7\% of the total population and 81.5\%
   of the hypertensive patients) were receiving antihypertensives. Age was
   the only significant factor that correlated with blood pressure: older
   patients (>65 years) had lower blood pressure (P < 0,0001). Race, time
   on dialysis, etiology of end-stage renal disease, adequacy of dialysis,
   and several excess volume parameters had no influence on the blood
   pressure level. Treated hypertensive patients had a predialysis mean
   blood pressure only 3 mm Hg less than the untreated hypertensive
   patients. No differences were found among four classes of
   antihypertensives with regard to the degree of blood pressure control.
   Patients with hypertension requiring more than one antihypertensive did
   not achieve a lower blood pressure than the untreated patients. There
   was no correlation between use of antihypertensives and the magnitude of
   decrease in blood pressure after dialysis. Our results document the high
   prevalence and resistant nature of hypertension in the hemodialysis
   population. It also casts doubt on the effectiveness of our current
   methods of treatment. Excess volume may not be as important in these
   patients as once thought. (C) 1995 by the National Kidney Foundation,

Abstract = {{Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune disease
   induced by immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid
   protein, or encephalitogenic peptides from these myelin components. EAE
   resembles multiple sclerosis in some of its clinical and histologic
   features, and serves as an experimental model for this and other
   autoimmune diseases. In this study, we examine i.v. peptide therapy of
   EAE in detail, and show that repeated i.v. injections of MBP peptides
   effectively treat EAE in (PLJ x SJL)F-1 mice. In this study,
   administration of the immunodominant epitope (MBP Ac1-11) prevents
   MBP-induced disease, whereas the subdominant epitope MBP 31-47 is
   neither required nor sufficient. Intravenous administration of
   substituted MBP peptide analogues is also effective in treating EAE,
   provided the peptide side chains presumed to be involved in TCR contact
   and MHC binding are preserved. A substituted MBP peptide analogue that
   forms long-lived peptide-MHC complexes in vivo is more effective than
   the unmodified MBP peptide. Lower doses of the substituted peptide
   analogue are effective, and the effect is longer lasting than treatment
   with the unmodified peptide. Clinical signs of EAE are reversed by
   injection of the substituted peptide during the acute phase of disease.
   Moreover, treatment of mice in the remission phase of EAE results in a
   dramatically reduced incidence of relapse. In summary, we have shown
   that EAE can be reversed after onset and treated during remission with
   an MBP peptide analogue that has been modified for improved therapeutic
   potency.}},

   special understanding of the US market enabled it to respond more
   effectively to life style differences by locating industrial designers
   in its key markets. Sony's strong design capability and effective
   division of labor (engineers lead generational and incremental projects,
   industrial designers and market personnel lead topological projects)
   allow for parallel model development. Investment in manufacturing
   flexibility amortized over multiple models within the product family

Abstract = {{Distributions of brachiopods from low-latitude paleogeographic settings,
   primarily in the Tethyan Ocean of southern Europe, with additional data
   from North America allow some observations on the bathymetric
   distribution of early Mesozoic brachiopod orders. Norian and latest
   Triassic (Rhaetian) brachiopod biofacies are dominated in shallowest
   waters by short-looped terebratulids (Terebratulidina) while
   spire-bearing athyrids (Athyrida) are common components of deeper-water
   environments in the latest Triassic. In the late Early Jurassic
   (Pliensbachian), shallow-water brachiopod faunas are dominated by
   rhynchonellids, short-looped terebratulids are commoner in relatively
   deeper shelf waters, and spiriferids and long-looped terebratulids
   (Terebratellidina) are abundant in deeper-water shelf environments.
   Following the end-Triassic extinction event there appears to be
   niche-replacement in deep-water shelf environments of Late Triassic
   athyrids by spiriferids and long-looped terebratulids in the Early
   Jurassic. Rhynchonellids appear to have diversified into shallowest
   water environments; specialized short-looped terebratulids may have
   occupied deeper-water niches that resulted ultimately in the success of
   the enigmatic Pygopidae later in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.}},

Abstract = {{Tomato ringspot nepovirus (TomRSV) produces a 45 kDa movement protein
   and a 58 kDa coat protein in infected plants. Accumulation of the
   movement protein in relation to that of the coat protein was studied in
   infected protoplasts using a monoclonal antibody against the movement
   protein and polyclonal antibodies against the coat protein. Unlike most
   other viral movement proteins, the TomRSV movement protein was present
   at late stages of infection. Pulse-chase labelling experiments revealed
   that the release of the movement protein from the precursor polyprotein
   was coordinated with that of the coat protein. However, the movement
   protein was less stable than the coat protein in the extractable
   fraction of the protoplasts. The expression pattern of the TomRSV
   movement protein is discussed in the light of the proposed mechanism of
   cell-to-cell movement of virus-like particles through tubular structures
   composed of the movement protein.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the identifiability of mixtures of distributions is
   discussed and a sufficient condition for the identifiability of the
   mixture of a large class of discrete distributions, namely that of the

   probabilistic arguments, an elementary and shorter proof of the
   Luxmann-Ellinghaus's (1987, Statist. Probab. Lett., 5, 375-378) result
   is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that this result is a special case of
   a stronger result connected with the Stieltjes moment problem. Some
   recent observations due to Singh and Vasudeva (1984, J. Indian Statist.
   Assoc., 22, 93-96) and Johnson and Kotz (1989, Ann. Inst. Statist.
   Math., 41, 13-17) concerning characterizations based on conditional
   distributions are also revealed as special cases of this latter result.
   Exploiting the notion of the identifiability of power-series mixtures,
   characterizations based on regression functions (posterior expectations)
   are obtained. Finally, multivariate generalizations of the preceding
   results have also been addressed.}},

Abstract = {{We study dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking of non-perturbative QCD in
   the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the QCD-monopole field is
   introduced as an essential field for color confinement stemming from the
   choice of the abelian gauge fixing a la `t Hooft. In this theory,
   QCD-monopole condensation causes the dual Meissner effect, which changes
   the gluon propagator. The dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking is
   investigated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation with the modified gluon
   propagator in the QCD-monopole condensed vacuum. We introduce the low
   momentum cutoff on the modified gluon propagator by considering the
   effects of the q-(\$) over bar q pair creation and/or the quarks being
   confined in hadrons. We find that dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking is
   largely enhanced by QCD-monopole condensation, which suggests the close
   relation between the color confinement and the chiral symmetry breaking.
   The dynamical quark mass, the pion decay constant and the quark
   condensate are reproduced consistently with the confining mechanism in
   this theory.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to acquire digitally collected, energy-filtered electron
   diffraction patterns has permitted the development of fully quantitative
   methods of pattern analysis based on fitting theoretical calculations to
   experimental intensities. We have developed a method of extracting
   accurate low-order structure factor information from zone-axis CBED
   patterns using an automated pattern matching technique. The feasibility
   of such an approach has already been established by fitting to simulated
   data-sets. Results are now presented from pattern matching calculations
   using energy-filtered Si {[}110] zone-axis patterns obtained with a
   serial EELS detector attached to a Philips EM420 TEM. Fits to patterns
   at two different sample thicknesses (measured to be 2761 and 4092
   Angstrom) are discussed. The results show good agreement with the most
   accurate Si structure factors obtained from X-ray measurements.}},

   agreement with the drift velocities observed by the collocated

   the mean DGS velocities to be within 50 m s(-1) of the ISR velocities,

   highlights the dominance of the electric field in controlling the plasma
   motion. The measured velocities are generally height independent, as
   would be expected for an E held mapped along the magnetic field lines
   from high altitudes to ionospheric heights. In addition, the comparative
   analysis is used to study an ionospheric event where a large section of

Abstract = {{The enzymes catalysing the first two steps of quinoline and
   3-methylquinoline degradation by Comamonas testosteroni 63 were
   investigated. Quinoline 2-oxidoreductase, which catalyses the
   hydroxylation of (3-methyl-)quinoline to
   (3-methyl-)2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, was purified to apparent
   homogeneity. The native enzyme, with a molecular mass of 360 kDa, is
   composed of three non-identical subunits (87, 32, and 22 kDa), occurring
   in a ratio of 1.16:1:0.83. Containing FAD, molybdenum, iron, and
   acid-labile sulfur in the stoichiometric ratio of 2:2:8:8, the enzyme
   belongs to the molybdo-iron/sulfur flavoproteins. Molybdopterin cytosine
   dinucleotide is the organic part of the pterin molybdenum cofactor.
   Comparison of N-terminal amino acid sequences revealed similarities to a
   number of procaryotic molybdenum-containing hydroxylases. Especially the
   N-termini of the beta-subunits of the quinoline 2-oxidoreductases from
   Comamonas testosteroni 63, Pseudomonas putida 86, and Rhodococcus spec.
   B1, and of quinoline-4-carboxylic acid 2-oxidoreductase from
   Agrobacterium spec. 1B showed striking similarities.
   Further degradation of (3-methyl-)2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline proceeds
   via dioxygenation st the benzene ring, i.e. at 5,6-position {[}Schach,
   S., Schwarz, G., Fetzner, S. \& Lingens, F. (1993) Biol. Chem.
   Hoppe-Seyler 374, 175-181]. 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 5,6-dioxygenase
   was partially purified; NADH and oxygen are required for the reaction,
   and the enzymic activity is enhanced 1.5-fold by addition of Fe2+ ions.
   Unexpectedly, this aromatic ring dioxygenase did not separate into
   distinct protein components, but is apparently a single-component
   enzyme. The molecular mass was estimated to be about 260 kDa.
   2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 5,6-dioxygenase is very thermolabile.
   However, dithioerythritol and low concentrations of substrate had a
   moderately stabilizing effect. 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline
   5,6-dioxygenase is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking agents, by
   metal-chelating agents, and by the flavin analogues quinacrine and
   acriflavin.}},

Abstract = {{We have used the data from the COBB satellite to search for delayed

   7 degrees beam of COBE is well matched to the large positional
   uncertainties in the GRB locations, although it also means that fluxes
   from (point source) GRB objects will be diluted. In view of this we are
   doing a statistical search of the GRBs which occurred during the
   currently released COBE DMR data (years 1990 and 1991), which overlap
   similar to 200 GRBs recorded by GRO. Here we concentrate on just the top
   10 GRBs (in peak counts/second). We obtain the limits on the emission by
   comparing the COBE fluxes before and after the GRB at the GRB location.
   Since it is thought that the microwave emission should lag the GRB
   event, we have searched the GRB position for emission in the few months
   following the GRB occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{The H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of phenylallene, diluted in
   acetone-d(6) and benzene-d(6), yield long-range coupling constants over
   as many as eight formal bonds between the ring and side-chain protons.
   These are discussed in terms of sigma- and pi-electron spin-spin
   coupling mechanisms, which are sensitive to the torsion angle between
   the allenyl and phenyl fragments. The torsion angle is assessed by means
   of molecular orbital computations of the internal rotational potential,
   whose height is calculated as 16.0 kJ/mol at the MP2/6-31G{*} level of
   correlation-gradient theory. Comparison with experimental and
   theoretical internal rotational potentials for styrene suggests that
   steric repulsions in the planar form of styrene amount to about 4
   kJ/mol. In a field of 7.0 T, phenylallene is partially aligned,
   entailing a positive dipolar coupling constant between the methylene
   protons, from which absolute signs of the spin-spin coupling constants
   involving these protons can be inferred. Such coupling constants over
   seven and eight bonds, to the meta and para protons, are taken as being
   mediated by the extended pi-electron system, providing a measure of
   pi-electron contributions to coupling constants between meta protons and
   those in side chains (spin correlation). Some coupling constants between
   protons and C-13 nuclei in the side chain, as well as between ring
   protons and these C-13 nuclei, are also discussed in terms of spin
   coupling mechanisms. Solvent perturbations of one-bond proton-carbon
   coupling constants in the allenyl group do not follow the usual pattern
   in which an increase in polarity of the solvent is associated with an
   increase in the magnitude of the coupling constant.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To search for a morphologic basis of cognitive impairment

   imaging and a demanding neuropsychologic test battery.
   Design: Case-control comparison with age, length of education, presence
   of diabetes, and presence of cardiac disease as matching criteria.
   Setting: Austrian Stroke Prevention Study.
   Subjects: A total of 89 hypertensive subjects and 89 control subjects
   from a subset of 272 volunteers with no neurologic symptoms undergoing
   extensive diagnostic workup in a large-scale stroke prevention study
   among randomly selected elderly community members.
   Main Outcome Measures: Focal brain abnormalities and size of ventricles
   and cortical sulci as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and
   neuropsychological test scores.
   Results: Hypertensive subjects more commonly showed areas of white
   matter hyperintensity and moderately severe ventricular enlargement
   compared with controls. While no differences were noted between the
   investigational groups in test results of memory capacity and
   conceptualization, hypertensive subjects tended to perform worse when
   assessed for attentional and visuopractical skills. These differences
   became significant when comparing the brain-damaged subsets of patients
   and controls with their counterparts without cerebral changes. The
   pattern and extent of neuropsychologic deficits was similar in
   hypertensive and normotensive subjects with abnormal magnetic resonance
   imaging scans.
   Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest the high rate of brain
   abnormalities among hypertensive subjects as the cause of their subtle
   neuropsychological dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Human skin represents the interface between the `'milieu interieur'' and
   the environment. Together with mucous membranes, it constitutes the
   first immune defence barrier involved in protection of self. The
   epidermis contains a population of dendritic cells of bone marrow
   origin, Langerhans cells, whose function is to continuously inform the
   body and, particularly, the immune system, about its antigenic
   environment. After binding a foreign substance, Langerhans cells leave
   the epidermis and migrate, via lymphatic vessels, to proximal lymph
   nodes where they exert the function of antigen-presenting cells to T
   lymphocytes. This antigenic presentation results in stimulation and
   proliferation of clones of T lymphocytes specific to the antigen pre
   sented. Following second contact with this same antigen, the antigenic
   presentation mechanism results in a local inflammatory reaction at the
   site of penetration of the antigen. This phenomenon, also called delayed
   hypersensitivity, is involved in contact dermatitis or contact eczema.
   Our recent studies on Langerhans cells have demonstrated that they can
   be distinguished in vitro from CD34(+) haematopoietic precursors present
   in umbilical cord blood in the presence of GM-CSF and TNF alpha.
   Stimulation of Langerhans cells by a hapten increase their migration
   capacity due to the expression of various adhesion molecules, receptors
   of constituents of the extracellular matrix. Antigen presentation and
   stimulation of T lymphocytes have been reproduced in vitro with normal
   human cells in an autologous system using, in particular, Langerhans
   cells obtained from normal skin and precultured 2 to 3 days. Finally,
   Langerhans cells express the CD4 molecule on their membrane and can be
   infected by the HIV1 virus. This infection, demonstrated in seropositive
   patients, has been reproduced in vitro. The main steps in the life cycle
   of Langerhans cells (differentiation from precursors, migration,
   interactions with lymphocytes) can therefore be reproduced and analysed
   in vitro in increasingly specific functional models. Their applications
   in cutaneous immunopathology and pharmacology open the way to research
   of a great general Value in public health.}},

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air relative humidity and
   thallus temperature (TT) were measured in Usnea antarctica over a period
   of 12 months at a coastal rock on King George Island, South Shetland
   Islands. TT had an annual amplitude of c. 54 K with the maximum of +27.4
   degrees C recorded in December and minimum of -27.3 degrees C in July.
   Daily maximum TT exceeded 0 degrees C every month except in June and
   July when they were below -0.4 degrees C and -1.6 degrees C,
   respectively. Daily minimum temperatures were always below zero. Diel
   courses of PPFD showed pronounced seasonal differences between summer
   (more than 2000 mu mol, m(-2) s(-1)) and winter (less than 50 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1) in July). Daily sum of PPFD was highest (more than 30 mol
   m(-2) d(-1)) in December and lowest (0.1 mol m(-2) d(-1)) in July. A
   photosynthesis model was used to estimate the potential annual primary
   production from habitat PPFD and TT. The estimated potential annual
   carbon balance of U. antarctica was 323 mg CO2 g(-1) dry weight y(-1)
   assuming that the lichen was always at optimal moisture. The potential
   carbon balance indicates that primary production is severely limited by
   low PPFD and subzero TT in the austral winter. Nevertheless, the PPFD
   and Tr would allow metabolic activity during winter but with a negative
   carbon balance during May-August. Spring and autumnal months are
   revealed as probably the most important periods for lichen primary
   production because PPFD exceeds photosynthetic light compensation point
   during the daytime and ambient moisture conditions frequently favour a
   positive carbon balance.}},

   Borkh,, were mapped from data collected at three forested sites of
   varying size and historical background in Cuyahoga County of northeast
   Ohio to compare the species' present distribution with that of its
   historical distribution in the mentioned areas, Sprouts were absent from
   one site despite a dense population of remnant chestnut stumps,
   Distribution of sprouts within the two remaining sites was sparse except
   for localized high concentrations, In addition to the aggregated
   pattern, sprout distribution was somewhat shifted from chestnut stump
   distribution indicating that such stumps are not the direct sources of
   regenerative tissue, but were the likely seed sources for younger,
   active root systems presently generating sprouts. Data collected to
   assess sprout location in relation to canopy changes indicated a
   continued association of American chestnut with white oak, Quercus alba,
   and red oak, Quercus rubra. Variations in sprout distribution are
   related to past land use and the subsequent stage of development of each
   site, The absence of sprouts from the old growth forest is attributed to
   competitive exclusion by shade tolerant species-mainly sugar maple, Acer
   saccbarum, and American beech, Fagus grandifolia, Although comparisons
   of sprouting rates versus death rates over a three year period indicated
   a 30\% increase in the number of chestnut stems giving the appearance of
   a growing population, succession toward beech-maple forests was evident
   at all three sites as is the case in many forested areas of this region.}},

Abstract = {{In risk assessment, thresholds are generally believed to exist for toxic
   reproductive and developmental agents. Therefore, dose combinations
   exist below the threshold where the response is not distinguishable from
   background and above the threshold where a dose-response trend results,
   Because data from combination experiments are more reflective of human
   exposure to environmental agents, threshold models that incorporate the
   effect of interactions among these agents are developed. For s agents
   acting in combination, the threshold is an s-dimensional surface, More
   specifically, for a combination of two agents, the threshold is a
   two-dimensional contour of dose combinations, and for a single agent,
   the threshold is represented by a single dose value, not necessarily a
   dose level used in the experiment. In toxicological experiments designed
   to investigate the reproductive or developmental effects of a chemical
   on laboratory animals, litter effects typically are present, yielding
   overdispersion. Instead of assuming a particular distributional form for
   the binary responses, quasi-likelihood methods often are used where
   parameters are introduced to measure the overdispersion. This article
   describes threshold models for combination reproductive and
   developmental experiments and develops parameter estimation techniques
   using quasi-likelihood methods. Once parameters are estimated, a
   hypothesis test for an overall dose-response relationship is performed
   using a quasi-likelihood ratio statistic. Next, a confidence interval
   about the threshold parameter is constructed using a quasi-likelihood
   ratio statistic, and finally, a confidence region is constructed about
   the threshold surface, Illustrative examples are presented that use
   single-agent reproductive data from the National Toxicology Program and
   three-agent combination developmental data from the Environmental
   Protection Agency and Man Tech Environmental Technology, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the use of a map of spatial preference for
   wildlife as a tool for environmental assessment to predict animal
   distribution, instead of using a map of vegetation cover types. The
   underlying idea of the map of spatial preference is for a planner to be
   able to understand the wildlife perception of the environment and to
   predict wildlife distribution. It is suggested that other types of
   surface cover beside vegetation are important to support wildlife
   conservation. Ideas for developing a map of spatial preference are
   presented and are applied to a case study of a coastal area. The results
   permit the definition of areas for preservation, as well as those with
   potential for development. Proposals are made for environmental
   assessment in coastal areas, in general, and particularly, in Venezuela.

   SELECTION OF THE DENDRITE OPERATING STATE}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{154}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{We develop a model that allows interface kinetics to be incorporated in
   a simple way in the determination of the dendrite operating state. The
   model is based on an optimum stability conjecture, according to which
   the dendrite tip radius is related to the wavelength of the fastest
   growing Fourier component in a linear stability analysis that includes
   consideration of interface kinetics. The basic idea is similar to that
   of the marginal stability hypothesis but leads to a value of the
   selection parameter sigma = 2 kappa d(0)/(V rho(2)) that decreases as
   the Peclet number Pe = V rho/(2 kappa) is increased (V = dendrite growth
   velocity, rho = dendrite tip radius, kappa = thermal diffusivity and
   d(0) = capillary length). This results in 1/sigma being a linear
   function of 1/rho. The Ivantsov equation for the dimensionless
   supercooling S in terms of Pe is modified to account for capillarity and
   kinetics by using the dendrite tip temperature instead of the melting
   temperature in the original Ivantsov equation. This yields a complete
   parametric solution to the problem, and the resulting `'scaling laws''
   are exhibited for the case of two spatial dimensions. We also reexamine
   the data of Rubinstein and Glicksman for dendritic growth in pivalic
   acid for which sigma varies by about 100\% over the measured range of
   supercooling. The value of 1/sigma is nearly linear in lip, in agreement
   with the optimum stability conjecture. Comparison with the present
   theory results in a kinetic coefficient of mu = 0.218 cm/s . K. The
   resulting calculated values of V and rho are found to be in better
   agreement with experiment than for constant sigma, but still show
   considerable discrepancy at small supercoolings, probably due to
   convection. This stability theory is based on a planar geometry rather
   than on a parabolic geometry, the modification of the Ivantsov relation
   is crude, and the theory completely neglects treatment of anisotropy of
   either capillarity or interface kinetics, which are known to be
   important from microscopic solvability theory. Nevertheless, we identify
   a dimensionless group m = mu T-M gamma/(kappa L(V)) which must be small
   for interface kinetics to be important (T-M = absolute melting
   temperature, gamma = crystal-melt surface free energy, and L(V) = latent
   heat per unit volume).}},

Abstract = {{An approach based on direct observation from the riverbank allowed a
   precise description of the size-dependent distribution patterns of young
   grayling. The smallest larvae (15-20 mm) were mainly observed in the
   upper layers of the water column and very close to the riverbank. With
   increasing age and size (20-35 mm), old larvae and young parr began to
   hold positions closer to the bottom and to the edge of the main channel.
   From a size of 35-40 mm, an increasing number of juveniles were observed
   in the river channel, holding a benthic position. A diel habitat shift
   was also shown for individuals of all stages, between their respective
   daytime habitats and dead zones, where they were observed resting on the
   bottom in very shallow water at night. The benefits of this shift might
   be expressed in terms of energy conservation and (or) decreased
   predation risk. This study points out the importance of marginal
   habitats in the first weeks of grayling life as (i) exclusive nursery
   areas for larvae that use them both by day and by night and (ii) resting
   habitats for juveniles at night.}},

Abstract = {{The existence and time course of the human plasma membrane block to
   polyspermy were investigated by an in vitro fertilization assay using
   zona pellucida-free unfertilized oocytes, pronuclear oocytes and
   embryos. In the time course study using a high sperm concentration
   (10(5) spermatozoa ml(-1)) the number of penetrating spermatozoa at 30
   and 60 min after insemination were 1.3 +/- 0.3 and 2.9 +/- 0.4,
   respectively. By 2 h after insemination, sper matozoa penetration
   reached a maximum. A lower maximum number of penetrating spermatozoa was
   observed at a low sperm concentration (10(4) spermatozoa ml(-1)), but
   the number of penetrating spermatozoa still reached a maximum by 2 h
   after insemination. A reinsemination experiment demonstrated that the
   number of penetrating spermatozoa was not significantly different
   between control and reinseminated oocytes, while sperm penetration was
   not observed in the oocyte beyond the two-cell stage. Furthermore, the
   number of binding spermatozoa decreased after fertilization and most of
   the four-cell stage embryos displayed no sperm binding. These results
   suggest that the plasma membrane block plays an important role in the
   prevention of polyspermy in the human oocyte, and that the plasma
   membrane block may involve permanent changes in the binding or fusion
   ability of spermatozoa in the oolemma after fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{A double step aging procedure was used to produce bimodal size
   distributions of precipitates in two Ni-Al-Mo alloys. The evolution of
   the microstructure during the decomposition was studied using

   distributions were determined for a very wide time scale. Particle shape
   transitions during aging were monitored by the determination of
   aspect-ratio distributions. The results are compared with small-angle
   neutron scattering analysis in the preceding paper and good agreement is
   found between the size distributions determined by the two techniques.
   In the alloy with high coherency strains peculiar phenomena were
   observed during aging, e.g. coalescence among the small precipitates,
   preferential growth of small precipitates in the presence of larger
   ones, and a dramatic narrowing of the size distribution of large
   precipitates indicating a uniformization in size towards late stages of

Abstract = {{We study a single grafted or tethered polymer chain in the mushroom

   of the form upsilon(x) = V(x/l)(a), where V and l are constants, there
   is a critical value of the exponent a above which coil-stretch
   transitions take place. This is a(c) = (2 nu - 1)/(1 - nu), where nu is
   the Flory exponent for the chain. We also study the case of shear flows,
   where a similar relation holds. We then study more general flows. In the
   particular case of a chain in a good solvent, a(c) = 1/2 and a flow in a
   coverging cone causes a coil-stretch transition for cones above a
   critical angle and for fluid fluxes above a critical value.}},

Abstract = {{Background In vivo rush desensitization is a procedure widely employed
   to quickly desensitize allergic patients by administering increasing
   doses of the offending antigen at short intervals. The mechanism(s)
   underlying this process and the possible role of mast cells in it have
   not been well delineated.
   Objective To define an ex vivo model for rush desensitization utilizing
   the mast cell-fibroblast coculture system.
   Methods Rat peritoneal mast cells were cultured on 3T3 fibroblasts and
   were preincubated with saturating or suboptimal concentrations of IgE
   anti-DNP antibodies. Mast cells were then repeatedly challenged at 30
   min intervals, with increasing amounts (0.001-100 ng/mL) of the antigen
   DNP-HSA, in the presence of calcium ions. Parallel control cultures were
   stimulated only once by each antigen concentration. In another set of
   experiments, mast cells were repeatedly activated with increasing
   concentrations (0.1-1000 ng/mL) of compound 48/80. Supernatants and cell
   sonicates were assessed for histamine content and the percentage of
   histamine released was calculated.
   Results When saturating concentrations of IgE anti-DNP antibodies were
   used, mast cells challenged repeatedly with DNP-HSA did not release
   significant amounts of histamine up to an antigen concentration of I
   ng/mL. At this stage they were partially desensitized, releasing only
   108.3 +/- 17.1 ng histamine/plate (7.9 +/- 0.8\%). A marked
   desensitization was observed at optimal antigen concentration (100
   ng/mL), where experimental mast cells released only 45.6 +/- 10.9
   ng/plate, compared with 661.9 +/- 48.2 ng/plate in firstly challenged
   cultures. Desensitization was probably not due to mast cells histamine
   depletion, since the cells still contained large amounts of histamine
   (579.5 +/- 108.6 ng/plate) at the end of the procedure. A similar
   pattern of desensitization was observed when mast cells were
   preincubated with a suboptimal concentration of IgE antibodies.
   Activation of mast cells with increasing amounts of the IgE-independent
   secretagogue, compound 48/80, did not cause desensitization since at
   each concentration both repetitively challenged and control cultures
   released similar amounts of histamine. furthermore, challenge of
   antigen-desensitized mast cells with compound 48/80 caused the release
   of 75.9 +/- 4.9\% histamine comparable to the percentage of histamine
   released from controls (79.5 +/- 6.7).
   Conclusion Repeated exposure of mast cells to gradually increasing
   amounts of antigen induces their refractoriness. This observation would
   suggest a role for mast cells in rush desensitization procedure in vivo.
   Our coculture system may serve as a useful model for studying this
   process.}},

   either Tn, mitral stenosis, or normal coronary arteriograms. The mean
   LAD displacement in the Tn group was significantly rightward compared to
   the other groups, Uniform rightward displacement of the lower two-thirds
   of the LAD had a 90\% sensitivity and 90-95\% specificity for the
   presence of Tn. Such displacement is probably the angiographic
   counterpart of the systolic paradoxical septal displacement demonstrated
   by echocardiography in patients with right ventricular volume overload.
   There was a positive correlation between the severity of Tn and the
   magnitude of LAD displacement. Attention to the LAD displacement on LAO

Abstract = {{Cationic ion-exchange resins, particularly the macroporous variety, are
   versatile catalysts which offer several advantages over the homogeneous
   acid catalysts with respect to corrosion, product recovery, selectivity,
   etc. In some cases, such as etherification of phenols/naphthols with
   isobutylene/isoamylene, resin catalysts allow the reaction to occur, but
   the homogeneous catalysts fail. A noteworthy development has been the
   use of distillation column reactors (DCR) where the exothermicity of the
   reaction is usefully employed and the resin inventory, for a specified
   level of conversion and productivity, can be significantly reduced. The
   availability of methyl-tert-butyl ether and tert-amyl methyl ether
   allows tert-butyl and tert-amyl derivatives of phenolic substances to be
   produced with the attendant advantages. The removal of low
   concentrations of substances like formaldehyde in aqueous medium offers
   new opportunities for resin catalysts and methylal formation with
   methanol in DCR has been realized in bringing down formaldehyde
   concentration from 1 to 2\% (wt) to as low as 0.02\%. Resin catalysts
   are useful for oligomerization of olefins like isobutylene, isoamylene,
   alpha-methyl styrene, etc.; cross-dimerization of olefins for making
   precursors for synthetic musks, can also be advantageously carried out.
   The alkylation of dissolved polyvinyl phenol with isobutylene, with
   resin catalysts is interesting in several ways. Many close-boiling
   substances, such as isomeric and non-isomeric phenolic substances, can
   be separated through selective reactions based on resin catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{This study comprised of 340 cases of extradural haematomas(EDHs) treated
   during a period of 10 Sears (1984-1994) in the division of Neurosurgery,
   Institute of Medical Sciences, Varanasi, Majority of them were rural
   patients (55.9\%), The commonest mode of injury was blunt impact to the
   head mainly by lathi in rural India (48.4\%), and road traffic accidents
   in urban population (60\%). Only 12\% of patients reached hospital
   within 6 hours of injury, Outcome is better in rural cases (11.5\%)
   inspite of late reporting to the hospital, Such cases are not usually
   associated with other injuries as impact is focal, Clot with less than
   50 ml, 50-100 ml and more than 100 ml had mortality rate 0\%, 12.5\% and
   18.7\% respectively; similarly outcome became poorer with increasing
   midline shift in computed tomography scan (1-4 mm: 0\%, 5-9 mm: 9.2\%
   and 10 mm or more : 29.8\%). The common site of EDH is temporal (42.2\%)
   in urban and parietal (51.6\%) in rural patients.}},

Abstract = {{Transplantation represents in the popular mind the pinnacle of
   biomedical knowledge and skill. Its feasibility depends upon the
   management of conflicting cultural values surrounding death and dying,
   where diverse parties consider bodies and their parts to be personal
   property, sacred entities, or offerings to the common good. Specifically
   within the specialized transplant community, viable organs are scarce,
   socially valuable resources. The ideology that guides transplant
   professionals, however, is rife with contradictions: close inspection
   reveals unease over definitions of death and rights to body parts.
   Ideological disjunction arises from the competing needs to personalize
   and to objectify organs and bodies. Organ recipients struggle with these
   contradictory messages as they rebuild their sense of self and
   self-worth following transplantation. This transformative process is
   explored by analyzing professional writings and data generated from
   ethnographic research in the United States. The study ends by examining
   transformed identity as fictionalized and extended biography.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainable management of fertilizer and manure P to minimize
   freshwater eutrophication requires identification of soil P levels that
   exceed crop P requirements and have the potential for P enrichment of
   runoff. Although several states have established such P levels,
   insufficient data are available to theoretically justify them. Thus,
   this study investigates the relationship between the concentrations of P
   in runoff and in soil. Surface samples (0-10 cm) of 10 oklahoma soils
   were packed in 0.15 m(2) boxes, incubated for 7 d with poultry litter
   (0-20 Mg ha(-1)) to obtain a range in Mehlich-3 P contents (7-360 mg
   kg(-1)), and received five 30-min rainfalls applied at 1-d intervals.
   The concentration of dissolved, bioavailable, and particulate P in
   runoff was related (r(2) > 0.90; P < 0.1) to the Mehlich-3 P content of
   surface soil (0-1 cm), with regression slopes ranging from 2.0 to 7.2,
   increasing as soil P sorption maxima increased (r(2) = 0.93). Two soils
   of 200 mg kg(-1) Mehlich-3 P supported a dissolved P concentration in
   runoff of 280 mu g L(-1) (San Saba clay; fine, montmorillonitic, thermic
   Udic Pellustert) and 1360 mu g L(-1) (Stigler silt loam; fine, mixed,
   thermic Aquic Paleudalf). Thus, relationships between runoff and soil P
   will have to be soil specific for use in management recommendations. A
   single linear relationship described the dependence of dissolved (r(2) =
   0.86) and bioavailable P (r(2) = 0.85) on soil P sorption saturation.
   The added complexity of the P saturation approach may limit its
   application; however, the approach integrates the effect of soil type
   with soil P content to better estimate the potential for P loss in
   runoff than soil P alone.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with cystic fibrosis have a high incidence of cholelithiasis.
   However, few studies have addressed the operative therapy for
   cholelithiasis in this group of patients with poor pulmonary function.
   We reviewed six patients with cystic fibrosis who were treated for
   symptomatic biliary stones. Five patients underwent cholecystectomy for
   chronic cholecystitis. One patient with extremely poor pulmonary status
   presented with choledocholithiasis and cholangitis, which was
   successfully treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by
   ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Five of these six patients had significant
   relief of their symptoms. One patient never recovered completely from
   the operation and eventually died from continued pulmonary
   deterioration. We conclude that in patients with cystic fibrosis and
   symptomatic biliary stones, careful attention to pulmonary care can
   afford safe, elective cholecystectomy. More conservative treatment is
   indicated in patients with marginal pulmonary reserve.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of dopamine (DA) receptors in the mesoaccumbens DA
   system was investigated with extracellular recording and
   microiontophoresis techniques in adult rats that received prenatal
   ethanol exposure and chronic postnatal amphetamine treatment. Pregnant
   rats were fed with a liquid diet containing 0 or 35\% ethanol-derived
   calories from gestation day 6 to 20. An ad libitum group received
   laboratory chow and water. Off-spring were injected with amphetamine (2
   mg/kg/day s.c.) or saline from postnatal day 22 to 10- to 12-months of
   age. Electrophysiological recording procedures were performed 16 to 24
   hr after the last amphetamine injection. A supersensitivity of
   somatodendritic DA autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area was
   observed in animals exposed prenatally to ethanol. This prenatal ethanol
   exposure-induced supersensitivity was not observed after postnatal
   amphetamine treatment. In control animals, postnatal amphetamine
   treatment did not affect the sensitivity of somatodendritic DA
   autoreceptors. The sensitivity of D-1 DA receptors in the nucleus
   accumbens was reduced by prenatal ethanol exposure. Postnatal
   amphetamine treatment reduced D-1 DA receptor sensitivity in control
   animals, but not in animals exposed prenatally to ethanol. Neither
   prenatal ethanol treatment nor postnatal amphetamine treatment altered
   the sensitivity of D-2 DA receptors in the nucleus accumbens. There were
   no differences between the ad libitum and 0\% ethanol-derived calorie
   groups, indicating undernutrition did not affect DA receptor function.
   These results show that prenatal ethanol exposure altered DA receptor
   function in the mesoaccumbens DA system in adult animals. Furthermore,
   postnatal amphetamine treatment was able to eliminate the
   supersensitivity of somatodendritic DA autoreceptors in prenatal
   ethanol-exposed animals.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if levels and function of
   G(s) alpha and G alpha(i-2) in rat hearts change over time following
   acute myocardial infarction (MI), and if so, whether the changes in G
   proteins are associated with changes in heart function. As compared with
   sham-operated controls, the G alpha(i-2) level of MI rats did not change
   at day 1, increased by 64\% at day 3 (P < 0.01) and by 55\% at day 9 (P
   < 0.05) accompanied by reduced adenylyl cyclase activity, and returned
   to control by day 21. By contrast, the G(s) alpha level did not change
   at any time. Cardiac function in MI animals was markedly impaired at
   days 1, 3, and 9 as evidenced by substantial elevation in LVEDP and
   reduction in maximum rates of pressure development and relaxation, and
   was partially restored at day 21. Increased G alpha(i-2) level in MI
   rats correlated significantly to severity of impaired cardiac function.
   The results show a three-phase dynamic pattern in G alpha(i-2) level
   following acute MI: a lag phase, an increased expression phase
   associated with marked impairment of heart function, and a late phase in
   which the expression returns to control level accompanied by partially
   restored cardiac function.}},

Abstract = {{The zebrafish has emerged as an important model system for the
   experimental analysis of vertebrate development because it is amenable
   to genetic analysis and because its optical clarity allows the movements
   and the differentiation of individual cells to be followed in vivo, In
   this paper, we have sought to characterize the spatial distribution of
   tissue progenitors within the outer cell layers of the embryonic shield
   region of the early gastrula, Single cells were labeled by iontophoretic
   injection of fluorescent dextrans, Subsequently, we documented their
   position with respect to the embryonic shield and their eventual fates,
   Our data show that progenitor cells of the neural, notochordal, semitic
   and endodermal lineages were all present within the embryonic shield
   region, and that these progenitors were arranged as intermingled
   populations, Moreover, close to the midline, there was evidence for
   significant biases in the distribution of neural and notochord
   progenitors between the layers, suggesting some degree of radial
   organization within the zebrafish embryonic shield region, The
   distributions of tissue progenitors in the zebrafish gastrula differ
   significantly from those in amphibians; this bears not only on
   interpretations of mutant phenotypes and in situ staining patterns, but
   also on our understanding of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation
   and of neural induction in the zebrafish.}},

Abstract = {{An optical fiber-bundle displacement sensor with subnanometer order
   resolution and low thermal drift is proposed. The setup is based on a
   carrier amplifier system and involves techniques to eliminate
   fluctuation in the light power of the source. The achieved noise level
   of the sensor was 0.03 nm/root Hz. The stability was estimated by
   comparing the outputs of two different sensors from the same target for
   4 ks (67 min). The relative displacements between the fiber bundle ends
   of the two sensors and the target surface varied in the area of 400 nm
   depending on the ambient temperature variation at 2 degrees C. However,
   the difference in output between the two sensor systems is within 2 nm
   for more than 1 hour of measurement. It is expected that it would be
   reduced to within the area of 0.1 nm if the ambient temperature were
   controlled to within +/-0.1 degrees C. It is concluded that the
   stability of the sensors is sufficiently good to be used with
   nanotechnological instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Although the two-point discrimination test of the skin is a simple test
   of the sensory nerve function, there have been few studies on
   age-related changes in the ability to discriminate between two points in
   a large noninstitutionalized population. In this study we attempted (1)
   to determine normal values on the two-point discrimination test by age
   and gender in a large population with a wide age span; (2) to describe
   age-related changes on the two-point discrimination test; and (3) to
   test the independence of this index from other indices measuring
   physiological aging by sensory functions, such as accommodation and
   hearing tests. The subjects were 2,036 men and women aged 10-87 years.
   The minimal distance at which two points could be discriminated was
   measured longitudinally on a line from the palmar pad to the base of the
   index finger of the right hand. The two points of a caliper were applied
   at the same time (stationary two-point discrimination test) using the
   weight of the caliper alone. An age-related decline in the ability to
   discriminate two points was apparent, but there were no significant
   differences in ability between men and women. The minimal distance of
   discrimination on the hand increased almost linearly between 10 and 60
   years of age. The results of the two-point discrimination test of the
   skin were independent of those of visual accommodation tests and hearing
   loss of high-frequency sound. From these results, the two-point
   discrimination test of the skin can be used as a powerful and simple
   index of sensory aging.}},

Abstract = {{Hot-carrier degradation of lightly doped drain (LDD) MOSFET's under ac
   stress is investigated. Enhanced ac degradation occurs in LDD MOSFET's
   as well as in single drain MOSFET's. However, there is a peculiar
   degradation mechanism in LDD MOSFET's. For single-drain MOSFET's,
   enhanced ac degradation appears in both threshold voltage and
   transconductance at stress drain voltages larger than a critical value.
   On the other hand, for LDD MOSFET's, although the enhanced degradation
   in threshold voltage and transconductance appears at stress drain
   voltages larger than a critical value, the enhanced degradation in
   transconductance appears even under stress drain voltages lower than the
   critical value. The difference in the ac-enhanced degradation between
   LDD and single-drain structures can be explained by a hot hole generated
   neutral-electron-trap model and the change in hot-hole-injected oxide
   region according to stress bias conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a member of heparin-binding growth
   factor, is a family of nine structurally related polypeptides showing
   multiple biological activities: angiogenesis, wound healing and
   development. FGF is known to exert its biological effects by interacting
   with both low-affinity receptor, heparan sulfate proteoglycan which is
   often substituted by heparin, and high-affinity receptor, receptor
   tyrosine kinase. Formation of ternary complex, heparin, FGF, and the
   high-affinity receptor seems to be essential for the subsequent
   intracellular events. Therefore to interrupt an interaction between
   these components is a good strategy for development of a new drug. Basic
   FGF (bFGF) is well known for its potent angiogenic effects. To examine a
   feasibility of heparin as a modulator of angiogenesis, the effect of
   heparin on the binding of bFGF to FGF receptor (FGFR) in the human
   endothelial cells was evaluated. As a preliminary step, we determined
   the subtype of FGFRs expressed in the endothelial cells from bovine
   glomerulus and aorta, respectively. To date, four different FGFRs have
   been cloned and analyzed. In the endothelial cells FGFR-1 was found to
   be expressed predominantly. In human endothelial cells and NIH 3T3 cells
   heparin inhibited the binding of bFGF to low-affinity receptors as well
   as to high-affinity receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosine
   phosphorylation of She and other cellular proteins by bFGF were
   accordingly reduced in the presence of heparin (20 mu g/ml). In
   addition, c-fos induction was blocked by the same concentration of
   heparin. Collectively, these data indicate that high concentration of
   heparin is inhibitory to the action of bFGF during a short period of
   time in vitro.}},

   bridge of telophase mammalian cells, the midbody, is recently

   reconstruction analysis, we show here that transiently associated
   midbody gamma-tubulin is localized at the minus ends of microtubules in
   the midbody structure. Using antisense RNA methods we also demonstrate
   that a selective depletion of transiently associated midbody
   gamma-tubulin causes an abortive cytokinesis due to a failure in the

Abstract = {{A possible profibrillatory effect on the atria of an elevated atrial
   pressure and the site of atrial stimulation was examined. In 15
   anesthetized dogs, right or left atrial or biatrial pacing was applied
   at a high rate (300-600/min) for 5 seconds at double threshold intensity
   under a wide range of atrial pressures achieved by venous or arterial
   transfusion or bleeding. Induction of atrial fibrillation in 236 of
   1,971 pacing runs was associated with a significantly higher (P < 0.001)
   atrial pressure (21.6 +/- 12.2 mmHg, mean +/- SD) than maintenance of
   sinus rhythm (16.8 +/- 11.1 mmHg in 1,735 of 1,971 pacing runs).
   Stimulation of the right atrium resulted in atrial fibrillation more
   frequently than left atrial or biatrial stimulation, with biatrial
   stimulation less frequent than right or left atrial stimulation. The
   induction of atrial fibrillation was related to the atrial pressure and
   to the site of stimulation but not to the pacing rate or the prepacing
   heart rate. The prepacing heart rate, associated with failure to induce
   sustained atrial fibrillation, was higher than that associated with
   atrial fibrillation in 12 of 15 experiments (significantly in 6) and not
   significantly lower in 3 of 15. Atrial fibrillation lasting 1 minute or
   more was more frequently associated with simultaneous stimulation of
   both atria than of either atrium alone. Thus, an elevated atrial
   pressure may facilitate the induction of atrial fibrillation. The site
   of stimulation also plays an important role for both the induction and
   maintenance of atrial fibrillation in this model.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatability estimates for litter size and weight, at birth and at day
   21, are reported for three breeds of pigs. The estimates ranged from
   0.122 to 0.185, averaging 0.149. The repeatabilities were used to
   maximize the genetic progress in litter traits per time unit, and a
   rough prediction of genetic progress in the sampled populations was
   provided. It was concluded that data from the first two litters should
   be used to obtain the maximum possible amount of genetic progress.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 65 epiphyte species (macrolichens, bryophytes, and a fern)
   were found on the branches of four 700-year-old Douglas fir trees, two
   growing in the forest interior and two growing on the edge of a
   20-year-old clearcut. The moss Antitrichia curtipendula and the
   cyanolichen Lobaria oregana dominated the epiphyte assemblages. Branch
   epiphyte assemblages were similar to those reported for a 450-year-old
   Douglas fir forest, but A. curtipendula and Pseudocyphellaria
   rainierensis were much more abundant in the older forest. Epiphyte
   species tended to be positively associated with other members of their
   functional group. Alectorioid and `'other'' lichens tended to be
   negatively associated with bryophytes. Several species were closely
   associated with moss mats. Ordination revealed one dominant gradient in
   epiphyte composition that was correlated with height. The gradient could
   be partitioned into an exposed portion with high lichen cover and low
   bryophyte cover, an intermediate portion, and a sheltered portion
   dominated by bryophytes. Biomass and species richness of macrolichen
   litterfall did not differ between the forest interior and clearcut edge,
   but there were some differences in the vertical distributions of
   epiphytes. The exposed and intermediate portions of the compositional
   gradient extended farther down in the crowns of the edge trees. After
   two decades of exposure on a clearcut edge, moss mats and associated
   species were still widely distributed within the edge tree crowns.}},

Abstract = {{Rab3 proteins are low molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding
   proteins that belong to the Ras superfamily and are believed to play a
   role in the final steps of exocytosis. To examine potential interactions
   of these proteins with signaling pathways that mediate pepsinogen
   secretion from gastric chief cells, we synthesized peptides
   corresponding to the effector domain of Rab3. In the absence of added
   calcium {[}calcium concentration ({[}Ca2+]) < 1 nM], a maximal
   concentration (15 mu M) of the Rab3 effector domain peptide or Rab3AL
   peptide, containing alanine and leucine substitutions, stimulated the
   release of 62 and 66\%, respectively, of total pepsinogen from
   streptolysin O-permeabilized chief cells. A Rab2AL peptide,
   corresponding to the Rab2 effector domain, and modified (scrambled and
   truncated) Rab3AL peptides did not alter secretion from permeabilized
   cells. An additive secretory response was observed when 5 mu M Rab3AL
   peptide was combined with increasing calcium ({[}Ca2+] < 1 nM to 3 mu M.
   In contrast, adding up to 3 mM adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate
   (cAMP) had no effect on Rab3AL peptide-induced secretion, and Rab3AL
   peptide did not alter endogenous cAMP production. The addition of a
   nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue {[}0.01 to 100 mu M guanosine
   5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)] potentiated the secretory response to Rab3AL
   peptide. This potentiated response indicates that other GTP-binding
   proteins are involved in calcium-independent secretion. Preincubation of
   cells with streptolysin O (10-30 min), to allow egress of cytosolic
   constituents, enhanced the response to Rab3AL peptide, suggesting that
   the target(s) for this peptide is (are) anchored to chief cell
   membranes. In summary, Rab3 effector domain peptides stimulate
   exocytosis from gastric chief cells in a specific, dose-dependent manner
   that is independent of changes in cellular mediators, such as calcium
   and cAMP. Moreover, these results suggest that, in gastric chief cells,
   the effector domain regions of Rab3 proteins may regulate pepsinogen
   secretion by interacting with membrane-associated target molecules.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1993, a major problem with the organophosphate
   insecticide, mevinphos (Phosdrin), occurred in Washington state apple
   orchards. At least 27 individuals required emergency room treatment or
   hospitalization from June 13, 1993, through August 18, 1993. Cases were
   identified and investigated through the state's pesticide surveillance
   program.
   This paper discusses the pesticide reporting system in Washington which
   has been in existence since 1990. It describes the toxicology of
   mevinphos and how its use in orchards created an environment conducive
   to human poisonings. Finally, it illustrates how a coordinated agency
   response eventually led to the suspension of mevinphos use on tree
   fruits and to better protection of the public health.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is now considered the first choice of
   treatment for aplastic anaemia and certain haematopoietic malignancies.
   In addition, BMT is being utilized in the treatment of an increasing
   number of individuals with haematological and non-haematological
   disorders, such as thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia,
   immunodeficiency syndromes, solid tumours and metabolic diseases. Recent
   advances in transplantation biology, such as the use of unrelated
   donors, partially matched marrow and peripheral and cord blood stem
   cells, have substantially increased the number of potential recipients
   for BMT. Although BMT is often a life-saving procedure, patients are
   exposed to potent therapies that may later cause serious complications.
   The preparative regimens commonly employed in the treatment of aplastic
   anaemia include high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day for 4 days),
   given alone or in combination with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) (1).
   In general, children undergoing BMT as a treatment for acute leukaemia
   receive high-dose chemotherapy (usually one or more alkylating agents,
   such as cyclophosphamide) plus total body irradiation (TBI) (2). The
   radiation can be given in a single dose or, more recently, has been
   given in multiple fractions, one to three times daily for several days
   (3). Busulphan and cyclophosphamide are being employed as an alternative
   to TBI by many centres, particularly in the treatment of non-lymphocytic
   leukaemias and thalassaemia.
   This article will review the effects of BMT during childhood on linear
   growth and endocrine function. As the commonest use of BMT is in the
   treatment of aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemia, most of the data
   available have been derived from studies performed in such patients.
   This review will therefore focus primarily an the endocrine sequelae
   following BMT in patients with aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemias.}},

Abstract = {{Resistance of Helicobacter pylori to metronidazole during therapy for
   gastroduodenal ulcers is claimed to be responsible for failure to
   eradicate the pathogen and thus the disease. Resistance to metronidazole
   and other nitroimidazoles is rare and documented only for anaerobes; the
   mechanism of resistance in typical microaerophiles, like Helicobacter,
   is not known. We have studied metronidazole uptake using high
   performance liquid chromatography in metronidazole sensitive and
   resistant strains of H. pylori under conditions of microaerophilia and
   in anaerobiosis. The uptake of metronidazole was faster in sensitive
   strains than resistant ones and was also increased in anaerobiosis. Drug
   uptake and the rate of cell kill was found to be dependent upon the
   relative oxygen tension of the environment and the cell density, both of
   which determine the redox conditions of the media.
   We suggest that resistance displayed in microaerophilia, but which
   disappears in anaerobiosis, may not involve futile cycling nor the
   induction of superoxide dismutase and catalase. We further propose that
   resistant organisms may have alterations in the pattern of pyruvate
   metabolism as documented for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa and that
   resistance in microaerophilia may involve the relative efficiencies of
   detoxifying oxygen in susceptible and resistant strains of H. pylori.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the ability of a biological marker (nitrogen excretion
   expressed as protein) to accurately reflect the protein intake of 12
   healthy subjects consuming a low protein diet (0.6 g protein/kg standard
   body wt). In this crossover study, protein intake was confirmed by
   chemically analyzing a duplicate of the constant diet each subject
   consumed for 3 d and by calculating protein content of self-selected
   diets recorded during two additional 3-d periods. Diet analysis matched
   excretion (difference 0.03 +/- 0.04 g protein/kg standard body wt, means
   +/- SEM). Self-selected intake manually calculated by subjects using
   educational materials matched the prescription {[}0.60 (0.42, 0.86) g
   protein/kg standard body wt, median (range)], but underestimated
   excretion by 0.18 +/- 0.02 g protein/kg standard body wt (means +/-
   SEM). Self-selected intake recalculated by the authors using a
   computerized database was only +0.05 (-0.08, +0.44) g protein/kg
   standard body wt higher than subjects' calculations, suggesting that
   discrepancies between databases and/or subject calculation errors only
   partially accounted for how greatly self-selected intake underestimated
   excretion. In a secondary analysis of self-selected intake, the three
   dietitian subjects consumed more energy and excreted less protein than
   nondietitians (137 +/- 4.9 vs. 94 +/- 3.5 kJ/standard body wt; 0.72 +/-
   0.02 vs. 0.83 +/- 0.02 g protein/kg standard body wt), suggesting that
   adequate energy intake and/or additional training might improve
   agreement between intake and excretion. Thus, discrepancies between
   protein excretion and reported intake may reflect factors other than
   willful noncompliance.}},

Abstract = {{Auditory hair cells that survive mechanical injury in culture begin
   their recovery by reforming the kinocilium. This study is based on
   cultures of the organ of Corti of newborn mice and two control animals.
   The axonemal patterns were examined in 165 kinocilia in cross-section In
   the immature and regenerating kinocilium, one of the normally peripheral
   doublets is frequently located inward, forming the modified 8+1 (double)
   form; the distribution of the remainingmicrotubules is irregular. As the
   cell matures, the 9+0 form predominates. Overall, 34-61\% of auditory
   kinocilia consist of 9+0 microtubules. The 9+2 (single) form, previously
   thought to characterize the organelle, occurs only in about 3-14\%,
   whereas the remaining population comprises the modified 8+1 (double)
   form. Normally, the kinocilium lasts only about 10 postnatal days;
   however, post-traumatic hair cells reform their kinocilia regardless of
   age. Concomitant with the regrowth of the kinocilium, the basal body and
   its cilium take a central location in the cuticular plate, stereocilia
   regrow, and the cytoplasmic area adjacent to the basal body displays
   pericentriolar fibrous densities, growth vesicles, and microtubules, all
   surrounded by actin filaments. Pericentriolar bodies nucleate
   microtubules. Involvement of microtubules is seen in the alignment of
   actin filaments and in the formation of the filamentous matrix of the
   cuticular plate. We propose that reformation of the kinocilium in
   recovering post-traumatic hair cells indicates the possible role of its
   basal body in the morphogenesis and differentiation of cuticular plates
   and stereocilia.}},

Abstract = {{The geochemistry of the mantle sources of island-are magmas is studied
   using the example of the Troodos ophiolite complex, which formed over a
   subduction zone. Mantle peridotites of the massif comprise spinel
   lherzolite, clinopyroxene-bearing harzburgite, and harzburgite. Their
   rock-forming minerals show a broad spectrum of compositions, which
   implies variable depletion of the mantle material in the basaltic
   component. Geochemistry of trace incompatible elements in the
   peridotitic pyroxene (examined on the basis of ion microprobe data)
   suggests that the contents of HREE in the clinopyroxene of the spinel
   lherzolite and clinopyroxene-bearing harzburgite make these rocks
   similar to the most clinopyroxene-depleted peridotites of mid-ocean
   ridges. The former pyroxenes are, however, strongly enriched in LREE.
   Spinel lherzolite of the Troodos Complex seems to have been produced by
   the fractional melting of a mantle source that chemically approximated
   the source of normal-type basalts of mid-ocean ridges. This source was
   entered by a subduction-related component with constant Zr: Sr: Ce: La =
   1:2.7:0.07:0.04. The typical harzburgites of this complex could not have
   formed in a closed system at the high melting degrees of the Troodos
   lherzolites. The most probable mechanism of their origin is the
   transformation of lherzolite as a result of its reaction with
   percolating mantle melts.}},

   be used for testing experimental subjects. The programs run on any
   IBM-compatible computer, and the resulting test data are stored in ASCII

   five regular and irregular preparatory intervals (PIs), and time
   estimation of 10 s with and without feedback was measured on normal
   adolescents and adults. For short PIs the adolescents had reaction times
   (RTs) similar to adults, but significant longer RTs than adults for long
   PIs. In the case of time estimation no differences between the two

   as an adjuvant, three intraperitoneal injections of 5 mu g of P4 pr P8
   antigen provided partial to complete protection of BALB/c mice
   challenged with 10(5) to 10(7) L. pifanoi promastigotes. These immunized
   mice developed significantly; smaller or no lesions and exhibited a 39-
   to 1.6 x 10(5)-fold reduction of lesion parasite burden after 15 to 20
   weeks of infection. In addition, P8 immunization resulted in complete
   protection against L. amazonensis infection of CBA/J mice and partial
   protection of BALB/c mice, suggesting that this antigen provided
   cross-species protection of mice with different H-2 haplotypes, At
   different stages during infection, vaccinated mice exhibited profound
   proliferative responses to parasite antigens and increased levels of
   gamma interferon production, suggesting that a Th1 cell-mediated immune
   response is associated with the resistance in these mice; Taken
   together, the data in this report indicate the vaccine potential of
   amastigote-derived antigens.}},

Abstract = {{Older adult memory performance declines with age. However, memory for
   newly learned material is only one measure of cognitive competence. This
   article reviews research that measured older adult cognitive performance
   using tasks that tap crystallized abilities, everyday problem solving,
   and those that used older expert subjects. The results indicate that
   many cognitive functions remain stable from middle age onward. This
   suggests that cognitive decline is not an inevitable result of aging per

   should be used as a segmentation variable for the older adult market.

Abstract = {{Trialkylsilanes or dialkylsilanes react rapidly with boron trichloride
   in the absence of ethereal solvents or other nucleophiles to form
   unsolvated dichloroborane. If no substrate is present, dichloroborane
   disproportionates to trichloroborane and two geometric isomers of
   chloroborane dimer, which in turn yield monochlorodiborane and, slowly
   but irreversibly, diborane. All of the B-H compounds in the mixture
   except diborane are highly active hydroborating agents. With alkenes in
   the presence of sufficient boron trichloride, the products are
   alkyldichloroboranes. These are free from detectable contamination by
   dialkylchloroboranes unless more than 1 mol of hydride is present.
   Similar hydroboration of terminal acetylenes can be controlled to yield
   either (E)-1-(dichloroboryl)alkenes or 1,1-bis(dichloroboryl)alkanes,
   each free from significant contamination by the other.
   Alkyldichloroboranes with trialkylsilanes at 25 degrees C produce
   alkylmonochloroboranes, detected by B-11 NMR.
   1,1-Bis(dichloroboryl)alkanes similarly yield 1,1-diborylalkane dimers.
   An alkylmonochloroborane can hydroborate a second alkene to form a
   dialkylchloroborane. For this purpose, differing alkyl groups may be
   introduced in either order, regardless of their relative steric
   properties. With 2 mol of trialkylsilane, alkyldichloroboranes are
   converted to alkylborane dimers. Boron tribromide and its bromoborane
   derivatives behave similarly to the chloro compounds in the examples
   tested.}},

Abstract = {{The discussion about the importance of new social movements as learning
   sites has focused on the understanding of their role as facilitators and
   providers of informal learning and education. Within Adult Education
   Quarterly Welton has contested Finger's emphasis on new social learning
   movements as `'strategies of individual survival'' by arguing they are
   concerned with collective goals and social purpose. However, even Welton
   has ignored the learning that is taking place in labor unions (old
   social movements) and therefore has privileged new social movements over
   old social movements as defenders of the `'lifeworld and ecosystem.''
   This paper contests this viewpoint and examines current Canadian labor
   education practices, concentrating on union education directed at
   environmental issues. It argues that labor is adopting some of the
   concerns and educational practices of new social movements and that old
   and new can learn from each other. A subsidiary argument is that labor
   continues to represent working people whereas new social movements are
   dominated by the middle class; therefore a truly `'collective defense''
   of the lifeworld and ecosystem must embrace labor's concerns.}},

Abstract = {{We studied susceptibility to herpes labialis by exposing 20 volunteers
   to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on three occasions at 3- to
   4-month intervals. The number of patients who developed lesions after
   each session was 9/20 (45\%), 9/20 (45\%) and 14/20 (70\%). Herpes
   simplex virus (HSV) was isolated from 21/29 (72\%) of lesions sampled.
   Three patients never developed a lesion, 13 developed lesions on one or
   two of the three occasions, and 4 patients had a lesion following all
   three sessions. Seven of 33 (21\%) lesions were `immediate' lesions
   (developed within 48 h) and the others developed 3-7 days after UVR
   exposure (delayed lesions). Development of lesions correlated with
   historical susceptibility to sun-induced herpes labialis, but not with
   age, sex, years with herpes labialis, frequency of herpes labialis from
   all causes, or concurrent serum levels of cortisol,
   dehydroepiandrosterone, estradiol, progesterone or alpha(1)-antitrypsin.
   Among normally menstruating females, a significant association was
   identified between the development of herpes labialis and the luteal
   phase of the menstrual cycle (8 cases of herpes labialis/11 attempts, RR
   = 14, P = 0.005). The lack of correlation between episodes of natural
   herpes labialis and susceptibility to experimental UVR-induced disease
   suggests that these events are controlled differently. The results of
   serial attempts to induce experimental herpes in each patient was most
   commonly inconsistent, indicating that individual patient susceptibility
   to UVR varies over time. While the explanation for this variation
   remains unclear, stages of the menstrual cycle may be important among
   women.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale ductile shear zones in high-grade metagabbros from the
   Caledonides of northern Sweden provide a good opportunity for examining
   the development of fabric and strain in rocks undergoing progressive
   non-coaxial deformation. The rocks contain strain markers in the form of
   aggregates of plagioclase feldspar. A selected shear zone is analyzed
   assuming monoclinic symmetry, which requires for the zone as a whole
   variable simple shear, variable volume change, or variable simple shear
   and volume change plus a homogeneous deformation. Both size of the
   feldspar aggregates and aspect ratio of the aggregates plotted against
   orientation indicate significant volume decrease (in excess of 50\%, and
   perhaps as much as 80\%) towards the centers of the zones. The data are
   broadly consistent with a deformation path involving constant shear
   strain across the zone followed by variable volume change or by a path
   of progressive loss of volume with increasing shear strain followed by a
   homogeneous strain. They are not consistent with a single path involving
   rates of shear strain and volume loss that are in constant proportions.
   There is little difference in chemical composition between the shear
   zone and the surrounding rock. An analysis of the concentrations of
   elements in the shear zone and wall rock suggests that volume changes
   were slight (< +/-15\%). The discrepancy between the values of volume
   change estimated from strain analysis and geochemical analysis may be
   resolved either by geochemical equilibration being attained after
   deformation or by a departure from the geometric constraints of the
   monoclinic `band' model for shear zones. Modification of marker particle
   size and shape during dynamic recrystallization may also partly account
   for the apparent volume loss.}},

Abstract = {{Although the cardioprotective effect of estrogen is well recognized, the
   mechanism by which this effect occurs is not well understood. One
   possible mechanism may involve an alteration in the local vascular
   equilibrium between prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)),
   favoring PGI(2). To test this hypothesis, we studied the estrogenic
   effect on urinary PGI(2)/TxB(2) balance, both acutely and long term, in
   postmenopausal women. Seven subjects received estradiol (E(2)) during
   one visit and only the vehicle during another visit (control). Both were
   administered intravenously for 8 h. Serum E(2) levels of similar to 200
   pg/ml were attained after E(2) treatment. An additional eight subjects
   were treated subcutaneously with two 25-mg E(2) pellets for 24 weeks;
   the serum E(2) levels averaged between 80 and 120 pg/ml. Also, 12
   premenopausal women were used for comparison of baseline prostanoid
   values with those of postmenopausal women. A highly specific and
   sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay
   (HPLC-RIA) was used to quantitate PGI(2) and TxA(2) by measuring their
   stable metabolites, 6-keto-prostaglandin F-1 alpha (6-keto-PGF(1 alpha))
   and thromboxane B-2 (TxB(2)), respectively, in urine. The 6-keto-PGF(1
   alpha) and TxB(2) levels in postmenopausal women were 35.6 +/- 6.5 and
   20.5 +/- 3.8 ng/g of creatinine compared with 32.2 +/- 5.3 and 16.7 +/-
   3.9 ng/g in premenopausal women, respectively. After E(2) infusion,
   there was a significant increase (41\%) in mean 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)
   levels, a 35\% drop in mean TxB(2) levels, and a significantly greater
   (65\%) 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)/TxB(2) ratio, compared to the controls. After
   long-term E(2) treatment, there was a progressive decrease in mean
   TxB(2) levels and a transient increase in 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) levels.
   The results of our study suggest that the anticipated effects of E(2)
   treatment on PGI(2) and TxA(2) metabolism in postmenopausal women do
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{We present maps at 20'' resolution of the molecular emission around 18
   evolved stars (14 asymptotic giant branch stars, one supergiant, two
   proto-planetary nebulae, and one planetary nebula), mostly in the
   (CO)-C-12(3-2) line. Almost all molecular envelopes appear to be at
   least marginally resolved at this resolution. A substantial fraction of
   the molecular envelopes show clear deviations from spherical symmetry in
   the form of elliptical or bipolar envelopes. This indicates that there
   is a need to implement nonspherical mass loss in current scenarios of
   the late stages of stellar evolution, in particular on the asymptotic
   giant branch.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of beta-lactam compounds to induce synthesis of the class C
   beta-lactamase of Citrobacter freundii was assessed both directly and
   indirectly, the latter by measurement of the different susceptibilities
   of strains with inducible and derepressed beta-lactamase synthesis and
   those of a beta-lactamase-negative strain. Most beta-lactam compounds
   were poor inducers but ampicillin, amoxycillin and cephalexin were
   moderately good inducers and cefoxitin, imipenem and meropenem were
   strong inducers. The ability of the compounds to select mutants in which
   the synthesis of the beta-lactamase was derepressed was also assessed.
   Imipenem and temocillin, which had a high degree of stability to the
   beta-lactamase failed to select such mutants or were very poor
   selectors. In contrast, most other compounds showed considerable
   lability to the beta-lactamase and readily selected derepressed mutants,
   whether they were strong inducers of beta-lactamase synthesis (for
   example cefoxitin) or poor inducers (cefotaxime, ceftazidime and many
   other compounds). Thus it appears that lability to the beta-lactamase is
   a more important factor in determining whether or not a compound will
   select derepressed mutants than the power of the compound as an inducer
   of beta-lactamase synthesis, since induction results in the production
   of less beta-lactamase than derepression as a result of mutation.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating endothelin (ET) levels are elevated in conditions such as
   endotoxemia, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, or orthotopic liver
   transplantation, and this potent peptide may contribute to hepatic
   pathophysiology. We measured the surface binding of {[}I-125]ET-1 to rat
   Kupffer cells in primary culture at 4 degrees C; the apparent
   dissociation constant (K-d) was 270 pmol/L, and the apparent B-max was
   3,000 receptors/cell. At 37 degrees C, total association (surface
   binding plus internalization) was much greater than at 4 degrees C,
   indicating that internalization of the receptor-ligand complex is rapid;
   the apparent K-d was 30 pmol/L, comparable with other reports for
   hepatic-derived cells. Studies using {[}I-125]ET-1, {[}I-125]ET-3, and
   specific ET (ant)agonists showed that Kupffer cells possess
   predominantly ET(B) type receptors. Prior treatment with 500 pmol/L
   unlabeled endothelin rapidly (<15 minutes) occluded 60\% of subsequent
   {[}I-125]ET association; using 5 nmol/L unlabeled ET, this occlusion
   occurred within 1 minute. {[}(125)]ET association with Kupffer cells was
   unaffected by short-term (approximate to 1 hour) treatment with cyclic
   adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), but long-term (20 hour) treatment
   resulted in a twofold increase in {[}I-125]ET association with no change
   in the apparent K-d. Stimulation of protein kinase C in Kupffer cells by
   phorbol 12-myristate acetate had a dual regulatory effect on {[}I-125]ET
   association. Short-term (<1 hour) treatment with phorbol 12-myristate
   acetate decreased {[}I-125]ET-3 association by 50\%, whereas prolonged
   treatment (20 hour) increased association twofold. In both cases, the
   apparent K-d for {[}I-125]-endothelin was unaltered.}},

Abstract = {{Three long piston cores from the deep Labrador Sea appear to record Late
   Pleistocene variations of relative paleointensity of the geomagnetic
   field. Two cores extend at least into isotope stage 6, the other into
   stage 5. In addition to delta(18)O, delta(13)C and AMS C-14
   stratigraphies, correlation between cores is facilitated by the presence
   of rapidly deposited high detrital carbonate (DC) and low detrital
   carbonate (LDC) layers, some of which correlate to the North Atlantic
   Heinrich events. Hysteresis ratios and rock magnetic parameters indicate
   that the magnetic assemblage in the cores is pseudo-single domain
   magnetite. Except for deglacial intervals and DC and LDC layers,
   normalized remanence records show strong correlation for a range of
   normalizers (k, k(ARM) and SIRM) and no correlation with bulk magnetic
   parameters. Paleointensity records from the three cores are consistent
   when only DC and LDC layers are used for correlation, suggesting that
   relative paleointensity can be used as a regional correlation tool.
   Consistent paleointensity features from the Labrador Sea, Indian Ocean
   and Mediterranean Sea suggest that the sediments are recording dipole
   field variations. Although the composite record from two Labrador Sea
   cores is strongly correlated to a composite of the Mediterranean/Indian
   Ocean records, the chronologies are inconsistent, indicating apparent
   discrepancies in the isotopic and AMS C-14 chronologies used in the
   Mediterranean/Indian Ocean and Labrador Sea, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the effects of viscosity on the inviscid stability of the
   Batchelor {[}J. Fluid Mech. 20, 645 (1964)] vortex in a compressible
   flow. The problem is tackled asymptotically, in the limit of large a
   (streamwise and azimuthal) wavenumbers, together with large Mach
   numbers. This problem, with Viscous effects neglected, was discussed in
   Stott and Duck {[}J. Fluid Mech. 268, 323 (1994)]. The authors found
   that the nature of the solution passes through different regimes as the
   Mach number increases, relative to the wave number. This structure
   persists when viscous effects are included in the analysis. In the
   present study, as in that mentioned above, the mode present in the
   incompressible case ceases to be unstable at high Mach numbers and a
   center mode forms, whose stability characteristics are determined
   primarily by conditions close to the vortex axis. We find generally that
   viscosity has a stabilizing influence on the flow, whilst in the case of
   center modes, viscous effects become important at much larger Reynolds
   numbers than for the first class of disturbance. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{The microstructure of four specimens of the martensitic cast steel
   GX12CrMoVNbN9-1 crept to fracture at 873 K for 220-33027 h was

   pores, and oxidation layers. The laws of time-dependent coarsening of
   particles and strain-controlled growth of subgrains are consistent with
   those previously established for X20(22)CrMoV12-1. Using these data the
   microstructural model of deformation developed for X20(22)CrMoV12-1 can
   explain the creep behaviour of GX12CrMoVNbN9-1. The minimum in creep
   rate is related to the coarsening of particles and subgrains. At low
   stresses (< 140 MPa) the fraction of small slowly coarsening V- and
   Nb-containing particles leads to improved creep resistance. The material
   resists against pore formation; fracture occurs by necking.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To assess the medium-term results of total cavopulmonary
   shunt operations in children with left atrial isomerism, interrupted
   inferior vena cava, and complex congenital heart defects.
   Background-Creation of a total cavopulmonary shunt provides very good
   interim palliation for children with interrupted inferior vena cava and
   complex congenital heart disease; however, longer term results after
   this operation have not been reported.
   Methods-Detailed follow up of six children who underwent creation of a
   total cavopulmonary shunt at a tertiary referral centre.
   Results-There were no early or late deaths. Oxygen saturations at
   discharge ranged from 89\% to 92\% (mean 90\%). At last follow up (mean
   4.7 years) saturations at rest ranged from. 73\% to 81\% (mean 77\%) (P
   < 0.05). All patients underwent exercise stress testing. At peak
   exercise oxygen saturations ranged from 62\% to 87\% (mean 71.5\%) and
   during recovery from 68\% to 85\% (mean 78\%). Cardiac catheterisation
   was performed in five patients with saturations of less than 80\% at
   rest or peak exercise. No patient had pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.
   Systemic venous to hepatic venous collaterals were documented in four
   patients. These were localised below the diaphragm in three and above
   the diaphragm in one patient. The collateral vessel was successfully
   embolised in three of these patients, with a rise in resting oxygen
   saturations from 6 to 10\% (mean 7\%).
   Conclusions-The development of systemic venous to hepatic venous
   collaterals is a common complication in patients who undergo a total
   cavopulmonary shunt operation. This can lead to significant desaturation
   at rest and during exercise. Detailed angiographic studies of the
   infradiaphragmatic systemic veins is required for diagnosis.
   Transcatheter embolisation of such vessels gives good relief.}},

Abstract = {{In cultures of isolated mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans,
   transdifferentiation into tracheary elements is induced by a combination
   of auxin and cytokinin and is blocked by inhibitors of DNA synthesis and
   poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis. During transdifferentiation, a very low
   level of synthesis of nuclear DNA was found in some cultured cells by
   microautoradiography after pulse-labeling with {[}H-3]thymidine. Density
   profiles of nuclear DNA that had been double-labeled in vivo with
   bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and {[}H-3]thymidine indicated that this DNA
   synthesis was repair-type synthesis. The sedimentation velocity of
   nucleoids increased during the culture of isolated mesophyll cells and
   the increase was dependent on phytohormones. This phenomenon may reflect
   the rejoining of DNA strand breaks after repair-type DNA synthesis
   during transdifferentiation. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of DNA
   synthesis or of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis prevented the increase in the

   previously shown to recognize the epitope FLRGRAYGL. The ability of
   substituted peptides to sensitize target cells for lysis by this clone
   was investigated using two peptide replacement sets, one synthesized
   with free carboxyl termini and another made with a carboxyl terminal
   beta-alanine-diketopiperazine (beta A-DKP) group. Curiously, the effect
   of certain substitutions differed for the two peptide sets. For example,
   NH2-FLRGRAYGL-beta A-DKP was 15-fold more active than NH2-FLRGRAYG1-beta
   A-DKP, but NH2-FLRGRAYGL-COOH had the sm?le activity as
   NH2-FLRGRAYGI-COOH. Evidence presented here illustrates that the
   activity of beta A-DKP peptide preparations was entirely due to
   contaminating peptides with free-COOH termini. The amount of active-COOH
   contaminants within alpha-beta A-DKP preparation thus appeared to vary
   depending on the substitution, resulting in some anomalous results from
   replacement set analysing using -beta A-DKP peptides.}},

Abstract = {{Although folate receptors (FRs) mediate folate uptake into cells, the
   independent role of FRs in cell proliferation remains unclear. We tested
   the hypothesis that transduction of FR cDNA in sense or antisense
   orientation using recombinant adeno-associated virus modulated FR
   expression and altered proliferation of cervical carcinoma cells (which
   constitutively overexpress FR genes). We determined that the integration
   of recombinant adeno-associated virions was not site specific. When
   compared with untransduced cells, sense and antisense FR cDNA-transduced
   cells exhibited an increase and decrease in FR mRNA and FR expression on
   the cell surface, respectively. However, when compared with antisense FR
   cDNA-transduced and untransduced cells, sense FR cDNA-transduced cells
   exhibited statistically significant (a) increases in total FRs, (b)
   smaller colonies, (c) lowered cell proliferation in vitro, and (d) less
   tumor volume with dramatic prolongation of tumor doubling times (225.6 h
   vs. 96 h) after transplantation into nude mice. Finally, (f) using
   single cell-derived transduced clones, an inverse relationship between
   cell proliferation and FR expression was established (r = 0.90, P <
   0.001). Thus, transduction of sense/antisense FR cDNA into cervical
   carcinoma cells modulated expression of BRs and had an impact on cell
   proliferation in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the use of fibrin glue sealing of the pancreatic
   stump for the prevention of postoperative pancreatic fistulas.
   Design: A prospective, randomized clinical trial.
   Patients and Methods: Fibrin glue is a biologic adhesive consisting of
   highly concentrated human fibrinogen, thrombin, and factor VIII.
   Twenty-six of 56 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for
   gastric cancer or pancreatic disease were randomly assigned to the
   fibrin glue group. Fibrin glue was applied to the suture line of the
   pancreatic stump with the ligated main pancreatic duct. Pancreatic
   fistula was defined as a pancreatic fluid discharge for over 7
   postoperative days diagnosed by local findings, with amylase
   concentration in the discharge fluid more than three times the serum
   amylase concentration, a level low enough that even a small pancreatic
   leakage could be diagnosed.
   Results: The overall incidence of pancreatic fistula was 28.6\%.
   Postoperative pancreatic fistulas occurred in four patients (15.4\%) in
   the fibrin glue group and 12 (40.0\%) in the control group (P=.04). The
   lower pancreatic fistula rate was seen in the fibrin glue group also
   when analyzing patients with gastric cancer or pancreatic disease only,
   although there was no statistically significant difference.
   Conclusions: Intraoperative use of fibrin glue following distal
   pancreatectomy could prevent pancreatic fistula formation. This method
   was feasible, safe, and reliable and will complement other prophylactic
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The degree to which pulmonary angiography may
   contribute to serious complications in patients with pulmonary
   hypertension has not been clarified and remains a matter of debate.
   Accordingly, this study was designed (1) to detect the potential release
   of vasoactive peptides and (2) to investigate the hemodynamic response
   after administration of a nonionic contrast medium in patients with
   pulmonary hypertension undergoing pulmonary angiography.
   Allergy-mediating substances also were measured to monitor for possible
   anaphylactoid reactions.
   METHODS. Pulmonary digital subtraction angiography was performed in 20
   patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure
   more than 20 mm Hg). Iopromide was administered as a total of 100 mL via
   a 7F catheter inserted from the right femoral vein. The injected volume
   and duration of injection (15 to 20 mL/sec) were kept constant.
   Hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored, including
   electrocardiogram, heart rate, phasic and mean pulmonary arterial and
   peripheral arterial pressures. Blood samples were obtained before and
   after administration of contrast media to assay for the concentration of
   the following vasoactive peptides using radioimmunoassay techniques:
   renin, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme, angiotensin II, aldosterone,
   atrial natriuretic peptide, antidiuretic hormone, cyclic-guanosine
   monophosphate, and myoglobin, as well as allergy-mediating substances
   such as tryptase, eosinophil protein X, and eosinophil cationic protein.
   RESULTS. Administration of iopromide caused significant increases in
   atrial natriuretic peptide (from 61.3 +/- 11.8 to 94.0 +/- 16.7) and
   antidiuretic hormone (from 6.6 +/- 1.9 to 12.3 +/- 3.1), whereas renin
   significantly decreased (from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.5). After
   administration of contrast media, there were no significant changes in
   the other measured vasoactive peptides, allergy-mediating substances,
   and monitored cardiovascular parameters.
   CONCLUSION. Administration of iopromide for pulmonary angiography in
   patients with pulmonary hypertension resulted in no appreciable
   hemodynamic alterations associated with the observed changes in atrial
   natriuretic peptide, antidiuretic hormone, and renin. No
   allergy-mediated reactions were observed in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to determine if levator veli palatini muscle

   and nasal air flow when a speech appliance is in place, The speech
   appliances routinely worn by 15 subjects were each modified
   experimentally by drilling a hole in the vertical center of the
   pharyngeal bulb, The air flow rate into the nasal cavity through the
   opening in the bulb was altered by changing the circular area of the
   opening in the bulb from the occluded condition (Condition I), to
   circular area of 12.6 mm(2) (4 mm in diameter; Condition II), and then
   to 38.5 mm(2) (7 mm in diameter; Condition III), Electromyographic
   activity was measured from the levator veil palatini muscle with changes
   in nasal air flow rate and oral air pressure, Levator veil palatini
   muscle activity was correlated with changes in nasal air flow and oral
   air pressure, Increases in levator veil palatini muscle activity were
   associated with increases in nasal air Row rate compared to oral air
   pressure changes, The results indicated that aerodynamic variables of
   nasal air flow and oral air pressure might be involved in the neural
   control of speech production in individuals wearing a speech appliance,
   even if the subjects exhibit velopharyngeal incompetence without using a
   speech appliance. Also, the stimulating effect of bulb reduction therapy
   on velopharyngeal function might be achieved through the change in
   aerodynamic variables in association with the bulb reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Acarbose is an inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidase and has been
   reported to decrease blood glucose concentrations and glycosuria in
   diabetic patients and animals. In this study we investigated whether
   this drug could prevent the abnormalities detected in retinal
   circulation of diabetic rats. Longitudinal paired studies were performed
   and the changes in retinal circulation were analyzed using video based
   fluorescein angiography (VFA) methodology in the same animal. Baseline
   VFA recordings were obtained from 41 rats. These rats were separated
   into 4 different groups: In group A (n = 12), diabetes was induced by
   streptozotocin (STZ) injection and the rats were fed with acarbose (40
   mg/100 g powdered chow) mixed into regular rat chow; In group B (n =
   10), diabetes was induced by STZ injection and the rats were fed with
   normal chow; Tn group C (n = 9), the non-diabetic rats were fed with
   acarbose; In group D (n = 10), the non-diabetic rats were fed with
   normal chow. At the end of 2 weeks, all rats again underwent VFA
   recordings. Blood glucose levels and body weights of rats were monitored
   during the experiment. The mean blood glucose concentration of Group B
   was raised from 98.5 +/- 8.7 to 342 +/- 30 mg/dl after STZ injection
   while in Group A, this change in glucose level was partially ameliorated
   by acarbose (from 102 +/- 15 to 247 +/- 48 mg/dl). In Group C and D, the
   blood glucose levels were not significantly changed during the
   experiment. In Group B, a paired t-test analysis demonstrated that
   retinal blood flow in the untreated diabetic rats decreased
   significantly (p = 0.0001) 2 weeks after induction of diabetes (76.4 +/-
   24.1 pixel(2)/s) compared to baseline (141.3 +/- 20.3 pixel(2)/s). In
   contrast, the acarbose treated diabetic rats in Group A showed no
   significant differences between blood flow before (140.1 +/- 21.6
   pixel(2)/s) and after induction of diabetes (133.4 +/- 16.5 pixel(2)/s).
   There were no significant changes in retinal blood flow in the
   non-diabetic rat groups (Group C acarbose fed and Group D normal chow).
   These results suggest that acarbose can prevent the abnormalities
   detected in retinal circulation probably associated with decreasing the
   blood glucose concentration.}},

Abstract = {{A metal-dependent dipeptidase was purified to homogeneity from a cell
   extract of Lactobacillus helveticus SET 2171 by fast protein liquid
   chromatography, The enzyme was purified 237-fold from the extract, with
   a yield of 1.8\%, Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed a single protein band with
   a molecular weight of 50,000, The dipeptidase hydrolyzes a range of only
   dipeptides. Dipeptides containing proline, glutamic acid, and aspartic
   acid are not hydrolyzed. The enzyme was shown to be a metalloenzyme with
   a pH optimum of 8.0 and a temperature optimum of 55 degrees C,
   Dithiol-reducing reagents exert strong inhibition on enzyme activity.
   Kinetic studies indicated that the enzyme has a relative average
   affinity for leucyl-leucine (K-m, 0.5 mM), The negative immunoresponse
   of the purified enzyme with monoclonal antibodies raised against a
   dipeptidase hom Lactococcus lactis subsp, cremoris Wg2 shows that both

   from monitoring sensor data information and allow him to concentrate on
   the higher level interpretation of the occurrence of events. Based on an
   object-oriented programming style, the paper discusses how the CFPN is
   constructed to provide a software support environment to aid process

Abstract = {{The recovery of a Cistus shrubland after experimental treatments
   (cutting, burning and ploughing) was studied to determine qualitative
   and quantitative differences in the secondary succession. The study was
   carried out in three experimental plots of 100 m(2) each, in which five
   1 m(2) sampling units were fixed and surveyed for five years, estimating
   cover percentage of each plant species. The data were analysed by means
   of affinity indexes (Sorensen and Steinhaus Indexes). The results
   indicated that the cover of the woody species increased progressively,
   but the degree of recovery depended on the treatment, as well as on the
   time afterwards. The number of these species remained almost constant
   throughout the whole period. The herbaceous species diversity was higher
   in the two first years in all treatments. When treatments were compared,
   the greatest diversity occurred after cutting. The regeneration of the
   community occurred by autosuccession in which the diversity decreased
   when the dominance of Cistus increased, unlike the general trend of the
   classical theories. The recovery was very quick after all three
   treatments, which can be interpreted as a great resilience of this
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in human lead exposure were reconstructed by lead analyses of
   ancient teeth and bones, as lead accumulates in calcified tissues. As a
   consequence of research on wildlife species as biomonitors for
   environmental pollution, red deer antlers were considered as indicators
   for temporal and regional changes of environmental contamination by
   pollutants such as lead and strontium-90. The chemical composition of
   the antler is similar to that of other bony tissues in the body. As many
   hunters keep antlers as trophies even from a long time ago, without any
   conservational treatment but with an exact listing of the date and place
   of shooting, the antlers represent valuable samples for environmental
   research, especially reconstruction of pollution of the past decades
   when modern analytical techniques did not exist.
   The primary focus of this study was to compare pollution by lead before
   and after the introduction of lead additives to vehicle's fuel and the
   impact of radioactive strontium-90 to the environment. Results of Sr-90
   analyses will be published in another paper (Schonhofer et al. 1994).}},

   INVOLVING BCL-2 PROTOONCOGENE EXPRESSION IN HUMAN BREAST-CANCER CELLS}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the Bcl-2 protein suppresses programmed
   cell death or apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli including
   chemotherapeutic drugs, Because estrogen promotes the survival of
   estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells in vivo, we investigated whether
   estrogen might regulate levels of Bcl-2 gene expression in an
   estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell line, Estrogen
   receptor-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells cultured in the
   presence of estrogen express the 8.5-kb Bcl-2 mRNA transcript. Depletion
   of estrogen from the medium results in loss of expression of the mRNA,
   whereas reexposure to estrogen markedly induces the Bcl-2 transcript,
   The changes in Bcl-2 mRNA are paralleled by changes in Bcl-2 protein
   levels, Estrogen-induced increases in Bcl-2 are significantly inhibited
   by inclusion of the pure antiestrogen ICI 164,384 in the medium. The Bax
   protein that heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 and promotes cell death is
   expressed in MCF-7 cells grown in the presence of estrogen and is
   unaffected by culture in estrogen-free medium, Estrogen depletion
   doubles the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to the cytotoxic effects of
   Adriamycin compared with cells cultured in medium supplemented with
   estrogen, consistent with a decrease in the Bcl-2 levels, MCF-7 cells
   treated simultaneously,vith estrogen and ICI 164,384 exhibit markedly
   lower resistance to Adriamycin compared with cells treated with estrogen
   alone, In the absence of estrogen, MCF-7 cells transfected with Bcl-2
   expression plasmids display a marked increase in resistance to
   Adriamycin. In the presence of estrogen, MCF-7 cells expressing Bcl-2
   antisense transcripts are rendered twice as sensitive to acute
   Adriamycin cytotoxicity as a control clone, We conclude that estrogen
   can promote resistance of estrogen receptor bearing human breast cancer
   cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through a mechanism that involves
   regulation of the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in offspring size within and between broods, between
   populations and between species is quantified for six species of
   woodlice (Crustacea; Oniscidae) from southern Africa. The range of
   offspring size within a brood was large, frequently more than 50\% of
   the total range for the population, suggesting that females partition
   resources unevenly between offspring and thereby `hedge their
   evolutionary bets'. Significant differences in mean offspring size for
   broods from different females did not correlate with female size,
   fertility or reproductive allocation. if female condition is an
   important determinant of offspring size then measures other than female
   size or reproductive allocation may be needed to quantify it.
   Interpopulation differences in mean offspring size were not always
   significant. Statistically significant between-species differences in
   mean offspring size may be less important than selection for increases
   in fecundity.}},

Abstract = {{Responses to hypoxia of lung arteries (200-350 mu m) from control (C)
   and chronically hypoxic (CH) rats were compared in a myograph before and
   after blockade of NO synthase with N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester
   (L-NAME). After precontraction with prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2
   alpha)), hypoxia caused a four-phase tension change: brief dilation,
   transient contraction, prolonged dilation, and slow contraction (we
   studied the first three phases). In CH rats, the first dilation and
   first contraction were significantly reduced. After L-NAME, the first
   dilation was reduced in C rats and abolished in CH rats; thus the first
   phase is attributable to NO release and is affected by chronic hypoxia.
   The first contractile phase was significantly reduced by L-NAME in C but
   not in CH rats, where it was small. Thus NO synthase inhibition inhibits
   hypoxic constriction in isolated vessels, whereas it enhances hypoxic
   constriction in perfused lungs. The third dilator phase was unaffected
   by chronic hypoxia; it was increased after L-NAME in CH rats. Thus, in
   vitro, responses to hypoxia are complex; there is a balance between two
   dilator and two constrictor processes.}},

Volume = {{155}},

Abstract = {{Furosemide has been reported to produce disproportional changes in blood
   flow in cortical zones and to inhibit tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF),
   suggesting that furosemide might alter the intracortical distribution of
   glomerular filtrate. We have tested this hypothesis by a new method for
   measuring local and total glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on
   proximal tubular accumulation of the basic polypeptide aprotinin (mel wt
   6513). Local GFR was calculated in tissue samples dissected from outer
   cortex (OC), inner cortex (IC) and the corticomedullary border zone (CM)
   from the plasma clearances of two aprotinin tracers injected i.v, before
   and after a 3 min i.v. infusion of 25 mg kg(-1) furosemide. The mean of
   five samples from each region was used to determine zonal GFR. Isotonic
   saline was infused at a rate corresponding to urine flow. Furosemide
   reduced whole kidney GFR from 1.17 to 1.00 mL min(-1) and gave a similar
   reduction of renal artery blood flow. Urine flow increased from 0.6 to
   17\% of GFR. Haematocrit (similar to 0.48) and plasma protein
   concentration (similar to 55 mg mL(-1)) were maintained while the
   arterial blood pressure tended to decline (118 +/- 5 mmHg to 108 +/- 6
   mmHg, P < 0.05). GFR in OC, IC and CM (1.58, 1.18, 0.42 mt min(-1)
   g(-1)) fell to 87, 88 and 88\% of control after furosemide infusion
   respectively. The furosemide/control ratio for each sample showed a
   coefficient of variation of about 3\%. We conclude that furosemide
   produced a modest GFR reduction that was uniform throughout the renal
   cortex. The homogenous GFR response suggests a similar TGF constriction
   tone in preglomerular vessels of deep and superficial nephrons.}},

Abstract = {{Cis-acting elements of the gene for mouse glycophorin, an
   erythroid-specific membrane glycoprotein, were determined by transient
   and stable transfection assays using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells,
   Cis-acting elements proximal to the transcription start site of the gene
   can be separated into the basal promoter (-1 to -91 bp) and the distal
   element (-133 to -92). The basal promoter contained GGTGG and GATA
   motifs and the distal element contained GATA-1 and NF-EB motifs.
   Deletion analysis of the distal GATA site and its neighboring sequence
   and DNase-I footprinting/EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay)
   analysis indicated that induced nuclear factor binding to GATA-1 and its
   neighboring sequence may be required for expression during MEL cell
   differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment, The NF-EB site
   was also shown to be essential for the promoter activity, An
   approximately 400bp far upstream region (-1325 to -948bp) containing the
   binding motifs for GGGTGG, GATA-1 and NF-ES showed no enhancing activity
   when this region was examined by transient transfection assay, but it
   did show enhancement of the differentiation-specific promoter activity
   in the stable transfection assay, The far upstream region of mouse

Abstract = {{The Cambay rift basin in northwestern India is one of the three basins
   that originated between the early Jurassic and Tertiary, during India's
   drift after the break-up of Gondwanaland. The thickness of the
   Quaternary and Tertiary sediments in some parts of the basin varies
   between 3000 and 5500 m. These sediments are underlain by the Deccan
   trap volcanics which form the basement of the Tertiary sediments. The
   presence of a high velocity lower crust and crustal thinning across the
   Cambay basin are in agreement with the geochronological model of
   volcanic accretion for the Deccan traps. The large thickness of
   volcanics in the Cambay basin, estimated to be between 1000 and 3200 m,
   and their rapid eruption suggest that the Cambay rift originated in late
   Cretaceous. Large post-volcanic subsidence of the rift is evidenced by
   the presence of up to 4000 m thick Tertiary sediments which were
   deposited in various phases of basin development. The first phase of
   basin subsidence appears to be associated to the rapid withdrawal of the
   magma from the Reunion mantle plume due to the proximity of the Cambay
   rift to the axis of the plume.}},

Abstract = {{Lend poisoning of migratory waterbirds from spent lend shot and lost
   lend fishing weights occurs commonly throughout the United States and
   Canada. Nontoxic substitutes for these products are available but are
   not required widely beyond the mandatory use in waterfowl hunting in the
   United States. That country banned the use of lend shot waterfowling in
   1991 and is proposing a national ban on the manufacture and trade in
   lead fishing weights. Canada has not reciprocated with parallel
   requirements, despite its being a signatory to the 1916 Migratory Bird
   Treaty between the United States and Canada, designed to protect
   migratory birds throughout their annual North American range. Lend-free
   shot is required for waterfowling in only a few small zones across
   Canada. In Canada, both federal and provincial regulations could be used
   to effect bans on the rise of lead shot and sinkers. However, the
   current policy of the Canadian government is to move with the provinces
   on this issue rather than impose a national standard. In both countries
   there is opposition to the use of nontoxic materials by some sporting
   organizations and some state/provincial agencies. There is reluctance to
   implement the precautionary principle and apply established prudent
   courses of action to resolve these wildlife issues. A wide array of
   international conventions and national legislation exists to regulate
   the use of nontoxic shot and sinkers in North America. In addition,
   environmental regulations tender the North American Free Trade Agreement
   and the terms of the North American Agreement on Environmental
   Cooperation could be applied at the commercial level to prevent further
   environmental contamination and lend poisoning of waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Although personality is theoretically composed of multiple facets that
   function in lively interrelatedness, the interplay among these
   multiplicities has mostly been missed by research that focuses on traits
   as the primary unit of personality. The juxtaposition of contrary
   interpersonal scripts is a promising way to capture dynamic processes of
   personality. A case study is used to illustrate the dynamic interplay
   between sociotropic (extraverted) and avoidant scripts. Whereas standard
   trait measures do not reveal how extraversion and avoidance co-relate in
   everyday experience, the dynamics are revealed by study of interpersonal
   scripts in narratives of memorable encounters. Similarities between the
   present approach and recent dialectical approaches to the self-concept
   are discussed (Hermans \& Kempen, 1993). Such approaches, particularly
   when articulated so as to interface with more generalized units of
   personality, can be highly useful for advancing understanding of
   personality dynamics.}},

   Along with these modifications come many complicated issued. This
   article reviews the literature pertaining to testing accommodations for
   people with disabilities. We address policy and legal considerations,
   existing standards, research on current practice, and research on
   technical concerns. We examine the relatively limited set of empirical
   studies on accommodations and assessments (many of which were conducted
   by test publishers) and recommend a significant program of research on

Abstract = {{1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25(OH)(2)D-3), has diverse effects in a
   variety of tissues and cell types, including skin. Since 1,25(OH)(2)D-3
   affects both fibroblast and keratinocytes, we evalauated the effect of
   1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on wound healing. We investigated the effect of the
   topically applied 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 or vehicle on the healing of cutaneous
   wounds in rats in a blinded manner. Wound areas were measured by
   planimetry technique. Healing was expressed as the percentage of the
   original wound area that was healed. 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 at concentrations
   between 5 and 50 ng/day caused a dose-dependent acceleration of healing.
   Time course and specificity studies indicated that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3
   specifically promoted healing between 1-5 days after wounding as
   compared with vitamin D (0.5 mu g/day), which showed no significant
   improvement over control. Our results suggest that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 and
   its analogues may be anew class of compounds that could be developed to
   enhance wound healing. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The blockade of veratrine-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in rat
   cerebral cortical miniprisms as a model of local anesthetic actions on
   voltage-dependent sodium channels was assessed. Veratrine stimulated
   phosphoinositide breakdown with an EC50 value of 5 mu M. The stimulation
   produced by 20 mu M veratrine was blocked completely by (+)-bupivacaine
   (IC50 7.6 mu M {[}mean of three separate experimental series]),
   (-)-bupivacaine (IC50 7.3 mu M), lidocaine (IC50 34 mu M), etidocaine
   (IC50 3.4 mu M), tetracaine (IC50 similar to 2 mu M), and prilocaine
   (IC50 110 mu M). Phosphoinositide breakdown responses to ouabain
   (100-1000 mu M) and K+ (50 mM) were only partially blocked by
   (+)-bupivacaine, and the responses to monensin (100 and 1000 mu M) and
   noradrenaline (30 mu M) were not blocked at all by this drug. Nifedipine
   produced no significant effects on the phosphoinositide response to 10
   mu M veratrine. It is concluded that in pulse label experiments using
   rat cerebral cortical miniprisms, local anesthetics in general, and
   (+)-bupivacaine in particular, block the phosphoinositide response to
   veratrine with a high degree of specificity. This system may be useful

Abstract = {{This article describes recent findings relative to the thrust
   performance of supersonic mixer ejectors. Mixer ejectors are a candidate
   means to mix out the high-velocity engine exhaust on the High Speed
   Civil Transport (HSCT) aircraft, thereby reducing jet noise at takeoff
   and landing. In the present work, data and analyses are presented that
   demonstrate that mixer ejectors can provide rapid mixing of a supersonic
   jet for acoustic benefits, all while increasing aircraft system static
   thrust. Jet engine thrust data is presented that demonstrates that a
   properly designed choked mixer nozzle has essentially no thrust loss
   when compared to conventional axisymmetric nozzles and mixer ejector
   thrust gains are invariant over a range of pressure ratios that choke
   the lobed nozzle. Model data of higher pressure-ratio mixer ejectors
   (i.e., consistent with HSCT applications) are analyzed to provide
   relevant thrust parameters. Comparisons are made with a conventional
   slot-nozzle ejector. A principal finding of this study is that the mixer
   ejector thrust performance is particularly sensitive to secondary inlet
   flowfield conditions and geometry. With proper inlet geometries, mixer
   ejector thrust performance was found to substantially exceed that of the
   slot-nozzle ejector.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the melt composition on the redox ratio of copper in
   binary sodium silicates at 1000 degrees C was determined by means of in

   currents measured by Repetitive Multi-Pulse Chronoamperometry. It
   appears that the redox ratio does not depend on the total copper
   concentration over the range 0.25 to 1 wt\% Cu. However, the proportion
   of copper(II) was found to increase with increasing basicity, ie with
   increasing the sodium oxide content. We deduced from a model based on
   the formation of pure ionic oxocomplexes that the coordination number of
   the Cu(II) oxocomplex is greater than that of the Cu(I) oxocomplex. The
   difference between the coordination numbers, which is calculated from
   the experimental results is equal to 0.56. The fractional number is
   quite far from the integer that would indicate the occurrence of well
   defined oxocomplexes of copper.}},

Abstract = {{Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disease of
   B-cell lineage. One of the peculiar immunophenotypic markers is the
   strong expression of the p55 chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R),
   recognized by anti-CD25 (or anti-Tac) monoclonal antibody. However, it
   is known that in rare cases CD25 may not be detectable, even when
   variant forms of HCL are excluded. The possibility has not been
   investigated that in these situations CD25 is present in the cytoplasm
   of the neoplastic cells. This paper describes a case in which the
   clinical, histological, and electron microscopic features were
   consistent with a typical HCL. Immunophenotype analysis showed the whole
   spectrum of markers of HCL, except for the expression of IL2R. The
   soluble form of the molecule was, however, increased in the patient's
   serum. Cytospin staining of the neoplastic B cells with anti-CD25
   clearly demonstrated the presence of IL2R in the cytoplasm of hairy
   cells. When the cells were cultivated in vitro in the presence of
   interferon-a2b, CD25 was detectable at the membrane level. These
   findings suggest that at least some cases of CD25-negative HCL may
   express cytoplasmic IL2R.}},

Abstract = {{The free induction decay (FID) and echo signals in a spin-echo pulse
   sequence have been used for seed oil determination without weighing and
   drying the seeds with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipment that
   has a magnetic field of low homogeneity. Earlier known methods, based on
   use of the FID signal to determine seed oil, become inapplicable when
   the magnetic field homogeneity is poor, because the angular position of
   seed significantly affects the signal. The present method, which
   elegantly eliminates the angular dependence, involves sampling the FID
   signal at 10 mu s after a 90 degrees pulse and the subsequent echo
   signal at 100 mu s formed by applying a 180 degrees pulse at 50 mu s
   Such short pulse spacing in spin-echo sequence produces almost a full
   oil signal. It also eliminates the effects of sample-to-sample Variation
   in T-2 and molecular diffusion on oil signal. The oil values obtained by
   this method are in good agreement (correlation for mustard: 0.952;
   linseed: 0.99; and for peanut: 0.912) with the values obtained by the
   well established and accurate pulsed NMR method, which is based on the
   measurement of the FID signal of oil in dried and weighed seeds.}},

Abstract = {{When mechanically excited, initially the ML intensity increases, attains
   a maximum value and then decreases with time. The total ML intensity I-T
   initially increases with the impact velocity V-0 of piston and attains a
   saturation value for higher values of V-0 and follows the relation I-T =
   I-T(0) exp(- V-c/V-0) where I-T(0) and V-c are constants. The ML
   intensity is maximum for 20\% CdS contents in the (Zn, Cd)S phosphors
   due to increase in hardness which may in turn increase the fracture
   stress and subsequently the piezoelectric field strength. The wavelength
   corresponding to the peak of both the ML and PL spectra shift towards
   longer wavelength with increasing CdS contents. Some models are
   discussed and it is concluded that the impulsive deformation of these
   phosphors may be due to piezoelectrification of newly created surfaces.
   The similarity of ML spectra with EL and PL spectra suggests that
   although the excitation processes are different, emission process is
   governed by the states of similar nature.}},

Abstract = {{Canine retinal central arterial strips responded to acetylcholine with a
   relaxation that was endothelium-independent. Indomethacin and atropine
   abolished the relaxation at low doses (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) and
   moderately attenuated the response to high concentrations (10(-5) and
   10(-4) M). The residual relaxation at 10(-5) and 10(-4) M in
   indomethacin-treated strips were abolished by N-G-nitro-L-arginine,
   hexamethonium, oxyhemoglobin and methylene blue, and the
   N-G-nitro-L-arginine-induced inhibition was reversed by L-arginine.
   Cerebral arterial strips with endothelium responded to acetylcholine
   with a transient relaxation followed by a contraction, whereas only a
   relaxation was induced when endothelium was denuded. The relaxations at
   low and high doses were modified by atropine, indomethacin,
   hexamethonium and N-G-nitro-L-arginine quite similarly to those seen in
   retinal arteries. Histochemical study demonstrated the presence of
   perivascular nerves containing NADPH diaphorase in whole mount
   preparations of the retinal artery. It is concluded that
   acetylcholine-induced retinal arterial relaxations, independent of
   endothelium, are mediated possibly by prostaglandin I-2 in activation of
   muscarinic receptors and by nitric oxide derived from perivascular
   nerves in response to nicotinic receptor stimulation. On the other hand,
   vasoconstrictor prostanoids appear to be liberated from the endothelium
   by muscarinic receptor stimulation in cerebral arteries, and mechanisms
   underlying the relaxation are similar to those seen in retinal arteries.}},

   Neither metalloproteinase activity nor proteoglycan degradation were

   processing is employed to investigate the bubble and particle behavior

   both the liquid and the bubbles to determine particle distribution,
   which affects the mixing performance of gas bubbles, solid particles and
   liquid. A real-time movement of bubble and particle behavior can be
   visualized by means of image processing with the use of a slow-motion
   video recording. It is disclosed that the particles injected through the
   nozzle may stick on the inner surface of the gas bubble, break through
   the bubble surface, or mingle with the gas stream to form a two-phase
   jet, depending on the particle-to-gas mass flow rate ratio. It is
   observed that when a solid-gas two-phase jet penetrates deeper in the
   horizontal direction, the particles and bubbles rise along the vertical
   sidewall and simultaneously spread in the transverse direction, thus
   promoting a better liquid-particle mixing. The application of the

   disorders clinic. Treatment sensitivity across gender and ethnicity was
   studied in 81 children who were diagnosed with a DSM-III-R childhood

   prevalence and intensity of fears, as rated by the child, parent,
   teacher, and clinical diagnostician, did not differ as a function of
   gender or ethnicity. Content of these fears was highly similar for both
   genders and ethnicities. A cognitive-behavioral treatment intervention
   for anxiety-disorders produced similar reductions in anxious
   symptomatology and presence of an anxiety disorder diagnosis across
   ethnicity and gender. Results are discussed in the context of
   similarities across gender and ethnicity for clinical levels of anxiety

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to apply the dynamic compaction process to
   calcium phosphate biomaterials. This new technique is currently used to
   compact metallic powders at room temperature but has not been previously
   applied to biomaterials. A detailed study of hydroxyapatite compacts was
   carried out to determine shock compaction parameters. Low static
   precompaction (3.1 MPa) resulted in slight peripheral cracks. A
   compaction degree of about 70\% and macrohardness of 51 H-v were
   achieved for a striker velocity of about 50 m/s. FTIR spectroscopy and
   X-ray diffraction showed no differences in structure and composition
   after dynamic compaction. Two other infrequently used biomaterials were
   also tested: an unstable octacalcium phosphate and beta-calcium
   metaphosphate fibres. Scanning electron microscopy showed that dynamic
   compaction preserved the initial fibre structure of the material. No
   major structural or chemical changes were noted after shock
   consolidation. Our results show that dynamic compaction could extend the
   range of bioceramics.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in cognitive therapies and theories for paranoid psychosis
   have constituted a significant breakthrough in our understanding of this
   disorder, offering a valid psychological alternative to biomedical
   approaches, which have been criticized on scientific, pragmatic, and
   ethical grounds. However, we have recently found evidence for two types
   of paranoia which, together with other conceptual and empirical work,
   show these cognitive theories to be insufficient. We propose an
   interpersonal theory of the self, which places the cognitive, emotional,
   and behavioral aspects of paranoia within a broader context of the
   perron. In this article, we (a) survey cognitive theories and the
   alternative interventions they imply; (b) describe new findings on two
   types of paranoia, which imply the need for significant theoretical
   adjustments; and (c) propose and describe a modified theory of paranoid
   threat and defense of the self, which, we argue, more adequately
   explains the phenomena.}},

   inhibitors on carbachol induced porcine and human destrusor contractions
   were investigated in vitro and an isolation and characterisation of PDE
   isoenzymes present in porcine and human detrusor homogenate was done.
   Milrinone (PDE III inhibitor), rolipram (PDE IV inhibitor), zaprinast
   (PDE V/I inhibitor) and dipyridamole (PDE V inhibitor, human tissue
   only) had only minor relaxant effects at maximum concentrations (< 20\%)
   while papaverine (nonselective PDE inhibitor) and vinpocetine (PDE I
   inhibitor) were significantly more potent (porcine detrusor: 73+/-4.3\%
   and 53+/-7.9\%, human detrusor: 59.9+/-8.2\% and 51.4+/-7.9\%
   relaxation).
   One PDE I, one PDE II, two PDE IV and two PDE V were identified from the
   42.000 g supernatant of the porcine detrusor homogenates. In the
   cytosolic fraction of the human tissue homogenate all five known PDE
   (PDE I-V) were found.
   The calcium/calmodulin stimulated PDE I seems to be of functional
   importance in the regulation of the porcine as well as the human
   detrusor tone. Despite distinct biochemical differences the pig is a
   valuable in vitro model for the study of the intracellular regulation
   cascade of the detrusor smooth muscle. Isoenzyme-specific modulation of
   intracellular key enzymes is a novel approach for detrusor tone
   regulation.}},

   measures of forearm blood flow (FBF) were performed to determine the

   for flow calibration of Doppler MBV estimates. Such a calibration of
   Doppler MBV eliminates the need for knowledge of vessel cross-sectional
   area and angle of insonation while allowing for the quantification of
   limb blood flow. Six healthy subjects (5 men and 1 woman) performed 40 s
   of isometric forearm contraction at 35\% maximal voluntary contraction
   with arterial inflow occluded. This resulted in elevated blood flow on
   relaxation and cuff deflation, and simultaneous beat-by-beat Doppler MBV
   and strain-gauge FBF measurements were then made over a period of 2-3
   min as flow gradually decreased to resting levels. The r(2) values for
   the fitted regression lines over a wide range of flows ranged from 0.87
   to 0.98, and the mean square error terms ranged from 0.88 to 3.07 ml .
   100 ml(-1) . min(-1). Significant day-to-day variation of the fitted
   regression parameters within subjects indicated that quantitative
   estimates of FBF from Doppler MBV require a calibration to be performed
   for each experiment. The finding of a strong linear relationship between
   Doppler MBV and venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography, as well
   as the marked beat-by-beat effect of cuff inflation on blood flow,
   confirms the importance of calibration on the same beats, not on
   adjacent segments of beats.}},

Abstract = {{Varying atmospheric pressure causes inversely proportional sea level

   daily mean values of sea level, atmospheric pressure and wind components
   at three stations are analysed in order to provide insight on the
   interactions at time scales from days to decades. The response of sea
   level to changing atmospheric pressure is frequency dependent and is
   almost never the theoretically predicted isostatic response of -1 cm of
   sea level change for 1 mbar change of pressure. The contribution of the
   wind components is found to be very small for most frequencies.
   Nevertheless wind is found to be the dominant parameter characterizing

   pressure rise is compared with the quasi-steady ones. Unsteady pow
   analysis is made for a two-dimensional circular cascade by use of the
   singularity method. The calculated frequency characteristics are
   compared with the corresponding experimental ones. The deviation of
   unsteady characteristics from quasi-steady ones is evident, and the
   numerical results agree qualitatively with the measured ones. It was
   found that with the increased frequency of rotational speed fluctuations
   the dynamic characteristics deviate remarkably from quasi-steady ones.

Abstract = {{A series of novel 2,8-dialkyl-1-oxa-2,8-diazaspiro{[}4.5]decan-3-ones
   and 2,8-dimethyl-1,2,8-triazaspiro{[}4.5]decane-3-one (13), related to
   M(1) muscarinic agonists YM796 and RS86, were synthesized by using
   Michael addition reaction of hydroxyurea or methylhydrazine to
   alpha,beta-unsaturated esters followed by cyclization reaction. These
   compounds were assessed for binding affinities for M(1) and M(2)
   receptors and in vivo muscarinic activity: namely, amelioration of
   scopolamine-induced impairment in rat passive avoidance tasks and
   induction of hypothermia, tremor, and salivation.
   2,8-Dimethyl-1-oxa-2,8-diazaspiro{[}4.5]decan-3-one (6a) exhibited high
   affinities for both M(1) and M(2) receptors, showed antiamnesic activity
   (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) and induced hypothermia (3 mg/kg, s.c.). In addition,
   6a stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in rat hippocampal slices,
   indicating partial agonistic activity for M(1) muscarinic receptors. The
   alteration of the methyl group at N2 of 6a increased the selectivity in
   binding affinities for M(1) over M(2) receptors, but resulted in loss of
   M(1) agonistic activity or antiamnesic activity. Compound 13 exhibited
   only low affinity for M(1) receptors, suggesting that a basic nitrogen
   atom is not tolerated in M(1) receptor binding as a substitute for an
   oxygen atom or a carbonyl group at the 1-position of 6a or RS86. None of
   these derivatives exhibited high selectivity for antiamnesic effect-over
   induction of hypothermia compared to YM796.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality entails the use of models and their associated
   renderings to supplement information in a real scene, In order for this
   information to be relevant or meaningful, the models must be positioned
   and displayed in such a way that they blend into the real world in terms
   of alignments, perspectives, illuminations, etc, For practical reasons
   the information necessary to obtain this realistic blending cannot be
   known a priori, and cannot be hard-wired into a system, Instead a number
   of calibration procedures are necessary so that the location and
   parameters of each of the system components are known, In this paper we
   identify the calibration steps necessary to build a computer model of
   the real world and then, using the monitor-based augmented reality
   system developed at ECRC (GRASP) as an example, we describe each of the
   calibration processes, These processes determine the internal parameters
   of our imaging devices (scan converter, frame grabber, and video
   camera), as well as the geometric transformations that relate all of the
   physical objects of the system to a known world coordinate system.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. This study was undertaken to determine the reproducibility of
   measurements of an acromial angle on radiographs and to correlate those
   measurements with the presence of the impingement syndrome and rotator
   cuff tears.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Ninety-nine shoulders in 95 patients who had an
   arch radiograph and had undergone shoulder arthroscopy were included in
   this retrospective study. The acromial angle was measured on the arch
   view of the shoulder independently by three observers who were blinded
   to the name, history, and arthroscopic results. The angle was measured
   at the intersection of lines drawn along the inferior cortex of the
   anterior and posterior portions of the acromion. Interobserver
   variability was determined by the intercorrelation coefficient (a test
   of reproducibility of quantitative measurements). The average of the
   three measurements for each patient was correlated with the preoperative
   diagnosis and the arthroscopic findings.
   RESULTS. A correlation was found between increasing severity of cuff
   disease as determined on arthroscopy and increasing acromial angle (p <
   .01). In 67 patients (70 shoulders) with impingement, patients with a
   full-thickness tear (29\%) accounted for 43\% of those with an angle of
   30 degrees or greater, The average acromial angle for patients with
   impingement was greater than that for either patients with instability
   or patients with trauma (p < .05 for both). An angle of 25 degrees or
   greater was measured in 63\% of patients with impingement but in only
   18\% of those with instability. The average acromial angle in patients
   with impingement and an intact rotator cuff was also greater than the
   average angle in patients with instability (p = .001). The interobserver
   variability had an intercorrelation coefficient of 0.90.
   CONCLUSION. The acromial angle is an objective and fairly reproducible
   measure of anterior acromial shape. The angle is useful in identifying
   patients with a greater likelihood of having a rotator cuff tear and in
   distinguishing patients with primary impingement from those with
   instability.}},

Abstract = {{The two main pathogenetic characteristics of atopic dermatitis (AD) are:
   (i) antigen-dependent `specific' reactivity, and (ii) altered
   non-immunological `non-specific' reactivity, Our understanding of the
   role of non-specific reactivity is hampered by the fact that methods
   available for its quantification are limited. The aim of the present
   study was to assess the usefulness of two parameters as quantitative
   measures of non-specific skin reactivity in AD: (i) susceptibility to
   repeated epicutaneous exposure to an irritant (sodium lauryl sulphate,
   SLS), assessed by visual scoring and transepidermal water loss (TEWL)
   measurement, and (ii) reactivity to intracutaneously injected bioactive
   agents (codeine, FMLP, histamine, methacholine, substance P, trypsin),
   assessed by measurement of weal and flare size. These two parameters
   were tested in a group of AD patients, subdivided according to the
   severity of their dermatitis, and a control group, The visual score and
   TEWL after SLS exposure tended to be higher in the AD group than in the
   control group. Furthermore, visual score and post-exposure TEWL were
   positively correlated with the dermatitis severity score. Weal size
   following injection of codeine, histamine and substance P, and flare
   size following injection of all agents, except methacholine, were
   significantly lower in the AD group than in the control group. Negative
   correlations were found between weal and flare sizes and the dermatitis
   severity score. These findings can be explained by down-regulation of
   structures involved in weal and flare reactions. In conclusion, we
   propose that epicutaneous irritant susceptibility and reactivity to
   intracutaneous bioactive agents may be useful indicators of non-specific
   skin reactivity in AD.}},

Abstract = {{It has previously been shown in several species that pulses of
   luteinizing hormone (LH) in peripheral serum are followed within 10-20
   minutes by pulses of testosterone. Whether or not LH pulses directly
   stimulate Leydig cells to produce the testosterone pulses would depend
   on the vascular permeability of LH within that physiologically relevant
   time. In the present experiments, the capillary permeability of the
   testicular microvasculature was characterized in adult rats, and the
   relative permeability to LH was determined. Adult male rats were
   prepared for in vivo micropuncture and testes were infused with
   H-3-water, C-14-urea, C-14-polyethylene glycol (PEG), and H-3-dextran
   directly into the testicular surface artery. Testicular interstitial
   fluid (TIF) and testicular Venous plasma were collected at 5 minutes, 10
   minutes, and 15 minutes after initiation of isotope infusion. Data were
   recorded as isotope concentration in TIF as a proportion of the isotope
   concentration in testicular venous plasma collected at that same time
   period. H-3-water movement into the TIF from blood was rapid reaching
   50\% of serum values within 15 minutes. C-14-PEG and H-3-dextran were
   largely excluded from the TIF, typically not exceeding 5-10\% of serum
   concentrations. In subsequent experiments, I-125-LH was infused using
   the same protocol. I-125-LH concentrations in TIF were 3.6 +/- 2.0\% of
   plasma concentrations 10 minutes after initiation of infusion. Preceding
   the I-125-LH infusion experiments with 5-day hypophysectomy or with LH
   pulses delivered either 10 minutes or 4 hours prior to the initiation of
   infusion did not alter the capillary permeability of I-125-LH. These
   data demonstrate the restricted availability of LH to the TIF. This
   implies that Leydig cells are not exposed to LH pulses through the TIF
   and raises the question whether LH pulses directly stimulate
   testosterone pulses.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus losses by surface runoff and leaching were studied for three
   years in a 16-plot field on a heavy clay soil in south-west Finland to
   compare losses of total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphorus (PP) and
   dissolved orthophosphate phosphorus (DP) from barley and grass ley
   plots. Barley was fertilized with 21 and 42 kg ha(-1) y(-1) P by
   placement technique. Ley was given P 42 and 84 kg ha(-1) y(-1), but
   split into two equal portions, by broadcasting. The mean losses of TP
   from the barley and ley were 1.2 and 1.6 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively.
   The PP losses (calculated as the difference between TP and DP)
   constituted 69\% of the TP loss from barley, but only 35\% of that from
   ley. In the case of barley, a considerable amount of PP was carried by
   drainage water. The mean DP losses were 0.4 kg ha(-1) y(-1) from barley
   and 1.0 kg ha(-1) y(-1) from ley. The higher DP loss from ley was due to
   both the higher fertilizer rate and the fertilizer broadcasting
   technique. During the second and third years of the experiment,
   fertilizer broadcasting on the ley plots was followed by high DP
   concentrations in surface runoff and drainage water. The peak DP
   concentrations in drainage water occurred soon after fertilizer
   broadcasting followed by only 7-15 mm of flow, indicating fast
   preferential movement of orthophosphate from the surface through the

Abstract = {{We reported previously that mutation of the chromosomal gene eaeA from
   enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7 prevented
   bacterial attachment in vivo, Attachment was restored when the EHEC or
   enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) eaeA gene was introduced into the mutant
   on a plasmid. In this communication we have compared in gnotobiotic
   piglets the;pathogenicities of wild-type O157:H7 strain 86-24 and its
   eaeA mutant UMD619 with those of the two plasmid -complemented strains
   expressing Intimin(O157) (EHEC) and Intimin(0127) (EPEC). 86-24
   colonized the surface and glandular epithelium of the large intestine
   and induced diarrhea, while UMD619 did not colonize any intestinal site
   and induced little or no diarrhea, Surprisingly, strain UMD619
   expressing Intimin(0127) behaved in pigs more like EPEC than EHEC
   strains; it colonized the distal half of the small intestine and the
   surface of the large intestine, inducing serious diarrhea. In contrast,
   strain UMD619 expressing Intimin(O157) colonized the colon extremely
   poorly, inducing little or no diarrhea. While only the two strains
   causing extensive attachment-86-24 and UMD619 expressing
   intimin(0127)-induced diarrhea, neurological symptoms attributed to
   Shiga-like toxin Il occurred equally in ail four groups of animals. The
   intimate bacterial attachment and mucosal damage were not a prerequisite
   for Shiga-like toxin II translocation from the gut lumen into the

   a hyperosmolar medium depends on the effect of `'trophic factors''
   transferred to the muscle by the axenic flow. Elimination of this effect
   by blocking the axoplasmic transport with colchicine impairs the ability
   of active chloride transport to be enhanced following an increase in the

Abstract = {{Background: Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) may offer
   theoretic advantages for outpatient surgery, because it produces the
   rapid onset of spinal anesthesia, with the option to extend the blockade
   with an epidural catheter. In this study, the authors attempted to
   determine an appropriate initial dose of a short-acting local
   anesthetic, 2\% lidocaine, to administer for outpatient knee arthroscopy
   using CSE.
   Methods: Data were collected from 90 patients undergoing outpatient knee
   arthroscopy, Using a double-blinded, prospective study design, patients
   were randomly assigned to receive CSE with an initial dose of
   intrathecal 2\% lidocaine of 40, 60, or 80 mg. A 27-G 4(11)/(16)-inch
   Whitacre needle was placed through a 17-G Weiss needle. Onset and
   regression of sensory anesthesia and motor blockade were measured by a
   blinded observer at frequent intervals.
   Results: All 90 patients had adequate anesthesia. Durations of thoracic
   and lumbar sensory and lower limb motor blockade were significantly
   shorter in the 40-mg group compared with the 60- or 80-mg groups (P <
   0.0002 Mantel-Cox, Survivorship Analysis). Indices of neural blockade
   resolved 30-40 min more rapidly in the 40-mg group than in either the
   60-or 80-mg group. Times to urinate, sit upright in a chair, take oral
   fluids, and be discharged were all significantly shorter (between 30 and
   60 min) in the 40-mg group compared with the 60- and 80-mg groups (P <
   0.01). Seven patients required intraoperative epidural supplementation:
   three in the 40-mg group, three in the 60-mg group, and one in the 80-mg
   group.
   Conclusions:: Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia with a 40-mg initial
   intrathecal dose of lidocaine provided reliable anesthesia for knee
   arthroscopy. Duration of spinal anesthesia with lidocaine was dose
   related.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present work was to study the dietary fibre (DF)
   fraction of olive cake and modify the fibre structure through enzymatic
   treatments in order to improve the sensory quality of this by-product

   enzyme preparations were used for enzymatic modifications: Viscozyme L,
   a hemecellulase/cellulase multienzyme complex, and Olivex which contains
   different pectolitic main activities as well as various side activities,
   hemicellulases and cellulases. DF consists of 800 g total dietary fibre
   per kg dry matter. More than 91\% of the DF are insoluble and the
   monosaccharide composition of this fraction indicates the presence of
   mainly cellulose and xyloglucans or xylans. Approximately 75\% of the
   uronic acids found in olive cake are associated to the insoluble DF
   (IDF). Arabinans and uronic acids polysaccharides are the major fibre
   components in the soluble DF (SDF) fraction. Enzymatic treatments with
   commercial preparations caused changes in the DF content and in the
   IDF:SDF ratio depending on enzyme concentrations and incubation time.
   Baking experiments showed that a substitution of 10\% of wheat flour by
   enzymatically modified olive cake led to an improved texture compared to
   products containing untreated cake.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Meta-analysis was used to explain disagreements across
   observational studies in regard to the association between perioperative
   transfusion and cancer recurrence.
   Study Design and Methods: Observational studies published in English
   from 1982 through 1994 were retrieved. Five or more articles published
   in complete form were identified for each of six cancer sites:
   colorectum, breast, head and neck, lung, prostate, and stomach.
   Necessary information for building a 2 x 2 contingency table could be
   extracted from 60 studies. Summary relative risks (RR) reflecting the
   `'average'' adverse transfusion effect were computed for each cancer
   site by the random-effects method. Seven study characteristics were
   examined as potential explanations for the disagreements among the
   published studies.
   Results: Before any adjustment for the effect of confounding, computed
   crude summary RRs suggested a significant (p < 0.05) deleterious
   transfusion effect in all cancer sites, except for breast. The RR of an
   adverse outcome was 1.49 in colorectal cancer (95\% Cl, 1.23-1.79) and
   ranged from 1.06 in breast cancers to 3.62 in head and neck cancers. The
   disagreements among published studies were most marked in the case of
   colorectal and gastric cancers. These discrepancies could be explained,
   in part, by study design, because prospective investigations had not
   produced a significant unadjusted transfusion effect (RR = 1.18; 95\%
   Cl, 0.93-1.51 in the case of colorectal cancer).
   Conclusion: A reduction in the size of the computed unadjusted
   transfusion effect (of an appropriate magnitude to adjust for the effect
   of confounding) might eliminate the significance of the average adverse
   effect in most studied cancer sites. Whether the entire unadjusted
   transfusion effect should be ascribed to the effect of confounding or
   whether a true, deleterious transfusion effect also exists can be
   resolved only by randomized controlled trials.}},

   Diabetes registries allow more systematic reassessment of these

   recruited by the Belgian Diabetes Registry and sampled at disease onset,
   together with 195 ethnically matched control subjects. 5' INS genotypes

   HLA-DQ genotype 124.9; P < 10(-6)) was not affected by the presence or
   absence of the 5' INS 1/1 genotype. Combined positivity for the 5' INS
   1/1 genotype and for one of three other HLA-DQ genotypes associated with
   an intermediate risk for IDDM conferred an age-independent RR of 12.1 (P
   < 10(-4)). In the absence of the 5' INS 1/1 genotype, intermediate-risk
   HLA-DQ genotypes no longer conferred a significant risk (2.9; not
   significantly different from 1). In subjects carrying neutral,
   protective, or infrequent HLA DQ genotypes, the overall RR for IDDM was
   significantly lower than 1 (0.2; P < 10(-6)) in the absence of the 5'
   INS 1/1 genotype but not in its presence (0.8; not significantly
   different from 1). The 5' INS 1/1 genotype was not preferentially
   associated with immune markers for IDDM. In conclusion, regardless of
   age at onset and the presence of autoantibodies, 5' INS polymorphisms
   contribute preferentially to IDDM susceptibility in subjects without the
   highest HLA-DQ-associated risk.}},

Abstract = {{In the medical-technological practice of in vitro fertilitation (IVF),
   it is increasingly the couple, rather than an individual patient, that

   some mechanisms involved in the construction of medical interventions on
   female bodies as appropriate and effective therapeutic solutions to
   problems and diagnoses pertaining To male bodies. It traces the
   transformation of male infertility through shifts in localization and
   definition of the problem concomitant reconceptualizations of the
   techniques involved redistributions of properties, and specific ways of
   constructing `'success.'' It is argued that both the notion of the
   couple as the patient in cases of male infertility and the claim that
   IVF techniques are appropriate solutions to this couple's problem
   simultaneously presuppose and legitimize medical interventions on
   women's bodies. This double movement is produced by leaving exactly the

   uneven distribution of costs between the sexes-out of scientific
   accounts of these practices.}},

   physiological dose of water-soluble vitamins.
   Design: Single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled intervention trial.
   Daily consumed supplement consisted of fortified fruit juice containing
   50 g carbohydrate and 50\% of the daily dietary recommendations of
   water-soluble vitamins. Regular fruit juice was used as placebo. Dietary
   intake assessment at baseline. Fasting blood sample, anthropometric
   measurements and medical record at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of
   supplementation.
   Setting: Three nursing homes within 40km of the coordination centre
   (Department of Human Nutrition, Wageningen Agricultural University, the
   Netherlands).
   Subjects: Forty-two female nursing home residents aged 60 years and
   older, in relatively stable health condition, at least 3 months resident
   at baseline. In each nursing home, 14 subjects were randomly assigned to
   the supplement or control group.
   Interventions: Twelve weeks of supplementation.
   Results: Participants had a poor nutritional status. Dietary
   supplementation significantly improved the concentrations of thiamin
   pyrophosphate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, increased body weight and
   decreased serum homocysteine concentration in the supplement group.
   Plasma vitamin C levels were significantly increased in both supplement

   OF DYNAMIC MR-IMAGING IN DETECTING VIABLE TUMOR BEFORE SURGERY}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. This study analyzed the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced
   and subtraction MR images in detecting residual viable tumor before
   surgery, with emphasis on timing of enhancement, in patients with
   high-grade osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma after neoadjuvant
   chemotherapy.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS, Twenty-one patients with proved osteosarcoma or
   Ewing's sarcoma were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
   surgery, After IV administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic
   enhancement patterns on preoperative MR images were compared with
   corresponding areas on histologic sections of the resected specimens. On
   dynamic subtraction images obtained with high temporal resolution (1.5-3
   sec), the interval between arrival of the bolus of contrast agent in an
   artery and start of tumoral enhancement was used to distinguish residual
   viable tumor, Early enhancing foci (interval artery-tumor < 6 sec) and
   late or nonenhancing areas seen on MR images were correlated with the
   histopathologic findings in these areas of the resected specimens.
   RESULTS. Early and progressively enhancing structures seen on MR images
   corresponded to feeding arteries, physeal vessels, or residual viable
   tumor at specific preferential sites on corresponding histologic
   sections of the resected specimens. Tumor foci as small as 3-5 mm(2)
   could be detected on dynamic MR images. Remnant viable tumor was often
   located subperiosteally and at the margins of the tumor, Occasionally,
   active periosteal reaction without presence of viable tumor contributed
   to early enhancement. Late and gradually enhancing or nonenhancing areas
   corresponded histopathologically to regions of chemotherapy-induced
   necrosis, mucomyxoid degeneration, or fibrosis, Alternatively, late or
   nonenhancing areas were associated with reactive changes such as edema,
   hemorrhage, or osteomyelitis or with tumor-related extracellular
   matrices such as abundant osteoid or chondroid, Viable tumor areas with
   scarce formation of matrix on microscopy, such as small cell
   osteosarcoma areas or Ewing's sarcoma, showed early enhancement with
   rapid washout of contrast agent on the dynamic MR images.
   CONCLUSION. Fast dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences are essential for
   identifying residual tumor before surgery, A short time interval of less
   than 6 sec between arterial enhancement and tumoral enhancement strongly
   correlates with presence of viable tumor. Both therapy-related
   alterations of tissue and tumor-related matrices must be considered when
   late or lack of enhancement is noted on dynamic MR images.}},

Abstract = {{Wave interaction with berm breakwaters is studied by means of a physical

   is capable of simulating the wave motion both on and inside the
   structure. This model for normally incident waves has been extended with
   a new morphological model for cross-structure transport, which resulted
   in a wave load-response model capable of simulating the reshaping
   process of the seaward slopes of dynamic coastal structures such as berm
   breakwaters and gravel beaches. The combined wave-morphological model
   has been verified with small-scale laboratory tests and with prototype
   data. Trends observed in physical model tests, such as the influence of
   wave height, wave period, and stone diameter on the reshaped seaward
   slopes, are also reproduced properly.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in
   beta-adrenoceptor density (B-max) and distribution in a model of chronic
   myocardial infarction in rats, and to relate possible changes to
   hemodynamic and neurohumoral abnormalities. In addition, we examined the
   effects of 8 weeks treatment with ibopamine and captopril. Methods:
   There were 3 experiments: (1) B-max and plasma catecholamines were
   examined (n = 46), (2) B-max was compared in infarcted and non-infarcted
   tissue (n = 13), and (3) contractile function was evaluated by isolated
   heart perfusion (n = 40). Of rats in Expts. (1) and (3), 50\% had
   myocardial infarction induced by coronary ligation and 50\% were
   controls. Each group was divided between ibopamine, ibopamine and
   captopril, or standard (no drug) treatment. Results: B-max was not
   decreased in rats with myocardial infarction (10.8 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg
   protein), compared to normal rats (11.4 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg protein), and
   the ratio beta(1)/beta(2) was also unaffected. In infarcted tissue,
   B-max was significantly (P = 0.03) lower than in non-infarcted tissue.
   Baseline left ventricular pressure, systolic and diastolic dP/dT were
   all impaired (P < 0.001), and plasma norepinephrine levels were elevated
   in rats with myocardial infarction (16.03 +/- 230 vs. 1287 +/- 83 pg/ml;
   P < 0.05), compared to normals. Both ibopamine alone and in combination
   with captopril reduced the elevated plasma norepinephrine levels in
   infarcted rats (P < 0.001), but only the combination of the 2 drugs
   significantly increased B-max in infarcted rats (14.7 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg
   protein; P = 0.03 vs. untreated myocardial infarction), while ibopamine
   alone had no significant effect (13.1 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg protein; p = ns).
   Also, active drug treatment had no significant effect on the hemodynamic
   changes. Conclusions: In this coronary artery ligation model of
   myocardial infarction in rats, no beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation is
   observed, despite marked abnormalities in baseline left ventricular
   function and plasma norepinephrine levels. The combination of ibopamine
   and captopril significantly increases B-max in infarcted rats, which is
   accompanied by a reduction in plasma norepinephrine levels, but not by
   an improvement in hemodynamic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels of retinal photoreceptors and
   olfactory neurons are differentially activated by ligands that vary only
   in their purine ring structure. The nucleotide selectivity of the bovine
   rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (cGMP > cIMP much greater than cAMP)
   was significantly altered by neutralization of a single aspartic acid
   residue in the binding domain (cGMP greater than or equal to cAMP >
   cIMP), Substitution by a nonpolar residue at this position inverted
   agonist selectivity (cAMP much greater than cIMP greater than or equal
   to cGMP), These effects resulted from an alteration in the relative
   ability of the agonists to promote the allosteric conformational change
   associated with channel activation, not from a modification in their
   initial binding affinity. We propose a general mechanism for guanine
   nucleotide discrimination, in common with that observed in high affinity
   GTP-binding proteins, involving the formation of a pair of hydrogen
   bonds between the aspartic acid side chain and N1 and N2 of the guanine
   ring.}},

Abstract = {{For many scholars, classical Athens did not and could not have avoided
   the implications of its dependence upon the military, even before it
   degenerated into imperialism. In a more disturbing way than Sparta or
   Persia, Athens exemplified the inevitable relationship of military might
   and antidemocratic principles. It is my negative thesis that this line
   of reasoning is incorrect, notwithstanding its virtue of appreciating
   the significance of the military, including its socioeconomic
   underpinnings, in ancient Athens. It is my positive thesis that hoplites
   were a cause of the extension of full political participation for a
   major part of the Athenian citizenry in the face of aristocratic and
   other traditional obstacles to democratic practices. There is no reason
   to believe the forces of aristocratic privilege or tyrannical authority
   would have had to give way to democratic forces had the iron link
   between aristocracy and military security remained intact. While the
   hoplite phalanx could not guarantee the development of democracy,
   neither could economic change no matter how pervasive, nor political
   philosophy no matter how profound.}},

Abstract = {{Omai Gold Mines Ltd. is the operator of a large-scale open pit gold
   mining operation located in Guyana, South America. Construction at the
   mine began in September 1991 and the process plant of a capacity of 12
   000 tonnes per day reached commercial production in January 1993.
   The remote location of the mine requires an extensive logistics support
   to ensure adequate material supplies. Over 60\% of the consumables
   valued at US\$35. O million per year are supplied from North America.
   One particular challenge has been the shortage of a skilled workforce in
   the country. An elaborate training program was put in place from the
   beginning to improve the skills level of the seven hundred national
   employees. One hundred expatriate employees, mostly Canadians are
   currently employed at the mine on training and supervisory and
   management functions.
   The operation produced 207 000 ounces of gold in 1993 and should recover
   in excess of 270 000 ounces in 1994, becoming one of the largest gold
   mines in South America and quadrupling Guyana's annual gold production.}},

Abstract = {{In Klebsiella pneumoniae, six genes, constituting the pqqABCDEF operon,
   which are required for the synthesis of the cofactor pyrroloquinoline
   quinone (PQQ) have been identified. The role of each of these K.
   pneumoniae Pqq proteins was examined by expression of the cloned pqq
   genes in Escherichia coli, which cannot synthesize PQQ. All six pqq
   genes were required for PQQ biosynthesis and excretion into the medium
   in sufficient amounts to allow growth of E. coli on glucose via the
   PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Mutants lacking the PqqB or PqqF
   protein synthesized small amounts of PQQ, however. PQQ synthesis was
   also studied in cell extracts. Extracts made from cells containing all
   Pqq proteins contained PQQ Lack of each of the Pqq proteins except PqqB
   resulted in the absence of PQQ Extracts lacking PqqB synthesized PQQ
   slowly. Complementation studies with extracts containing different Pqq
   proteins showed that an extract lacking PqqC synthesized an intermediate
   which was also detected in the culture medium of pqqC mutants. It is
   proposed that PqqC catalyzes the last step in PQQ biosynthesis. Studies
   with cells lacking PqqB suggest that the same intermediate might be
   accumulated in these mutants. By using pqq-lacZ protein fusions, it was
   shown that the expression of the putative precursor of PQQ, the small
   PqqA polypeptide, was much higher than that of the other Pqq proteins.
   Synthesis of PQQ most likely requires molecular oxygen, since PQQ was
   not synthesized under anaerobic conditions, although the pqq genes were
   expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Suppose we are given a random source and want to use it as a random
   number generator; at what rate can we generate fair bits from it? We
   address this question in an information-theoretic setting by allowing
   for some arbitrarily small but nonzero deviation from `'ideal'' random
   bits. We prove our results with three different measures of
   approximation between the ideal and the obtained probability
   distributions: the variational distance, the d-bar distance, and the
   normalized divergence. Two different contexts are studied: fixed-length
   and variable-length random number generation. The fixed-length results
   of this paper provide an operational characterization of the inf-entropy
   rate of a source, defined in Han and Verdu {[}1] and the variable-length
   results characterize the liminf of the entropy rate, thereby
   establishing a pleasing duality with the fundamental limits of source
   coding. A feature of our results is that we do not restrict ourselves to
   ergodic or to stationary sources.}},

Abstract = {{Octanoic acid causes the inhibition of growth, decrease of the biomass
   yield and yield of ATP, stimulation of the specific production of
   ethanol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The toxicity of this fatty acid is
   higher in cells grown at temperatures below 25 degrees C, particularly
   below 15.5 degrees C, as indicated by the enhancement of the exponential
   constant of growth inhibition by octanoic acid with the decrease of
   temperature. Moreover, its presence leads to an increase of the minimum
   temperature for growth. The intracellular pH (pH(i)) of cells harvested
   in the mid-exponential phase of growth at temperatures within the range
   8.5-30 degrees C decreased sharply from 6.8-6.9 down to 5.8-6.2 when
   octanoic acid is present at concentrations of the undissociated toxic
   form below 14 mg l(-1). However, with more inhibitory concentrations (up
   to 44.5 mg l(-1)) the pHi only attained 5.7-6.1. This may result from
   the decreased synthesis of succinic and acetic acids in
   octanoic-acid-stressed cells and from the increased buffering capacity
   of their cytoplasm due to the reduced internal volume. The effect of
   octanoic acid on intracellular acidification is nearly independent of
   growth temperature within the range 8.5-30 degrees C and cannot explain
   the augmentation of toxicity at low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-controlled

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal tumors
   (squamous cell carcinoma {[}n = 4], pleomorphic adenoma {[}n = 2])
   underwent LITT with local anesthesia. A 7-F introducing sheath was
   inserted into the center of the tumor followed by a specially designed
   laser emitter. Therapy was monitored on-line with MR thermometry, and
   the amount of necrosis was estimated with dynamic and static contrast
   material-enhanced sequences.
   RESULTS: All procedures were well tolerated with use of local
   anesthesia, with no clinically relevant side effects. MR thermometry
   depicted up to 15-mm-diameter areas of less signal intensity near the
   laser tip. Coagulative necrosis was achieved in all patients (volume
   range, 4 - 28 cm(3)), and clinical symptoms were reduced in four.
   CONCLUSION: MR imaging-controlled LITT may be a safe, minimally invasive
   alternative in the treatment of recurrent head and neck tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic audiological tests performed in ten children from 1985 to
   1991 showed remarkable differences between the results of behavioral
   audiometry (free field or pure tone audiometry) and those of auditory
   evoked response audiometry. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was absent
   in seven children with sensory neural hearing loss. Neuropsychological
   evaluation was performed on four children, neuropsychological
   observation was performed on two children, pediatric examination was
   performed on three children and one child showed signs of neuropediatric
   disorder. The results of neuropsychological evaluation showed moderate
   to severe learning disabilities (sensory integration disorders, learning
   disorders) in all four children tested. Available neuropsychological
   observation also indicated the presence of sensory integration disorders
   in two children. Two children had multiple handicaps with cerebral
   abnormalities, two further children were diagnosed as suffering from
   `'minimal cerebral dysfunction,'' one of which was mentally retarded.
   The fact that ABRs were absent in seven children indicates that a
   response desynchronisation in the auditory pathway may exist in these
   disorders. Thus, ABR might not be a reliable method for audiological
   testing in children with learning disabilities or other cerebral
   dysfunctions, but serves as an adjunct to conventional testing methods.}},

   following the development of pests and diseases, such as thrips (Thrips
   parvispinus Karny), yellow tea mite (Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks),
   anthracnose fruit rot (Colletotrichum spp.), blossom mould
   {[}Choanephora cucurbitarum (Berkeley \& Ravenel) Thaxter], cercospora
   leaf spot (Cercospora capsici Heald Bi Wolf), southern blight
   (Sclerotium rolfsii Saccardo), and aphid-transmitted virusus (mainly CMV
   and CVMV). Crop production in the field was measured through yield of
   healthy fruits, mean weight per fruit and earliness of harvesting.
   Screen-covered nurseries protected seedlings from aphids and
   aphid-transmitted viruses during the nursery phase and enhanced
   mid-fruiting time and improved crop production during the field phase.
   Use of screen-covered nurseries could make application of pesticides
   during the nursery phase superfluous. After planting in the field,
   potted transplants established better and produced fruits earlier than
   bare-root transplants. A transplant production period of 1.5 months
   appeared optimal for plant growth and earliness of harvesting.
   Production of transplants in pots under a screen cover during 1.5 months
   is proposed as an element of ICM. During the field phase of the crop
   cultivation, healthy and vigorous transplants yielded better only when
   other elements of ICM, such as mulching, were included.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently shown that hypomethylation of cytosine residues in the
   HRS60 family of repetitive DNA sequences can be induced with
   5-azacytidine (5-azaC) in tobacco tissue cultures. We have also proven
   that such a DNA methylation status is maintained during the recovery of
   protoplasts, plant regeneration, and vegetative development. In the
   present paper we follow meiotic transmission of hypomethylated HRS60
   DNA. Plants obtained from seeds treated with 5-azaC were either self
   pollinated or crossed with a non-treated control in a reciprocal way.
   Analysis of the methylation status of the HRS60 DNA revealed that these
   sequences were hypomethylated in the progenies up to the extent found in
   the parental 5-azaC-treated plant. Since no parent-of-origin effect was
   observed, we presume that both male and female gametes transmit an
   artificial methylation imprint to a similar extent. This result is
   supported by methylcytosine evaluation in the total mic DNA samples. A
   temporal analysis of 5-azaC effects on germinating seeds and a
   phenotypic evaluation of 5-azaC-treated tobacco plants are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the performance of noncoherent reception for M-ary
   spread-spectrum (M-ary/SS) signals in the presence of carrier frequency
   offset. In general, the M-ary/SS scheme is expected to be of higher
   spectral efficiency than the conventional DS/SS schemes, but its
   performance may be degraded by the carrier frequency offset. We:
   therefore, analyze the effect of carrier frequency offset on the
   performance of the non-coherent M-ary/SS system with orthogonal
   modulation using a set of sequences generated by the Hadamard matrix. As
   a result of the analysis, it has been found that the carrier frequency
   offset may cause a great deal of degradation in the performance, and
   that its effect has a distinctive property which is due to the
   characteristic of Hadamard matrix, at the same time. Making use of this
   property, we propose two schemes that can mitigate the effect of carrier
   frequency offset: one is based on choice of the code sequences, the
   other is on the error correcting code. The effectiveness of the schemes
   is evaluated in the terms of symbol-error-rates through analysis and
   computer simulation.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate serologic measure of hepatic function would be clinically
   useful in selecting donors for liver transplantation. An experimental
   model that incorporates varying lengths of total hepatic warm ischemia
   with reperfusion injury was utilized to compare serologic parameters and
   mitochondrial performance of oxidative phosphorylation in predicting
   hepatocellular injury. Monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) formation
   following bolus intravenous lidocaine injection was found to be
   significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) at all periods of ischemia when
   compared to that in nonischemic controls. A serum MEGX level of <50 mu
   g/liter suggested severe hepatic damage. No correlation was found
   between MEGX level and liver viability as measured by animal survival.
   Serum transaminase (AST and ALT) levels demonstrated progressive,
   nonsignificant elevations with increasing length of ischemia (P = 0.0779
   at the maximum ischemic time). Polarographic measurements of
   mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation did not reveal a significant
   alteration in subcellular metabolism with prolonged ischemic time. These
   data highlight the comparative sensitivity of MEGX formation as an early
   quantitative measurement of hepatocellular injury during warm ischemia,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Late neurologic deterioration following subarachnoid
   hemorrhage is often due to vasospasm and rebleeding. Although the sudden
   onset of a focal neurologic deficit can actually be the result of
   thromboembolism, anticoagulation has rarely been used in such cases.
   METHODS We report a case of a 55-year-old woman who developed recurrent
   transient focal neurologic deficits 13 days after having a subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, with multiple cerebral infarcts by CT. Two cerebral
   angiograms showed no aneurysm. Her symptoms and clinical temporal
   profile were consistent with thromboembolic phenomenon. We elected to
   treat her with systemic anticoagulation.
   RESULTS The patient had no recurrent events after systemic
   anticoagulation, hut had episodic sensory changes and a new infarct on
   MRI once the anticoagulation was discontinued.
   CONCLUSIONS Anticoagulant was safely administered after subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (SAH) in this patient and may have been effective in
   preventing further cerebral ischemic infarction following her SAH. Our
   patient's clinical profile of sudden (rather than gradual) onset of a
   transient focal neurologic deficit and resolution of blood on CT
   indicates one setting in which the use of heparin may be considered.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature water was examined as a medium for the decomposition of
   highly energetic materials. To this end, a series of aromatic nitroamine
   compounds was used to mimic the chemical and structural aspects of
   several important explosives. The compounds 2-nitroaniline (2NA),
   4-nitroaniline (4NA), 2,6-dinitroaniline (2,6-DNA),
   2-nitro-1,4-phenylene diamine (2NPDA), 2-nitro-1,2-phenylene diamine
   (3NPDA), and 4-nitro-1,2-phenylene diamine (4NPDA) were chosen to probe
   the basic structure-reactivity relationships between the number of NO2
   and NH2 substituents and their relative locations on the aromatic ring.
   These experiments revealed that pyrolysis and hydrothermal reaction
   occurred in parallel, with both rates and selectivities dependent upon
   the presence of water. Reaction rates were generally higher during
   reaction in high-temperature water than in neat pyrolysis. The rates of
   both pyrolysis and hydrothermal reactions increased with increasing
   number of substituent groups. Finally, the rate of pyrolysis and
   hydrothermal reaction was lower when nitro and amine groups were
   adjacent.}},

   of Gastroenterology 1994 sponsored an International Working Party
   composed of four panels, each with experience in a selected area of
   hepatology. This document, prepared by one of these four panels,
   considers all mass lesions composed of hepatocytes in humans, with the
   exception of mesenchymal hamartoma and hepatoblastoma. It is hoped that
   the suggested terms, definitions, and codes will assist clinicians and
   laboratory physicians in the care of patients and in the retrieval of

   whole animal, a significant portion of the whole-animal magnesium may be
   lost during normal overwintering. We also evaluated the renal response

   The saccular cyst may result from an atresia of the laryngeal saccule

   of submucosal glands located around the ventricle. Traditionally, the
   treatment of the lesions has been endoscopic unroofing or
   marsupialization. Frequently, this modality requires multiple procedures
   as well as concomitant tracheotomy. There also have been reports of
   acquired subglottic stenosis. We have found that removal of the
   recurrent saccular cyst can be achieved relatively safely and
   effectively via a lateral cervical approach to the thyrohyoid membrane.
   We review our experience with four patients with congenital saccular

   tri-fractal over several decades of length scale. The sapphire fibre
   exhibited a surface structure with two scales of periodic roughness, of

   responses to intravenous infusion of isoproterenol in 27 African
   Americans and 27 White men and women. African Americans showed
   significantly smaller beta(2)-receptor mediated falls in diastolic
   pressure than Whites. In contrast, isoproterenol produced similar

Abstract = {{Various steps in the existing procedure (Slocum, R. D., Flores, H. E.,
   Galston, A. W. and Weinstein, L. H., Plant Physiol. (1989) 89, 512) for
   the analysis of agmatine as its benzoyl derivative were found to impair
   the quantification of agmatine, leading to irreproducible results.
   Degradation of benzoylated agmatine is a major factor contributing to
   erratic results, and two mechanisms of degradation have been observed.
   Firstly, benzoylagmatine undergoes a temperature-dependent hydrolysis in
   alkaline solution and this reaction has a half-life of 168 min at 22
   degrees C. Therefore, the benzoylation reaction time and temperature
   have to be controlled In order to ensure reliable results; a maximum
   yield of benzoylagmatine may be obtained after incubation for 30 min.
   Secondly, benzoylagmatine can undergo rapid alkali-catalysed
   methanolysis with a half-life of 12 min at 22 degrees C. Methanolysis
   produces a degradation product that was originally considered to be
   agmatine or benzoylurea, but is probably
   N-benzoylmethoxybenzamidomethylene imine. The formation of
   benzoylagmatine depends on the amount of benzoylchloride added since
   small volumes of the reagent do not exhaustively derivatize agmatine,
   hence leading to unreliable results. Mass spectrometry of
   benzoylagmatine showed that tribenzoylagmatine is the main derivative
   formed. The suggested modifications to the existing procedure enable the
   rapid and reliable determination of agmatine in various plant materials.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the effects on hemostatic parameters of a
   combiphasic oral contraceptive containing desogestrel and ethinyl
   estradiol (DSG/EE) and a triphasic oral contraceptive containing
   levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE).
   Methods: In an open-label, randomized, group-comparative study in 10
   healthy volunteers per treatment group, the effects on parameters of
   coagulation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, antifibrinolysis and
   platelet function were determined at baseline, after three treatment
   cycles, and after a post-treatment cycle. Changes from baseline were
   analyzed using a paired t-test, whereas between-group differences were
   analyzed by means of an analysis of co-variance.
   Results: Both OC preparations induced modest changes of some
   coagulation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis and antifibrinolysis
   parameters, although all mean values remained within the normal range.
   No significant effects were observed with either OC with respect to
   platelet function. Statistically significant differences between the two
   preparations could occasionally be observed: the concentrations of
   antithrombin III (AT-III) and Factor VII were higher with the DSG/EE
   preparation than with the LNG/EE preparation at the end of treatment and
   AT-III activity, AT-III concentration, Factor X concentration, and
   plasminogen activity were higher with DSG/EE than with LNG/EE in the
   post-treatment cycle.
   Conclusions: Combiphasic DSG/EE and triphasic LNG/EE, both OCs with a
   comparable amount of EE per cycle, had no clinically significant effect
   on the overall hemostatic balance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the role of ductus arteriosus (DA) constriction
   and loss of luminal blood flow in producing permanent closure of the DA
   in human infants.
   Methods: We studied 77 newborn infants (gestational age, 23 to 33 weeks)
   with asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), who had `'complete
   clinical closure'' (defined as the disappearance of all PDA signs) after
   treatment with indomethacin (three doses within 36 hours), All infants
   had an echocardiogram 24 to 36 hours after the last dose of
   indomethacin, They were then followed for the development of ductus
   reopening.
   Results: Despite the absence of clinical signs, 18 (23\%) of 77 infants
   still had some residual luminal blood flow according to their
   echocardiograms. The failure to obliterate luminal blood flow completely
   was directly related to the infant's postnatal age when treatment was
   begun and to the amount of fluid administered before treatment.
   Subsequently the DA reopened in 16 (21\%) of 77 infants. As predicted,
   infants with residual luminal blood flow after indomethacin treatment
   had a higher rate of subsequent clinical reopening than did those with
   no luminal flow, In addition, immature infants had a significantly
   higher reopening rate than did more mature infants. The increased risk
   of reopening in immature infants was seen even when indomethacin caused
   complete obliteration of ductus luminal blood flow.
   Conclusion: The DA of immature infants is resistant to the
   constriction-induced ischemic damage that is necessary for subsequent
   permanent closure of the vessel.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal measurements documented the vertical profile of the
   atmospheric environment during May and June from 1984 to 1990. This time
   corresponded to peak emergence of Helicoverpa tea (Boddie) and
   Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) from 2x10(5) ha of mature corn in the
   Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas and Mexico. The atmospheric data
   revealed a maximum average relative humidity of about 85\% between 400 m
   and 600 m altitude. Average cloud cover ranged annually from 26 to 58\%.
   Average air temperature of 22.5 degrees C at 500 m Above Ground Level
   (AGL) was significantly cooler in 1987 than in any year except 1990.
   Maximum average wind speed ranged from 9.3 m/s to 15.2 m/s and was
   located between 400 m and 600 m AGL. Nightly atmospheric trajectories at
   500 m AGL were calculated from an origin near Weslaco, Texas, on the
   northern perimeter of an expansive corn growing area. Atmospheric
   trajectory endpoints representing two-night displacement from Weslaco
   were scattered annually across Texas, except west of the-Big-Bend-area.
   Trajectory endpoints were frequently located in Oklahoma and less
   frequently in Arkansas and Louisiana. Atmospheric trajectory
   calculations underestimated moth flight from the LRGV that was measured
   by an airborne radar on the night of 20 June 1989. An error of 164 km,
   over the 7.67 h radar tracking period, was likely due to a combination

Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{289-298}},

Abstract = {{Silene dioica (Caryophyllaceae) has evolved different morphotypes that
   vary in hairiness in different habitats in the Swedish mountains. A
   hairy form, var. serpertinicola and a hairless (glabrous) form, var,
   smithii grow on serpentine, i.e. a dry soil rich in heavy metals. Var.
   lapponica is a densely hairy morphotype on subalpine meadows. Crosses
   between these varieties showed that glabrousness has a simple Mendelian
   inheritance and that glabrousness is determined by a recessive allele.
   The crosses further suggested that the recessive allele has been present
   in the original population that invaded the mountain area. Glabrous
   plants have, however, never been found on subalpine meadows, even though
   an earlier study has shown that gene flow is relatively common among
   serpentine and nearby meadow populations. In addition to the genetic
   background of glabrousness, we studied the grazing on glabrous smithii
   and hairy serpentinicola and Iapponica plants by the slugs Arion
   fasciatus and Arion subfuscus and the snail Arianta arbustorum in
   greenhouse and in nature. Arion slugs, abundant on subalpine meadows,
   preferred glabrous plants and, in particular, A. fasciatus consumed high
   amounts of S. dioica. Arianta snails, however, consumed irrespective of
   morphotype. The selective behaviour was seen both at the seedling stage
   and the adult plant stage. Arion slugs were more choosy when they were
   given a choice of glabrous smithii and densely hairy lapponica plants
   then when they were served smithii and the less hairy variety
   serpentinicola. This study implies that the Arion slugs are important
   agents of selection on subalpine meadows. The selective grazing seems to
   counteract the flow of the recessive allele that determines
   glabrousness, from serpentine into meadow populations. Gastropods are
   rare in the dry serpentine habitat. The evolution of a distinct glabrous
   morphotype on serpentine is therefore rather due to relaxation of
   selection than to adaptation to serpentine stress.}},

Abstract = {{The role of a membrane-associated folate binding protein (mFBP) in
   transport of folate analogues was investigated in three epithelial cell
   lines that were grown in high folate medium and folate-conditioned
   medium and express different levels of mFBP: human nasopharyngeal KB
   cells, monkey kidney MA104 cells, and IGROV-I ovarian carcinoma cells.
   Folate analogues were selected for which mFBP exhibits a low affinity,
   i.e., methotrexate (MTX) and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EdAM) or a
   (moderately) high affinity as compared to folic acid, i.e.,
   N-(5{[}N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl(-N-methylamino
   ]-2-theonyl)-L-glutamic acid (ZD1694), N-10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic
   acid (CB3717), and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid.
   Regardless of the medium folate status, growth inhibition studies with
   IGROV-I and MA104 cells demonstrated a lack of correlation between the
   affinity of mFBP for the antifolate drugs and their sensitivity profile;
   both cell lines were highly sensitive to growth inhibition by MTX,
   10-EdAM, ZD1694 and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid, but were
   insensitive for CB3717. The same drug sensitivity profile was observed
   for KB cells, with the exception that these cells were also sensitive to
   growth inhibition by CB3717 but only in folate-conditioned medium. This
   overall drug sensitivity profile appeared to correlate with the
   differential efficiency of drug transport via the `'classical'' reduced
   folate/MTX carrier (RFC), rather than by mFBP. Characteristics that
   further supported functional RFC activity In KB, IGROV-I, and MA104
   cells included: (a) the growth inhibitory effects of the drugs could be
   prevented by the reduced folate leucovorin rather than by folic acid;
   (b) rates for uptake of {[}H-3]10-EdAM were 2-4-fold higher than for
   {[}H-3]MTX at 1 mu m extracellular concentrations and coincided,vith the
   affinity of the RFC for these drugs, rather than those of the mFBP; (c)
   uptake of {[}H-3]10-EdAM and {[}H-3]leucovorin was markedly inhibited by
   leucovorin and 10-EdAM, respectively, or by an N-hydroxysuccinimide
   ester of MTX (irreversibly labeling RFC) but only to a minor extent by
   folic acid or an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid (irreversibly
   labeling mFBP); and, finally, (d) labeling with an N-hydroxysuccinimide
   ester of {[}H-3]MTX identified a protein with a molecular weight within
   the range of that reported for the RFC in human leukemic cells.
   Altogether, these results indicate that both RFC and mFBP are
   coexpressed in three epithelial cell lines and that RFC is the
   preferential route of entry for antifolate compounds, even when mFBP is
   expressed to very high levels.}},

Abstract = {{Low-grade astrocytomas are the most common central nervous system (CNS)
   tumor occurring in the pediatric age group. Although many of these
   tumors are karyotypically normal, various studies have reported gains of
   chromosomes in a significant proportion of cases. We had the opportunity
   to karyotype two pilocytic astrocytomas occurring in 5- and 15-year-old
   children. These tumors were characterized by stemlines of 49,XY, +4,
   +7,+8 and 48,XX, +7, +8. Using these patients as index cases and based
   on additional karyotypic data that have been published, we performed
   fluorescence in situ hybridization on 25 additional cases of low-grade
   astrocytomas in children using pericentromeric probes for chromosomes 4,
   6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17. Six of 18 (excluding the two index
   cases), or one third, of the pilocytic astrocytomas were characterized
   by chromosomal gains, most commonly chromosomes 7 and 8, suggesting that
   trisomy 7 and 8 are relatively common events in the tumorigenesis of
   pilocytic astrocytomas. In contrast, chromosomal trisomies were not
   detected in seven well-differentiated fibrillary astrocytomas with any
   of the probes chosen. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders Company}},

Abstract = {{For the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, secreted aspartyl proteinase
   (Sap) activity has been correlated with virulence. A family consisting
   of at least eight SAP genes can be drawn upon to produce Sap enzymatic
   activity. In this study, the levels of Sap1, Sap2, and Sap3 isoenzymes
   were monitored under a variety of growth conditions for several strains,
   including strain WO-1, which alternates between two switch phenotypes,
   white (W) and opaque (O). When cultured under proteinase-inducing
   conditions, most strains and W cells produce Sap2, while O cells produce
   Sap1, Sap2, and Sap3. Both W and O cells of strain WO-1 produce Saps in
   enriched and defined media that do not induce Saps from other strains.
   The specific Sap isoenzyme that is produced is determined by the cell
   type, while the level of Sap production is determined by environmental
   factors. The levels and temporal regulation of the SAP mRNAs as
   determined by Northern (RNA) analysis were consistent with Sap protein
   levels and with previous results. S1 analysis showed that SAP6 is the
   predominant SAP gene transcribed during hyphal induction at neutral pH.
   These studies define the culture conditions which control the levels of
   SAP mRNAs and Sap proteins, and they indicate that both the yeast/hyphal
   transition and phenotypic switching can determine which of the Sap
   isoenzymes is produced.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is hypothesized that self-injurious behavior (SIB) and
   symptoms of autism may be due to overactivity in some opioid systems in
   the brain. We examined the efficacy and safety of naltrexone
   hydrochloride, an opioid antagonist, in the treatment of SIB and autism
   in mentally retarded adults.
   Method: Thirty-three mentally retarded adults with autism and/or SIB
   participated in double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies.
   Active treatment was first a single 100-mg dose of naltrexone
   hydrochloride. Subsequently, 19 subjects were treated with 50 mg/d and
   14 with 150 mg/d of naltrexone hydro chloride for 4 weeks. The outcome
   was assessed by means of direct observations (n=11) and on the basis of
   scores on a list of target behaviors, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist,
   and the Clinical Global Impression Scale.
   Results: Thirty-two subjects (seven with autism, 16 with autism and SIB,
   and nine with SIB) completed the trial. Naltrexone treatment failed to
   have therapeutic effects on SIB and autism. On the contrary, naltrexone
   increased the incidence of stereotypic behavior on the Aberrant Behavior
   Checklist, and the care staff evaluated the effect of the 50-mg/d
   treatment as being significantly worse than that of the placebo
   treatment as measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that naltrexone has no clinical value
   for a broad group of mentally retarded subjects with SIB and/or autism.}},

   associated inter-atomic distances, respectively. The presence of a
   pharmarophore in each of the structures in a database can then be tested
   by means of a subgraph isomorphism algorithm, the computational
   requirements of which are minimized by the use of an initial screening
   procedure that eliminates the majority of the structures from the
   subgraph-isomorphism search. Analogous graph-based representation and
   searching methods can also be used with flexible 3D structures: in this
   case, the edges of the graphs represent inter-atomic distance ranges and
   a final conformational search needs to be carried out for those
   molecules that match the query pharmacophore in the subgraph-isomorphism
   search. The paper also reviews related work on the automatic
   identification of pharmacophoric patterns and on 3D similarity
   searching.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the relationship between sulfon arotinoid
   biotransformation and teratogenic activity, the potency of the ethyl (Ro
   15-1570) and methyl (Ro 14-9706) arotinoid sulfones and their in vivo
   disposition in pregnant hamsters were studied. Administration of Ro
   15-1570 was teratogenic, but Ro 14-9706 showed no such activity. Total
   absorbed doses of the ethyl and methyl sulfones (measured as maternal
   plasma AUC) were very similar. Total delivered dose of Ro 14-9706 to
   liver and lung was 120-160\% that of Po 15-1570, and Po 14-9706 was
   transferred in greater amounts to the embryo as well. Placenta AUC for
   parent sulfon arotinoids was 160-250\% that in the embryo. Plasma
   analyses by HPLC suggested that the ethyl sulfone was oxidized and
   appeared in maternal plasma as the corresponding sulfinic (Ro 14-9572)
   and sulfonic (Ro 14-3899) acids, amounting to 10\% and 16\%,
   respectively, of the mean maternal ethyl sulfone C-max value. The
   concentrations of sulfinic and sulfonic metabolites were always less
   than the analytical limit of detection in placenta and embryo after
   maternal ethyl sulfone intubation. Neither the sulfinic nor the sulfonic
   acid were ever detected in maternal circulation, placenta, or embryo
   after methyl sulfone intubation. Comparisons of their binding affinities
   found that neither the ethyl nor the methyl arotinoid sulfone could act
   as a ligand for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP), nor
   could these compounds bind retinoid nuclear receptors (RAR).
   Transcriptional activation of RARs was weak and similar for both
   compounds. The sulfinic and sulfonic acid arotinoids bind and
   transactivate RARs, and bind CRABP with efficiencies similar to
   all-trans-retinoic acid. Furthermore, they are active in cultured limb
   bud chondrocytes. The results suggest that the methyl sulfone (in accord
   with its lack of activity in cultured limb bud chondrocytes) is of no
   toxicologic significance in hamster embryo-even after relatively high
   delivered dose. Teratogenicity of the ethyl sulfone (which shows marked
   inhibition of chondrogenesis in cultured limb bud) does not appear to
   depend on measurable concentrations of these sulfinic/sulfonic acid
   metabolites in the hamster embryo. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in secondary brain
   injury after head trauma. Although oxygen-free radicals may be derived
   from multiple sources, the activation and accumulation of neutrophils in
   areas of brain injury is a potential source of deleterious inflammatory
   mediators, including free radicals, which may exacerbate the primary
   insult. Neutrophils may also impede the cerebral microcirculation by
   congestion and occlusion of postcapillary venules. The lazaroid U83836E
   is a potent-free radical scavenger that inhibits lipid peroxidation.
   US3836E was studied in a cryogenic model of cerebral injury in
   pretreatment paradigm. Fifteen rabbits received a unilateral cryogenic
   brain lesion. Six animals received U83836E, and nine animals received
   vehicle only. Arterial blood gases, hematocrit, temperature, and mean
   arterial pressure were controlled in physiologic range throughout the
   experiment. Intracranial pressure was continuously monitored. Lesion
   size was determined by triphenyltertrazolium chloride staining and
   planimetric image analysis. Neutrophil aggregation and oxygen-free
   radical generation was assessed in whole blood by impedance aggregometry
   and simultaneous luminol-mediated chemiluminescence, respectively.
   Myeloperoxidase assay was used to determine neutrophil accumulation
   within the brain. Elevations in intracranial pressure from baseline
   values were significantly greater in the untreated (control) animals at
   all time points (p < 0.0001). Mean lesion size (\%hemisphere +/- SEM)
   was significantly reduced in animals receiving U83836E (4.41 +/- 0.64, n
   = 6) when compared with controls (15.09 +/- 2.28, n = 9, p < 0.001). A
   reduction in both the release of oxygen-free radicals and in neutrophil
   aggregation following the cryogenic injury in the U83836E animals
   correlated with a smaller lesion volume. Myeloperoxidase assay and
   histologic examination demonstrated a reduction in neutrophil
   accumulation in the lesion penumbra in the U83836E group. This study
   suggests that U83836E limits secondary brain injury after a cryogenic
   lesion. The study also suggests that part of the salutary effect of the
   antioxidant U83836E may be related to neutrophil inhibition.}},

   Currently, partnering in the construction industry focuses on a project

   partnering into a construction corporate culture. Many organizational
   behaviorists agree that a cultural change must be managed. However, it
   is usually a difficult venture that must be carefully considered and
   cautiously undertaken (Frost 1985). This paper investigates partnering
   from a strategic viewpoint. It imbeds the strategic aspect of a
   partnering process into a modern organizational-change model. The
   resulting partnering process model serves as a guide for those
   construction organizations preparing to partner or those currently
   partnering with a desire to internalize their concepts and values.}},

   and Cap proteins accumulated in the nucleus, where they distributed into
   a soluble and an insoluble fraction. Analysis of the soluble nuclear
   fraction of capsid proteins by sucrose density gradients showed that
   they formed at least three steady-state pools: a monomer pool
   sedimenting at about 6S, a pool of oligomeric intermediates sedimenting
   between 10 and 15S, and a broad pool of assembly products with a peak
   between 60 and 110S, the known sedimentation positions of empty and full
   capsids. While the soluble nuclear monomer and oligomer pool contained
   predominantly only two capsid proteins, the 30 to 180S assembly products
   contained VP1, VP2, and VP3 in a stoichiometry similar to that of
   purified virions. They probably represent different intermediates in
   capsid assembly, DNA encapsidation, and capsid maturation. In contrast,
   the cytoplasmic fraction of capsid proteins showed a pattern of
   oligomers continuously increasing in size without a defined peak,
   suggesting that assembly of 60S particles occurs in the nucleus, Soluble
   nuclear Rep proteins were distributed over the whole sedimentation
   range, probably as a result of association with AAV DNA. Subfractions of
   the Rep proteins with defined sedimentation values were obtained in the
   soluble nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. We were able to
   coimmunoprecipitate capsid proteins sedimenting between 60 and 110S with
   antibodies against Rep proteins, suggesting that they exist in common
   complexes possibly involved in AAV DNA packaging, Antibodies against the
   capsid proteins, however, precipitated Rep78 and Rep68 predominantly
   with a peak around 30S representing a second complex containing Rep and
   Cap proteins.}},

   winter and spring and 8 mu atm in the boreal summer and autumn. Our
   cruises also obtained the first set of austral winter and spring fCO(2)
   data for the southwest subtropical Pacific and thus provided a complete
   seasonal cycle of surface fCO(2) for this oceanic region. The southwest
   Pacific within 25 degrees S-15 degrees S, with a mean annual Delta
   fCO(2) of about -20 mu atm, was a CO2 sink year round except during the
   austral summer of the El Nino whence Delta fCO(2) had positive values.
   The observed sea-surface fCO(2) showed large variability. Between the
   summer and the winter months, the seasonal amplitudes of fCO(2)
   (normalized to the climatological annual mean SST) ranged from 1 mu atm
   to 63 mu atm. The surface waters of the subtropical and the northeast
   Pacific also displayed annual trends in the normalized fCO(2) values.
   From January 1984 to January 1987, there were decreases in the seasonal
   means of normalized fCO(2) of 4-11 mu atm yr(-1) within 25 degrees C-15
   degrees S, 15 degrees N-25 degrees N, and 25 degrees N-35 degrees N.
   These trends were within the uncertainty of the data and were not
   significant statistically. However, from summer 1985 to summer 1987, the
   normalized fCO(2), showed significant positive increase of 24 mu atm
   yr(-1) within 35 degrees N-45 degrees N. There was also an increase,
   though not significant statistically, of 13 mu atm yr(-1) within 25
   degrees N-35 degrees N. The cause of the slightly larger increase in
   fCO(2), in northern subtropical gyre could be the anomalous intrusions
   of the Oyashio Current during the period 1984-1986 along the North
   Pacific Current, which was the source of the California Current
   bifurcating into the waters of 25 degrees N-35 degrees N and 35 degrees
   N-45 degrees N. These intrusions in late spring usually followed an
   intensified and eastward shift of the Aleutian Low which was especially
   persistent during 1977-1988.}},

Abstract = {{In sheep, prenatal exposure to androgens during a critical period for
   sexual differentiation can masculinize tonic luteinizing hormone (LH)
   secretion and defeminize the LH surge. The present study investigated
   the possible independent control of these two modes of LH secretion, as
   revealed by their developmental history. Specifically, we tested the
   hypothesis that separate critical periods exist for androgenization of
   tonic and surge LH secretion. Pregnant ewes were treated weekly with
   testosterone cypionate (200 mg in oil). As a control and to induce
   robust masculinization of reproductive neuroendocrine function, one
   group of females received testosterone from day 30 to 86 of gestation
   (LONG group). To determine if masculinization of tonic LH secretion
   develops separately from that of the LH surge, two additional groups
   were treated from day 30 to 51 (EARLY group) or 65-86 (LATE group). At
   birth, the external genitalia of the LONG- and EARLY-treated females
   were masculinized; those of the LATE-treated group were normal. At 2
   weeks of age, all androgenized females, together with normal males and
   females (n = 8 each), were gonadectomized and steroids replaced using an
   estradiol-filled Silastic capsule. First, to determine the timing of the
   pubertal decrease in steroid sensitivity, circulating LH was monitored
   twice weekly. Second, to test the function of the LH surge system, LH
   was measured every 1-2 h for 60 h after an acute increase in estradiol
   at 9 months of age. With regard to tonic LH secretion, in control males
   and LONG-treated females, a sustained increase in tonic LH in the
   presence of constant steroid feedback occurred at 7.1 +/- 0.3 and 10.9
   +/- 1.7 weeks of age, respectively (mean +/- SE). In control females,
   tonic LH increased at 27.1 +/- 0.8 weeks. Despite the differences in
   their genitalia, EARLY and LATE testosterone treatment produced
   intermediate effects: LH secretion increased at 19.3 +/- 1.2 and 20.4
   +/- 0.8 weeks, respectively. In response to acute estradiol stimulation,
   all control females produced a surge of LH that peaked 18.4 rt 0.6 h
   after steroid treatment. For the control males and LONG-treated females,
   LH concentrations were not sustained above unsuppressed pretreatment
   levels throughout the 60-hour sampling period. All but 4 of the 18
   EARLY- and LATE-treated females responded to estradiol stimulation with
   a surge of LH that peaked at 29.8 +/- 1.6 and 31.8 +/- 1.3 h,
   significantly later than that of control females. These data indicate
   that it is possible to advance the pubertal increase in tonic LH
   secretion without preventing the LH surge, thereby suggesting that tonic
   and surge LH secretion can be differentially masculinized by prenatal
   testosterone.}},

Abstract = {{Background. This study examines the relationship between smoking
   cessation and absence from work by analyzing data collected from a large
   sample of ex-smokers. In particular, it is hypothesized that if smoking
   cessation is of benefit for work attendance, the incidence of absence
   should be inversely related to the amount of time elapsed since smoking
   cessation.
   Methods. A multivariate lost model of absence incidence is proposed
   which includes variables measuring the amount of time since smoking
   cessation. This model is then estimated using data collected from a
   sample of 4,812 ex-smokers as part of the 1989/1990 Australian National
   Health Survey.
   Results. The estimated coefficients indicate that the probability of
   absence among ex-smokers is highest for those who only stopped smoking
   in the past year and progressively falls with the number of years since
   smoking cessation, with persons who last smoked at least 20 years ago
   found up to 4.5 times less likely to be absent from work than persons
   who ceased smoking during the previous year.
   Conclusions. Smoking cessation is not only associated with improved
   health outcomes, but also with improved behavioral outcomes, such as
   increased work attendance. However, such improvement is observed only
   over relatively long periods of time. (C) 1995 academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The infinite population simple genetic algorithm is a discrete dynamical
   system model of a genetic algorithm. It is conjectured that trajectories

   with a finite number of fixed points. Moreover, every sufficiently small
   perturbation of fitness preserves the finiteness of the fixed point set.
   These results allow proofs and constructions that require finiteness of
   the fixed point set. For example, applying the stable manifold theorem
   to a fixed point requires the hyperbolicity of the differential of the
   transition map of the genetic algorithm, which requires ( among other
   things) that the fixed point be isolated.}},

   VALUE OF MR-IMAGING IN DETECTING DISPLACED FRAGMENTS}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. A bucket-handle tear of a meniscus is a longitudinal tear
   with an attached fragment displaced away from the meniscus, Several MR
   findings of bucket-handle tears have been reported previously. However,
   the sensitivity of MR for detecting the displaced fragment is unknown.
   We determined the sensitivity of MR for detecting a displaced
   bucket-handle tear and determined how the sensitivity varied with tears
   of different sizes. We also evaluated whether the three findings of a
   displaced fragment differed in frequency between medial and lateral
   tears.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively evaluated the MR examinations
   of 39 patients with arthroscopically proven bucket-handle tears for
   signs of a displaced meniscal fragment. Thirty-two patients had medial
   meniscal bucket-handle tears, and seven had lateral tears, Two observers
   evaluated each examination independently, with discrepancies resolved by
   consensus of a third reader. Each observer evaluated for three findings
   of a bucket-handle tear: a double posterior cruciate ligament sign, a
   flipped meniscus sign, or a fragment in the intercondylar notch, A
   double posterior cruciate ligament sign is present when the meniscal
   fragment is displaced anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament,
   resembling two ligaments. A flipped meniscus sign occurs when the
   fragment is flipped anteriorly so the anterior horn of the meniscus
   appears to be enlarged. We tested for differences between menisci in the
   sensitivity for each sign using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's
   exact test, We compared the sensitivity of MR for identifying fragments
   when the tear involved one third, two thirds, or the entire meniscus
   using Spearman's rank correlation.
   RESULTS. Overall sensitivity for a displaced fragment was only 0.64.
   When the bucket-handle tear involved the entire meniscus, the displaced
   fragment could be seen in 84\% of the menisci, The double posterior
   cruciate ligament sign was seen in 53\% of the medial and none of the
   lateral bucket-handle tears (p =.01). The flipped meniscus sign was
   noted in 44\% of medial and 29\% of lateral menisci (p =.68), and a
   fragment was identified in the intercondylar notch in 66\% of medial and
   43\% of lateral menisci (p =.40).
   CONCLUSION. MR is sensitive for detecting meniscal fragments in large
   bucket-handle tears, but is less so in small tears. The flipped meniscus
   sign and presence of a fragment in the notch were comparably useful
   findings of a displaced fragment in both medial and lateral menisci. The
   double posterior cruciate ligament sign was noted only in medial
   bucket-handle tears.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The objective of this study was to characterize the

   1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-L-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil (L-FMAU). a
   nucleoside analogue with potent activity against the hepatitis B virus
   and the Epstein-Barr virus, in rats. Methods. Three doses of L-FMAU were
   administered intravenously (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) to rats, and L-FMAU
   concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by HPLC.
   Pharmacokinetic parameters were generated by using area-moment analysis.
   Results, There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic
   parameters between the three doses (alpha < 0.05). Thus. the disposition
   of L-FMAU was linear over the dosage of 10 to 50 mg/kg. Plasma
   concentrations of L-FMAU declined rapidly with a terminal phase
   half-life of 1.33 +/- 0.45 h (mean +/- SD). Total clearance of L-FMAU
   was moderate, averaging 1.15 +/- 0.28 L/h/kg. The fraction of compound
   excreted unchanged in urine was 0.59 +/- 0.13. No glucuronide metabolite
   was found in the urine. The steady-state volume of distribution was 1.12
   +/- 0.26 L/kg indicating intracellular distribution of the compound. The
   fraction of L-FMAU bound to plasma proteins was approximately 15\% and
   was independent of nucleoside concentration. Conclusions. The
   pharmacokinetics of L-FMAU in rats were independent of dose over the
   dosage range of 10 to 50 mg/kg.}},

   antibodies of atopic serum pool. Among these 11 clones, eight were
   recognized by murine anti-Cr-PI monoclonal antibodies Four clones (C7,
   C8, C12 and C29) were found to contain inserts of 26 kilobases (kb), and
   clones C5 and C20 were found to contain inserts of 24 kb. The remaining
   clones (C13, C23, C25, C28, and C35) were found to contain inserts of
   1.8, 1.6, 2.5, 1.7, and 0.9 kb, respectively. Clones C12, C20, C13, and
   C28 were selected, subcloned into the expression pET vectors, and used
   to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Immunoblot analyses of clones C12, C20,
   C13, and C28 with anti-Cr-PI monoclonal antibodies revealed fusion
   proteins with molecular weights of 78 and 50 kd 72 and 43 kd, 54 kd, and
   46 kd respectively. However, among those fusion proteins only those with
   molecular weights of 78, 72, 54, and 46 kd were able to bind human
   specific IgE antibodies.
   Conclusions: The cDNA clones are expected to code for the major and
   principal allergens of American cockroach, and recombinant allergens may
   therefore be valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice parameters of calcite were measured at simultaneous high
   pressures and temperatures up to 10 kbar and 500 degrees C. Samples of
   Solnhofen limestone and distilled, deionized water were loaded in a
   hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell. In situ energy-dispersive X-ray
   diffraction was used to determine lattice parameters along live H2O
   isochores with densities of 1.040, 0.964, 0.760, 0.670, and 0.595
   g/cm(3) from 30 to 500 degrees C; these densities correspond to the
   ice-melting temperature of -7.7 degrees C and the liquid-vapor
   homogenization temperatures 92.4, 274.5, 318.9, and 344.6 degrees C,
   respectively. In addition, data along the P axis were collected by
   hydrostatic compression at room temperature and along the T axis by
   heating at atmospheric pressure. Our results show that anisotropic
   thermal expansion of calcite continues up to 10 kbar, therefore making
   it a good double internal X-ray standard. Both a and c lattice
   parameters are fitted to second-order polynomials of pressure,
   temperature, and a cross term.}},

   a reduction in body weight, increase in Liver weight, and decrease in

Abstract = {{Sequence differences in the noncoding region of the human papillomavirus

   conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR)-amplified material. Two variants accounted for 50\%-70\% of all
   HPV-16 variants from 3 cohorts in Seattle. Seventy subjects who were
   repeatedly HPV-16 DNA-positive over 2-8 4-monthly visits showed an
   identical SSCP pattern at every visit. Only 10\%-20\% of the specimens
   showed evidence of infection by multiple variants when assessed by SSCP.
   However, cloning and sequencing of the PCR products revealed a
   substantially higher proportion of specimens with >1 variant. Sequencing
   many clones from each specimen confirmed that 1 major variant seemed to
   predominate over time, whereas minor variants appeared more transient.
   These results suggest that HPV-16 establishes a persistent infection in
   which a single variant predominates: coinfection with additional HPV-16
   variants results in a minor population of HPV-16 genomes.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism for the formation of a spinel compound from the reaction
   of LiNO3 with a high density gamma-MnOOH is extensively investigated in
   terms of pore-size distribution, X-ray diffraction, thermal and chemical
   analyses. The reaction of MnOOH with LiNO3 at about 300 degrees C yields
   a product that consists of domains of lithiated MnO2 phase with an
   approximate composition of Li0.3MnO2. This product ultimately transforms
   to a disordered spinel phase of composition LiMn2O4+y at 300-400 degrees
   C. The disordered spinel is converted to a well-ordered spinel as the
   temperature is raised above 550 degrees C. The oxygen content depends on
   the final heating temperature and atmosphere. Compounds obtained at high
   temperature, or in N-2, have a large capacity and unstable
   rechargeability. By contrast, some compounds prepared at low
   temperature, or with a slightly high lithium content in the starting
   materials, exhibit an improvement in rechargeability. The possible cause
   for the differences in electrochemical characteristics of both types of
   compound is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A simple algorithm named temporal phase unwrapping (TPU) is introduced
   to address the phase aliasing problem in time-dependent phase contrast
   (CINE-PC) velocity imaging. The method exploits the temporal continuity
   of velocity field and unwraps the phase along time, TPU only involves a
   one-dimensional (1D) temporal integration; therefore, many complications
   in 2D or 3D spatial phase unwrapping are avoided, Differential velocity
   maps (DVM) between adjacent movie frames are first calculated from the
   complex MR images. The DVMs have no phase aliasing as the differential
   velocities are much smaller than the absolute velocities. Aliasing-free
   velocity maps are obtained by integrating the DVMs along the time
   direction provided an aliasing-free reference velocity map (RVM) is
   found as a starting point of the integration. Typically, such RVMs are
   always available within the cardiac cycle, especially in diastole where
   the blood flow is the low,est, In vivo results from fully automated
   processing and detailed discussion on noise behavior are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of vegetal cover on soil erosion processes has been
   recognized for a long time. However, the short and long term effects of
   faunal activity on soil erosion and soil development had been largely
   overlooked by geomorphologists. The study of runoff and erosion
   processes in the Negev desert indicated pronounced systematic
   differences in sediment concentration and soil erosion rates between
   rocky and colluvial surfaces. Erosion rates were always higher on the
   former than on the latter. Field observations drew attention to an
   intense burrowing and digging activity conducted mainly by Isopods and
   Porcupines. The monitoring of this activity, based on a grid system,
   which consists of rows 5 m wide, lasted ten consecutive years. Data
   obtained suggest the existence of a strong link between the spatial
   pattern of bioturbation and that of soil erosion. The study also
   examines, through feedback processes, the regulatory role of
   bioturbation on the spatial distribution of water availability; soil
   moisture and soil forming processes. Due to bioturbation two distinct
   environments were recognised. The rocky environment which is
   characterized by a positive feedback with a high water availability and
   low soil salinity; and the soil covered areas where a negative feedback
   results in low water availability and a high soil salinity.}},

Abstract = {{The semi-active vibration control capabilities of Electrorheological
   (ER) material based adaptive beams were investigated in this study. The
   adaptive nature of such ER beams was achieved by controlling the
   pre-yield theology of the ER material in response to varying applied
   electric field levels. The cross-sectional configuration of the beams
   considered was based on sandwiching the ER material between elastic face
   plates. A dynamic model of the beam structure based on thin plate theory
   was developed. The resulting dynamic model was able to predict the
   structural vibration characteristics of the ER adaptive beam. The
   information determined included natural frequencies, loss factors, and
   transverse vibration responses at any location on the beam surface.
   These vibration characteristics were determined as functions of
   excitation frequency and applied electric field level. Also the beam
   model was developed for generalized boundary conditions. The boundary
   conditions considered in this study were: clamped-clamped, clamped-free,
   clamped-simply supported and simply supported. Variations in the natural
   frequencies, loss factors, and transverse vibration response of the
   adaptive structure were analyzed for the listed boundary conditions.
   Additionally, effects of variations of the damping layer thickness of
   the adaptive beam on the structural loss factor was studied. Results
   were compared for the boundary conditions studied, and considerable
   variations in beam vibration responses were observed. As a result, the
   semi-active control capabilities of ER material based adaptive beams
   were theoretically illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{A general ocean circulation model is used to analyze seasonal variations
   in the Guinea Dome and Angola Dome regions. The cold Guinea Dome
   develops from June through September due to active divergence of heat
   transport. The cooling is related to upwelling generated by the local
   wind stress curl associated with the northeast trade winds. The Guinea
   Dome thus provides an active mechanism of absorbing heat from the
   atmosphere. The coastal Guinea region experiences semiannual warming in
   April-July and November-December due to intrusion of coastal downwelling
   Kelvin waves from the equatorial region.
   The Angola Dome in the Southern Hemisphere is found to be cooled from
   March through August. The surface flux plays a major role in the
   seasonal variation of the heat budget in contrast to the situation of
   the Guinea Dome in the Northern Hemisphere. The Angola front located at
   the northern border of the cold Angola Dome becomes distinguishable
   particularly during the boreal fall because of the intrusion of warm
   water from the equatorial region.
   The coastal warming occurs twice a year in both hemispheres mostly due
   to intrusion of warm water accumulated in the eastern border of the Gulf
   of Guinea. The semiannual relaxation of the trade winds east of 30
   degrees W as well as the semiannual intensification of the eastward
   component of the West African monsoon is responsible for this remarkable
   oceanic phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-ring dating (ring-width pattern matching) was used to determine
   emplacement dates for eight subfossil-tree-bearing, pre-1980
   pyroclastic-flow and lahar deposits in stream valleys draining Mount St,
   Helens, Washington, Limiting dates were also established for nine other
   pre-1980 flowage deposits from the ages of trees rooted on or near them,
   or from exhumed trees. The 17 new dates improve understanding of the
   chronology of events during and after Mount St. Helens's Kalama eruptive
   period, which extended from A.D. 1479 to the mid-1700s. We assign
   bracketing dates to the three phases of the Kalama eruptive period:
   1479-1510 to the early Kalama, during which Mount St. Helens erupted
   explosive dacitic tephras, pyroclastic flows, and one or more domes;
   1489-1566 to the middle Kalama, during which Mount St. Helens produced
   andesitic tephras, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows; and 1489-1750 to
   the late Kalama, during which Mount St. Helens again erupted dacite.
   Overlap of the brackets reflects the limits of our dating resolution.
   The revised chronology confirms that little time (perhaps 50 yr) elapsed
   between the end of Mount St. Helens's Kalama eruptive period and the
   start of the succeeding Goat Rocks eruptive period (A.D. 1800-1857).
   Eruptions apparently occurred sporadically during the entire 1479-1857
   interval. The record also indicates that a large pyroclastic flow
   occurred 7-10 yr after the explosive eruptions that began the Kalama
   eruptive period. The dates further imply that extrusion of the pre-1980
   summit dome continued intermittently for approximate to 100 yr and limit
   the ages of two tephras. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of
   relict tree-bearing deposits to volcanic history studies.}},

   has increased ca. 30 times within the last 6 years. The vertical
   distribution of the cysts indicated that about 80 to 98\% of all cysts
   existed in 0-3 cm depth. This suggests that mass deposition of the cysts

Abstract = {{The effect of torsion on the flow in a helical tube of circular

   numbers from about 500 to 20000. Three cases of dimensionless curvature
   delta were studied, i.e. delta = 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1. The torsional
   parameter beta(0), which is defined as beta(0) = tau/root 2 delta with
   dimensionless torsion tau, was considered for seven cases between 0.45
   and 1.72. The results reveal rather large effect of torsion on the flow:
   the friction factor of the flow at a fixed delta deviates from that of
   the toroidally curved tube without torsion as beta(0) increases, and it
   decreases toward that of the straight tube as beta(0) further increases.
   It is also found that the torsion has a destabilizing effect on the
   flow. The critical Reynolds number at the onset of turbulence varies
   with beta(0) and has a minimum at beta(0) similar or equal to 1.3. The
   minimum critical Reynolds number at delta = 0.1 is about 800.}},

Abstract = {{The use of existing metallic local line facilities is being studied for
   providing `'video on demand (VOD)'' services to residential subscribers
   across asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL). ADSL carries a
   high-rate channel in the downstream direction from a central office (GO)
   to the subscriber, and a low-rate channel in both directions on an
   existing 2-wire pair. Audio and video signals are compressed by the
   moving picture experts group's standardized algorithms (MPEG 1 and MPEG
   2), and delivered to the subscriber in the high-rate channel. Control
   (demand and response) signals are transceived in the low-rate channel.
   This paper presents the line length coverage of ADSL systems given the
   environment of NTT's local networks. The bit rates in the downstream and
   upstream directions are assumed to be 1.6-9.2 Mbit/s and 24 kbit/s,
   respectively. Two types of ADSL systems are considered: transceiving
   ADSL signals using the plain old telephone service (POTS) line or the
   basic rate access (BRA; 320 kbaud ping-pong transmission system) line on
   the same 2-wire pair. 16-QAM, 32-QAM and 64-QAM are compared as
   transmission schemes. Intra-system crosstalk interference (interference
   between identical transmission systems) and inter-system crosstalk
   interference (interference between different transmission systems) with
   the existing digital subscriber lines (DSL) are estimated. It is shown
   that the inter-system crosstalk interference with BRA is most stringent,
   and ADSL with 16-QAM yields the best performance in NTT's local
   networks. This paper concludes that realizing ADSL with 16-QAM can
   achieve channel capacities of up to 9.2 Mbit/s for fiber-in-the-feeder
   (FITF) access systems, but the possibility of applying ADSL to direct
   access systems is remote except for a restricted short haul use. Some
   comparisons regarding American local networks are also described.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To examine the brain damage of solvent abusers in Japan, where
   pure industrial toluene is frequently abused, METHODS: Twenty solvent
   abusers 17 to 33 years of age with 7.2 +/- 4.0 years of abuse were
   examined with a 1.5-T MR imaging system. RESULTS: White matter
   hyperintensities in cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum on T2-weighted
   images were found in seven cases, The extent of white matter change was
   most clearly shown on proton density-weighted images. The patients with
   restricted white matter change and intermediate white matter change
   showed white matter hyperintensities in the brain stem and cerebellum on
   T2-weighted images, in some cases, with additional hypointensities in
   the corresponding T1-weighted images. These patients had mainly abused
   pure toluene. The patients with diffuse white matter change showed
   obvious brain atrophy, including hippocampal atrophy and thinning of the
   corpus callosum, These patients had mainly abused lacquer thinner.
   CONCLUSION: There are some patients with restricted but severe enough
   change to cause the neurologic symptoms in specific regions, such as the
   brain stem and/or cerebellum, before the brain atrophy becomes apparent.
   This suggests that the restricted white matter change represents not
   only an early change of diffuse white matter change, but at least in
   some cases also represents a qualitatively different change than that of
   diffuse white matter change. We suggest that pure toluene has a possible
   relation to this qualitative difference.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The safe limit of volume reduction in partial hepatic
   transplantation, including extracorporeal hepatic resection, remains to
   be clarified. This study evaluated such a limit and pathological
   features associated with transplantation of a less than critical volume.
   Methods. Partial hepatic grafting was performed in a porcine orthotopic
   autotransplantation model. According to the remnant liver volume,
   animals were classified into three groups: group 1, 73.8\% +/- 4.2\%
   (SD) group 2, 52.6\% +/- 6.7\%; and group 3, 29.4\% +/- 6.7\% of the
   whole liver (n = 5 each).
   Results. Three-day survival was achieved in five (100\%, four (80\%),
   and zero animals, respectively. All animals in group 3 died of graft
   nonfunction; their intraoperative clearance of the total bile acids was
   significantly worse than the other groups (p < 0.01). After operation
   the clearance of the total bile acids and hyaluronic acid, which is
   selectively cleared by hepatic endothelial cells, was significantly
   better in group I than group 2 (p < 0.01 and < 0.05, respectively). On
   histologic examination postperfusion biopsy specimens of group 3
   exhibited severe ischemic changes and portosinusoidal hyperemia, whereas
   that ofgroups I and 2 exhibited only mild ischemic damages.
   Conclusions. Transplantation of less than 30\% of expected full liver
   volume could lead to primary graft nonfunction after partial hepatic
   grafting.}},

   The multilayers prepared by Langmuir-Schaefer method at different
   surface pressure provided X-ray diffraction patterns, which suggested
   that they had a Y-type packing. Studies of the relationship between the

   cannot displace the polycation from the surface, the

   adsorption on the surface of liquid liposomes induces transbilayer

   distributions in the sunlit polar wind, in which the averaged energy
   (temperature) of the thermal energy electrons is higher in the upward
   magnetic field direction than in the downward and perpendicular
   directions. In the 1500-4000 km altitude region, the observed upward to
   downward temperature ratio: T-eu/T-ed, was in the range of 1.5 to 2. The
   observed downward and perpendicular temperatures were similar; T-ed/T-e
   perpendicular to similar or equal to 1 The heat flux associated with the
   observed thermal energy electron velocity distribution was upward and on
   the order of similar to 10(-2)erg cm(-2)s(-1), and was a factor of 5
   larger than that of the atmospheric photoelectrons above 10 eV. In this
   altitude region, the higher-energy (> a few eV) photoelectrons are
   essentially collisionless. In contrast, the ambient and lower-energy
   photoelectrons remain collisional because of their larger Coulomb
   collision cross sections. In the steady state, an ambipolar electric
   field is required to maintain quasi-neutrality along the field line. It
   is suggested that the ambipolar electric field and the Coulomb
   collisions modify the velocity distributions of the thermal energy
   electrons and the photoelectrons, resulting in the observed temperature
   anisotropy. The upward heat flux associated with the observed
   temperature anisotropy dominates any downward heat flux due to electron
   temperature gradients that may be present in the polar wind plasma and
   demonstrates the important role of the photoelectrons in the dynamics of
   the polar wind.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic events leading to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
   often involve chromosomal alterations that can be detected as loss of
   heterozygosity (LOH). In the Eker rat, spontaneous tumors of the kidney,
   uterus, and spleen develop as a result of a germline mutation of the
   tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) gene. We examined the pattern and frequency
   of LOH at the predisposing locus in 77 primary tumors and cell lines to
   gain an understanding of the role of Tsc2 allelic loss in the
   pathogenesis of Eker-derived tumors. Although most renal and uterine
   tumors (primary and cell lines) displayed LOH, splenic hemangiosarcomas
   did not. Although the presence of normal tissue may account for some of
   this difference, the possibility exists that an alternative mechanism,
   such as subtle mutation or gene dosage effects, may be involved during
   splenic tumorigenesis. Northern analysis confirmed that LOH resulted in
   loss of the wild-type transcripts for the Tsc2 gene. Thus, the
   inactivation of both alleles plays an important role in renal and
   uterine tumor development, in keeping with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.
   In addition, renal tumors that retained the wild-type allele also did
   not express the normal transcript, suggesting that the remaining Tsc2
   alleles had acquired subtle mutations resulting in loss of gene
   function. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Sectorial components of the geomagnetic decadal variations correlate
   well with the length-of-day (LOD) variation. Furthermore, when the Gauss
   coefficients g(m)(m) are plotted against h(m)(m) (g-h plot), the
   trajectories of the geomagnetic variation lie almost on a straight line.
   The linearity indicates the existence of a spatial preferential
   direction, which can be interpreted as the pattern of the core-mantle
   boundary (CMB) topography. We therefore propose that the sectorial
   components of the geomagnetic decade variations are caused by LOD
   variation through bumps at the CMB. We examine the geomagnetic
   variations using the topographic interaction model developed by Yoshida
   and Hamano (Geophys. J. Int., 114: 696-710, 1993) for modeling the
   westward drift of the geomagnetic field. Accurate observations of the
   decadal LOD variation over the past century enable us to assess the
   advantages and disadvantages of the model. The patterns of the time
   variations of the sectorial geomagnetic fields are found to be explained
   well by our model, if the basic toroidal field is assumed to be
   symmetric about the equator. However, the inferred variation of the time
   delays with the wavenumber is difficult to explain. The model allows us
   to infer the sectorial components of the CMB topography from the
   preferential direction of the g-h plot. The resulting pattern correlates
   well with the seismic heterogeneity of the lower mantle, although the
   inferred amplitude of the CMB undulation is unrealistically large.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-four samples of domestic wheat and barley grains, collected from
   eight prefect;res of different locations in Japan and previously
   determined to be positive for deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NN)
   and/or zearalenone (ZEA), were analysed for acetylated derivatives of
   DON and NIV by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition to DON
   and NIV 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol
   (15-ADON) and 4-acetylnivalenol (4-ANIV) were found in 25, 4 and 14
   samples, respectively. A regional difference in the DON and NIV
   contamination of Japanese wheat and barley was suggested: DON was the
   major trichothecene in the northern district and NN in the central
   districts, whereas in the southern districts the DON level was similar
   to or slightly higher than the NIV level. 3-ADON occurred together with
   DON in almost all prefectures examined, whereas 15-ADON was found only
   in samples from northern districts. In addition, a high correlation (r =
   0.974, n = 23) between levels of DON and its acetates (3-ADON and
   15-ADON) was noted. These results may also suggest the possibility of a
   geographic difference in the distribution of different chemotypes of
   Fusarium species producing these trichothecenes in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac-specific hormone, is stored
   in the atria and released in response to atrial stretch. During cardiac
   hypertrophy, ANP gene expression is markedly upregulated in the left
   ventricle (LV). Because the hearts of normotensive senescent rats
   exhibit left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and
   dilatation, we examined ANP mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis and
   ANP peptide concentrations by radioimmunoassay in atria, LVs, and plasma
   of rats at 2, 6, 18, and 22-24 mo of age. Compared with LVs of B-mo-old
   rats, the LV-to-body weight ratio was elevated 30\% by 18 mo of age,
   whereas levels of ANP mRNA were elevated twofold (not significant) and
   sevenfold (P < 0.05) in the LV of 18- and 22- to 24-mo-old rats,
   respectively. The concentration of immunoreactive ANP (ir-ANP) exhibited
   a four- to fivefold increase in LVs of 18- and 22- to 24-mo-old rats
   compared with values for 6-mo-old rats (43 +/- 4 pmol/g wet wt; means
   +/- SE). Among 18- and 22- to 24-mo-old rats a significant correlation
   was observed between ANP peptide concentration and LV hypertrophy (r(2)
   = 0.64). Levels of ANP mRNA and ir-ANP in the atria exhibited only
   modest changes with aging. Plasma ir-ANP concentrations were 2.4-fold
   higher at 18 mo of age compared with the 6-mo value of 9.7 +/- 1.9
   fmol/ml but were intermediate at 22 mo of age (16.8 +/- 1.5 fmol/ml).
   Given the size of the LV relative to the atria, these data suggest LV
   endocrine release may contribute significantly to circulating ANP levels
   in the senescent rat. The correlation between ir-ANP and hypertrophy in
   the LVs of older rats suggests that a common mechanism(s) is responsible
   for the age-associated increases in ANP gene expression and cardiac
   hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have previously demonstrated a model for the determination
   of the thickness uniformity on flat, horizontal plates, which is based
   upon an empirically observed inverse power law relationship between the
   coating thickness and the source-to-substrate distance. The model is
   simple to use because it only requires a small number of measured data,
   provided that the locations are accurately known relative to the source.
   This paper employs zirconia-based coatings, deposited using
   electron-beam-based deposition techniques, onto large substrates, to
   provide further confirmation for the use of the above model. Of
   particular interest was the effect on the thickness distribution that
   resulted from scanning the beam during operation rather than letting it
   remain stationary. In addition, because the relative intensities of the
   evaporant flux and the sputter bombardment from the plasma will vary
   across the plate, it might be expected that the structure of the coating
   may also change across the substrate, so this effect is also studied.
   Zirconia was selected for this work because, since the coatings are
   relatively thick, it is possible to observe changes caused in the
   structure as a consequence of the changing ratio of evaporation flux
   arrival:sputter removal that results from ion bombardment.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of growth hormone, its mediator insulin-like growth factor-I
   (IGF-I), and fetal calf serum on odontogenesis were compared to those of
   serum-free medium. Explanted, 16-day, fetal mouse first molar tooth
   germs in early bell stage were grown on semisolid, serum-free medium
   supplemented with ascorbic and retinoic acids. Recombinant human growth
   hormone at 50 or 100 ng/ml, IGF-I at 100 or 200 ng/ml, or fetal calf
   serum at 20\% concentration were added to the media. Volumetric changes
   in serial sections of six tooth germs per treatment over 3 days of
   treatment (4, 5, 6 days in vitro) were compared by digitized
   morphometry. Mitotic indices were also compared and the cell densities
   of the dental papillae recorded. Qualitative ratings of differentiation
   were ascribed to each tooth germ by light microscopy. Differences in
   volume, mitotic activity and cell densities were found. The growth
   hormone-treated tooth germs were not larger than the serum-free ones but
   had increased mitotic indices and higher cell densities in the dental
   papillae. IGF-I-treated tooth germs had larger volumes than with all
   other treatments, e.g. germs treated with 200 ng/ml of IGF-I, after 6
   days in culture, were significantly larger than with all other
   treatments (p < 0.01 - < 0.001). Whilst IGF-I-treated germs displayed
   the greatest extent of differentiation, growth hormone-treated germs
   also showed advanced differentiation compared to those on serum-free
   medium. These results suggest that growth hormone and IGF-I are involved
   in odontogenesis of murine teeth in vitro by affecting mitotic activity,
   tissue volume and cell differentiation. In conjunction with previous
   immunohistochemical studies that show expression of growth hormone
   receptor and IGF-I in developing teeth, these results provide evidence
   that both growth hormone and its mediator play a part in odontogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed Sr-Nd isotopic study of primary apatite, calcite and dolomite
   from phoscorites and carbonatites of the Kovdor massif (380 Ma), Kola
   peninsula, Russia, reveals a complicated evolutionary history, At least
   six types of phoscorites and five types of carbonatite have been
   identified from Kovdor by previous investigators based on relative ages
   and their major and accessory minerals. Isotopic data from apatite
   define at least two distinct groups of phoscorite and carbonatite.
   Apatite from the earlier phoscorites and carbonatites (group 1) are
   characterized by relatively low Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.70330-0.70349) and
   Nd-143/Nd-144 initial ratios (0.51230-0.51240) with F = 2.01-2.23 wt\%,
   Sr = 2185-2975 ppm: Nd = 275-660 ppm and Sm = 31.7-96.2 ppm. Apatite
   from the second group has higher Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.70350-0.70363) and
   Nd-143/Nd-144 initial ratios (0.51240-0.51247) and higher F (2.63-3.16
   wt\%), Sr (4790-7500 ppm), Nd (457-1074 ppm) and Sm (68.7-147.6 ppm)
   contents. This group corresponds to the later phoscorites and
   carbonatites. One apatite sample from a carbonatite from the earlier
   group fits into neither of the two groups and is characterized by the
   highest initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.70385) and lowest Nd-143/Nd-144 (0.51229)
   of any of the apatites. Within both groups initial Sr-87/Sr-86 and
   Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios show negative correlations. Strontium isotope data
   from coexisting calcite and dolomite support the findings from the
   apatite study. The Sr and Nd isotopic similarities between carbonatites
   and phoscorites indicate a genetic relationship between the two rock
   types. Wide variations in Sr and Nd isotopic composition within some of
   the earlier carbonatites indicate several distinct intrusive phases.
   Oxygen isotopic data from calcite and dolomite (delta(18)O = +7.2 to
   +7.7 parts per thousand, SMOW) indicate the absence of any
   low-temperature secondary processes in phoscorites and carbonatites, and
   are consistent with a mantle origin for their parental melts. Apatite
   data from both groups of phoscorite plot in the depleted quadrant of an
   epsilon(Nd) versus epsilon(Sr) diagram, Data for the earlier group lie
   along the Kola Carbonatite Line (KCL) as defined by Kramm (1993) and
   data from the later group plot above the KCL. The evolution of the
   phoscorites and carbonatites cannot be explained by simple magmatic
   differentiation assuming closed system conditions. The Sr-Nd data can
   best be explained by the mixing of three components, Two of these are
   similar to the end-members that define the Kola Carbonatite Line and
   these were involved in the genesis of the early phoscorites and
   carbonatites. An additional component is needed to explain the isotopic
   characteristics of the later group. Our study shows that apatite from
   rocks of different mineralogy and age is ideal for placing constraints
   on mantle sources and for monitoring the Sr-Nd evolution of
   carbonatites.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effect of a short course of methylxanthines on renal
   function and on urinary calcium excretion, 20 premature neonates
   affected by apnea or moderate respiratory distress syndrome were
   randomly assigned to either a theophylline treatment or to a caffeine
   treatment group. The protocol included a 24-hour pretreatment study
   period (I) and a subsequent 24-hour period (II) following 5 days of
   theophylline (loading dose 5 mg/kg i.v., maintenance dose 2.5 mg/kg/12
   h) or caffeine (loading dose 10 mg/kg i.v., maintenance dose 2.5
   mg/kg/12 h) administration. Pre- and postxanthine treatment serum
   sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus remained stable, while serum
   creatinine decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Furthermore, from period
   I to period II, sodium urine excretion, fractional Na excretion and
   creatinine clearance remained statistically comparable in both study
   groups, along with a significant increase (p < 0.05) in calciuria,
   urinary Ca/creatinine and urinary Ca/Na. Predose caffeine and
   theophylline serum levels, assessed on the 5th day of treatment, were
   12.8 +/- 1.8 and 7.9 +/- 1.7 mu g/ml, respectively. Compared to control
   healthy untreated prematures, the studied premature infants showed a
   statistically significant increase in urine calcium excretion (10- to
   15-fold), which was more evident in the theophylline group. Our data
   suggest further investigation to determine the long-term renal effects
   of methylxanthines in premature neonates, to improve assessment of the
   risk of nephrocalcinosis and osteopenia, in particular in association
   with various diuretic therapies.}},

Abstract = {{To date several studies have evaluated the accuracy of thallium-201
   myocardial scan in risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD),
   while reports using technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI), a
   tracer particularly suited to single-photon emission tomographic (SPET)
   imaging, are lacking. To rectify this omission, a prospective study was
   started in 1988 and at present 176 consecutive, and thus unselected,
   patients have been enrolled. All of them have been submitted to
   stress-rest MIBI SPET for the diagnosis or evaluation of CAD; 147
   patients (121 males and 26 females, aged 53 +/- 9 years) have completed
   a surveillance period of at least 36 months following the scintigraphic
   study (range 36-60 months, mean 43). Sixty-one patients had a documented
   previous myocardial infarction. The mean pretest likelihood of CAD was
   44\% in the patients without prior infarction. The main anamnestic,
   clinical, EKG and scintigraphic findings were evaluated and
   statistically correlated with the incidence of ensuing cardiac events
   using both univariate (chi-square test) and multivariate analysis
   (logistic regression model). Twenty-nine patients suffered from a
   cardiac event during the follow-up period (i.e. three cardiac deaths,
   six myocardial infarctions and 20 cases of unstable angina). Statistical
   multivariate analysis identified MIBI scan as the only highly
   significant and independent prognostic predictor {[}P = 0.006, relative
   risk (RR) = 17.62]. In detail, the most important scintigraphic
   parameters were the presence of a reversible defect (P = 0.0089, RR =
   5.11) and the extension of the stress perfusion defect (P = 0.0255, RR =
   3.27). The presence of typical angina proved to be a slightly
   significant predictor (P = 0.051, RR = 2.45), while no other examined
   parameter showed a significant correlation with a bad prognosis. In
   conclusion, MIBI SPET can be considered a useful tool in the risk
   stratification of CAD patients. The presence of a reversible perfusion
   defect or an extensive defect appears responsible for a clear increase
   in the probability of subsequent cardiac events, thus indicating a more
   aggressive therapeutic approach to be appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphocyte interactions with other leukocytes and other cell types, as
   well as with components of the extracellular matrix, are one of the key
   steps in the immune response. Three novel monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs)
   have been produced and selected for their ability to induce
   intercellular adhesion in B cells. These three MoAbs immunoprecipitated
   a polypeptide of 220 kD, displaying specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase
   activity th at has been identified as CD45. These MoAbs recognize
   epitopes located on the alternative spliced exon-A-encoded region of
   CD45. These epitopes are of polypeptidic nature, but they can be masked
   by addition of carbohydrate during CD45 biosynthesis. Interestingly
   enough, CD45 epitopes recognized by these MoAbs appeared to be
   selectively expressed on both peripheral blood and tonsillar B
   lymphocytes as well as on peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells,
   CD45-mediated intercellular adhesion was abrogated upon incubation with
   anti-leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (anti-LFA-1), intercellular
   cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and ICAM-3 MoAbs, thus indicating
   that this phenomenon involved both LFA-1/ICAM-1 and LFA-1/ICAM-3 cell
   adhesion pathways. Moreover, CD45-mediated cell aggregation was also
   inhibited by preincubation with some conventional anti-CD45 MoAbs.
   interestingly, the triggering of cell aggregation through CD45 induced
   membrane surface relocation of CD45 and LFA-1 molecules, with both of
   them colocalizing at cell-cell contact areas of B-cell aggregates.
   Studies with inhibitors of both phosphotyrosine phosphatase and tyrosine
   kinase activities suggest that CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity
   could be involved in CD45-mediated cell aggregation. Taken together,
   these results support the notion that CD45 is a key molecule in the
   regulation of LFA-1-mediated cell-cell interactions. (C) 1995 by The

Abstract = {{This study examined the decrease in cesarean section rates in relation
   to perinatal mortality bent een 1987 and 1993 at the primary referral
   hospital in north Jordan. Most of the population is at high risk and of
   low socioeconomic status. The cesarean section rate decreased from 15.5
   percent in 1987 to 8.7 percent in 1993, and has remained at this low
   rate. During the same period the perinatal mortality dropped from 52 to
   20.9 deaths per 1000 live births. These results do not include perinatal
   morbidity. The successful reduction of the cesarean section rate is
   attributed to active management of label; trial of labor for women with
   a previous cesarean birth, and vaginal breech delivery in selected
   women. We conclude that the rate of cesarean delivery can be safely
   reduced in a developing country without adverse effects on birth

Abstract = {{Brain tissue of a patient with multiple myeloma suffering from
   neurological disorders similar to those seen in progressive multifocal
   leukoencephalopathy (PML) patients was evaluated for the presence of the
   papovavirus, JCV. Results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed
   the presence of JCV with structural organization at the control region
   which is distinct from well-characterized isolates, ie Mad-1 and Mad-4.
   The control region of the new isolate, named JCV(Phila-1), contains a 22
   nucleotide insertion which separates the TATA box from the NF-1
   regulatory motif. Only 18 nucleotides of the insert are duplicated in
   the second copy of the enhancer/promoter of the new isolate, which is 84
   nucleotides in size. Results from a transcription assay indicate a
   modest elevated level of JCV(Phila-1) early promoter activity compared
   to that of JCV(Mad-4) in glial cell lines. The basal and
   T-antigen-induced transcriptional activities of the JCV(Phila-1) late
   promoter was lower with respect to Mad-4 late gene activity in glial
   cells. Of particular interest was the observation that in the cells
   producing the early protein, T-antigen, JCV(Phila-1) DNA replicated more
   efficiently then the Mad-4 DNA. These results suggest that the
   alterations seen in the JCV(Phila-1) control region may differentially
   influence early and late gene expression and facilitate amplification of
   the viral genome in cells derived from the CNS.}},

Abstract = {{This study has quantified the effects of insulin treatment with and
   without aldose reductase inhibitor (ponalrestat) on intestinal
   epithelial cell morphology in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Epithelial
   volumes, villous and microvillous surface areas and mean volumes of
   cells (and their nuclei) in crypts and villi were estimated in each of
   four segments and in the entire intestine. We derived total numbers of
   cells, quantified the ultrastructural features of average cells and
   explored variation along the intestine and between experimental groups.
   In crypts, insulin and ponalrestat had significant effects on cell
   number (reduced towards normal values) and size (volume and apex area
   increased beyond normal values). There were interaction effects between
   insulin and ponalrestat for cell volume and apex area (insulin producing
   more exaggerated effects when given without ponalrestat). On villi,
   insulin and ponalrestat returned cell numbers towards normal values but
   neither treatment normalised cell size or the number and area of
   microvilli per cell. Indeed, ponalrestat increased microvillous number
   and area beyond values found in untreated diabetic animals. Again, there
   were interaction effects between insulin and ponalrestat. Patterns of
   segmental variation seen in crypts of normal rats (values tending to be
   higher in proximal or mid-intestinal regions) were not preserved, and
   only some of the segmental differences seen on villi (higher values at
   proximal or mid-intestinal sites) were maintained during therapy. Apart
   from reducing the abnormally high numbers of cells in untreated diabetic
   rats, these results show that insulin and ponalrestat treatment fail to
   restitute epithelial cell morphology in the small intestines of
   experimental diabetic rats.}},

Abstract = {{Oestrogen has been reported to modulate tumour necrosis factor (TNF),
   interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 cytokine levels in human mononuclear cell
   cultures. In the present study, the effects of exogenous oestrogen
   administration on the cytokine response to an endotoxin challenge was
   investigated in a murine model of endotoxemia. Animals pretreated for 4
   days with 17 alpha ethinyl oestradiol exhibited divergent regulation of
   TNF and IL-6 levels in sera from endotoxin-stimulated mice. Oestrogen
   treatment resulted in a significant increase in serum TNF while serum
   IL-6 levels, relative to the placebo group, decreased in response to an
   endotoxin challenge. These oestrogenic effects were dose dependent with
   maximal elevations observed in TNF at 1 mg/kg and maximal reduction in
   IL-6 at 0.1 mg/kg of 17 alpha ethinyl oestradiol. The increase in TNF
   levels by ethinyl oestradiol was blocked by co-administration of the
   oestrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. Oestrogen-mediated modulation
   of the TNF and IL-6 response to endotoxin was also apparent in animals
   implanted with 17 beta oestradiol pellets. The oestrogen-mediated
   effects on serum IL-6 were consistent with a reduction in IL-6 mRNA in
   peritoneal macrophages from oestrogen-treated mice. The effects of
   oestrogen on TNF and IL-6 production were also investigated in vitro.
   Oestradiol-treated macrophage cultures produced three- to fourfold lower
   amounts of IL-6 without any significant modulatory effects on TNF
   secretion. The combined in vivo and in vitro results demonstrate the
   modulation of IL-6 and TNF during endotoxemia by oestrogen analogues
   through an oestrogen receptor-dependent mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate target detection is fundamental to many industrial measuring
   applications. One type of target uses retroreflective material for
   defining object surface points. In a photogrammetric procedure camera at
   different positions illuminate these targets, which are imaged onto the
   CCD array. By intersecting all the lines of sight, the targets are fixed
   in space. In the past, accuracy improvements have been concentrated
   mainly on algorithms or sensor calibration, such as better modeling of
   optical and electronic distortions, and less effort has been spent on
   potential targeting problems. It is conventionally assumed that the
   target center is physically fixed and independent of the angle a between
   the target normal and the line of sight. The author investigates this
   assumption in the case of retroreflective targets. Tests have revealed a
   systematic shift of the target center from - 30 to + 30 mu m normal to
   the line of sight, when the target is viewed from different directions,
   i,e. - 40 deg less than or equal to alpha less than or equal to + 40
   deg. There is no shift seen for punched targets.}},

Abstract = {{The spectroelectrochemical behavior of the {[}M(bipy)(3)](2+) complexes
   (M = Co, Ni and bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine) adsorbed on a silver electrode
   has been investigated by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The
   voltammetric measurements have shown that in the case of the
   {[}Co(bipy)(3)](2+) complex two redox processes can occur. The first
   one, reversible, occurs near 0.2 V (SCE) and has been assigned to the
   Co(II)/Co(III) redox process. The SERS results suggest that the
   transferred electron on going from Co(III) to Co(II) is localized on a
   molecular orbital with a main contribution of an atomic orbital of the
   central ion. The Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox process could not be monitored by
   SERS. The second redox process, less reversible, is observed for
   potentials more negative than -1.0 V, for both complexes. The dependence
   of the Raman frequencies on the applied potentials supports the
   conclusion that the electron transferred in this process is localized in
   the bipy ligand. Further evidence for the localization of the
   transferred electron on the ligand is given by reflectance measurements
   for both complexes. On the basis of the charge-transfer model for SERS
   and on the data given by the dependence of SERS excitation profiles on
   the laser excitation energy, an energy diagram for the adsorbed
   complexes is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Precise determinations of the isotopic compositions of molybdenum,
   tellurium, tin and tungsten were obtained utilizing an inductively
   coupled plasma (ICP) source magnetic sector mass spectrometer equipped
   with multiple collectors. The results of this study are comparable to
   those measured by conventional and negative thermal ionization mass
   spectrometry (TIMS and NTIMS) and the values recommended by the
   International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), but with
   improvement in precision by up to two orders of magnitude. The relative
   isotopic abundances and atomic weight for each element calculated from
   the data obtained in this study are also in excellent agreement with
   previously published values. The only disagreement between this study
   and IUPAC recommended values is for tellurium. However, with the
   exception of Te-130, the Te data are in good agreement with those
   reported in a recent study by De Laeter {[}1]. The results of this study
   demonstrate the capability of this new instrument to produce precise and
   reproducible isotopic data for elements that are difficult to ionize and
   measure with TIMS. Furthermore, the greater precision of isotopic
   measurements possible with the ICP source multiple collector magnet
   sector mass spectrometer greatly enhances the prospects for research on
   the distribution and isotopic compositions of these elements in
   terrestrial and meteoritic materials.}},

   limit (described by just such a gauge field) is that of free field
   theory: First we approximate a gauge invariant version of Wilson's
   renormalization group by neglecting all higher derivative terms similar
   to partial derivative(n) F in L, but allowing for a general
   non-vanishing anomalous dimension. Then we prove analytically that the
   resulting flow equation has only one acceptable fixed point: the

Abstract = {{Growth and grazing rates of a naked heterotrophic dinoflagellate,

   Inland Sea (Harima strain) and Tokyo Bay (Tokyo strain) in Japan were
   used for the experiments. Both strains grew well when fed amorphous
   materials (such as bacterial flocs with attached nanoflagellates and
   aggregates of a small diatom) and plankton species with ESD of 15 to 26
   mu m. The Tokyo strain also grew rapidly when fed small (ca 5 mu m)
   phytoplankton species at levels higher than 1 x 10(5) ml(-1). However,
   rates of ingestion of Nephroselmis aff. rotunda (ESD = 4.5 mu m) by the
   Tokyo strain were too low to sustain rapid growth of G. dominans at
   natural levels of small (2 to 8 mu m) flagellate abundance (<3 x 10(4)
   ml(-1)). Ingestion of Heterocapsa triquetra (ESD = 15.3 mu m) followed
   Michaelis-Menten kinetics with half-saturation constants of 820 and 180
   ml(-1) and maximum ingestion rates of 0.82 and 0.59 prey predator(-1)
   h(-1) for the Harima and Tokyo strains, respectively. The clearance
   rates of both strains feeding on H. triquetra were about 2 orders of
   magnitude higher than those for N, aff, rotunda. These results indicate
   that G. dominans can play an important role in the decline of red tides
   caused by large (> 15 mu m) nanoflagellates such as Gymnodinium
   mikimotoi.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design for an antireflection (AR) coating layer on facets of
   laser diodes (LDs) is proposed and the validity of the design is
   confirmed experimentally. The proposed novel AR coating, consisting of
   multilayers, is designable such that the characteristic matrix is
   equivalent to that of the ideal quarter wavelength single layer AR
   coating. Applying this idea to laser diodes with a lasing wavelength of
   1.3 mu m and equivalent refractive index of 3.2, a very low reflectivity
   of 0.08\% has been realised by the stratified three layers which consist
   of alumina (Al2O3, 9O2 Angstrom)/amorphous silicon (a-Si, 83 Angstrom)/
   Al2O3 (902 Angstrom), deposited by electron beam evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The metabolic effects and mechanism of action of metformin
   are still poorly understood, despite the fact that it has been used to
   treat patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) for
   more than 30 years.
   Methods. In 10 obese patients with NIDDM, we used a combination of
   isotope dilution, indirect calorimetry, bioimpedance, and tissue-balance
   techniques to assess the effects of metformin on systemic lactate,
   glucose, and free-fatty-acid turnover, lactate oxidation and the
   conversion of lactate to glucose; skeletal-muscle glucose and lactate
   metabolism; body composition; and energy expenditure before and after
   four months of treatment.
   Results. Metformin treatment decreased the mean (+/-SD) glycosylated
   hemoglobin value from 13.2+/-2.2 percent to 10.5+/-1.6 percent (P<0.001)
   and reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations from 220+/-41 to
   155+/-28 mg per deciliter (12.2+/-0.7 to 8.6+/-0.5 mmol per liter)
   (P<0.001). Although resting energy expenditure did not change, the
   patients lost 2.7+/-1.3 kg of weight (P<0.001:), 88 percent of which was
   adipose tissue. The mean (+/-SE) rate of plasma glucose turnover
   (hepatic glucose output and systemic glucose disposal) decreased from
   2.8+/-0.2 to 2.0+/-0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute
   (15.3+/-0.9 to 10.8+/-0.9 mu mol per kilogram per minute) (P<0.001), as
   a result of a decrease in hepatic glucose output; systemic glucose
   clearance did not change. The rate of conversion of lactate to glucose
   (gluconeogenesis) decreased by 37 percent (P<0.001), whereas lactate
   oxidation increased by 25 percent (P<0.001). There were no changes in
   the plasma lactate concentration, plasma lactate turnover, muscle
   lactate release, plasma free-fatty-acid turnover or uptake of glucose by
   muscle.
   Conclusions. Metformin acts primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose
   output, largely by inhibiting gluconeogenesis, It also seems to induce
   weight toss, preferentially involving adipose tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of age on immunohischemically demonstrable neurotrophin
   receptor proteins (p75, trkA-, trkB-, and trkC-proteins) was studied in
   the cerebellar cortex of Wistar male rats aged 3 (young), 12 (adult) and
   24 (old) months. The number of Purkinje neurons displaying p75, trkA-
   and trkC-like proteins immunoreactivity (IR), as well as the intensity
   of p75 and trkA-like protein IR, were significantly reduced in aged rats
   in comparison with 3 and 12-month-old rats. The intensity of trkC-like
   protein in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons remained unchanged for all
   the period studied. Moreover, no significant age-dependent changes were
   observed in the density of p75 or trkC-like proteins IR in the granule
   neurons layer, The molecular layer showed faint p75 IR which decreased
   as a function of age. No immunolabelling for neuronal trkB-like proteins
   was observed, but trkB- and trkC-like proteins IR was found in
   non-neuronal cells. These results suggest that cerebellar cortex neurons
   are responsive to and/or dependent upon different neurotrophins.
   Moreover, the age-dependent impairment in the expression of some
   neurotrophin receptors in Purkinje neurons, but not in the granule
   neurons, lends support to a role for neurotrophins in cerebellar aging.}},

Abstract = {{The post-translational processing and intracellular sorting of the
   proinsulin-converting enzyme carboxypeptidase H (CPH) was studied in
   isolated rat islets of Langerhans. Pulse-chase-radiolabelling
   experiments using sequence-specific antisera showed that CPH was
   synthesized initially as a 57-kDa glycoprotein which was processed to a
   54-kDa mature form by proteolytic processing at the N-terminus.
   Processing of the CPH precursor occurred rapidly (t(1/2) = 30 min) after
   an initial delay of 15-30 min and the enzyme was secreted in parallel
   with the insulin-related peptides in response to glucose-stimulation
   within 1 h after radiolabelling. This indicated that the proteins were
   packaged into nascent secretory granules at approximately the same rate
   following synthesis. Conversion of proinsulin and the 57-kDa form of CPH
   was inhibited markedly by chase incubation of islets at 20 degrees C,
   indicating that maturation of both proteins occurs in a post-Golgi
   compartment. Affinity purification of the enzyme from insulinoma
   subcellular fractions showed that the 57-kDa form was associated with
   endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi elements, and the 54-kDa form was present
   in secretory granules. Structural analysis showed that the granule form
   of the enzyme had an N-terminal amino acid sequence beginning at residue
   42 of rat CPH, thereby implicating cleavage of the precursor after the
   fourth Arg in a site containing five consecutive Arg residues. These
   findings indicate that post-translational processing of CPH is mediated
   by an endoprotease which cleaves at sites containing multiple basic
   amino acid residues upon segregation of the enzyme to the secretory
   granules.}},

Abstract = {{A new hybrid algorithm for automatically generating either an
   all-quadrilateral or an all-triangular element mesh within an
   arbitrarily shaped domain is described. The input consists of one or
   more closed loops of straight-line segments that bound the domain.
   Internal mesh density is inferred from the boundary density using a
   recursive spatial decomposition (quadtree) procedure. All-triangular
   element meshes are generated using a boundary contraction procedure.
   All-quadrilateral element meshes are generated by modifying the boundary
   contraction procedure to produce a mixed element mesh at half the
   density of the final mesh and then applying a polygon-splitting
   procedure. The final meshes exhibit good transitioning properties and
   are compatible with the given boundary segments which are not altered.
   The algorithm can support discrete crack growth simulation wherein each
   step of crack growth results in an arbitrarily shaped region of elements
   deleted about each crack tip. The algorithm is described and examples of
   the generated meshes are provided for a representative selection of
   cracked and uncracked structures.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work a continuous flow system to carry out
   spectrophotometric titrations is developed. The titrant solution is
   generated on-line from mixing two different stock buffer solutions. The
   composition of the titrant agent is sequentially varied along the
   titration by changing the ratio of flow rates of both buffer channels,
   and therefore the pH can be modified. One spectrum is recorded at each
   pH value when the absorbance achieves the steady state. The spectral
   data have been treated by means of a recently developed self-modelling
   multivariate curve resolution method (SPFAC procedure). This method has
   been applied to the study of the acid-base equilibria of
   1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (NQS). Four titrations with
   concentrations of NQS ranging from 1.6 X 10(-4) to 7.3 X 10(-4) M have
   been performed, and, in every case, 24 spectra at different pH have been
   registered. Three species are detected in the range of pH studied
   (6.9-12.3). Their distribution plot with pH and their unit spectrum have
   been obtained.}},

   1-{[}2-(decylthio)ethyl]azacyclopentane-2-one (HPE-101), was assessed in
   the nasal absorption of an LHRH agonist, buserelin acetate (BLA), in
   rats. HP-beta-CyD increased the solubility of HPE-101 in water through
   the formation of an inclusion complex, and hence facilitated the
   transfer of HPE-101 into the nasal mucosa. The nasal administration of
   the combined system of HPE-101 and HP-beta-CyD led to a significant
   increase in plasma BLA levels in the rats. This enhancement effect was
   ascribable to the lowering of both enzymatic and permeation barriers to
   the peptide in the nasal mucosa. The release of membrane proteins and
   scanning electron microscopic observations indicated that local mucosal
   damage due to the coadministration of HPE-101 and HP-beta-CyD may not be
   a serious obstacle to their safe use. The results obtained here suggest
   that HP-beta-CyD potentiates the action of the lipophilic absorption

Abstract = {{In this paper, we illustrate the usefulness of spray-drying as a
   resourceful procedure for preparing solid dispersions. The study in the
   solid state of the triamterene-D-mannitol system from 10 to 40\% w/w
   drug included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction
   (DRX) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The main finding
   arising from the former studies was that a strong drug-carrier
   interaction existed in the systems prepared by spray-drying. In
   contrast, solid dispersions prepared by the melting carrier method
   showed only weak interactions between triamterene and D-mannitol. This
   observation helps to explain the much better dissolution rates obtained
   for the spray-dried outputs.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have established a link between blood coagulation and
   canter, and more specifically between tissue factor (TF), a
   transmembrane protein involved in initiating blood coagulation, and
   tumor metastasis. In the study reported here, a murine model of human
   melanoma metastasis was used for two experiments, (i) The first
   experiment was designed to test the effect of varying the level of TF
   expression in human melanoma cells on their metastatic potential, Two
   matched sets of cloned human melanoma lines, one expressing a high level
   and the other a low level of the normal human TF molecule, were
   generated by retroviral-mediated transfections of a nonmetastatic
   parental line, The metastatic potential of the two sets of transfected
   lines was compared by injecting the tumor cells into the tail vein of
   severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and later examining the
   lungs and other tissues for tumor development. Metastatic tumors were
   detected in 86\% of the mice injected with the high-TF lines and in 5\%
   of the mice injected with the low-TF lines, indicating that a high TF
   level promotes metastasis of human melanoma in the SCID mouse model,
   This TF effect on metastasis occurs with i.v.-injected melanoma cells
   but does not occur with primary tumors formed from s.c.-injected
   melanoma cells, suggesting that TF acts at a late stage of metastasis,
   after tumor cells have escaped from the primary site and entered the
   blood, (ii) The second experiment was designed to analyze the mechanism
   by which TF promotes melanoma metastasis. The procedure involved testing
   the effect on metastasis of mutations in either the extracellular or
   cytoplasmic domains of the transmembrane TF molecule, The extracellular
   mutations introduced two amino acid substitutions that inhibited
   initiation by TF of the blood-coagulation cascade; the cytoplasmic
   mutation deleted most of the cytoplasmic domain without impairing the
   coagulation function of TF, Several human melanoma lines expressing high
   levels of either of the two mutant TF molecules were generated by
   retroviral-mediated transfection of the corresponding TF cDNA into the
   nonmetastatic parental melanoma line, and the metastatic potential of
   each transfected line was tested in the SCID mouse model, Metastases
   occurred in most mice injected with the melanoma lines expressing the
   extracellular TF mutant but were not detected in most mice injected with
   the melanoma lines expressing the cytoplasmic TF mutant, Results with
   the extracellular TF mutant indicate that the metastatic effect of TF in
   the SCID mouse model does not involve products of the coagulation
   cascade. Results with the cytoplasmic TF mutant indicate that the
   cytoplasmic domain of TF is important for the metastatic effect,
   suggesting that the TF could transduce a melanoma cell signal that
   promotes metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{The positive effects of Myc on cellular growth and gene expression are
   antagonized by activities of another member of the Myc superfamily, Mad.
   Characterization of the mouse homolog of human mad on the structural
   level revealed that domains shown previously to be required in the human
   protein for anti-Myc repression, sequence-specific DNA-binding activity,
   and dimerization with its partner Max are highly conserved. Conservation
   is also evident on the biological level in that both human and mouse mad
   can antagonize the ability of c-myc to cooperate with ras in the
   malignant transformation of cultured cells. An analysis of c-myc and mad
   gene expression in the developing mouse showed contrasting patterns with
   respect to tissue distribution and developmental stage. Regional
   differences in expression were more striking on the cellular level,
   particularly in the mouse and human gastrointestinal system, wherein
   c-Myc protein was readily detected in immature proliferating cells at
   the base of the colonic crypts, while Mad protein distribution was
   restricted to the postmitotic differentiated cells in the apex of the
   crypts. An increasing gradient of Mad was also evident in the more
   differentiated subcorneal layers of the stratified squamous epithelium
   of the skin. Together, these observations support the view that both
   downregulation of Myc and accumulation of Mad may be necessary for
   progression of precursor cells to a growth-arrested, terminally
   differentiated state.}},

Abstract = {{Visual pattern memory of Drosophila melanogaster at the torque meter is
   investigated by a new learning paradigm called novelty choice. In this
   procedure the fly is first exposed to four identical patterns presented
   at the wall of the cylinder surrounding it. In the test it has the
   choice between two pairs of patterns, a new one and one the same as the
   training pattern. Flies show a lasting preference for the new figure.
   Figures presented during training are not recognized as familiar in the
   test, if displayed (i) at a different height, (ii) at a different size,
   (iii) rotated or (iv) after contrast reversal. No special invariance
   mechanisms are found. A pixel-by-pixel matching process is sufficient to
   explain the observed data. Minor transfer effects can be explained if a
   graded similarity function is assumed. Recognition depends upon the
   overlap between the stored template and the actual image. The similarity
   function is best described by the ratio of the area of overlap to the
   area of the actual image. The similarity function is independent of the
   geometrical properties of the employed figures. Visual pattern memory at
   this basic level does not require the analysis of shape.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors plays an important role
   in regulating their function, In this study the G-protein-coupled
   receptor phosphatase (GRP) capable of dephosphorylating G-protein
   coupled receptor kinase-phosphorylated receptors is described. The GRP
   activity of bovine brain is a latent oligomeric form of protein
   phosphatase type 2A (PP-2A) exclusively associated with the particulate
   fraction. GRP activity is observed only when assayed in the presence of
   protamine or when phosphatase-containing fractions are subjected to
   freeze/thaw treatment under reducing conditions, Consistent with its
   identification as a member of the PP-2A family, the GRP is potently
   inhibited by okadaic acid but not by I-2, the specific inhibitor of
   protein phosphatase type 1. Solubilization of the membrane-associated
   GRP followed by gel filtration in the absence of detergent yields a
   150-kDa peak of latent receptor phosphatase activity. Western blot
   analysis of this phosphatase reveals a likely subunit composition of
   AB(alpha)C. PP-2A of this subunit composition has previously been
   characterized as a soluble enzyme, yet negligible soluble GRP activity
   was observed, The subcellular distribution and substrate specificity of
   the GRP suggests significant differences between it and previously
   characterized forms of PP-2A.}},

   has been investigated. The first method entails the incorporation of
   non-ionic surfactants which modify the porous structure of gels. Ln this
   case, specific surface area, pore size and porous volume can be varied
   in the final material as a function of chain length and concentration of
   the surfactant. In the second method, self-assembled systems made of
   cationic surfactants develop during the gelation process and lead to an

   intended to support the co-operative browsing and filtering of large
   document stores. VR-VIBE extends a visualisation approach proposed in a
   previous two dimensional system called VIBE into three dimensions,
   allowing more information to be visualised at one time and supporting
   more powerful styles of interaction. The essence of VR-VIBE is that
   multiple users can explore the results of applying several simultaneous
   queries to a corpus of documents. By arranging the queries into a
   spatial framework, the system shows the relative attraction of each
   document to each query by its spatial position and also shows the
   absolute relevance of each document to all of the queries. Users may
   then navigate the space, select individual documents, control the
   display according to a dynamic relevance threshold and dynamically drag
   the queries to new positions to see the effect on the document space.
   Go-operative browsing is supported by directly embodying users and
   providing them with the ability to interact over live audio connections
   and to attach brief textual annotations to individual documents.
   Finally, we conclude with some initial observations gleaned from our
   experience of constructing VR-VIBE and using it in the laboratory

   detected in one family at D6S459, an interval that was excluded in the
   17 cM overlapping region. Here, linkage of CCD to 6p21 was independently
   confirmed with a maximal two-point LOD score of Z=5.12 with marker
   D6S452 at theta=0.00. Recombinant events in two affected individuals
   defined a CCD region of 7 cM from D6S465 to D6S282, which overlapped
   with the CCD region containing the microdeletion but did not overlap
   with the 17 cM critical region from D6S282 to D6S291. These results
   suggest the refined localization of the CCD region to 6 cM spanning

Abstract = {{An electric field, epsilon, shifts the phase equilibria in polymeric
   solutions and distorts anisotropically concentration fluctuations in the
   vicinity of the coexistence curve. I present a statistical theory of
   birefringent binary polymeric solutions. An explicit form for the
   structure factor in terms of the molecular anisotropic polarizabilities
   of the statistical segments, upsilon(A) and upsilon(B), is given. For
   polymers A (containing N-A segments) in a monomeric solvent B, it is
   predicted that in the critical point the anisotropic corrections to the
   light scattering intensity scales as N(A)(1/2)upsilon(A) epsilon(2).
   When upsilon(A) > 0 and upsilon(B) < 0, for polymer A (N-A) plus polymer
   B (NB) solution the resulting anisotropy turns out to be dependent
   solely on the sign of the combination N(A)(-1/2)upsilon(A) +
   N(B)(-1/2)upsilon(B). The theory provides a microscopic argumentation on
   why an electric field suppresses the separation and why the phase
   equilibria shift is proportional to on. We also predict diamond- and
   pillowlike forms of the isointensity contours.}},

   with (\$) over bar M(w) of 3.0 x 10(6) and 1.05 x 10(5) were used to
   simulate relaxation in the PS matrix corresponding to chain reptation

   M(w) of 3.0 x 10(4) and long chains with (\$) over bar M(w) of 3.0 x
   10(6) was used to simulate relaxation in the PS matrix by tube dilation.
   In the binary PS blend, the short chains were deuterated in order to
   monitor the concentration of each component independently. Non-Fickian
   diffusion was observed above and below the T-g of the PS matrix. Above
   the T-g of PS, interdiffusion was enhanced as the matrix relaxation
   mechanism changed from chain reptation to tube dilation to constrained
   release, consistent with the predicted relaxation time of these
   matrices. Below the T-g of PS, interdiffusion was controlled by the rate
   of swelling of PS by PVME and interdiffusion was faster in the binary PS
   blend due to the reduced entanglement density between the long chains.}},

   that at fixed molecular weight (N), as the number of teeth (n) is
   increased, the comb becomes significantly less efficient and the
   disparity between combs and diblocks grows larger. However, when we
   compare combs and diblocks with different molecular weights, we observe
   a trade-off between N and n. In particular, long combs with multiple
   teeth are more efficient than short diblocks. These studies allow us to

Abstract = {{In a refugee camp for Kashmiris it was stated that children had been
   exposed to torture and ill-treatment; consequently, we decided to
   appraise the validity of such statements. Ten boys allegedly exposed to
   torture and 10 children who were said to have been ill-treated were
   interviewed and examined. The veracity of the individual statements
   about exposure was appraised through an assessment of the consistency
   between the history and the clinical findings. In all cases of alleged
   torture, the history was in agreement with clinical findings ascribed to
   torture. Torture methods included cuts with bayonets and burns with
   items easily available in any setting. In five of the 10 cases of
   torture, the scars were highly indicative of intentionally inflicted
   injuries, by their shapes, their presence in clusters and their
   localization in regions not normally exposed to traumatization. Nine of
   the 10 children allegedly exposed to ill-treatment had scars in
   accordance with their histories. In all cases, Indian security forces
   were said to have been responsible for the inflicted violence. The
   histories and the clinical findings were in accordance with results of
   examinations of adult victims of organized violence from the same
   region. On the basis of the physical evidence, in each case in agreement
   with the history, it is concluded that torture of children has occurred
   in Kashmir. Series of children with physical evidence of torture have
   not previously been described in the medical literature.}},

Abstract = {{Pd-Ag/porous stainless steel asymmetric membranes were prepared by
   successive palladium and silver platings in electroless hydrazine baths,
   followed by a thermal treatment in hydrogen of the as-deposited
   membranes above the Tamman temperatures for the alloy formation. The
   prepared membranes were permselective toward hydrogen separation. A
   membrane reactor made of stainless steel was designed to perform methane
   steam reforming. At mild reaction conditions, methane conversion is
   significantly enhanced by partial removal of nydrogen from the reaction
   location as a result of diffusion through the Pd-based membrane. These
   effects were examined under a variety of experimental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has been shown to be an
   appropriate technique for the structural characterization of fullerenes
   in solvents with strong SANS contrast (e.g., CS2) {[}Affholter, K. A.;
   Henderson, S. J.; Wignall, G. D.; Bunick, G. J.; Haufler, R. E.;
   Compton, R. N. J. Chem. Phys. 1993, 99, 9224]. Since deuterated solvents
   (e.g., toluene-d(8)) have a high scattering length density (SLD) which
   is close to that of C-60 and C-70 fullerenes, there is virtually no SANS
   contrast with the solvent, and these particles are practically
   `'invisible'' in such media. On the other hand, the negative scattering
   length of hydrogen means that the SLD of H-1-containing materials is
   much lower, so they have a strong contrast with toluene-d(8). Thus, SANS
   makes it possible to study the sizes and shapes of polymer-substituted
   fullerenes (flagellenes) {[}Samulski, E. T.; DeSimone, J. IM.; Hung, M.
   O., Jr.; Menceloglu, Y. Z.; Jarnagin, R. C.; York, G. A.; Labat, K. B.;
   Wang, H. Chem. Mater. 1992, 4, 1153]. Mono- and
   dipolystyrene-substituted C-60 were synthesized via termination of
   living anionic polymerization of styrene in an optimization of our
   previous work {[}Samulski et al.]. These materials were characterized by
   gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and small-angle neutron
   scattering(SANS). The extrapolated cross section at zero angle of
   scatter {[}d Sigma/d Omega(0)] is a function of the number of pendant
   chains, so SANS can be used to assess the number of `'arms'' which are
   covalently attached to the fullerene `'core''. Close agreement (+/- 4\%)
   between the measured and calculated values of d Sigma/d Omega(0) and
   with independent estimates of the radius of gyration (R(g)) and second
   virial coefficient (A(2)) for a linear polystyrene calibration sample
   serves as a cross check on the validity of this methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(2,5-diheptoxy-p-phenylenevinylene-alt-2,5-dimethoxy-p-phenyleneviny
   lene) (DHDMPPV) exhibits electroluminescence (EL) at room temperature
   when either a conventional de forward bias, or a reverse bias, or an ac
   voltage is applied to the test device, which has a simple ITO (indium
   tin oxide)/polymer/Al configuration. DHDMPPV is a soluble derivative of
   poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) synthesized using a Wittig condensation
   polymerization. Its EL spectrum lies in the orange region with a maximum
   intensity at 582 nm and a shoulder at 620 nm. The EL spectra either
   under a de forward or reverse bias or on the imposition of an ac voltage
   are qualitatively identical. The threshold biases are similar to 5 V for
   de forward bias, similar to 6 V for de reverse bias, and similar to 5 V
   (10 V peak-to-peak) for ac operation, for a polymer emitter film
   thickness of ca. 80 nm. The EL emissions are bright and relatively
   stable at room temperature and can be easily seen under normal light
   conditions. Two other EL-active copolymers were also tested in similar
   configurations; no significant de reverse bias EL was observed. However,
   blends of DHDMPPV with another EL-active copolymer previously described
   show the same behavior as DHDMPPV itself; for example, a 1:1 weight
   ratio blend with a green-light-emitting multiblock copolymer shows only
   an enhanced orange emission from the narrow-band-gap DHDMPPV.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of repeated cocaine administration on serotonin

   catheters and received cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d.) or saline for 7
   days. Rats were challenged with either saline, the 5-HT releaser
   fenfluramine (1.2 mg/kg i.v.), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist
   8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 50 mu g/kg i.v.), or
   the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist
   1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; 100 mu g/kg i,v,) 42
   h and 8 days after the final chronic treatment. Repeated blood samples
   were withdrawn immediately before and at 15, 30 and 60 min after acute
   challenge injections. All 5-HT receptor agonists increased plasma
   corticosterone, but the fenfluramine-induced rise in corticosterone was
   significantly attenuated in cocaine-treated rats withdrawn for 42 h.
   This blunted response to fenfluramine exhibited only partial recovery
   when examined at 8 days postchronic treatment. Corticosterone responses
   to 8-OH-DPAT and DOI were not affected by cocaine exposure. Our data
   suggest that chronic cocaine produces deficits in presynaptic 5-HT
   function, and alterations in 5-HT neurotransmission may underlie the
   dysphoria experienced by abstinent cocaine users. Neuroendocrine
   challenge tests should be performed in human addicts to evaluate
   potential 5-HT dysfunction associated with cocaine abuse.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of a DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) purified from
   bovine placenta by ginsenosides from Panax Ginseng C. A. Meyer has been
   studied. Preincubation of the enzyme with ginsenosides increased the
   polymerase activity 2.2-fold in a dose-dependent manner. There was a
   reproducible decrease in K-m, in addition to a substantial increase in
   V-max, in response to increasing concentrations of ginsenosides.
   Ginsenosides also activated the proofreading ability of 3'- to
   5'-exonuclease activity associated with DNA pol delta. The coordinated
   activation of both polymerase and exonuclease activities of DNA pol
   delta by ginsenosides is consistent with the view that its polymerase
   and its exonuclease activities residue on the same protein molecule.
   UV/Vis difference spectroscopic studies suggested that the activation of
   DNA pol delta by ginsenosides might be due to the conformational change
   induced by ginsenosides binding.}},

Abstract = {{Pepsin contains a single lysine residue which protrudes from the
   enzyme's surface, behind the active site cleft, on the C-terminal
   domain. Mutations of pepsin by site-directed mutagenesis of the Lys-319
   residue were generated to study the structure-function relationships.
   Kinetic parameters, pH activity profiles, along with conformational
   analysis using circular dichroism (CD), and molecular modelling were
   examined for the wild-type (non-mutant) and mutant enzymes. The pepsin
   mutations, Lys-319 --> Met and Lys-319 --> Glu, resulted in a
   progressive increase in the K-m and similar decrease in k(cat),
   respectively, as well as being denatured at a lower pH than the
   wild-type pepsin. CD analysis indicated that mutations at Lys-319
   resulted in changes in secondary structure fractions which were
   reflected in changes in enzymatic activity as compared to the wild-type
   pepsin, i.e. kinetic data and pH denaturation study. Molecular modelling
   of mutant enzymes indicated differences in flexibility in the flap loop
   region of the active site, the region around the entrance of the active
   site cleft, subsite regions for peptide binding, and in the subdomains
   of the C-terminal domain when compared to the wildtype enzyme. The
   results suggest that Lys-319, which is distal to the active site, is
   important to the flexibility/stability of the enzyme, as well as to its
   catalytic machinery.}},

   (MAP) kinase activation in cultured bovine tracheal myocytes, Kinase
   renaturation assays demonstrated activation of the 42-and 44-kDa MAP

   mimicked by alpha-methyl-5-HT and reduced by pretreatment with either
   phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or forskolin, suggesting activation of the
   5-HT, receptor, protein kinase C, and Raf-1, respectively, Raf-1
   activation was confirmed by measurement of Raf-1 activity, and the
   requirement of Raf-1 for 5-HT-induced MAP binase activation was
   demonstrated by transient transfection of cells with a dominant-negative
   allele of Raf-1, Histamine pretreatment significantly inhibited 5-HT and
   insulin-derived growth factor-1-induced MAP kinase activation,
   Attenuation of MAP kinase activation was reversed by cimetidine,
   mimicked by forskolin, and accompanied by cAMP accumulation and
   inhibition of Raf-1, suggesting activation of the H-2 receptor and
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. However, histamine treatment inhibited
   Raf-1 but not MAP kinase activation following treatment with either
   platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor, implying a
   Raf-1-independent MAP kinase activation pathway, In summary, our data
   suggest a model whereby 5-HT activates MAP kinase via a protein kinase
   C/Raf-1 pathway, and histamine attenuates MAP kinase activation by
   serotonin via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and
   inhibition of Raf-1.}},

Abstract = {{-H-Arg-D-TrpNmePhe-D-TrpLeu-Met- a broad spectrum neuropeptide growth
   factor antagonist (antagonist G), is soon to enter a phase I clinical
   trial for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The
   pre-clinical pharmacology of this peptide has revealed that its
   metabolism proceeds from the C-terminus via deamidation. In this study
   the class of enzyme responsible for the degradation of antagonist G has
   been characterized. Tissue distribution studies on the enzyme have shown
   it to be very widespread with high specific activity being detected in
   the spleen, kidney, H69 SCLC xenograft and liver (12.64, 9.58, 8.00 and
   6.94 nmols G/mg protein/hr, respectively). HPLC gel filtration indicated
   that the G-deamidase enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 81 kDa.
   The sub-cellular distribution of the enzyme using differential
   centrifugation indicates that it is largely soluble with > 85\% of the
   activity located in the cytosolic fraction. The distribution of activity
   towards antagonist G closely resembles that of esterase and acid
   carboxypeptidase activity, two activities, along with deamidase
   activity, known to be possessed by serine carboxypeptidases. Studies
   using a range of protease inhibitors showed clear inhibition of
   metabolism by phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and
   benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanine chloromethylketone, indicating that the
   enzyme is a chymotrypsin-like serine carboxypeptidase. This knowledge of
   the enzyme will be invaluable in the further development of antagonist G
   and similar compounds. Moreover, the widespread distribution of this
   enzyme together with its broad specificity for C-terminal group suggests
   that it should be given serious consideration when designing
   C-terminally modified peptide drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of members of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of
   transcription) family of latent transcription factors is an early event
   following the binding of many cytokines to their cognate receptors,
   Although the patterns of STATs activated by different cytokines are well
   described, the consequences of differential STAT activation are less
   well studied, We show by mutational analysis that STAT binding elements
   (SBEs) exist that discriminate between STAT complexes containing STAT1
   alpha, STAT3 or both, and that these elements show altered cytokine
   responsiveness, We also show that in the context of a minimal promoter,
   single and multiple SBEs exhibit strikingly different patterns of
   transcriptional activation in response to IFN-gamma, IL-6, OSM or LIF.
   These differences in transcriptional activation are correlated with the
   differential ability of these cytokines to activate STAT1 alpha, STAT3
   or both. Our results show that the pattern of STATs activated by a
   cytokine and the arrangement and sequence of the SBEs in the responding
   promoter have a profound effect on the ability of the cytokine to elicit

Abstract = {{The microsporidium Cystosporogenes deliaradicae sp. nov., a parasite of
   the adipose tissue of adult cabbage root flies, Delia radicum in
   Denmark, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural
   characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The
   sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 4-16 (most commonly 6 or 8)
   ovocylindrical spores, measuring 1.2-1.5 x 4.6-5.5 mu m when fixed and
   stained. The spore wall has an approximately 43 nm thick, layered
   exospore with a median layer resembling a double membrane. The
   polaraplast is uniformly lamellar. The isofilar, 114-123 nm thick, polar
   filament is arranged in 11-15 (most commonly 12-13) coils in a single
   layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is approximately 35
   degrees. The last coil touches the posterior pole of the spore. A
   sporophorous vesicle is produced by the sporont. The envelope is
   generated as a duplication of the plasma membrane. Typically the vesicle
   primordia grow from one pole of the sporont to the other. The
   episporontal space initially has granular inclusions. Later septate,
   persistent tubules of exospore material appear. Simultaneously with the

Abstract = {{Expression of the avian apoVLDLII gene is liver specific and completely
   dependent on estrogen, Previous analyses of protein binding sites in the
   apoVLDLII promoter revealed interactions between liver-enriched and
   ubiquitous factors at a location, site F', between nucleotides -229 and
   -260 relative to the major transcriptional start site, Site-directed
   mutagenesis of G residues contacted by these factors decreased
   expression from the promoter similar to 5-fold in the avian hepatoma
   cell line LMH2A. We have used this site to screen a cDNA expression
   library constructed from day 9 embryonic liver RNA, One of the two DNA
   binding factors isolated is a novel homeodomain protein, With the
   exception of the homeodomain itself, which is atypically located close
   to the protein N-terminus, the factor displays little similarity to any
   known DNA binding protein, Its homeodomain is most similar to that of
   the maize protein Knotted-1, while the most closely related vertebrate
   domain is that of the human proto-oncoprotein Pbx1, We demonstrate that
   the DNA binding specificity of the factor is consistent with its
   involvement in the ubiquitous complex formed with site F' and that it is
   capable of suppressing expression from the apoVLDLII promoter in
   short-term transfection experiments, These studies, combined with its
   DNA binding specificity, the tissue distribution of its mRNA and its
   developmental regulation, suggest a role as a negative regulator of gene
   expression in non-hepatic tissues and in the liver early during
   embryogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that
   belongs to the insulin receptor family. LTR is mainly expressed in pre B
   cells and brain, Previously we cloned the full-length cDNA of human LTR,
   but no ligands have so far been identified, and hence, very little is
   known about the physiological role of LTK. To analyze the function of
   the LTK kinase, we constructed chimeric receptors composed of the
   extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor and the
   transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of LTK and established cell
   lines that stably express these chimeric molecules. When cultured in
   medium containing EGF, growth of these cell lines was stimulated, and
   these fusion proteins became autophosphorylated and associated with She
   in uiuo in a ligand-dependent manner, By treatment with EGF, She was
   associated with the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex, Our analyses demonstrate that
   LTK associates with Grb2/Ash through an internal adaptor, Shc, depending
   on a ligand stimulation, The LTK binding site for She was tyrosine 862
   at the carboxyl-terminal domain and to a lesser extent tyrosine 485 at
   the juxtamembrane domain, Both of them are located in NP/AXY motif which
   is consistent with binding sites for She. These findings demonstrate
   that LTR can activate the Ras pathway in a ligand dependent manner and
   that at least one of the functions of this kinase is involved in the
   cell growth.}},

Abstract = {{The central sympathoinhibition caused by moxonidine has been explained
   by activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors on the one hand, and by an
   action at imidazoline I-1 receptors on the other hand. In order to
   examine these possibilities, effects of moxonidine were compared with
   those of 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline(UK 14304), an
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist with very low affinity for I-1 receptors,
   in conscious rabbits. The interaction with yohimbine, an
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist with very low affinity for imidazoline
   I-1 receptors, was also studied. Moxonidine 3-100 mu g kg(-1) and UK
   14304 1-30 mu g kg(-1) i.v. elicited similar effects: they decreased
   arterial blood pressure after a transient increase, decreased renal
   sympathetic nerve activity (recorded with chronically implanted
   electrodes), decreased heart rate and decreased the plasma noradrenaline
   concentration. Yohimbine given i.v, antagonized the effects of
   moxonidine and of UK 14304 in a similar manner. Yohimbine injected into
   the cisterna magna (i.c.) prevented the hypotension but did not change
   the decrease in plasma noradrenaline and heart rate, again in the case
   of both moxonidine and UK 14304. The agreement of the effect patterns of
   moxonidine and UK 14304, and the similar antagonism of yohimbine against
   either drug, demonstrate involvement of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in their
   central sympathoinhibitory action. The resistance of the bradycardia and
   the plasma noradrenaline fall against yohimbine i.c. indicates a
   contribution of presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic inhibition of
   transmitter release from postganglionic sympathetic neurons to the
   overall reduction of sympathetic tone.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the possibility that presynaptic inhibition of transmitter
   release from postganglionic sympathetic neurons contributes to the
   overall reduction of sympathetic tone produced by moxonidine,
   rilmenidine and 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline tartrate
   (UK 14304). In pithed rabbits without electric stimulation, moxonidine,
   rilmenidine and UK 14304 caused a long-lasting, > 10 min, increase in
   arterial pressure. Heart rate was not changed. In pithed rabbits in
   which sympathetic tone was created by electric stimulation through the
   pithing rod (2 Hz), the same doses of moxonidine, rilmenidine and UK
   14304 caused only a brief, < 10 min, blood pressure rise. Heart rate was
   decreased, as were the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and
   adrenaline. Dose-response curves for the effects on the plasma
   noradrenaline concentration (stimulated pithed rabbits) were compared
   with previously obtained dose-response curves for depression of renal
   sympathetic nerve activity (conscious rabbits). For each drug, the curve
   describing peripheral presynaptic inhibition and the curve describing
   central sympathoinhibition were very similar. Both the power and the
   dose dependence of the peripheral inhibitory effect support its
   contribution to the overall decrease in sympathetic tone produced by
   clonidine-like drugs in intact animals. The peripheral effect in all
   likelihood consists in activation of presynaptic alpha(2)-autoreceptors.
   The agreement of the dose-response curves for the peripheral and for the
   central effect supports the view that the central effect, like the
   peripheral one, is mediated through alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrolysis of RNA in imidazole buffer and by spermine-imidazole
   conjugates has been investigated. The RNA models were yeast tRNA(Asp)
   and a transcript derived from the 3'-terminal sequence of tobacco mosaic
   virus RNA representing a minihelix capable of being enzymatically
   aminoacylated with histidine. Imidazole buffer and spermine-imidazole
   conjugates in the presence of free imidazole cleave phosphodiester bonds
   in the folded RNAs in a specific fashion. Imidazole buffer induces
   cleavages preferentially in single-stranded regions because nucleotides
   in these regions have more conformational freedom and can assume more
   easily the geometry needed for formation of the hydrolysis intermediate
   state. Spermine-imidazole constructs supplemented with free imidazole
   cleave tRNA(Asp) within single-stranded regions after pyrimidine
   residues with a marked preference for pyrimidine-A sequences. Hydrolysis
   patterns suggest a cleavage mechanism involving an attack by the
   imidazole residue of the electrostatically bound spermine-imidazole and
   by free imidazole at the most accessible single-stranded regions of the
   RNA. Cleavages in a viral RNA fragment recapitulating a tRNA-like domain
   were found in agreement with the model of this molecule that accounts
   for its functional properties, thus illustrating the potential of the
   imidazole-derived reagents as structural probes for solution mapping of
   RNAs. The cleavage reactions are simple to perform, provide information
   reflecting the state of the ribose-phosphate backbone of RNA and can be
   used for mapping single-and double-stranded regions in RNAs.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular cloning of mouse plasma phospholipid transfer protein
   (PLTP) and the eukaryotic cell expression of complementary DNA for mouse
   and human PLTP are described. Mouse PLTP was found to share 83\% amino
   acid sequence identity with human PLTP. PLTP was produced in baby
   hamster kidney cells. Conditioned medium from BHK cells expressing PLTP
   possessed both phospholipid transfer activity and high density
   lipoprotein (HDL) conversion activity. PLTP mRNA was detected in all 16
   human tissues examined by Northern blot analysis with the ovary, thymus,
   and placenta having the highest levels. PLTP mRNA was also examined in
   eight mouse tissues with the highest PLTP mRNA levels found in the lung,
   brain, and heart. The effect of purified human plasma-derived PLTP and
   human recombinant PLTP (rPLTP) on the two human plasma HDL subspecies
   Lp(A-I) and Lp(A-I/A-II) was evaluated. Plasma PLTP or rPLTP converted
   the two distinct size subspecies of Lp(A-I) into a larger species, an
   intermediate species, and a smaller species. Lp(A-I/A-II) particles
   containing multiple size subspecies were significantly altered by
   incubation with either plasma or rPLTP with the largest but less
   prominent subspecies becoming the predominant one, and the smallest
   subspecies increasing in concentration. Thus, PLTP promoted the
   conversion of both Lp(A-I) and Lp(A-I/A-II) to populations of larger and
   smaller particles. Also, both human PLTP and mouse rPLTP were able to
   convert human or mouse HDL into larger and smaller particles. These
   observations suggest that PLTP may play a key role in extracellular
   phospholipid transport and modulation of HDL particles.}},

Abstract = {{Neointima formation associated with vascular restenosis is a complex
   local inflammatory process actively involving the major cellular
   component of the atherosclerotic lesion, the vascular smooth muscle
   cell. NF-kB is a pleotrophic transactivator of a diverse group of genes
   whose activation has been strongly associated with the cellular response
   to inflammation. We treated human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)
   with phosphorothio antisense oligonucleotides to the p65 subunit of
   NF-kB and report that addition of p65 antisense oligonucleotides (1-20
   mu M), but not sense or p50, inhibit human VSMC adherence and
   proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally,
   administration of p65 antisense significantly inhibited neointima
   formation in balloon angioplasty treated rat carotid arteries,
   indicating that the p65 subunit of NF-kB transactivates genes whose
   expression is important in VSMC pathobiology. These results suggest that
   abrogation of p65 reduces neointima formation by inhibition of smooth
   muscle cell proliferation and adherence. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

   complex predicts the formation of the vibrationally excited CO(v=0,1,2).
   On the other hand, the direct channel model in which the collision

   4-(trimethylammonio)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylperdeuteriopiperidine-N-oxyl

   were measured in water, ethanol, formamide, and N-methylformamide
   solutions. Spin-labeled Nafion membranes saturated by water and aqueous
   solutions of spin-labeled poly(styrene sulfonic acid) as the sodium salt

   the free spin label in the neat solvent. A smaller effect was observed
   for ethanol as solvent and practically no effect in formamide and
   N-methylformamide solutions. The results were rationalized by
   considering the specific influence of each solvent on the solvophobicity
   of the ionomer backbone and on the interaction between ion pairs. We

Abstract = {{EFFICIENT electron transfer of redox proteins to and from their
   environment is essential for the use of such proteins in
   biotechnological applications such as amperometric biosensors and
   photosynthetic biocatalysts(1-3). But most redox enzymes lack pathways
   that can transport an electron from their embedded redox site to an
   electrode(4,5) or a diffusing photoexcited species(6). Electrical
   communication between redox proteins and electrode surfaces has been
   improved by aligning proteins on chemically modified electrodes(7-9), by
   attaching electron-transporting groups(10,11) and by immobilizing
   proteins in polymer matrices tethered by redox groups(12-14). Generally
   these methods involve contacting the enzymes at random with electron
   relay units, Here we report an approach that allows site-specific
   positioning of electron-mediating units in redox proteins, We strip
   glucose oxidase of its flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactors,
   modify tbe latter with redox-active ferrocene-containing groups, and
   then reconstitute the apoprotein with these modified cofactors, In this
   way, electrical contact between an electrode and the resulting enzyme in
   solution is greatly enhanced in a controlled and reproducible way.}},

Abstract = {{Objective.-To determine the prevalence of intensive care unit
   (ICU)-acquired infections and the risk factors for these infections,
   identify the predominant infecting organisms, and evaluate the
   relationship between IOU-acquired infection and mortality.
   Design.-A 1-day point-prevalence study.
   Setting.-Intensive care units in 17 countries in Western Europe,
   excluding coronary care units and pediatric and special care infant
   units.
   Patients.-All patients (>10 years of age) occupying an IOU bed over a
   24-hour period. A total of 1417 ICUs provided 10 038 patient case
   reports.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Rates of ICU-acquired infection, prescription of
   antimicrobials, resistance patterns of microbiological isolates, and
   potential risk factors for IOU-acquired infection and death.
   Results.-A total of 4501 patients (44.8\%) were infected, and 2064
   (20.6\%) had ICU-acquired infection. Pneumonia (46.9\%), lower
   respiratory tract infection (17.8\%), urinary tract infection (17.6\%),
   and bloodstream infection (12\%) were the most frequent types of ICU
   infection reported. Most frequently reported microorganisms were
   Enterobacteriaceae (34.4\%), Staphylococcus aureus (30.1\%; {[}60\%
   resistant to methicillin]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.7\%),
   coagulase-negative staphylococci (19.1\%), and fungi (17.1\%). Seven
   risk factors for ICU-acquired infection were identified: increasing
   length of ICU stay (>48 hours), mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of
   trauma, central venous, pulmonary artery, and urinary catheterization,
   and stress ulcer prophylaxis. ICU-acquired pneumonia (odds ratio {[}OR],
   1.91; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.6 to 2.29), clinical sepsis
   (OR, 3.50; 95\% CI, 1.71 to 7.18), and bloodstream infection (OR, 1.73;
   95\% CI, 1.25 to 2.41) increased the risk of ICU death.
   Conclusions.-ICU-acquired infection is common and often associated with
   microbiological isolates of resistant organisms. The potential effects
   on outcome emphasize the importance of specific measures for infection
   control in critically ill patients.}},

Abstract = {{The transition structures and secondary kinetic isotope effects for
   representative pericyclic reactions, obtained by Hartree-Fock
   (RHF/6-31G{*}) and density functional theory (B-LYP/6-31G{*})
   calculations, are reported. Isotope effects were calculated with the
   Bigeleisen-Mayer equation and the Bell tunnel correction. Both methods
   give similar predictions, but the B-LYP/6-31G{*} results are closer to
   the experimental data, where available. The cyclobutene electrocyclic
   ring opening, the hexatriene and octatetraene electrocyclic ring
   closures, and the reverse reactions show large differences between
   isotope effects for diastereotopic hydrogens directed inward (IN) or
   outward (OUT) on the termini of the transition state. Experimental and
   prior theoretical results are available for the cyclobutene ring opening
   and the hexatriene cyclization. For the Cope and Claisen
   {[}3,3]-sigmatropic shift reactions, the isotope effects of the axial
   (IN) and equatorial (OUT) hydrogens are predicted to be different. For
   the Diels-Alder {[}4 + 2] cycloaddition, there are large differences
   between isotope effects for the IN and OUT hydrogens at the diene
   termini and smaller differences for the endo (IN) and exo (OUT)
   hydrogens of the dienophile. These isotope effect patterns are analyzed
   in terms of steric and electronic interactions in the transition states
   for concerted pericyclic reactions. The more sterically crowded IN
   hydrogens have higher bending force constants than the OUT protons. The
   OUT often have low bending force constants due to diradicaloid character
   of some of the transition states. The difference between IN and OUT
   secondary kinetic isotope effects is a sensitive probe of transition
   state geometry and therefore of mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of angiotensin receptors has recently been identified that
   exhibits both high specificity and affinity for the hexapeptide (3-8)
   fragment of angiotensin II, angiotensin IV (AngIV). Here, utilizing
   radioligand binding, we fully characterize AngIV binding at the AT4
   receptor on cultured bovine coronary venular endothelial cells (CVEC),
   and report that when AngIV and bFGF are presented simultaneously an
   enhancement of DNA synthesis results that is significantly greater than
   that produced by bFGF alone. The level of DNA synthesis was determined
   by the incorporation of {[}H-3]thymidine into quiescent CVEC monolayers
   following exposure to 10 nM AngIV and 10 ng/ml bFGF for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
   or 11 days. A significant enhancement of DNA synthesis (P < 0.01) was
   seen following 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 days exposure. In addition, AngIV does
   not bind to bFGF or heparin, and conversely, bFGF is unable to compete
   for AngIV binding which suggests that this synergistic response is
   mediated by independent receptors for these ligands. Results of this
   study indicate that microvascular endothelial cells are significantly
   more responsive to bFGF in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of
   AngIV.}},

Abstract = {{Electric properties of heteronuclear dimers of the coinage metals are
   calculated at the level of the CCSD(T) approximation applied to 38
   electrons of the valence and next-to-valence atomic shells. The
   relativistic effects are accounted for by using the scalar approximation
   to the Pauli hamiltonian. Both the pure relativistic and mixed
   relativistic-correlation contributions to energies and electric
   properties are computed. All calculations have been carried out by using
   the recently developed first-order polarized basis sets of the coinage
   metal atoms. In the non-relativistic approximation all studied dimers
   show only a moderate degree of polarity; the non-relativistic CuAg turns
   out to be the most polar dimer with the Cu(-)Ag(+) polarity. The
   relativistic effects considerably reduce the negative value of the CuAg
   dipole moment, change the sign of the CuAu dipole moment, and make the
   AgAu molecule the most polar species in the series. Simultaneously, the
   parallel component of the dipole polarizability shows only a small
   relativistic contraction. The calculated quasirelativistic interaction
   potentials have a correct behavior in the vicinity of their minima and
   give the R(e) and omega(e) values in complete agreement with experiment.
   Much less satisfactory are the dissociation energy data which seem to
   suffer from the single reference configuration approximation. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) gene contains a 360-bp region with
   significant homology to the catalytic domain of mammalian
   GTPase-activating protein. This particular GAP-related domain of the NF1
   gene (NF1-GRD) stimulates ras GTPase and inactivates ras protein
   p21(ras). Therefore, it has been suggested that the NF1 gene represents
   another tumor-suppressor gene. In the search for molecular markers of
   possible diagnostic relevance, childhood brain-tu mor specimens of
   different histologic diagnoses were tested for mutations of the
   so-called FLR-exon within the NF1-GRD. This part of the NF1-GRD has been
   shown to be most crucial for the GAP-like function. Using a highly
   sensitive PCR-SSCP technique, we tested 51 tumor specimens were tested,
   but found no mutations. We conclude that inactivation of this putative
   tumor-suppressor gene by mutations does not play a significant role in
   tumorigenesis of childhood brain tumors. Next, we compared the splice
   variants of the NF1-GRD in 33 brain tumors and 8 extraneural embryonal
   tumors. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (n = 10) and one
   intracranial teratoma were the only tumors that predominantly expressed
   a splice pattern that can be observed in the immature developing brain.
   In contrast to other embryonal neuronal tumors, this NF1-GRD splicing
   pattern could not be modified in a newly established medulloblastoma
   cell line by retinoic acid treatment. Since this particular splice
   variant suppresses p21(ras) more effectively than other NF1-GRD
   transcripts, its predominant expression may interfere with the
   physiological signal transduction of p21(ras) during differentiation of
   neurons. There may be a neurofibromin-induced and p21(ras)-mediated
   differentiation pathway of neuronal stem cells that is blocked in PNET.
   Such an arrest of a p21(ras)-dependent differentiation pathway may
   explain the persistence of primitive pluripotent neuronal cells in PNET.

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations of methyl tunneling in
   2,5-dimethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole are reported. The tunneling frequency
   (v(t) = 3.39 MHz) was obtained using low field NMR spectroscopy. By
   means of rapid field cycling irradiation and relaxation measurements the
   probabilities of the absorption transitions, responsible for the
   spectral lines in the low field NMR spectra, can be quantified. The
   results obtained agree well with the calculated probabilities of rf
   induced transitions between the eigenstates of a methyl rotor with v(t)
   = 3.39 MHz. Measurements of the temperature dependence of v(t), the spin
   conversion time tau(con) and an analysis of the proton spin lattice
   relaxation time T-1, the latter two revealing the correlation time
   tau(c), enabled the study of the methyl group dynamics over a
   temperature range encompassing both the quantum mechanical and the
   classical regimes. The dynamical data can be explained well with a
   threefold hindering barrier of height V-3/k(B) = 1175 K and are compared
   with existing theoretical models. (C) 1995 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Our previous single unit and ultrastructural studies of visual cortex of
   dark-reared rats revealed an impairment of intracortical inhibitory
   mechanisms {[}2,3,5]. Neurochemical changes in inhibitory
   neurotransmitter and/or neuropeptides, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA) and somatostatin (SS), respectively, may contribute to the
   observed alterations. The present study was designed to measure GABA and
   SS alterations in the visual cortex of the same dark-reared preparation,
   as possible neurochemical correlates of the changes seen both
   physiologically and anatomically in previous companion studies. In the
   present investigation the mean densities of GABA- and SS-immunoreactive
   neurons in area 17 of dark-reared rats were determined and compared to
   the density of those of rats reared in normal lighting conditions.
   Dark-rearing resulted in a significant decrease in the density of
   GABA-immunoreactive neurons in all cell layers of area 17 of the rat
   visual cortex; not limited to the thalamorecipient layer(s). There was
   also a higher mean density of total cortical cells in dark-reared
   animals. No differences, however, were seen in the density of
   SS-immunoreactive neurons. The alterations of GABA-immunoreactive
   neurons in all cortical layers agree with the altered synaptic
   ultrastructure and physiological responses seen in all cortical layers
   as reported in our previous companion studies. Taken together, these
   studies further support the notion of a deficit in intracortical
   inhibitory mechanisms in the visual cortex of dark-reared adult rats.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate medium-induced interactions acting on a tagged chain
   immersed in its melt are studied for AB copolymers using liquid-state
   polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory. The
   contributions from both density and concentration fluctuations are
   examined. In analogy to the homopolymer case, we identify the alloy
   density-fluctuation-mediated term as a local, or `intrinsic',
   contribution which survives in the long-chain limit. On the other hand,
   the concentration-fluctuation-like term is finite size in nature, and is
   viewed as the liquid-state theory analogue to the `screened' potentials
   employed in previous field theoretic studies. Here, the screened form
   can be written in terms of fluctuation renormalized collective structure
   factors and corresponding effective chi-parameters, which replace the
   phenomenological Flory chi-parameter in the mean field treatment. The
   conformational properties of idealized structurally and
   interaction-symmetric diblock copolymers under the screened conditions
   are then investigated. As the diblock melt is cooled, the mean squared
   end-to-end distance is predicted to grow, while the individual blocks
   may either shrink or expand depending on composition. The roughly
   sigmoidal shape of the end-to-end distance versus inverse temperature is
   in good agreement with recent lattice Monte Carlo simulations. The
   degree to which the overall chain dimensions deviate from the
   unperturbed value is predicted to be <10\% over the relevant temperature
   range, also in accord with simulation results. The predicted saturation
   of conformational changes at low temperatures is a direct consequence of
   the fluctuation-corrected liquid-state theory solvation potential, and
   physically arises from the emergence of a `ground-state' fluid structure
   on the microdomain length. We also discuss issues relating to the
   screening of the intrachain excluded volume, and the consequences of
   non-universal coupled density and concentration fluctuations on the
   solvent-induced potential, for more general models of structurally
   asymmetric block copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many searches for magnetic monopoles in flight, but few
   for monopoles in matter. We have searched for magnetic monopoles in
   meteorites, schists, ferromanganese nodules, iron ores, and other
   materials. The detector was a superconducting induction coil connected
   to a superconducting quantum interference device with a room temperature
   bore 15 cm in diameter. We tested a total of more than 331 kg of
   material including 112 kg of meteorites. We found no monopole and
   conclude the overall monopole/nucleon ratio in the samples is <1.2 x
   10(-29) with a 90\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{The F3 cell surface glycoprotein consists of six immunoglobulin-like
   domains, four fibronectin type III repeats and a
   glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and is found in membrane-bound and
   soluble form. Until now, it has been localized mainly on axons of
   subsets of developing and postnatal neurons and has been implicated in
   axonal growth and synaptogenesis. We here examined its expression in the
   adult rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system composed of magnocellular
   neurons whose axons can undergo remodelling in adulthood in response to
   lesion or physiological stimulation. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated
   high levels of F3 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic nuclei containing
   the somata of the neurons, in the median eminence, through which pass
   their axons and in the neurohypophysis, where they terminate. The amount
   of F3 detected in the latter was 2-fold that in the hypothalamus. In
   addition, soluble forms predominated in the neurohypophysis and
   GPI-linked forms in the hypothalamus. Immunocytochemistry revealed a
   strong F3 immunoreactivity throughout the neurohypophysis and internal
   layer of the median eminence, characterized by a punctate labeling of
   fibers and dense filling of dilatations. In the hypothalamic nuclei,
   staining of variable intensity was visible in the cytoplasm of some
   magnocellular somata. In contrast, in colchicine-treated rats, all
   magnocellular somata throughout the hypothalamus displayed intense
   labeling while staining in the neurohypophysis was greatly reduced. Our
   observations reveal that neurons of the adult
   hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system express high level of F3, even under
   normal conditions. In view of its distribution and the differing
   proportions of membrane-bound and soluble forms, we propose that, after
   synthesis in the hypothalamus, F3 is targeted to the neurohypophysis
   where it accumulates in neurosecretory terminals or is released into the
   extracellular space. It remains to be seen whether its expression is
   linked to the secretion of the neurohypophysial peptides and in
   particular, to the ability of these neurons to undergo structural
   remodelling in adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{We have found that the gene expression of the ninth member of the
   fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, FGF9 was induced during retinoic
   acid(RA)-induced neuronal differentiation of murine embryonal carcinoma
   P19 cells. We have reported here the nucleotide sequence of the mouse
   FGF9 cDNA. The murine cDNA showed 92.4\% nucleotide sequence homology to
   the human FGF9 cDNA and 98.2\% homology to that of rats. This mouse FGF9
   cDNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 208 amino acids with amino acid
   sequence identical to that of rats. Only one amino acid was replaced
   compared to the human homolog. The highly conserved sequence homology of
   FGF9 suggests its functional importance. FGF9 was originally isolated
   from a culture medium of a human glioma cell line as a growth-promoting
   factor for glial cells {[}5]. Upon induction of neuronal differentiation
   by forming cell aggregates with 10(-6) M RA, the gene expression of FGF9
   was increased biphasically during the first 96 hours when cells were
   aggregating and from 168 hours to 192 hours followed by plating onto a
   tissue culture dish as glia-like cells proliferated. Neither
   undifferentiated P19 cells nor the cells aggregated without RA remaining
   undifferentiated expressed FGF9. This indicates that RA regulates the
   gene expression of FGF9 that may play an important role in neuronal
   differentiation in both early and late developmental process.}},

   template layers deposited at 630 degrees C among the deposition

   0.5, 0.045, and 0.053 for the films on PBCO templates deposited at 620,

Abstract = {{Immunostaining for three neuronal proteins, nonphosphorylated
   neurofilament protein (with antibody SMI-32), calbindin, and
   parvalbumin, was used to examine the organization of layer IV in human
   primary visual cortex (area 17 or V1) specifically to determine whether,
   similar to the case in macaque V1, layer IVA is present and is divided
   into neurochemically distinct compartments. All three proteins are
   expressed by neurons that are unevenly distributed in layer IV of human
   V1; immunostaining for each protein includes a thin band corresponding
   to layer IVA of classic cytoarchitectonic studies. In this band,
   nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein immunoreactivity is present in
   relatively broad clusters of pyramidal cell somata and dendrites that
   appear as upwardly protruding parts of intense immunostaining in layer
   IVB, whereas immunoreactivity for calbindin and parvalbumin exists in
   somata of nonpyramidal neurons and in thin, dense clusters of punctate
   profiles. In tangential sections through layer IVA, the three proteins
   are seen in distinct compartments. Calbindin- and
   parvalbumin-immunostained neurons make up a thinly walled honeycomb or
   lattice, whereas neurons immunostained for nonphosphorylated
   neurofilament protein occupy the central lacunae. Direct comparison
   shows that neurons immunostained for calbindin occupy regions in layer
   IVA complementary to those immunostained for nonphosphorylated
   neurofilament protein. These data demonstrate a basic similarity in the
   organization of layer IV in macaques and humans. Layer IVA specifically
   is organized into complementary and neurochemically distinct
   compartments, including what appears to be a geniculocortically
   innervated and parvicellular-driven lattice and the interstitial lacunae
   formed by the periodic, upward protrusion of magnocellular-dominated
   layer IVB neurons. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter
   and High Resolution Imager observations of two distant clusters of
   galaxies, MS 0735+74 and MS 0451-03, selected from the Einstein Extended
   Medium-Sensitivity Survey (EMSS). The duster MS 0735+74 at z = 0.216 is
   a cooling flow candidate because the central brightest galaxy has
   extended H alpha emission. We present optical spectra and a radio map
   for this duster's brightest cluster galaxy. MS 0451-03, at a newly
   determined redshift of z = 0.55, is the most luminous cluster in the
   EMSS with L(x)(0.5-3.5 keV)= 2.0 x 10(45) ergs s(-1) h(50)(-2). We
   derive significant limits on gas temperatures in these clusters and
   measure their core radii, `'beta(image),'' and mass cooling rates. We
   estimate gas masses and total gravitational masses for each cluster. We
   quantify structure by fitting isophotal ellipses and by decomposing the
   images with a wavelet analysis. The clusters are elliptical, but we
   measure no other significant substructure. In the duster MS 0735+74 we
   compare the structure and flux from the central optical emission-line
   nebulosity to the duster's X-ray and radio emission from the same
   region. We discuss the significance of the measured X-ray properties in
   the context of cluster evolution and cooling flows. Our results show
   that `'cooling flows'' can be identified by their extended H alpha
   emission and that distant clusters probably do not have more intrinsic
   absorption than nearby clusters. We suggest that these distant clusters
   have X-ray morphologies similar to those of rich nearby clusters and
   that MS 0451-03, a luminous cluster at high redshift, may have somewhat
   lower M(gas)/M(total) ratios (less than or similar to 17\% at 1
   h(50)(-1) Mpc scales) than low-redshift clusters of comparable
   luminosity.}},

   velocities were made under polar mesopause summer echo (PMSE) conditions
   enabling spatial and temporal resolution of 300 m and 2 s and accuracies
   of 0.1 ms(-1) or better. Our observations revealed vertical motions with
   periods ranging from hours to tens of seconds and vertical wave
   structure exhibiting both ducted and vertically propagating behavior.
   Significant correlations were found between the low-pass vertical
   velocity and velocity uncertainties, velocity variances at high
   frequencies, radar backscatter power, and radar spectral widths.
   Specifically, upward motions at lower frequencies correlated with larger
   uncertainties, high-frequency variances, and radar spectral widths,
   while downward motions correlated best with larger backscatter power. We
   show these correlations to lead to biases in the determination of mean
   vertical motions when data are thresholded by any of the above
   quantities. We also suggest that these correlations arise from a
   tendency for turbulence to be associated primarily with the upward phase
   of wave motions at lower frequencies. A companion paper by Fritts and
   Hoppe presents a spectral analysis of this same data set.}},

   SiO2 and NaOH-Na2CO3 with the molar ratios of SiO2/(NaOH + Na2CO3) = 5
   and H2O/(NaOH + Na2CO3)= 100, magadiite was formed after 24 hours of

   magadiite or quartz simultaneously in 48-96 hours of reaction at 160 or
   170 degrees C. In the molar ratios of SiO2(NaOH + Na2CO3) = 5-10,

   cm(-1) resolution infrared solar spectra recorded with the McMath
   Fourier transform spectrometer at the National Solar Observatory on Kitt
   Peak. The analysis is based on a multilayer line-by-line forward model
   and a semiempirical version of the optimal estimation inversion method
   by Rodgers. The 1002.6-1003.2 cm(-1) spectral interval has been selected
   for the analysis on the basis of synthetic spectrum calculations. The
   characterization and error analysis of the method have been performed.
   It was shown that for the Kitt Peak spectral resolution and typical
   signal-to-noise ratio (greater than or equal to 100) the retrieval is
   stable, with the vertical resolution of approximate to 5 km attainable
   near the surface degrading to approximate to 10 km in the stratosphere.
   Spectra recorded from 1980 through 1993 have been analyzed. The
   retrieved total ozone and vertical profiles have been compared with
   total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) satellite total columns for the
   location and dates of the Kitt Peak measurements and about 100 ozone
   ozonesoundings and Brewer total column measurements from Palestine,

Abstract = {{We have previously shown in intact human erythrocytes that both the
   plasma membrane Ca2+ pump activity and its phosphorylation can be
   increased by phorbol-la-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known stimulator
   of protein kinase C. These effects were inhibited by high doses of
   adriamycin (L. C. Wright et al., 1993, Arch, Biochem, Biophys, 306,
   277-284). We now show that low doses of adriamycin (ADR) (maximum effect
   at 10 mu M for 1-6 min) decrease the amplitude of the intracellular
   calcium ({[}Ca2+](i)) transient induced by 2.5 mu M CaCl2 and 10 mu M
   A23187 in intact human erythrocytes, This is reflected by a parallel
   increase in Ca2+-ATPase activity in plasma membranes isolated from
   pretreated intact cells, When 10 mu M ADR and 1 mu M PMA were combined
   the effects were additive, with a maximum decrease in the Ca2+ transient
   amplitude of 50\%. A similar effect was seen on the Ca2+-ATPase
   activities in isolated membranes, In erythrocytes labeled with
   {[}P-32]orthophosphate 10 mu M ADR induced a 1.5-fold increase in the
   phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump and when combined with 1 mu M PMA the
   phosphorylation was greatly enhanced (2.3 times that induced by PMA
   alone), ADR alone and in combination with PMA was found to decrease both
   P-32 labeling and lipid phosphate content of phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This was accompanied by an increase in the
   amount of 1,2-diacylglycerol formed in response to 10 mu M ADR, We
   conclude that low doses of ADR are able to stimulate the breakdown of
   6-13\% of erythrocyte PIP2 by phospholipase C at an intracellular
   calcium concentration of 2.5 mu M, normally regarded as below threshold
   for phospholipase C activation in erythrocytes, The diacylglycerol
   formed appears to stimulate protein kinase C to activate the Ca-2+ pump
   and enhance its phosphorylation and Ca2+ efflux in intact human
   erythrocytes. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Lysyl hydroxylase (LH) catalyzes the formation of hydroxylysine required
   for the intermolecular crosslinking of collagen, which is an essential
   step in collagen biosynthesis. Dermal fibroblasts from patients with
   Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type VI (EDS VI), an inherited connective tissue
   disorder, express decreased levels of LH activity, In the present study
   we have shown that both the mRNA and the enzyme activity of LH in skin
   fibroblasts from one EDS VI patient (AT750), a compound heterozygote for
   the LH gene, are increased by administration of ascorbate and
   hydralazine, either individually or in combination. Although the AT750
   cells express only 24\% of the LH activity found in normal cells, a
   similar fold increase in activities in both EDS VI and normal cells was
   observed following treatment with ascorbate (1.5- to 2-fold) and
   hydralazine (2- to 4-fold), which paralleled the increase in their
   steady state LH mRNAs, Ascorbate increased total collagen production by
   a-fold from a similar basal level of collagen synthesis in each cell
   type. This was confirmed by protein gel analysis which showed increases
   in pro alpha 1(I), pro alpha 2(I), and pro alpha 1(III) collagen chains
   in both normal and EDS VI cells. This ascorbate-mediated increase of
   alpha 1(I) collagen resulted from increased mRNAs for alpha 1(I)
   collagen in both cell types. Hydralazine treatment, with or without
   ascorbate, severely decreased the alpha 1(I) collagen mRNAs in
   fibroblasts from both AT750 and the normal donor; total collagen
   synthesis was similarly reduced, This study shows that LH activity,
   which is severely deficient in fibroblasts from an EDS VI patient, can
   be upregulated by administration of ascorbate and hydralazine as a
   result of the increased mRNA for LH, suggesting that the mechanism for
   the regulation of the LH gene is functioning normally in this patient.

Abstract = {{Objective-To examine whether the reduction in mortality after standard
   titre measles immunisation in developing countries can be explained
   simply by the prevention of acute measles and its long term
   consequences.
   Design-An analysis of all studies comparing mortality of unimmunised
   children and children immunised with standard titre measles vaccine in
   developing countries.
   Studies-10 cohort and two case-control studies from Bangladesh, Benin,
   Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Senegal, and Zaire.
   Main outcome measures-Protective efficacy of standard titre measles
   immunisation against all cause mortality. Extent to which difference in
   mortality between immunised and unimmunised children could be explained
   by prevention of measles disease.
   Results-Protective efficacy against death after measles immunisation
   ranged from 30\% to 86\%. Efficacy was highest in the studies with short
   follow up and when children were immunised in infancy (range 44-100\%).
   Vaccine efficacy against death was much greater than the proportion of
   deaths attributed to acute measles disease. In four studies from
   Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Burundi vaccine efficacy against death
   remained almost unchanged when cases of measles were excluded from the
   analysis. Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and polio vaccinations were not
   associated with reduction in mortality.
   Conclusion-These observations suggest that standard titre measles
   vaccine may confer a beneficial effect which is unrelated to the
   specific protection against measles disease.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of the propagation of errors (random and systematic) for
   isotope dilution analysis (IDA) has been applied to the analysis of
   fission products and actinide elements by inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Systematic errors in ID-ICP-MS
   arising from mass-discrimination (mass bias), detector non-linearity and
   isobaric interferences in the measured isotopes have to be corrected for
   in order to achieve accurate results. The mass bias factor and the
   detector dead-time can be determined by using natural elements with
   well-defined isotope abundances. A combined method for the simultaneous
   determination of both factors is proposed. On the other hand, isobaric
   interferences for some fission products and actinides cannot be
   eliminated using mathematical corrections (due to the unknown isotope
   abundances in the sample) and a chemical separation is necessary. The
   theory for random error propagation in IDA has been applied to the
   determination of non-natural elements by ICP-MS taking into account all
   possible sources of uncertainty with pulse counting detection. For the
   analysis of fission products, the selection of the right spike isotope
   composition and spike to sample ratio can be performed by applying
   conventional random propagation theory. However, it has been observed
   that, in the experimental determination of the isotope abundances of the
   fission product elements to be determined, the correction for
   mass-discrimination and the correction for detector dead-time losses
   contribute to the total random uncertainty. For the instrument used in
   the experimental part of this study, it was found that the random
   uncertainty on the measured isotope ratios followed Poisson statistics
   for low counting rates whereas, for high counting rates, source
   instability was the main source of error.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse
   transcriptase mutants of helix H in the thumb subdomain suggested by
   x-ray crystallography to interact with the primer strand of the
   template-primer. These enzymes, G262A and W266A, were previously shown
   to have greatly elevated dissociation rate constants for template-primer
   and to be much less sensitive to inhibition by 3'-azidodeoxythymidine
   5'-triphosphate. Here we describe their processivity and error
   specificity. The results reveal that: (i) both enzymes have reduced
   processivity and lower fidelity for template-primer slippage errors,
   (ii) they differ from each other in sequence dependent termination of
   processive synthesis and in error specificity, and (iii) the magnitude
   of the mutator effect relative to wild-type enzyme for deletions in
   homopolymeric sequences decreases as the length of the run increases.
   Thus amino acid substitutions in a subdomain thought to interact with
   the duplex template-primer confer a strand slippage mutator phenotype to
   a replicative DNA polymerase. This suggests that interactions between
   specific amino acids and the primer stem at positions well removed from
   the active site are critical determinants of processivity and fidelity.
   These effects, obtained in aqueous solution during catalytic cycling,
   are consistent with and support the existing crystallographic structural
   model.}},

   involves formation of the trimethyisilyl esters of alkylmethylphosphonic
   acids using 1\% trimethylchlorosilane in
   bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide as a derivatizing agent. Eight
   phosphorus-containing acids were extracted from spiked water, wipes, and

   used to quantitate the derivatives in order to determine the extraction
   and derivatization efficiencies for environmental sample preparation.
   Because elemental response factors for the AED are independent of the

   standard, for which dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) is used. The
   derivatization efficiencies ranged from 80\% to 110\% (six trials, with
   R.S.D. in the range 2-7\%). The extraction efficiencies ranged from 13\%

Abstract = {{The activation of a latent DNA binding factor by interleukin-4 (IL-4),
   the IL-4 nuclear activated factor (IL-4 NAF), occurs within minutes of
   IL-4 binding to its receptor. Molecular characterization of IL-4 NAF by
   ultraviolet light cross-linking experiments revealed a single protein of
   120-130 kDa in contact with the DNA target site. Glycerol gradient
   sedimentation analysis indicated a molecular mass of IL-4 NAF consistent
   with a monomer that is capable of binding DNA. The IL-4 NAF target site
   is a palindromic sequence that is also recognized by the
   interferon-induced transcription factor, p91/STAT1 alpha. However, IL-4
   NAF and p91/STAT1 alpha display distinguishable DNA binding
   specificities that may generate one level of specificity in the
   expression of target genes. Previous studies suggested the involvement
   of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in the IL-4 signal
   transduction pathway. Although IRS-1 is involved in the stimulation of
   mitogenesis, our results demonstrate that activation of IL-4 NAF is
   independent of IRS-signaling proteins. The results of this study
   indicate that IL-4 stimulates bifurcating signal pathways that can
   direct mitogenesis via the IRS-signaling proteins and specific gene
   expression via the IL-4 NAF.}},

Abstract = {{Giant liposomes were made from a mixture of asolectin phospholipid
   vesicles and presynaptic plasma membranes isolated from Torpedo
   cholinergic nerve endings, Acetylcholine filled giant liposomes were
   able to release neurotransmitter upon stimulation by the Ca2(+)
   ionophore A23187 and Ca2(+). Botulinum neurotoxin type A inhibited this
   Ca2(+)-dependent acetylcholine transport. Additionally, Botulinum toxin
   type A decreased membrane fluidity of liposomes. These results suggest
   that Botulinum toxin can interact directly with components of the
   presynaptic plasma membrane and inhibit acetylcholine translocation.
   Furthermore, since the reconstituted liposomes do not have synaptic
   vesicle components, the observed effects may account for the action of
   Botulinum toxin on the nonquantal release of acetylcholine from motor
   nerve terminals.}},

Abstract = {{Purified glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface
   proteins can be reincorporated spontaneously into the cell membrane by
   incubating the cells with these proteins. This unique property provides
   a novel way of introducing cell surface receptors on live cell membranes
   without the use of gene transfection. Since any classical transmembrane
   cell surface protein can be converted to a GPI anchored protein by
   recombinant techniques, this method provides a means of studying
   ectodomain associated receptor functions on various cell types.
   Moreover, in some circumstances, it can be used to correct deficient
   cellular functions resulting from lack of cell surface protein
   expression. Using GPI-anchored Fc gamma receptor III (CD16B), a low
   affinity Fc gamma receptor, we have systematically studied the optimal
   conditions for reconstitution of a functional receptor on nucleated
   cells. CD16B is purified to homogeneity from neutrophil lysates by
   single step immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified CD16B is
   functionally active as evidenced by its ability to bind IgG opsonized
   erythrocytes. CD16B incorporation on nucleated cells is temperature
   dependent with an optimum of 37 degrees C. The level of expression of
   incorporated CD16B is also depend on the concentration of CD16B
   available and the duration of incubation. The incorporated CD16B retains
   its ability to bind ligand and also mediates endocytosis of the bound
   ligand. In summary, our results demonstrate that purified, functionally
   active GPI-anchored receptors can be expressed on desired cells in a
   controlled manner and retain some functional properties.}},

Abstract = {{Pb2+ is reported to cause cognitive dysfunctions in children and to
   inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP), a model form of synaptic
   plasticity that involves nitric oxide (NO). Since Pb2+ interacts with
   Ca2+-calmodulin, and brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is
   Ca2+-calmodulin regulated, we examined the effects of Pb2+ on NOS
   activity prepared from rat cerebellum. NOS required NADPH and was
   inhibited by monomethylarginine. Full NOS activity required 0.6 mu M
   free Ca2+ and was inhibited 50\% by 17 nM and 100\% by 80 nM free Pb2+.
   NOS inhibition by Pb2+ was reversible by increasing free Ca2+
   concentrations. Evaluation of other divalent cations resulted in the
   following ranked order of potencies: CU2+ > Pb2+ >> Zn2+; Fe2+, Ba2+,
   Mg2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+ were ineffective. These results suggest that Pb2+
   inhibition of brain NOS activity may account for some of the effects of

   significantly greater in the older subjects than in the younger ones.
   This may reflect the up-regulated hsc 70 mRNA induction in response to a

Abstract = {{Growth suppression by the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor proteins is
   mediated through effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins at the G1/S

   which regulate G1. We used fibroblasts containing disruptions of the Rb
   or p53 genes to genetically test the role of these proteins in c-Abl
   growth suppression. We find that c-Abl requires p53 but not Rb to
   suppress growth, c-Abl binds p53 in vitro and enhances p53 dependent
   transcription from a promoter containing p53 DNA binding sites. An Abl
   mutant which no longer binds p53 does not enhance p53 transcriptional
   activity and fails to suppress growth. These findings provide a novel

   stiffness matrix of the system. Numerical examples are studied and the

Abstract = {{Cultured chondrocytes respond to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) by
   increasing the production of proteoglycans and insulin-like growth
   factor binding proteins (IGF-BPs). To investigate the biological effects
   of IGFs and IGF-BPs, isolated bovine articular and ovine growth-plate
   chondrocytes were cultured at high density in the presence of IGF-I, and
   its truncated form, des (1-3) IGF-I. Both growth factors stimulated the
   production of IGF-BPs in articular and growth-plate chondrocyte
   monolayers. Western ligand blots showed that bovine articular
   chondrocytes released two forms of IGF-BPs into conditioned medium with
   molecular weights of 29 and 31 kDa. Ovine growth-plate chondrocytes
   released four different forms of IGF-BPs of approx. 22, 24; 29-30 and 34
   kDa. IGF-I and des (1-3) IGF-I stimulated total proteoglycan synthesis
   by articular chondrocytes up to 1.5-fold. The truncated analogue was
   more potent at lower concentrations, particularly in stimulating
   incorporation of newly synthesized proteoglycans into the cell-layer.
   The maximal stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis in ovine growth-plate
   chondrocyte culture was 3-fold with des (1-3) IGF-I, while IGF-I
   enhanced proteoglycan production by only 2-fold over the concentrations
   used, Our results suggest that endogenous IGF-BPs in chondrocyte
   cultures act as a part of a feed-back mechanism which diminishes the
   bioactivity of IGF-I.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of a NiMo/alumina hydrotreating
   catalyst aged with Kuwait resid showed the presence of two distinct
   types of coke. A low-temperature coke (type I), showing a CO2 peak
   around 460 degrees C, is attributed to a `normal' coke, which is found
   on catalysts aged with lighter feeds. A high-temperature coke (type II),
   showing a CO2 peak around 620 degrees C, is associated with vanadium
   deposits and appears to be consistent with the presence of asphaltenes.
   The presence of COS in the TPO profiles is taken as evidence of sulfur
   in the coke. In addition, a low-temperature COS peak is observed, which
   is ascribed to adsorbed CHx species in the inorganic sulfide phase. The
   coke effectively covers the inorganic sulfide phase. Hence, appreciable
   loss of catalytic activity could be due to coverage of active sites by
   coke, aside from any specific poisoning effects of metal deposits.}},

Abstract = {{In the family of small blue-copper proteins azurins are unique in that
   they contain a disulfide bridge close to the amino-terminal end. It is
   situated in the `south' side of the molecule, about 25 Angstrom away
   from the copper. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to exchange one or
   both of the cysteines in the bridge for serines in Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa azurin. In the double mutant Cys3Ser-Cys26Ser the Type 1 Cu
   is converted into Type 2, and the fluorescence of the single internal
   tryptophan shows that it becomes exposed to a polar environment. The
   circular dichroism spectrum indicates a loss of p-structure. Thus, this
   mutation prevents the correct folding of the protein and the formation
   of the metal-binding site. Single mutants, Cys3Ser or Cys26Ser, can at
   least in part form native-like structures as shown by optical, EPR,
   fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The Cys3Ser mutant can form a stable

Abstract = {{The frequency dispersions of the water O-17 and H-2 nuclear magnetic
   relaxation rates have been measured in solutions of the calcium-binding
   protein calbindin D-9k in the apo and calcium-loaded states. The
   relaxation data show that the residence times of the two water molecules
   that ligate calcium ions in the crystal structure are in the range 5 ns
   to 7 mu s, much longer than for calcium-coordinated water in bulk
   solution. In addition to a twist libration of substantial amplitude, the
   calcium-coordinated water molecules in calbindin undergo a fast (<1 ns)
   flip motion, resulting in a drastic reduction of the H-2 dispersion
   amplitude. The residence time as well as the internal motions of these
   water molecules are largely governed by strong hydrogen bonds to side
   chains that may be essential for the cooperativity of calcium binding.
   In addition to the calcium-coordinated waters, calbindin contains (at
   least) one long-lived (>5 ns) water molecule, which we tentatively
   identify as a structure-stabilizing water molecule buried in a surface
   pocket near the linker loop. Even at pD 6.7, the H-2 relaxation
   dispersion is dominated by rapidly exchanging carboxyl deuterons in
   highly ordered side chains. The present study provides the first direct
   observation by means of NMR of water molecules coordinated to a
   diamagnetic metal ion in a protein solution.}},

   excitation are compared with results of corresponding calculations. In
   the theoretical treatment the features of the low-loss region are
   interpreted as superpositions of plasmon and interband excitations. On
   the basis of the energy eigenvalues E(m) and the occupation densities of
   the occupied valence states attained by MNDO (modified neglect of
   diatomic overlap) calculations the scattering function Im
   \{-1/epsilon(E)\} in the low-loss region is simulated. The low-loss
   features attained both experimentally and theoretically agree quite
   well. The fine structure of the Sit,, ionization edge is interpreted
   using densities of unoccupied states obtained by MNDO calculations, too.
   The density of states calculated depends on the chemical bonding as
   experimentally proved. The calculations enable predictions concerning
   the electronic structure of the silicon compounds under investigation,

Abstract = {{Objective.-To investigate variability in practices for determining brain
   death and organ procurement results in pediatric intensive care units

   Design.-Prospective cohort study.
   Setting.-Pediatric ICUs.
   Patients.-Children undergoing brain death evaluations selected from 5415
   consecutive PICU admissions.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Data from children undergoing brain death
   evaluations including number of coma examinations, number and duration
   of apnea tests, Pco(2) measurements at the end of the apnea test,
   ancillary tests used to confirm brain death, organ procurement, and
   reasons for nonprocurement.
   Results.-A total of 93 (37\%) of 248 deaths were brain deaths. Compared
   with the other deaths, children who were classified as brain dead were
   sicker on admission (mean Pediatric Risk of Mortality {[}PRISM]
   score+/-SD: 31+/-11 vs 23+/-12, P<,001; pre-ICU cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation, 72\% vs 40\%, P<.001), and had more traumatic injuries
   (42\% vs 12\%, P<.001). Variability in apnea testing included lack of
   apnea testing in 23 patients (25\%) and controversial apnea testing
   practices in 20 patients (22\%). Three patients (3\%) had brain death
   evaluations within hours of discontinuing barbiturate infusions, and
   four of 30 patients younger than 1 year did not have a confirmatory
   test, Solid organ procurement was successful in 32\%, Reasons for
   nonprocurement included parental refusal (12\%), disease state (12\%),
   and medical examiner's case (22\%).
   Conclusions.-Substantial variability exists in the criteria used by
   clinicians for the diagnosis of brain death. Some practices are
   contradictory to the Guidelines for the Determination of Brain Death in
   Children and to recommendations for apnea testing. Organ procurement
   could be improved by increased medical examiner cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Ferric leghemoglobin in the presence of H2O2 is known to give rise to
   protein radicals, at least one of which is centred on a tyrosine
   residue, These radicals are quenched by at least two processes. The
   first one involves an intramolecular heme-protein cross-link probably
   involving the tyrosine radical; this leads to the formation of a green
   compound with spectral characteristics differing markedly from those of
   ferryl and ferric leghemoglobin. This green compound cannot be reduced
   by dithionite or ascorbate, precluding any role for this species as an
   oxygen carrier, It exhibits modified EPR and pyridine haemochromogen
   spectra, indicating that alterations occur at the porphyrin macrocycle
   level, The additional compound previously described {[}Puppo, A., Monny,
   C. and Davies, M.J. (1993) Biochem. J. 289, 435-438] appears to be a
   mixture of ferryl Lb and this green compound. The second quenching route
   results in the formation of intermolecular cross-links and hence dimeric
   forms of the protein. Ascorbate and glutathione inhibit both this
   intermolecular dimer formation and the formation of the intramolecular
   haem-protein cross-links and are likely to play a protective role in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatoma model, the effect of fish
   oil, a rich source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
   acid (DHA), and ground nut oil, a rich source of oleic acid (OA) and
   linoleic acid (LA), was studied. Both 20\% fish oil and ground nut oil
   inhibited DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Contrary to general
   belief, an inverse correlation was observed between the development of
   neoplastic nodules and the amount of lipid peroxides formed in the high
   fat (20\% fish oil and ground nut oil) diet groups, indicating that the
   higher the lipid peroxides formed, the lower the incidence of liver
   tumours in DEN-treated animals. Results of the analysis of liver fatty
   acid composition of the phospholipid fraction suggested that DEN and
   fish oil treatment can inhibit the activity of the delta-6- and
   5-desaturases. It is concluded from the results of the present study
   that a `high fat' diet and lipid peroxidation can modulate DEN-induced
   hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Comparing the behavior of freely suspended and immobilized enzyme in
   organic media with low water contents can yield insights into
   interactions among the biocatalyst, solvent, and support that influence
   protein structure and function. Immobilized chymotrypsin has higher
   activity than the suspended enzyme (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) in
   anhydrous organic solvents ranging from nonpolar n-octane to polar
   acetonitrile. In anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), glass-adsorbed
   chymotrypsin is ca. 10 times more active than the suspended enzyme, and
   election spin resonance (ESR) spectra of an active-site spin-label
   reveal greater local flexibility. Upon adding up to 0.5\% v/v water,
   increased catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme is accompanied
   by a sharp rise in active-site polarity but no apparent change in
   active-site conformation or dynamics. Under the same conditions the
   activity of the suspended enzyme also increases; however, the
   active-site polarity remains nearly constant while the spin-label
   reflects increasing molecular flexibility. For both preparations,
   further changes in protein structure occur as enzyme activity increases
   with 0.5-7\% v/v added water. Computer simulations of the
   room-temperature ESR spectra suggest that different initial
   conformational states contribute to the different behavior of the two
   enzyme systems over the entire range of added water. These findings show
   that the structural properties of suspended and immobilized enzyme can
   differ markedly and that these differences are important to enzyme
   activity in organic media.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the mechanism of silicon crystal growth mediated by a
   surface photochemical reaction. The growth process consists of reactive
   sticking of disilane (Si2H6) onto a partially hydrogen covered surface
   followed by the photon-stimulated desorption of hydrogen atoms and
   consequent regeneration of dangling bonds. The saturation coverage of Si
   admolecules resulting from self-limiting chemisorption of disilane was
   found to be 0.42 monolayer (ML), and the ejection of H+ and H-2(+) ions
   was observed by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Hydrogen removal by
   the purely electronic process differs from thermal desorption, however,
   in that not all of the hydrogen is removed. Analysis of film growth by
   repetition of the cycle of disilane exposure, evacuation, and
   synchrotron radiation irradiation showed that the onset temperature of
   thermal growth (350 degrees C) is the same as that of H-2 desorption
   from the dihydride species. Below 350 degrees C a digital growth of 0.18
   ML/cycle occurs over a wide range of gas exposure times, irradiation
   times, substrate temperatures, and the irradiation intensities. If the
   temperature is raised to facilitate thermal desorption of hydrogen atoms
   and migration of Si adatoms, the number of Si adatoms delivered in each
   cycle increases significantly. Photolytic, thermal, and photothermal
   effects result in growth rates of 0.4 ML/cycle at 430 degrees C and 1
   ML/cycle 480 degrees C. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial superantigens (SAS), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)
   and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), are powerful T-cell stimulators,
   triggering systemic release of lymphokines causing lethal shock in
   D-galactosamine (D-Gal)-sensitized mice. We show that pretreatment with
   recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF)
   protects mice against T-cell-mediated SAg-shock. In mice challenged with
   D-Gal/TSST-1, lethal shock was caused within 30 hours. In contrast,
   animals pretreated with two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 2 mu
   g rhG-CSF with a 12-hour time interval showed only marginal signs of
   illness and no lethality after challenge with D-Gal/TSST-1. Mice treated
   with 5 mu g rhG-CSF either 12 or 6 hours in advance also survived
   otherwise lethal doses of D-Gal/ TSST-1. The protective effects of
   rhG-CSF pretreatment was also evident against lethal doses of D-Gal/SEB
   challenge and this protection was accompanied by suppression of systemic
   interleukin-2. However, rhG-CSF affected neither the proliferative
   responses of SAg-reactive T cells in vivo or in vitro nor their
   interleukin-2 production in vitro, implying that rhG-CSF may indirectly
   interfere with cytokine synthesis in T cells but not with T-cell-SAg
   binding itself. These results represent another beneficial effect of
   rhG-CSF as an antiinflammatory agent against T-cell-mediated toxicity
   triggered by SAg. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

   biodegradable 3-dimensional porous composite of

   Six core floods at 50 degrees C have been conducted using Berea as the

   the polymer, n-heptane as the oil, and NaCl solution as the injection
   fluid. The oil recovery is compared by using a traditional salinity

   discussed in terms of the following two phenomena: (a) chromatographic
   separation of the polymer and surfactant in the front of the chemical
   slug to prevent dispersion of the surfactant; (b) the decrease in the
   polymer concentration at the rear of the surfactant slug to promote a
   III/II(-) phase transition in order to prevent trapping of surfactant.}},

Abstract = {{1. Interneurones mediating reciprocal inhibition between wrist flexors
   and extensors in man are characterized using both Renshaw cells and
   transarticular group I afferent activation.
   2. Renshaw cells were activated by reflex discharges evoked by a tendon
   tap. The tendon tap was applied to the tendon of the muscles from which
   the Ia fibres responsible for the reciprocal inhibition originated.
   Contrary to what was observed both in the cat hindlimb and in human
   elbow muscles, this Renshaw cell activation never resulted in a long
   depression of the reciprocal inhibition between wrist flexors and
   extensors.
   3. Convergence from group I elbow muscle afferents and antagonistic
   group I afferents onto interneurones mediating reciprocal inhibition
   between wrist muscles was revealed in post-stimulus time histogram
   (PSTH) experiments using the technique of spatial facilitation.
   4. The characteristics of the interneurones mediating reciprocal
   inhibition between wrist flexors and extensors could therefore be
   summarized as follows: (a) they are fed by antagonistic group I
   afferents and group I afferents originating from both flexor and
   extensor elbow muscles; (b) they are not inhibited by Renshaw cells; (c)
   they are not excited by low threshold cutaneous afferents; and (d) they
   are probably interposed in a disynaptic pathway.
   5. It is therefore concluded that interneurones mediating reciprocal
   inhibition between wrist flexors and extensors in man differ both from
   Ia interneurones and from interneurones interposed in the Ib reflex
   pathways and these characteristics are related to the complex
   circumduction movements developed in the wrist.}},

Abstract = {{The essential mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, Mim44, is involved
   in the translocation of preproteins across the mitochondrial inner
   membrane. Two other putative components of this protein-translocation
   system are the integral inner-membrane proteins, Mim23 and Mim17. Here,
   we present genetic evidence for functional co-operation of all three
   proteins. Furthermore, we show that Mim23 and Mim17 are associated in a
   protein complex that also contains two proteins of 55 kDa and 20 kDa. We
   speculate that this subcomplex forms the proteinaceous import channel of
   the inner-membrane which transiently interacts with a less abundant
   peripheral complex of Mim44 and mitochondrial heat-shock protein Hsp70.}},

Abstract = {{The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
   that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before
   lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation
   along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed
   after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the
   molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we
   have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and
   T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the
   SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with
   DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter.
   Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in
   erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were
   sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint
   promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter Ib also
   exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242),
   and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter
   activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required
   for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242
   MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However,
   GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells
   GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not
   GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell
   environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in
   T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of
   trans-dominant negative regulators. (C) 1995 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{Regulation of synthesis of cytochrome d in Escherichia coli has been
   studied using mutants with cytochrome-d-beta-galactosidase gene fusions.
   It was shown that various protonophorous uncouplers, when added to the
   growth medium, cause induction of the cytochrome d synthesis. The
   cytochrome-d-inducing activity of uncouplers correlates with their
   ability to inhibit such a Delta<(mu)over bar>(H+)-driven function as
   motility of the E. coli cells. An increase in the Na+ concentration in
   the growth medium from 1.5 mM to 25 mM results in induction of the
   cytochrome d synthesis. The cytochrome-d-inducing effect of uncouplers
   is much more pronounced when the Na+ concentration is high than when it
   is low. These data are in agreement with the assumption that cytochrome
   d is involved in the Na+ energetics substituting for the H+ energetics
   when the latter appears to be inefficient.
   Mutations in arcA or arcB genes (but not in fnr gene) completely prevent
   the increase in the cytochrome d level induced by uncouplers but are
   without effect on that induced by Na+. It is assumed that in the control
   of the cytochrome d synthesis, the Are system is involved in the
   Delta<(mu)over bar>(H+) sensing whereas sensing of Delta<(mu)over
   bar>(Na+) (or of the Na+ concentration) is mediated by some other
   receptor system.}},

Abstract = {{The purified lipase from Candida deformans was shown to catalyse ester
   production in aqueous media by esterification of free fatty acids but
   not by alcoholysis. As the enzyme also catalysed ester hydrolysis, the
   influence of various physico-chemical factors on ester hydrolysis and
   synthesis was studied and compared. Substrate specificities were also
   studied. Both activities had the same pH and temperature optima, and did
   not require a metal cofactor. Tyrosine appeared to be one of the amino
   acids of the enzyme required by both catalytic activities, whereas
   serine-reactive reagents inhibited synthesis only. The highest synthesis
   and hydrolysis activities were obtained with mono-, di-and
   tri-unsaturated fatty acids containing a {[}cis] Delta-9 unsaturation
   and 16 to 18 carbon atoms. Only esters of primary alcohols were
   hydrolysed and synthesised. For alcohols ranging from methanol to
   butanol, synthesis activity increased with the length of the alcohol
   whereas hydrolysis activity of the corresponding esters decreased. The
   presence of alcohol inhibited hydrolysis. An optimum concentration was
   found for each primary alcohol at which ester synthesis was maximum and
   hydrolysis was low.}},

Abstract = {{The products of TAP1 and TAP2 genes, recently mapped within the MHC
   class II region, are involved in antigen presentation by MHC class I
   molecules, especially in the transport of endogenous peptides, As for
   most MHC genes, a polymorphism has been described and the possibility
   that it could influence the recipient immune response by modulating
   antigen presentation in kidney transplantation has been tested. The aim
   of our study was to compare TAP1 and TAP2 gene polymorphism and matching
   in 53 couples of kidney donors and recipients without any rejection
   episodes and in 55 other couples who had experienced at least 2 acute
   cellular rejection episodes; 70 healthy individuals served as controls.
   Our results showed that allelic variant frequencies of TAP1 alleles (1A
   to 1C) and TAP2 alleles (2A to 2E), as assessed by amplification
   refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction, were similar among
   `'rejection'' and `'no rejection'' populations, Furthermore, there were
   no differences of TAP1 and/or TAP2 matching between donors and
   recipients in the 2 groups. In contrast, we showed that the recipients
   of the no rejection group were better matched with their corresponding
   donors for the HLA-DR genes than those of the rejection group. These
   results suggest that the currently described polymorphism in the limited
   coding region of TAP1 and TAP2 genes does not influence the incidence of
   kidney allograft rejection episodes and seems not to be a strong link to
   the adjacent DR/DQ subregion. Moreover, the observed increase frequency
   of TAP1B allele in the whole recipient's group as compared with controls
   (16.2\% vs, 7.1\% in the healthy individuals; P<0.02) was not linked to
   the rejection occurrence hut to the presence of glomerulonephritis as
   initial disease.
   Our study suggests that, in the clinical conditions tested, neither TAP
   polymorphism nor TAP matching influences the renal graft outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Background, A Total Quality Improvement review of frozen section
   diagnoses yielded four sequential false-negative frozen section
   diagnoses in lymph nodes in the evaluation of metastases from prostate
   carcinoma, Because these results appeared to differ from the
   department's overall frozen section experience, frozen section diagnoses
   of pelvic lymph nodes in patients with prostate carcinoma were reviewed
   to benchmark the department's performance,
   Methods. All 220 pelvic lymph node frozen section samples from 110
   patients with prostate carcinoma from January, 1986 to July, 1993 at
   Bridgeport Hospital (BH) were reviewed, and the department's frozen
   section diagnostic efficiency was compared with: (1) all BH frozen
   section procedures performed during the same period; (2) pelvic lymph
   node frozen section analysis and (3) imaging techniques for prostate
   carcinoma from other institutions found in MEDLARS literature searches
   from 1973 to 1993.
   Results, Frozen section diagnostic efficiency for patients with prostate
   carcinoma from BH was 93.6\% (sensitivity 63.2\%, specificity 100\%)
   compared with (1) 98\% for all BH frozen section analyses (sensitivity
   99\%, specificity 98\%); (2) 90.1\% for MEDLARS search pelvic lymph node
   frozen section prostate carcinoma analyses (sensitivity 66.5\%,
   specificity 100\%); and (3) 88\% for MEDLARS search magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) pelvic lymph node prostate carcinoma (sensitivity 41\%,
   specificity 97\%).
   Conclusions, Frozen section diagnosis of pelvic lymph nodes approaches
   the overall diagnostic efficiency of frozen section analysis and is more
   sensitive for the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma in pelvic lymph nodes
   than is MRI because more than half of the metastases are smaller than
   the 1.0-cm resolution limit of the MRI, False-negative frozen section
   diagnoses (67\% sensitivity) occur because of errors in sampling
   microscopic metastases.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative 3' splicing of the one active human epsilon heavy chain gene
   results in variants of epsilon mRNA encoding distinct IgE proteins. The
   same relative amounts of these < epsilon mRNA variants were produced by
   non-atopic donor B cells when driven in a variety of T-dependent or
   T-independent systems. The most abundant variants were those for classic
   secreted epsilon and a novel secreted form (CH4-M2''). In contrast,
   cells from subjects with high levels of serum IgE secondary to parasitic
   infection or atopy spontaneously produced higher relative levels of the
   CH4-M2' epsilon mRNA variant, lower relative amounts of both the
   membrane and CH4-M2'' secreted variants, and very low levels of the
   CH4'-CH5 variant. The existence of and corresponding changes in levels
   of the CH4-M2'-encoded secreted protein were demonstrated. IL-10 induced
   this same differential expression of epsilon splice variants in vitro
   when used to costimulate IL-4 plus CD40-driven B cells and could
   differentially enhance the production of CH4-M2' protein by established
   IgE-secreting cell lines. Inhibition of IgE by cross-linking the low
   affinity IgE receptor (CD23) decreased the levels of epsilon mRNA and
   resulted in a distinct pattern of epsilon mRNA characterized by a
   dramatic decrease in CH4-M2' splice variant. IL-6, IL-2, or IFN-gamma
   did not change the epsilon mRNA pattern. Overall, the absolute and
   relative amounts of the different epsilon mRNA splice variants produced
   appear to be controlled in a differentiation-related fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Long ice cores from Greenland yield records of annually resolved climate
   change for the past ten to twenty thousand years, and decadal resolution
   for one hundred thousand years or more. These cores are ideally suited
   to determine the rapidity with which major climate changes occur. The
   termination of the Younger Dryas, which marks the end of the last
   glacial period, appears to have occurred in less than a human lifetime
   in terms of oxygen isotopic evidence (a proxy for temperature), in less
   than a generation (20 years) for dust content and deuterium excess
   (proxies for winds and sea-surface conditions), and in only a few years
   for the accumulation rate of snow. Similarly rapid changes have been
   observed for stadial-interstadial climate shifts (Dansgaard-Oeschger
   cycles) which punctuate the climate of the last glacial period. These
   changes appear to be too rapid to be attributed to external orbital
   forcings, and may result from internal instabilities in the Earth's
   atmosphere-ocean system or periodic massive iceberg discharges
   associated with ice sheet instability (Heinrich events). In contrast,
   the Holocene climate of the Arctic appears to have been relatively
   stable. However, the potential for unstable interglacials, with very
   rapid, shortlived climatic deteriorations, has been raised by results
   from the lower part of the GRIP ice core. These results have not been
   confirmed by other ice cores, notably the nearby GISP2 core. Evidence
   from other records of climate during the Eemian interglacial have
   yielded mixed results, and the potential for rapid climate change during
   interglacial periods remains one of the most intriguing gaps in our
   understanding of the nature of major Quaternary climate change.}},

   proteins (IGFBPs) were studied in MDA-MB-231
   (estrogen-receptor-negative), MCF-7/6 (estrogen-receptor-positive,
   invasive) and in MCF-7/AZ (estrogen-receptor-positive, non-invasive)
   human breast carcinoma cell lines. Cells were grown or maintained in a
   chemically defined medium. Under these conditions, we found different
   patterns of IGFBPs in the three cell types. MDA-MB-231 cells secrete
   most of the IGFBPs they produce whereas MCF-7/6 and MCF-7/AZ cells
   maintain a high intracellular level. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the major
   IGFBP is IGFBP-4 which is the minor form in MCF-7/6 and MCF-7/AZ cells.
   IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 are predominant in MCF-7/6 cells while MCF-7/AZ
   cells produce far less IGFBPs and do not contain detectable amounts of
   29-32-kDa forms (IGFBP-5). In MCF-7/6 cells, estradiol-17 beta
   specifically decreases both the intracellular content and secretion of
   IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5. Estrogen regulation of IGFBPs cell content and
   secretion was found to be tamoxifen-resistant, and only slightly
   antagonized by ICI 182,780, a pure antiestrogen. The function of these
   regulations relative to the invasive phenotype and proliferation has now
   to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Injection of parental lymphocytes into an unirradiated adult F-1 host
   results in an acute GVH reaction characterized by immune deficiency,
   attack on host lymphohematopoietic tissues, and repopulation with
   donor-derived cells. All of these events result from the initial
   activation of donor lymphocytes by host alloantigens. Interaction of
   pairs of host and donor costimulatory molecules, in particular
   CD28/CTLA4 and B7-1/B7-2, play a crucial role in this initial activation
   of donor T cells. We demonstrate here that in vivo treatment of the host
   with high doses of CTLA4-Ig solely during the initial period of donor
   alloactivation can completely abort the subsequent development of GVH
   reaction. Although donor T cells are retained, CTLA4-Ig treatment
   reduces the initial endogenous cytokine production and arrests the
   subsequent expansion of donor T cells, the differentiation of anti-host
   effecters, and the development of severe immune deficiency. This result
   is consistent with the establishment of host-specific tolerance in the
   donor population, while maintaining host immune competence.}},

Abstract = {{Signal transduction pathways mediated by sensor histidine kinases and
   cognate response regulators control a variety of physiological processes
   in response to environmental conditions, Here we show that in
   Caulobacter crescentus these systems also play essential roles in the
   regulation of polar morphogenesis and cell division. Previous studies
   have implicated histidine kinase genes pleC and divJ in the regulation
   of these developmental events, We now report that divK encodes an
   essential, cell cycle-regulated homolog of the CheY/Spo0F subfamily and
   present evidence that this protein is a cognate response regulator of
   the histidine kinase PleC. The purified kinase domain of PleC, like that
   of DivJ, can serve as an efficient phosphodonor to DivK and as a
   phospho-DivK phosphatase, Based on these and earlier genetic results we
   propose that PleC and DivK are members of a signal transduction pathway
   that couples motility and stalk formation to completion of a late cell
   division cycle event, Gene disruption experiments and the filamentous
   phenotype of the conditional divK341 mutant reveal that DivK also
   functions in an essential signal transduction pathway required for cell
   division, apparently in response to another histidine kinase, We suggest
   that phosphotransfer mediated by these two-component signal transduction
   systems may represent a general mechanism regulating cell
   differentiation and cell division in response to successive cell cycle
   checkpoints.}},

Abstract = {{Mass resolved fluxes of Ba+ and Sr+ ions were measured with the
   Quadrupole Ion Mass Spectrometer during the CRRES G-11b chemical release
   experiment in darkness. The flux of Sr+ relative to Ba+ at a distance of
   4 km from the release point was more than ten times larger than expected
   based on estimated charge transfer cross sections of the ground state
   metals. In each metal, we have identified at least one low-lying
   metastable state that is closer to charge-transfer resonance with O+
   than the ground state. These metastable states are 5s5p P-3(2) in Sr at
   14, 899 cm(-1) above the ground state and 6s5d D-3(3) in Ba at 9,597
   cm(-1). The Sr 5s5p P-3(2) state is nearly exactly resonant with O+ (9
   meV energy defect) and may have a significantly enhanced charge transfer
   cross section. In a proposed mechanism that may explain the measured ion
   fluxes, neutral metal atoms are excited to these metastable states by
   electron-atom collisions early in the expansion of the neutral cloud.
   High energy electrons could be produced by a plasma process such as CIV.
   This energy is stored in the neutral cloud. The metastable atoms are
   ionized by near-resonant charge exchange with ambient O+ and are
   detected after the cloud expands to reach the spacecraft.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at
   increased risk for developing malignant neural crest tumors and juvenile
   myeloid leukemia, Although the normal allele of the NF1 tumor-suppressor
   gene is frequently deleted in some of the malignant tumors that arise in
   patients with NF1, the role of NF1 alterations in the sporadic forms of
   these cancers is unclear.
   Methods. A series of intragenic sequence polymorphisms was used to
   investigate lymphocyte and tumor DNA samples from 22 adults with high
   grade malignant gliomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) al NF1. In
   addition, an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction was used to
   screen these tumors for point mutations at codon 1423.
   Results. One recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma showed LOH within NF but
   not with a flanking marker located near the gene. Of 21 informative
   tumors, none showed point mutations affecting codon 1423 of NF1.
   Conclusion, These data suggest that LOH at NF1 is uncommon in sporadic
   high grade astrocytoma, and codon 1423 is not a `'hot spot'' for
   activating point mutations in these tumors.}},

   favorably with the observed waveform in terms of shape. However, the

Abstract = {{We studied effects of temperature on the deiodinating enzymatic pathways
   governing hepatic production of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T-3) from
   L-thyroxine (T-4) in rainbow trout. Kinetics of outer-ring deiodination
   (ORD) and inner-ring deiodination (IRD) of T-4 and T-3 were measured in
   vitro at 4 degrees, 12 degrees, and 18 degrees C using liver microsomes
   of trout that were acclimated for 21 days at 4 degrees, 13 degrees, and
   18 degrees C and fed on temperature-compensated food rations. For all
   temperatures the V-max (level of functional enzyme) and V-max/K-m (index
   of enzyme efficiency) values for the T-3-generating T(4)ORD pathway
   greatly exceeded values for the T-3-degrading T(3)IRD pathway; T(4)IRD
   and T(3)ORD) pathways were negligible. The main effects of temperature
   occurred between 4 degrees C and 12 degrees/13 degrees C; T(4)ORD
   V-max/K-m rose from 0.48 at 4 degrees C to 1.62 at 12 degrees/13 degrees
   C and to 1.83 at 18 degrees C. This response correlated with in vivo
   deiodination rates measured previously. T(4)ORD apparent K-m did not
   change over the temperature acclimation range, suggesting an absence of
   temperature-induced isozymes. However, K-m was depressed at the assay
   temperature of 4 degrees C, indicating a direct effect of temperature to
   enhance enzyme-T-4 substrate affinity. T(4)ORD V-max was insensitive to
   assay temperature but was depressed in trout acclimated at 4 degrees C.
   We conclude that from 4 degrees to 18 degrees C T(4)ORD is the main
   thyroid hormone deiodinating pathway in trout liver. T(4)ORD activity
   increases more than threefold from 4 degrees to 13 degrees C. This is
   due to a direct effect of temperature to decrease K-m and to an
   acclimatory increase in V-max. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and decomposition of phosphine molecules on clean Si(100)
   2 x 1 surfaces have been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy,
   photoemission spectroscopy, and total energy calculations. Phosphine
   decomposition depends strongly on the substrate temperature and results
   in a variety of surface structures depending on the relative rates of
   phosphine adsorption, hydrogen and phosphorus desorption, and hydrogen,
   phosphorus, and silicon surface diffusion. Between room temperature and
   200 degrees C the phosphine mainly dissociatively adsorbs, most likely
   into P-P dimers. Near defect sites nondissociative adsorption of PH3 is
   also found. For temperatures up to about 400 degrees C surface diffusion
   allows the generation of small P-P dimer rows. Above 400 degrees C,
   beyond the onset of hydrogen desorption, larger islands with width not
   exceeding approximately eight dimer rows are formed. At maximum
   phosphorus coverage, obtained by phosphine adsorption at 625 degrees C,
   straight vacancy lines are found, which most likely consist of
   phosphorus passivated Si(111) microfacets. Total energy calculations
   suggest that these may result from surface stress induced by the

   development of cells from all hemopoietic lineages appeared normal,

Abstract = {{In this report, we describe a modification of the assay for long-term
   culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) that allows a subset of murine LTC-IC
   (designated as LTC-ICML) to express both their myeloid (M) and lymphoid
   (L) differentiative potentials in vitro, The modified assay involves
   culturing test cells at limiting dilutions on irradiated mouse marrow
   feeder layers for an initial 4 weeks under conditions that support
   myelopoiesis and then for an additional week under conditions permissive
   for B-lymphopoiesis. All of the clonogenic pre-B progenitors
   (colony-forming unit {[}CFU] pre-B) detected in such postswitch LTC
   appear to be the progeny of uncommitted cells present in the original
   cell suspension because exposure of lymphoid-restricted progenitors to
   myeloid LTC conditions for greater than or equal to 7 days was found to
   irreversibly terminate CFU-pre-B production and, in cultures initiated
   with limiting numbers of input cells (no progenitors of any type
   detected in > 70\% of cultures 1 week after the switch), the presence of
   CFU-pre-B was tightly associated with the presence of myeloid clonogenic
   cells, regardless of the purity of the input population. Limiting
   dilution analysis of the proportion of negative cultures measured for
   different numbers of input cells showed the frequency of LTC-ICML in
   normal adult mouse marrow to be 1 per 5 x 105 cells with an enrichment
   of similar to 500-fold in the Sca-1(+) Lin(-)WGA(+) fraction, as was
   also found for competitive in vivo repopulating units (CRU) and
   conventionally defined LTC-IC. LTC-ICML also exhibited the same
   resistance to treatment in vive with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as CRU and
   LTC-IC, thereby distinguishing these three populations from the great
   majority of both in vitro clonogenic cells and day 12 CFU-S. The ability
   to quantitate cells with dual lymphoid and myeloid differentiation
   potentials in vitro, without the need for their prior purification,
   should facilitate studies of totipotent hematopoietic stem cell
   regulation. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a naturally occurring variant of the human thyrotropin
   receptor with a Pro52Thr substitution in the N-terminal extracellular
   domain of the receptor has been identified. To determine the functional
   significance of this substitution, cDNAs of wild-type and variant
   thyrotropin receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary
   cells. The Pro52Thr substitution did not affect synthesis and membrane
   localization of the receptor, as evidenced by I-125-thyrotropin binding
   analysis to intact cells. The variant receptor and the wild-type
   receptor were expressed in equivalent numbers and displayed identical
   binding affinity for thyrotropin. Strikingly, thyrotropin increased cAMP
   accumulation to a much greater extent in cells expressing the variant
   receptor as compared to the wild-type receptor-expressing cells. Basal
   and cholera toxin-stimulated or forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels were
   not different. It is concluded that the Pro52Thr substitution in the
   N-terminal region of the human thyrotropin receptor produces a receptor
   protein with enhanced coupling to cAMP production. This naturally
   occurring hyperactive thyrotropin receptor may participate in
   hyperthyroidism of patients with Graves' disease.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclin-dependent kinase 4-inhibitor (CDK41; p16; or (MTS1) gene has
   been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located in
   chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a wide spectrum of human
   cancers, including leukemias. Recent studies disclosed that it was
   frequently deleted or mutated in a variety of primary human cancers,
   including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The purpose of this study is to
   figure out the precise manners and frequencies of p16 gene inactivation
   in diverse hematopoietic tumor types and thus to clarify its
   significance in development of human hematopoietic malignancies. A total
   of 410 tumor specimens from patients with primary hematopoietic
   malignancies were examined for deletions of the p16 gene as well as the
   neighboring p15 gene and the nearby interferon alpha gene by Southern
   blot analysis. Tumor-specific mutations or small deletions of the p16
   gene were also studied in 74 patients using single-strand conformation
   polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Loss of the p16 gene was
   most frequently observed among the three genes examined and was found in
   59 of the 410 patients: 2 of 134 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 41 of
   105 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 of 15 with chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia, 5 of 14 with adult T-cell leukemia, 4 of 33 with non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma, 3 of 8 with mixed-lineage leukemia, and 2 of 61 with chronic
   myelocytic leukemia. In 16 of the 59 patients, the p16 deletions
   occurred due to rearrangements within the small region between the p15
   exon 2 and the p16 exon 2. Tumor-specific mutations or small deletions
   of the p16 gene were not detected in the 74 patients examined, including
   12 of 14 patients with hemizygous deletions of the gene. Loss of the p16
   gene is frequent in and highly specific to lymphoid malignancies (54 of
   183 {[}30\%] in lymphoid tumors v 2 of 219 {[}1\%] in myeloid tumors; P
   <.0001). The deletion analyses strongly suggest that the pig gene is a
   tumor-suppressor gene located in chromosome 9p21 that is involved in
   development of human lymphoid tumors. Gene deletions but not minute
   mutations should be the predominant mechanism of p16 gene inactivation
   in these types of tumors. (C) 1995 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNAs covering the
   5'-end region of mouse and rat mRNAs that encode the beta or
   muscle-specific isoform of the glycolytic enzyme enolase. As previously
   determined for humans, two classes of beta-enolase transcripts with
   distinct sequences in their 5'-untranslated regions are present in both
   mouse and rat muscles. A mechanism of alternative splicing, conserved
   from mouse to man, generates the two forms of mRNA. Secondary-structure
   predictions indicated that, in all cases, a more stable secondary
   structure could exist in the 5' end of the message with the longer
   leader. In vitro transcripts containing defined human or mouse
   5'-untranslated sequences were obtained by fusion of the different cDNA
   clones and tested for their relative translational efficiencies in
   rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Transcripts containing the human long and
   short leader sequences showed differences in the translational rate,
   suggesting a role for the 5'-untranslated region in the regulation of
   translation. No detectable difference was found between transcripts with
   the two distinct mouse leader sequences. In addition, both transcripts
   are bound to polysomes and are equally distributed along differently
   sized polysomes in C2C12 myogenic cells. The relative expression of the
   two spliced forms in developing and adult muscle tissues by means of
   reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction did not show a
   stage-specific or a tissue-type-specific pattern. A putative functional
   role for the 5'-untranslated sequences of beta-enolase transcripts is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Time dynamics of a family of opto-thermal nonlinear devices is described
   by means of a system of linear partial differential equations subjected
   to a nonlocal and nonlinear boundary condition and a rich variety of
   homoclinic phenomena is numerically found. Linear-stability analysis
   shows that the effective dynamical dimension is determined by the device
   structure, i.e. by the number of layers between two mirrors, and then it
   may be easily varied.
   A variety of local and global bifurcations observed in bilayer systems
   are described in detail, showing that the dynamics is in effect
   two-dimensional except for subtle features appearing in a gluing
   bifurcation where two homoclinic connections occur almost
   simultaneously. Complex behaviour is shown to occur in the case of
   trilayer systems, with a very similar dynamics to the one of the
   well-known Rossler model of third-order ordinary differential equations.
   Two different families of aperiodic phase portraits are described in
   detail and their association with homoclinic connections to saddle
   invariant sets of different configurations is pointed out. The
   occurrence of complex dynamics is demonstrated by means of first-return
   1D maps obtained in proper Poincare sections.}},

Abstract = {{The role of heritable, population-wide cell damage in neoplastic
   development was studied in the 28 L subline of NTH 3T3 cells, These
   cells differ from the 17(3c) subline used previously for such studies in
   their lower frequency of `'spontaneous'' transformation at high
   population density and their greater capacity to produce large, dense
   transformed foci. Three cultures of the 28 L subline of NM 3T3 cells
   were held under the constraint of confluence for 5 wk (5 wk 1 degrees
   assay) and then assayed twice in succession (2 degrees and 3 degrees
   assays) for transformed foci and saturation density, After the 2 degrees
   assay, the cells were also passaged at low density to determine their
   exponential growth rates and cloned to determine the size and
   morphological features of the colonies, Concurrent measurements were
   made in each case with control cells that had beep kept only in frequent
   low-density passages and cells that had been kept at confluence for only
   2 wk (2 wk 1 degrees), Two of the three cultures transferred from the 2
   degrees assay of the 5 wk 1 degrees cultures produced light transformed
   foci, and the third produced dense foci, The light focus-forming
   cultures grew to twice the control saturation density ip their 2 degrees
   assay and 6-8 times the control density in the 3 degrees assay;
   saturation densities for the dense focus formers were about 10 times the
   control values in both assays, All three of the cultures transferred
   from the 2 degrees assay of the 5 wk 1 degrees cultures multiplied at
   lower rates than controls at low densities, but the dense focus formers
   multiplied faster than the light focus formers, The reduced rates of
   multiplication of the light focus formers persisted for >50 generations
   of exponential multiplication at low densities. Isolated colonies formed
   from single cells of the light focus formers were of a lower population
   density than controls; colonies formed by the dense focus formers were
   slightly denser than the controls but occupied only half the area A much
   higher proportion of the colonies from the 5 wk 1 degrees cultures than
   the controls consisted of giant cells or mixtures of giant and
   normal-appearing cells. The results reinforce the previous conclusion
   that the early increases in saturation density and light focus formation
   are associated with, and perhaps caused by, heritable, population-wide
   damage to cells that is essentially epigenetic in nature. The more
   advanced transformation characterized by large increases in saturation
   density and dense focus formation could have originated from rare
   genetic changes, such as chromosome rearrangements, known to occur at an
   elevated frequency in cells destabilized by antecedent cellular damage.}},

   investigate the spectral evolution of radio outbursts in the blazar

   `quiescent' emission, the flare spectrum can be described by a simple
   homogeneous self-absorbed synchrotron component. The evolution of this
   spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with the shock model of
   Marscher and Gear, although not totally so in detail. Some of the
   discrepancies can possibly be resolved if the proposed relativistic jet,
   which is initially oriented close to the line-of-sight, bends away. The
   optically thin spectrum of the flare emission, however, is found to be
   flatter than allowed by the model, Strong correlations are found between
   the 90-22 GHz two-point spectral index and the logarithm of the 90-GHz
   flux, These trends are reconciled with the evolution of the synchrotron
   spectrum during the hares.}},

   (Nd422) particles were intentionally added, was prepared through the
   so-called MMTG process in Ar (99\% purity) flowing atmosphere at an
   ambient pressure. The quasi-single crystal thus grown was about 1 cm X 1
   cm X 1 cm in dimension. It turned out that the Nd422 particles were
   uniformly distributed in the Nd123-phase matrix in a fashion similar to
   the distribution of the intentionally added Y211 particles in the Y123
   phase matrix. The superconducting transition temperature T-c for the
   sample subjected to post-annealing in oxygen atmosphere was 94 K. The
   critical current density J(c) was determined to be 45 000 A/cm(2) at 77
   K and 1 T, when the field was applied parallel to the c-axis of the

   With the aid of examples, it is shown how difficult it is to develop
   suitable materials for oil-country and boiler tubing. Reference is also

   today, for example, whether the NACE tensile test or rather the NACE DCB

Abstract = {{We present ab initio total energy calculations for aggregate defects of
   the noble metals Pt or Au with Li. The calculations are performed in the
   local spin density approximation to the density-functional theory using
   the linear-muffin-tin-orbital method in the atomic spheres
   approximation. We determine the binding energies of the aggregates
   (ignoring lattice relaxations) and calculate the hyperfine interactions.
   We show that in the aggregate defects observed experimentally (see paper
   I) the noble metal atom is always on a lattice site. There is a stable
   orthorhombic pair consisting of one Li atom on an interstitial site
   close to the noble metal impurity and a trigonal aggregate consisting of
   the noble metal surrounded by three Li atoms on the nearest interstitial
   sites. The hyperfine interactions (see paper I) with the noble metal,
   with Li, and also with Si are quantitatively explained by an extension
   of the vacancy model and it is shown that the Si-29 nucleus giving rise
   to the prominent hyperfine interaction is on a regular lattice site. We
   show that aggregates involving two Li atoms are not stable. There is,
   however, a stable aggregate where four Li atoms are placed around one Pt
   atom in a tetrahedral configural;ion. The analogous aggregate with Au
   has no state in the gap and, therefore, would be a stable end product of
   the gettering process of Au by Li. Its presence might be difficult to
   prove experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{We study the single-electron capture process by impact of protons on
   hydrogen atoms, at intermediate and high collision energies. The
   emphasis is on differential cross sections for capture to specific nlm
   final states. The calculations use three distorted-wave models, a
   symmetric one (continuum distorted-wave approximation) and two
   asymmetric ones (continuum distorted-wave-eikonal initial state and
   eikonal final-state approximations).
   The various sets of differential cross sections are presented and
   compared to available experimental data. Distinguishing features appear
   most notably in the double scattering region revealing the different
   physical content of the approximations. An analysis of the post-prior
   discrepancy in the asymmetric models is sketched and the validity of a
   previously introduced criterion to select the appropriate distorted-wave
   model in a specific collision is also discussed.}},

   Protein analysis established N-terminal and C-terminal positions,
   showing different and specific patterns in protein start positions

   with formaldehyde differ consistently, being about 10-fold higher in the
   yeast than the human/mammalian enzymes, but compensated for by similar
   changes in k(cat) values. This is compatible with the different
   functional needs, emphasizing low formaldehyde concentration in the
   animal cells but efficient formaldehyde elimination in the

   formaldehyde detoxication rather than in long-chain alcohol turnover.}},

Abstract = {{The transport properties of intermetallic compounds RCo(2) (R = Pr, Nd,
   Sm, Gd-Lu, Sc and Y) in the temperature range from 4.2 up to 1000 K were
   studied and different contributions were determined. In the non-magnetic
   compounds the spin fluctuation contribution to the electrical
   resistivity, rho(sf) proportional to (T/T-sf)(2), and thermal
   resistivity, W-sf proportional to (T/T-sf), were found to follow the
   theoretical predictions. The spin disorder contribution arising from the
   scattering of conduction electrons on 4f moments was deduced and found
   to be proportional to the de Gennes factor. It is shown that the spin
   fluctuations are responsible for the low-temperature features of the
   temperature-dependent thermopower, whereas the high-temperature
   behaviour is mainly determined by the density of states function.
   In the paramagnetic region near the Curie temperature, the critical
   fluctuations cause a considerable enhancement of the electrical
   resistivity of the magnetic RCo(2) compounds, which is manifested by
   pronounced upturns in rho versus T dependences.}},

Abstract = {{During opiate withdrawal, there is an elevated and prolonged efflux of
   glutamate and aspartate in the locus coeruleus (LC). The enhanced
   excitatory amino acid (EAA) release is thought to contribute to the
   withdrawal-induced activation of LC neurons and to the expression of the
   physical withdrawal syndrome. In this study, prolonged bath applications
   of glutamate to LC neurons in brain slices resulted in a slowly
   developing long-term glutamate desensitization (LTGD). LTGD was observed
   during extracellular recordings or in neurons voltage-clamped to -60 mV,
   in both cases reaching a maximum of about a 50\% reduction in the
   glutamate response. Responses in the desensitized cells gradually
   recovered within 3 h. Cyclothiazide, an inhibitor of rapid glutamate
   receptor desensitization did not prevent LTGD. LTGD could not be induced
   by prolonged applications of EAA agonists other than glutamate, either
   alone or in various combinations. However, after induction by glutamate,
   there was cross-desensitization to quisqualate but not to AMPA or NMDA.
   LTGD was blocked by either lowering extracellular Ca2+ concentrations or
   by treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine but not
   by inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase or nitric oxide
   synthase. Applications of the protein kinase C activator phorbol
   diacetate did not cause a decrease in glutamate responses indicating
   that an activation of protein kinase C may not be sufficient for
   desensitization to occur. A decrement of the glutamate response
   resembling LTGD occurred after treatment by the protein phosphatase
   inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A. LC neurons in brain slices
   prepared from opiate-withdrawn rats exhibited glutamate responses that
   were initially desensitized and recovered within 3 h after withdrawal.
   These results suggest that LTGD in LC neurons may occur during opiate
   withdrawal and could contribute to the time course of LC hyperactivity
   and the associated behavioral withdrawal syndrome.}},
