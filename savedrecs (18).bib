Abstract = {{We define model recovery anti-windup for SISO linear control systems
   with output saturation. We address the problem by relying on a hybrid
   modification of the linear closed loop which, employs a suitable logic
   variable to activate/deactivate various components of a control scheme.
   The scheme relies on a finite-time observation law, an open-loop
   observer and an open-loop input generator which is capable of driving
   the plant output within the saturation limits. Then the control scheme
   is based on suitable (hybrid) resetting laws allowing the controller to
   operate on the artificial output signal generated by the open-loop
   observer when the actual plant output is outside the saturation limits.
   Unlike existing results, not only we prove uniform global asymptotic
   stability of the closed loop, but we also prove the local preservation
   and global recovery properties, typical of model recovery anti-windup
   paradigms. We also illustrate the proposed technique on an example
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The response of nanolasers subject to external optical feedback has been
   analyzed. Calculations have been performed using rate equations, which
   include the Purcell cavity-enhanced spontaneous emission factor F and
   the spontaneous emission coupling factor beta. In the analysis, the
   influence of F and beta is evaluated for varying distance from external
   mirror, current, and feedback rate. It is observed that, in general,
   increased F and beta at low bias currents increases the critical
   feedback for which chaos occurs as compared to conventional lasers,
   whereas at higher bias currents, chaos occurs at lower feedback rates.
   It is also found that for larger F, when increasing the distance from
   external mirror, the feedback rate at which chaos occurs increases.}},

Pages = {{3700-3709}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{During rapid movements, tendons can act like springs, temporarily
   storing work done by muscles and then releasing it to power body
   movements. For some activities, such as frog jumping, energy is released
   from tendon much more rapidly than it is stored, thus amplifying muscle
   power output. The period during which energy is loaded into a tendon by
   muscle work may be aided by a catch mechanism that restricts motion, but
   theoretical studies indicate that power can be amplified in a
   muscle-tendon load system even in the absence of a catch. To explore the
   limits of power amplification with and without a catch, we studied the
   bullfrog plantaris muscle-tendon during in vitro contractions. A novel
   servomotor controller allowed us to measure muscle-tendon unit (MTU)
   mechanical behavior during contractions against a variety of simulated
   inertial-gravitational loads, ranging from zero to 1x the peak isometric
   force of the muscle. Power output of the MTU system was load dependent
   and power amplification occurred only at intermediate loads, reaching
   similar to 1.3x the peak isotonic power output of the muscle. With a
   simulated anatomical catch mechanism in place, the highest power
   amplification occurred at the lowest loads, with a maximum amplification
   of more than 4x peak isotonic muscle power. At higher loads, the
   benefits of a catch for MTU performance diminished sharply, suggesting
   that power amplification >2.5x may come at the expense of net mechanical
   work delivered to the load.}},

Title = {{Dengue Virus Non-structural Protein 1 Modulates Infectious Particle
   Production via Interaction with the Structural Proteins}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the most enigmatic proteins of
   the Dengue virus (DENV), playing distinct functions in immune evasion,
   pathogenesis and viral replication. The recently reported crystal
   structure of DENV NS1 revealed its peculiar three-dimensional fold;
   however, detailed information on NS1 function at different steps of the
   viral replication cycle is still missing. By using the recently reported
   crystal structure, as well as amino acid sequence conservation, as a
   guide for a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we discovered
   that in addition to being essential for RNA replication, DENV NS1 is
   also critically required for the production of infectious virus
   particles. Taking advantage of a trans-complementation approach based on
   fully functional epitope-tagged NS1 variants, we identified previously
   unreported interactions between NS1 and the structural proteins Envelope
   (E) and precursor Membrane (prM). Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation
   revealed an additional association with capsid, arguing that NS1
   interacts via the structural glycoproteins with DENV particles. Results
   obtained with mutations residing either in the NS1 Wing domain or in the
   beta-ladder domain suggest that NS1 might have two distinct functions in
   the assembly of DENV particles. By using a trans-complementation
   approach with a C-terminally KDEL-tagged ER-resident NS1, we demonstrate
   that the secretion of NS1 is dispensable for both RNA replication and
   infectious particle production. In conclusion, our results provide an
   extensive genetic map of NS1 determinants essential for viral RNA
   replication and identify a novel role of NS1 in virion production that
   is mediated via interaction with the structural proteins. These studies
   extend the list of NS1 functions and argue for a central role in
   coordinating replication and assembly/release of infectious DENV
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{We studied vortex nucleation/annihilation process and its temperature
   dependence in micromagnetic objects with lowered symmetry using
   micro-Hall magnetometry. Magnetization reversal curves were obtained for
   the Pacman-like nanodots placed directly on Hall probes. Lowered

   nucleation and annihilation fields strongly depend on the angle of the
   external in-plane magnetic field with respect on the nanodot symmetry.
   The micromagnetic simulations support the experimental results - the
   vortex nucleation fields are controlled by local magnetization
   configurations present in the object (C-, S-, and double S-states) for
   field just above vortex nucleation field. The experiments also confirm
   that the vortex nucleation proceeds via thermal activation over an

Abstract = {{Standard electron optics predicts Larmor image rotation in the magnetic
   lens field of a TEM. Introducing the possibility to produce electron
   vortex beams with quantized orbital angular momentum brought up the
   question of their rotational dynamics in the presence of a magnetic
   field. Recently, it has been shown that electron vortex beams can be
   prepared as free electron Landau states showing peculiar rotational
   dynamics, including no and cyclotron (double-Larmor) rotation.
   Additionally very fast Gouy rotation of electron vortex beams has been
   observed. In this work a model is developed which reveals that the
   rotational dynamics of electron vortices are a combination of slow
   Larmor and fast Cony rotations and that the Landau states naturally
   occur in the transition region in between the two regimes. This more
   general picture is confirmed by experimental data showing an extended
   set of peculiar rotations, including no, cyclotron. Larmor and rapid
   Cony rotations all present in one single convergent electron vortex
   beam. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving of challenging
   adaptive time-dependent problems with Crank-Nicolson kind of time
   integration in parallel. The new algorithm allows for parallel execution
   of computations from different time steps. Time steps are distributed
   between processors. The number of processors working over consecutive
   time steps increases with each iteration of the adaptive algorithm. The
   following time steps utilize the previous time steps's solutions with
   the same level of accuracy. Our new parallel algorithm is compared with
   other methods. First, we compare it with a traditional method which
   performs all the adaptive iterations in the first time step, next it
   restarts the adaptive iterations in the second time step, and continues,
   one time step after another. Second, we compare our algorithm with the
   one that performs all the adaptive iterations in the first time step,
   and then starts the following time steps with the optimal mesh obtained
   from the previous iteration. Finally, we compare our algorithm to the
   one that executes the projection-based interpolation of the material
   data in the first time step, then it solves the problem over the
   obtained mesh, and then starts the following time steps with the optimal
   mesh obtained from the previous iteration. All the mentioned algorithms
   are tested on the challenging computational problem, which is the
   solution of the Pennes equation over a human head. The heat source is
   obtained by approximation of the solution of the Maxwell equation
   computed over the model human head. From our numerical results it
   follows that 10 min (600s) of exposure to the cell phone radiation may
   cause up to 2 degrees C increase of the temperature of the brain in the
   range close to the cell phone. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a clinical diagnosis, with no
   single best method of detection currently available. This study
   evaluated whether a decline between resting (rPO) and ambulatory (aPO)
   pulse oximetry (PO) levels after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation
   therapy (RT) can serve as a clinical aid in diagnosing and evaluating
   treatment response of grade 2-3 RP.
   Methods and materials: Between March 2007 and November 2013, rPO and aPO
   values were obtained from 55 patients immediately after definitive
   thoracic RT and at each subsequent visit, for up to 4 visits. Median
   values of the decline from rPO to aPO were compared between those with
   and without subsequent RP. A logistic regression model was used to
   determine an association between a drop in PO and, independently,
   clinically defined RP.
   Results: RP was identified in 19 of 55 patients, with a median time to
   diagnosis of 56 days after RT. Twelve patients (22\%) were diagnosed
   with grade 2 RP and 7 (13\%) with grade 3 RP. According to a Wilcoxon
   rank sum test, the median calculated drop between rPO and aPO was
   greater in RP patients than in those without RP (median 4.21 and 1.01,
   respectively; P < .0001). After adjustment for total tumor dose and age,
   multivariate analyses revealed a 64.8\% increase in the chance of RP
   development with every unit of decline in PO (P=.0014). After initiation
   of treatment with a corticosteroid, the mean difference in PO drop was
   compared with patients' baselines and demonstrated a statistically
   significant improvement, with peak PO value recovery after 2 weeks of
   corticosteroid therapy (P=.0001).
   Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with RP demonstrated an early,
   measurable drop between rPO and aPO that was detected at or before
   diagnosis. Consequent recovery in PO followed treatment with
   corticosteroids. PO measurements are cost-effective and readily
   available, and they can be a valuable tool to aid in diagnosing RP and
   gauging treatment response. (C) 2015 American Society for Radiation

Title = {{Trametinib radiosensitises RAS- and BRAF-mutated melanoma by perturbing

Journal = {{RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) is used frequently in patients with melanoma,
   but results are suboptimal because the disease is often radioresistant.
   This may be due to constitutive activation of MAPK pathway signalling
   through mutations involving RAS/RAF. Thus, we studied whether
   trametinib, a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 could
   improve the efficacy of RT.
   Methods and materials: Clonogenic survival assays were performed in
   human BRAF-mutant (A375), NRAS-mutant (D04, WM1631), KRAS-mutant
   (WM1791c) and wild-type (PMWK) melanoma cell lines. The effects of
   trametinib with and without radiation on protein levels of MEK effectors
   were measured by immunoblot analyses. Cell cycle effects, DNA damage
   repair, mitotic catastrophe and senescence were measured using flow
   cytometry, gamma H2Ax staining, nuclear fragmentation and
   beta-galactosidase staining, respectively. Additionally, athymic mice
   with D04 flank tumours were treated with fractionated RT after gavage
   with trametinib and monitored for tumour growth.
   Results: All cell lines, except PMWK, exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity
   when RT was combined with trametinib compared to either agent alone.
   Sensitiser enhancement ratios were 1.70, 1.32, 1.10, and 1.70 for A375,
   D04, WM1361 and WM1791c, respectively. Trametinib efficiently blocked
   RT-induced phosphorylation of ERK at nanomolar concentrations. Increased
   radiosensitivity correlated with prolonged G1 arrest and reduction in
   the radioresistant S phase up to 48 h following RT. A larger population
   of senescence-activated beta-galactosidase-positive cells was seen in
   the trametinib pretreated group, and this correlated with activation of
   two of the major mediators of induced senescence, p53 and pRb. Mice
   receiving the combination treatment (trametinib 1 mg/kg and RT over 3
   days) showed a reduced mean tumour volume compared with mice receiving
   trametinib alone (p = 0.016), or RT alone (p = 0.047). No overt signs of
   drug tonicity were observed.
   Conclusion: Trametinib radiosensitised RAS-/RAF-mutated melanoma cells
   by inducing prolonged G1 arrest and premature senescence. In this
   pre-clinical study we demonstrate that combining trametinib and RT is
   well tolerated, and reduces tumour growth in vivo. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Due to a lack of statistical data, unstiffened cylindrical lightweight
   structures are designed following a knockdown factor (KDF) approach
   described in the NASA SP-8007 (Weingarten and Seide, 1965). This
   approach aims at a lower-bound, conservative design. The basis for the
   proposed KDFs are a number of tests with different, partially unknown
   boundary conditions and imperfection patterns for metallic cylinders
   that do not resemble the imperfection patterns achieved by
   state-of-the-art manufacturing methods for cylinders made of carbon
   fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). Within this work, two CFRP tubes are
   manufactured using the filament winding method and are cut into a total
   of 12 cylinders from which optical measurements are taken to analyse
   characteristics of the corresponding imperfection patterns. 11 cylinders
   are tested in axial compression until buckling occurs and tests are
   accompanied by high speed displacement measurements, thermography and
   measurements of occurring load imperfections. Four different FE-models,
   which differ in the parameters considered, are set up for prediction of
   the budding load of each cylinder. Model response showed the highest
   sensitivity to load imperfections. Negligence of this parameter lead to
   a 15\% increase of the corresponding model bias while geometric
   imperfections made up for only 3\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress is known to contribute to cell damage. In several cell
   types, one of the earliest effects of oxidative stress is a rapid and
   substantial decrease in cell volume, which in turn regulates a broad
   range of cell functions, including development of apoptosis. Since
   volume regulation is closely coupled to membrane ion permeability,
   activation of ion channels may play an important role in oxidative
   stress-related cell injury. Oxidative stress plays a major role in a
   variety of liver diseases and bile duct epithelia cells (BDE) represent
   an important site of injury. We, therefore, investigated the functional
   interactions of oxidative stress, cell volume and ion permeability in a
   BDE model. Whole-cell patch clamp studies were performed in the human
   Mz-Cha 1 cell line. Oxidative stress was produced by addition of H2O2 to
   the bath solution. Changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and of
   crosssectional area (for calculating cell volume) were monitored by
   laser scanning microscopy. Exposure of Mz-Cha 1 cells to H2O2 resulted
   in cell shrinkage and increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
   Patch-clamp studies revealed that exposure to H2O2 also resulted in the
   activation of ion currents with a threshold of 10-6 M H2O2. Ion
   substitution studies and blocker experiments identified the currents as
   representing an increase in membrane K+ and Cl-permeability.
   Interestingly both ion channel activation and cell shrinkage had a close
   relationship to the applied H2O2 concentration and were significantly
   inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ chelation. These data imply that in a
   BDE model, oxidative stress leads to cell shrinkage through activation
   of Ca2+-dependent K+ and Cl-currents. Since cell shrinkage has been
   associated with increased cell damage, the opening of these ion channels
   might contribute to the high susceptibility of biliary epithelial cancer
   cells to oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Because it is unknown whether 24-h energy expenditure (EE) responses to
   dietary extremes will identify phenotypes associated with weight
   regulation, the aim of this study was to determine whether such
   responses to fasting or overfeeding are associated with future weight
   change. The 24-h EE during energy balance, fasting, and four different
   overfeeding diets with 200\% energy requirements was measured in a
   metabolic chamber in 37 subjects with normal glucose regulation while
   they resided on our clinical research unit. Diets were given for 24 h
   each and included the following: 1) low protein (3\%), 2) standard (50\%
   carbohydrate, 20\% protein), 3) high fat (60\%), and 4) high
   carbohydrate (75\%). Participants returned for follow-up 6 months after
   the initial measures. The decrease in 24-h EE during fasting and the
   increase with overfeeding were correlated. A larger reduction in EE
   during fasting, a smaller EE response to low-protein overfeeding, and a
   larger response to high-carbohydrate overfeeding all correlated with
   weight gain. The association of the fasting EE response with weight
   change was not independent from that of low protein in a multivariate
   model. We identified the following two independent propensities
   associated with weight gain: a predilection for conserving energy during
   caloric and protein deprivation and a profligate response to large
   amounts of carbohydrates.}},

Title = {{MIRO observations of subsurface temperatures of the nucleus of

Abstract = {{Observations of the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the
   millimeter-wave continuum have been obtained by the Microwave Instrument
   for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO). We present data obtained at wavelengths
   of 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm during September 2014 when the nucleus was at
   heliocentric distances between 3.45 and 3.27 AU. The data are fit to
   simple models of the nucleus thermal emission in order to characterize
   the observed behavior and make quantitative estimates of important
   physical parameters, including thermal inertia and absorption properties
   at the MIRO wavelengths. MIRO brightness temperatures on the irregular
   surface of 67P are strongly affected by the local solar illumination
   conditions, and there is a strong latitudinal dependence of the mean
   brightness temperature as a result of the seasonal orientation of the
   comet's rotation axis with respect to the Sun. The MIRO emission
   exhibits strong diurnal variations, which indicate that it arises from
   within the thermally varying layer in the upper centimeters of the
   surface. The data are quantitatively consistent with very low thermal
   inertia values, between 10-30 JK(-1) m(-2) s(-1/2), with the 0.5 mm
   emission arising from 1 cm beneath the surface and the 1.6 mm emission
   from a depth of 4 cm. Although the data are generally consistent with
   simple, homogeneous models, it is difficult to match all of its
   features, suggesting that there may be some vertical structure within
   the upper few centimeters of the surface. The MIRO brightness
   temperatures at high northern latitudes are consistent with sublimation
   of ice playing an important role in setting the temperatures of these
   regions where, based on observations of gas and dust production, ice is
   known to be sublimating.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1341-1370}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is increasingly being used in medium-rise
   timber buildings for a number of reasons, such as rapidity of
   construction, cost effectiveness and robustness. Like for other building
   materials, verification of the load-bearing performance in fire
   conditions is an important issue. Experimental fire tests have been
   performed on loaded CLT wall elements at research institutes in Sweden
   and Italy. In total, three large-scale and four medium-scale tests have
   been carried out. The aim was to gain information about initially
   protected and unprotected elements, to be used for classification and
   also for validation of calculation models. In the test series, reference
   tests at normal temperature were included to obtain information (e.g.
   stiffness, strength) about the material tested in fire conditions. In
   addition, model-scale fire tests were performed to investigate the loss
   in stiffness resulting from fire exposure and the effect of different
   protection types. Loaded fire tests varied in the range of 41.8 min to
   120 min, depending on the CLT structure, the level of load, and the type
   of protection. Data on temperature within specimens and residual
   cross-sections were collected. Charring rates evaluated from
   experimental results were comparable with values proposed by Eurocode
   for the design of timber structures. Conservative solutions were
   obtained by using simplified design methods and comparing their results
   to test results and results of advanced modelling. It was shown that the
   load-bearing performance of CLT may show abrupt changes due to its
   layered structure. It is strongly recommended that a minimum residual
   depth depending on the CLT structure should be required in order to
   ensure robust building products.}},

Title = {{Estimating Disease Duration in Cross-sectional Surveys}},
Journal = {{EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{839-845}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: In some common episodic conditions, such as diarrhea,
   respiratory infections, or fever, episode duration can reflect disease
   severity. The mean episode duration in a population can be estimated if
   both the incidence and prevalence of the condition are known. In this
   article, we discuss how an estimator of the average episode duration may
   be obtained based on prevalence alone if data are collected for two
   consecutive units of time (usually days) in the same person.
   Methods: We derive a maximum likelihood estimator of episode duration,
   explore its behavior through a simulation study, and illustrate its use
   through a real example.
   Results: We show that for two consecutive days, the estimator of the
   mean episode duration in a population equals one plus twice the ratio of
   the number of subjects with the condition on both days to the number of
   subjects with only 1 day ill. The estimator can be extended to account
   for 3 or 4 consecutive days. The estimator assumes nonoverlapping
   episodes and a time-constant incidence rate and is more precise for
   shorter than for longer average episode durations.
   Conclusion: The proposed method allows estimating the mean duration of
   disease episodes in cross-sectional studies and is applicable to large
   demographic and health surveys in low-income settings that routinely
   collect data on diarrhea and respiratory illness. The method may further
   be used for the calculation of the duration of infectiousness if test
   results are available for two consecutive days, such as paired throat
   swabs for influenza.}},

Title = {{Interaction Quality: Assessing the quality of ongoing spoken dialog
   interaction by experts-And how it relates to user satisfaction}},
Journal = {{SPEECH COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{12-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a novel expert-based approach to assess the quality
   of ongoing Spoken Dialog System (SDS) interactions. We call this
   approach ``Interaction Quality{''} (IQ). It is an objective measure
   which relies on statistical classification with Support Vector Machines
   (SVMs). We compare objective expert IQ annotations of ongoing SDS
   interactions with subjective User Satisfaction (US) ratings and show
   that IQ and US correlate (rho =.66). Expert annotations obviously mirror
   the subjective user impression to a great extent while they are, above
   all, much easier to obtain. The IQ score that quantifies the quality of
   the interaction is generated using the median score of exchange
   annotations of several experts. US is tracked in a study with 38 users
   interacting with an SDS. A large, comprehensive set of
   domain-independent, automatic interaction parameters is introduced to
   quantify the interaction at arbitrary dialog exchanges. Furthermore, a
   manually annotated negative emotion feature is added to the parameter
   set in order to evaluate the contribution of emotions on the
   classification of IQ and US. For evaluation we use the CMU Let's Go bus
   information system. The model yields a correlation of rho = .80 when
   classifying IQ scores annotated in field data from the CMU system.
   Furthermore, the model achieves p =.74 for predicting US on lab data,
   and rho =.89 for IQ on lab data. The presented approach outperforms
   related studies in the field. Only a marginal contribution of the
   emotion feature to the performance can be observed, implying that US is
   not influenced by visible emotions. We analyze causalities and
   correlations between the interaction parameters and the target variables
   US/IQ and identify relevant predictors. With the presented paradigm,
   critical dialogs can be found; once deployed as an online monitoring
   technique, this paradigm could render SDSs more user friendly and
   improve user acceptance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Design of parallel transmission radiofrequency pulses robust against

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PurposeTwo-spoke parallel transmission (pTX) radiofrequency (RF) pulses
   have been demonstrated in cardiac MRI at 7T. However, current pulse
   designs rely on a single set of B-1(+)/B-0 maps that may not be valid
   for subsequent scans acquired at another phase of the respiration cycle
   because of organ displacement. Such mismatches may yield severe
   excitation profile degradation.
   MethodsB(1)(+)/B-0 maps were obtained, using 16 transmit channels at 7T,
   at three breath-hold positions: exhale, half-inhale, and inhale.
   Standard and robust RF pulses were designed using maps obtained at
   exhale only, and at multiple respiratory positions, respectively.
   Excitation patterns were analyzed for all positions using Bloch
   simulations. Flip-angle homogeneity was compared in vivo in cardiac CINE
   acquisitions.
   ResultsStandard one- and two-spoke pTX RF pulses are sensitive to
   breath-hold position, primarily due to B-1(+) alterations, with high
   dependency on excitation trajectory for two spokes. In vivo excitation
   inhomogeneity varied from nRMSE = 8.2\% (exhale) up to 32.5\% (inhale)
   with the standard design; much more stable results were obtained with
   the robust design with nRMSE = 9.1\% (exhale) and 10.6\% (inhale).
   ConclusionA new pTX RF pulse design robust against respiration induced
   variations of B-1(+)/B-0 maps is demonstrated and is expected to have a
   positive impact on cardiac MRI in breath-hold, free-breathing, and
   real-time acquisitions. Magn Reson Med 74:1291-1305, 2015. (c) 2014

   teaching practices through reflective dialog about shared practice. In
   this regard we surveyed 310 teachers participating in a collaboration

   the impacts of reflective dialog in a cross-institutional context. The
   results indicate benefits condensing in complemented child-perception
   and a more student-centered practice. Furthermore, teachers' experience
   and a practice of documentation seem to mediate impacts. Ultimately, the

Abstract = {{Introduction. Cross-sex hormone treatment of gender dysphoria (GD)
   patients changing from male to female a prerequisite for sex
   reassignment. For initial physical adaptation, a combined treatment of
   anti-androgens and estrogens is used. Provided that patients fulfill
   specific criteria, sex reassignment surgery (SRS) presents the final
   step toward physical adaptation. However, systematic studies analyzing
   effects of hormone treatment regimens are lacking.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three different
   hormonal treatment strategies regarding endocrinological parameters and
   testicular histology.
   Methods. Testicular tissues were obtained in a multicenter study from
   108 patients on the day of SRS from three clinics following different
   treatment strategies. Patients either discontinued treatment 6 weeks
   (clinic A) or 2 weeks (clinic B) prior to SRS or not at all (clinic C).
   Testicular tissues, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood and
   questionnaires were obtained on the day of SRS.
   Main Outcome Measures. Blood hormone and intratesticular testosterone
   (ITT) levels were measured. Testicular weight and histology were
   evaluated and the percentage of luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin
   receptor (LHCGR) positive cells was determined.
   Results. According to the questionnaires, patients showed desired
   phenotypical changes including breast growth (75\%) and smooth skin
   (32\%). While patients from clinics A and B presented with rather
   virilized hormonal levels, patients from clinic C showed generally
   feminized blood serum levels. Histological evaluation revealed highly
   heterogeneous results with about 24\% of patients presenting with
   qualitatively normal spermatogenesis. In accordance with serum endocrine
   profile, ITT levels were lowest in clinic C and correlated with
   testosterone and free testosterone, but not with the spermatogenic
   state. The percentage of LHCGR-positive cells and ITT levels did not
   correlate.
   Conclusion. Only patients that did not discontinue hormonal treatment
   showed feminized blood levels on the day of SRS. The ones who stopped
   re-virilized quickly. Interestingly, testicular histology was highly
   heterogeneous irrespective of the treatment strategy, a phenomenon that
   requires further investigation.}},

Title = {{Solid state joining of nickel based alloy, Haynes 230}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{492-499}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Haynes 230 is a nickel based, solid-solution strengthened alloy that is
   used for high-temperature applications in the aero-engine and power
   generation industries. Addition of carbon promotes the formation of
   carbides to enhance creep resistance and control grain size. Although
   the alloy has been formulated for high temperature stability, cracking
   issues are still observed in fusion welding applications. To avoid
   formation of common fusion weld defects, this study considers the use of
   a solid state technique variation of friction stir welding (FSW) called
   thermal stir welding (TSW). An 85\% reduction in grain size was observed
   in the TSW region along with a 30-60\% reduction in the size of the W6C
   carbide phase. Negligible change in the area fraction of the tungsten
   rich carbides indicated the W6C carbides fragmented rather than
   dissolved. A slight decrease of 12\% from the parent material properties
   was observed in the tensile strength and elongation to failure of the
   TSW specimens. No cracks were observed in the TSW region during bend
   testing. Based on the TSW region morphology and lack of tracking, use of
   solid state joining provides an alternative to fusion welding and its
   associated defects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and
   safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with
   restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The
   open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University
   Hospital of Zurich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano).
   Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy
   with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels < 35 mu g/l or
   hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the study. RLS was graded
   according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Study Group
   rating scale. All participants had a score of >= 20 or had RLS >= 3
   times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was
   administered over 20 min. The primary end point was a >= 50\% reduction
   in the mean IRLS score one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end
   points included periodic limb movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal
   foot actigraphy), sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep
   Quality Index), and safety.
   Results: The IRLS score decreased from 23 +/- 7 (baseline) to 13 +/- 7
   (P < 0.01), whereas the PLM index decreased from 35 +/- 26 (baseline) to
   25 +/- 20 (P < 0.001). Significant improvement in sleep quality was also
   reported (P < 0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious
   adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to
   treatment.
   Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and
   efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron
   deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is
   warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 (GT4) is genetically diverse, with 17
   confirmed subtypes, and comprises approximately 13\% of infections
   worldwide. In this study, we identified GT4 subtypes by phylogenetic
   analysis, assessed differences in patient demographics across GT4
   subtypes, examined baseline sequence variability among subtypes and the
   potential impact on treatment outcome, and analyzed the development of
   viral resistance in patients who received a regimen of ombitasvir
   (nonstructural protein 5A {[}NS5A] inhibitor) plus ritonavir-boosted
   paritaprevir (NS3/4A inhibitor) with or without ribavirin (RBV) for the
   treatment of HCV GT4 infection. Phylogenetic analysis of HCV NS3/4A,
   NS5A, and NS5B nucleotide sequences identified 7 subtypes (4a, 4b, 4c,
   4d, 4f, 4g/4k, and 4o) among 132 patient samples. Subtype prevalence
   varied by country, and the distributions of patient birth cohort and
   race were significantly different across GT4 subtypes 4a, 4d, and
   non-4a/4d. Baseline amino acid variability was detected in NS5A across
   GT4 subtypes but had no impact on treatment outcome. Three patients
   experienced virologic failure and were infected with subtype 4d, and the
   predominant resistance-associated variants at the time of failure were
   D168V in NS3 and L28V in NS5A. Overall, high response rates were
   observed among patients infected with 7 HCV GT4 subtypes, with no impact
   of baseline variants on treatment outcome. GT4 subtype distribution in
   this study differed based on patient demographics and geography.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In many parts of the developing world the lack of consistent
   and affordable transport may be a serious obstacle to education and a
   unique sociocultural cause of stress among undergraduate students.
   Objective. To determine the student-perceived benefits of a faculty-led,
   grassroots student transport service for economically disadvantaged
   medical students. The service has been newly developed and implemented
   at the School of Medicine, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein,
   South Africa.
   Methods. A brief qualitative questionnaire survey, with Likert scales
   and free text, was administered to participants in the Student Transport
   Project after its first 21 months of operation. Students' views of the
   impact and effect of the project on their circumstances were surveyed.
   Results. During its first 2 years of operation, the Student Transport
   Project was used by 116 students in their clinical third - fifth years,
   representing 16.6\% of students in these years of training. All the
   participating students using the shuttle service were from previously
   disadvantaged communities and were economically disadvantaged. A survey
   among the participating students yielded an 84\% response rate; they all
   felt that the service significantly reduced their levels of financial
   and emotional stress, and many believed that the project positively
   impacted on their academic performance and assisted them in remaining in
   medical school.
   Conclusion. The basic, but novel, student transport service described in
   this article can have a dramatic effect in reducing medical student
   stress and, potentially, improving academic performance and success. It
   is hoped that others in lesser-developed countries in Africa and beyond
   may replicate such a student-centred transport initiative at their
   schools.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Little is known about the change in risk conferred
   by family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) as a person ages. We
   evaluated the effect of family history on CRC incidence and mortality
   after 55 years of age, when the risk of early onset cancer had passed.
   METHODS: We collected data from participants in the randomized,
   controlled Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial
   of flexible sigmoidoscopy versus usual care (55-74 years old, no history
   of CRC), performed at 10 US centers from 1993 to 2001. A detailed family
   history of colorectal cancer was obtained at enrollment, and subjects
   were followed for CRC incidence and mortality for up to 13 years.
   RESULTS: Among 144,768 participants, 14,961 subjects (10.3\%) reported a
   family of CRC. Of 2090 incident cases, 273 cases (13.1\%) had a family
   history of CRC; among 538 deaths from CRC, 71 (13.2\%) had a family
   history of CRC. Overall, family history of CRC was associated with an
   increased risk of CRC incidence (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.30; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.10-1.50; P<.0001) and increased mortality
   (HR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.69; P=.03). Subjects with 1 first degree
   relative (FDR) with CRC (n = 238; HR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.42) or >= 2
   FDRs with CRC (n = 35; HR, 2.04; 95\% CI, 1.44-2.86) were at increased
   risk for incident CRC. However, among individuals with 1 FDR with CRC,
   there were no differences in risk based on age at diagnosis in the FDR
   (for FDR <60 years of age: HR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.63; for FDR 60-70
   years of age: HR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.62; for FDR >70 years of age:
   HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.45; P trend = .59). CONCLUSIONS: After 55
   years of age, subjects with 1 FDR with CRC had only a modest increase in
   risk for CRC incidence and death; age of onset in the FDR was not
   significantly associated with risk. Individuals with >= 2 FDRs with CRC
   had continued increased risk in older age. Guidelines and clinical
   practice for subjects with a family history of CRC should be modified to
   align CRC testing to risk.}},

Title = {{Differentiating neutrophils using the optical coulter counter}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present an optofluidic measurement system that quantifies cell
   volume, dry mass, and nuclear morphology of neutrophils in
   high-throughput. While current clinical hematology analyzers can
   differentiate neutrophils from a blood sample, they do not give other
   quantitative information beyond their count. In order to better
   understand the distribution of neutrophil phenotypes in a blood sample,
   we perform two distinct multivariate measurements. In both measurements,
   white blood cells are driven through a microfluidic channel and imaged
   while in flow onto a color camera using a single exposure. In the first
   measurement, we quantify cell volume, scattering strength, and cell dry
   mass by combining quantitative phase imaging with dye exclusion cell
   volumetric imaging. In the second measurement, we quantify cell volume
   and nuclear morphology using a nucleic acid fluorescent stain. In this
   way, we can correlate cell volume to other cellular characteristics,
   which would not be possible using an electrical coulter counter. Unlike
   phase imaging or cell scattering analysis, the optical coulter counter
   is capable of quantifying cell volume virtually independent of the
   cell's refractive index and unlike optical tomography, measurements are
   possible on quickly flowing cells, enabling high-throughput. (C) 2015

   Rather than using electrically powered nodes in an otherwise fully

   -10 dBm. Feeder protection for optical access is experimentally

Title = {{A new perspective on proxy report: Investigating implicit processes of

Journal = {{QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2637-2649}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background Utilizing proxy report is a common solution to gathering
   quality-of-life information from people who are not capable of reliably
   answering questionnaires, such as people with dementia. Proxy report
   could, however, also provide information about patients' implicit
   processes of understanding, which we define as automatic, schema-driven
   cognitive processes that allow one to have a better understanding of
   oneself and of one's body, make oneself known and knowable to members of
   the social network, and allow one to react proactively in response to
   cues. We investigated whether implicit processes of understanding
   explain some of the association between reserve and healthy lifestyle
   behaviors.
   Methods We operationalized three implicit processes of understanding:
   (a) psychosocial understanding; (b) insight into physical disability;
   and (c) somatic awareness. This secondary analysis involved a cohort of
   multiple sclerosis patients and their caregiver informants (n = 118
   pairs). Measures included a neurologist-administered Expanded Disability
   Status Scale, patient- and informant-completed survey measures, and a
   heartbeat perception test (interoception). Patient-other congruence
   assessed implicit processes of understanding: psychosocial understanding
   (neurocognitive and personality); physical-disability insight; and
   somatic awareness (interoception).
   Results Effect sizes (ES) for the inter-correlations between the three
   implicit processes were small. Psychosocial understanding was associated
   with higher past reserve-building activities (small ES). Psychosocial
   understanding explained variance in healthy lifestyle behaviors over and
   above the variance explained by current reserve-building activities
   (Delta R-2 = 0.04; model R-Adjusted(2) = 0.18).
   Conclusions Proxy versus patient report can provide information about
   underlying interpretational processes related to insight. These
   processes are distinct from reserve, predict health outcomes, and can
   inform lifestyle-changing interventions.}},

Title = {{Cost-components of lung cancer care within the first three years after

Journal = {{LUNG CANCER}},

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Although lung cancer is of high epidemiological relevance in
   Germany, evidence on its economic implications is scarce. Sound
   understanding of current care structures and associated expenditures is
   required to comprehensively judge the additional benefit of novel
   interventions in lung cancer care. Adopting a payer perspective, our
   study aims to analyze expenditures for individuals with incident lung
   cancer.
   Material and methods: Patients with an initial diagnosis of lung cancer
   (ICD-10 code 04) in 2009 were searched in a large, nationwide base of
   health insurance claims data and grouped according to initial treatment
   (Surgery, Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy, No specific treatment). All-cause
   SHI and lung cancer-related spending was assessed for a
   patient-individual three-year time frame after initial diagnosis.
   Expenditures per case and expenditures per year survived were calculated
   via Generalized Linear Gamma Models adjusted forage, gender, living
   region, baseline metastases, multiple tumors and initial treatment
   regimen using time under observation as a weighting factor.
   Results: 17,478 individuals were identified. Lung cancer-related
   expenditures peaked within the first six months after initial diagnosis.
   Following, they declined subsequently and so did their share in allcause
   SHI spending. Lung cancer-related expenditures per case were estimated
   at (sic)20,400 (53\% of allcause expenditures) with a huge variance
   according to initial treatment regimen {[}Surgery: (sic)20,400,
   Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy: (sic)26,300, No specific treatment: 42001.
   Cost per year survived amounted to (sic)15,500 (55\% of all cause
   expenditures) {[}Surgery: (sic)11,600, Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy:
   20,200, No specific treatment: (sic)7600].
   Conclusion: Analyses of lung cancer-related expenditures need to take
   into account treatment strategies and survival. Our study is
   representative for a large share of the population and provides
   detailed, patientlevel information on costs of care and their
   compilation. Results render estimates available for the cost of lung
   cancer e.g. for budget impact analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses of
   screening and prevention schemes, or prognostic models of life-time
   expenditures per lung cancer case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents methods for improving the accuracy of vector-based
   position measurements through the decoupling of multiple nonideal sensor
   properties using model reference adaptive system (MRAS) techniques. The
   nonideal sensor properties considered are: signal scaling errors
   (amplitude imbalance on the vector components), signal offsets,
   imperfect orthogonality (quadrature error) between sensor vector
   components, and additional spatial harmonics superimposed on fundamental
   sensor outputs. Simulation and experimental results are provided to
   evaluate the proposed MRAS-based decouplingmethods. Themethods presented
   here can be applied to multiple forms of vector-based position
   measurement and estimation such as the use of magnetoresistive sensors,
   sine/cosine encoders, resolvers, or self-sensing (sensorless) methods.
   These methods can be implemented in real time and are well-suited to the
   self-commissioning of vector-based position sensors for enhanced sensor
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Real-life comparative data of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
   (ICD) longevity are needed to identify the best possible device
   longevity for optimal patient comfort and to minimize risk for multiple
   replacements.
   We retrospectively studied ICD longevity in a large single-center
   population. At our institution, 1272 consecutive patients were implanted
   with 1665 ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator
   (CRT-D) devices between 1998 and 2010. Device data and follow-up were
   retrieved from the continuous ICD clinic documentation, and generator
   replacements were verified from the hospital charts. Kaplan-Meier event
   probabilities for the time to generator replacement were calculated
   according to device type, pacing percentage (sum of atrial, right and
   left ventricular pacing, if applicable) and right ventricular pacing
   threshold, incidence of ICD shocks, and manufacturer. Multivariate Cox
   proportional hazards regression was performed in addition.
   A total of 470 devices were replaced for elective replacement indicator.
   These occurred after 5.4 years (95 \% confidence interval, 5.1 to 5.6
   years) in 175 of 625 implanted Boston Scientific or Guidant devices,
   after 5.7 years (5.5 to 5.9 years) in 266 of 883 Medtronic devices, and
   5.2 years (5.0 to 5.4 years) in 29 of 157 Biotronik devices,
   respectively. Differences between manufacturers remained significant
   upon multivariate analysis (Medtronic vs. Boston Scientific: P = 0.01;
   both vs. Biotronik: P < 0.01) as did differences of device type (single-
   and dual-chamber ICD vs. CRT-D, P < 0.01) and pacing percentage (P <
   0.01). Pacing output and ICD shocks did not influence battery longevity.
   ICD longevity differed significantly between manufacturers, independent
   of device type or pacing parameters.}},

   large transfer from the central bank to the treasury of the same
   magnitude as the fiscal stimulus, offset by an equal cut in the central
   bank's open market purchases so that the bank's transfer to the treasury
   is money-neutral. According to the simulations, the policy would achieve
   prompt full recovery from the severe recession without generating any
   adverse effect on government debt as a percent of GDP or on the
   inflation rate in either the short run or long run. The difference

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{200-207}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study experiments were conducted to study the porous thin plate
   drying process. An analysis was also carried out to determine the
   moisture transfer coefficients that vary with the moisture content of
   the plate during drying. The study is useful for analyzing the transient
   drying process of porous thin plates. Furthermore, energy and exergetic
   analyses based on the measured results were carried out to determine the
   dryer performance. It is found that, although the drying rate increases,
   the energy utilization ratio of the drying process decreases with either
   an increase in the rate of air flow or an increase in the size of the
   drying air inlet. The results indicate that a significant amount of the
   energy provided to the system was lost and not utilized for drying,
   especially for high drying rate dryers. An exergetic analysis showed
   that by adjusting the configuration of the air inlet and flow rate, the
   exergetic efficiency of the dryer can be significantly increased (from
   0.5\% to 10\%). An overall transport phenomena analysis and performance
   evaluation including the transient moisture transfer coefficients,
   drying rate, energy utilization ratio, and exergetic efficiency in the
   current study provide comprehensive and important insights to the
   thermal physics of porous thin plate drying processes and the design of
   efficient dryer systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: The ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for maintenance
   of protein homeostasis by degrading polyubiquitinated proteins in a
   spatially and temporally controlled manner. Cell and protein homeostasis
   are altered upon pathological tissue remodeling. Dysregulation of the
   proteasome has been reported for several chronic diseases of the heart,
   brain, and lung. We hypothesized that proteasome function is altered
   upon fibrotic lung remodeling, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis
   of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Objectives: To investigate proteasome function during myofibroblast
   differentiation.
   Methods: We treated lung fibroblasts with transforming growth factor
   (TGF)-beta and examined proteasome composition and activity. For in vivo
   analysis, we used mouse models of lung fibrosis and fibrotic human lung
   tissue.
   Measurements and Main Results: We demonstrate that induction of
   myofibroblast differentiation by TGF-beta involves activation of the 26S
   proteasome, which is critically dependent on the regulatory subunit
   Rpn6. Silencing of Rpn6 in primary human lung fibroblasts counteracted
   TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Activation of the 26S
   proteasome and increased expression of Rpn6 were detected during
   bleomycin-induced lung remodeling and fibrosis. Importantly, Rpn6 is
   overexpressed in myofibroblasts and basal cells of the bronchiolar
   epithelium in lungs of patients with IPF, which is accompanied by
   enhanced protein polyubiquitination.
   Conclusions: We identified Rpn6-dependent 26S proteasome activation as
   an essential feature of myofibroblast differentiation in vitro and in
   vivo, and our results suggest it has an important role in IPF
   pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: There are currently no published data on
   post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) or its prevention in
   children. Our study was aimed to analyze the safety and complications of
   large volume paracentesis (LVP) in children with severe ascites due to
   chronic liver disease with or without albumin therapy.
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal observational study enrolled
   children with severe ascites who underwent single time LVP at admission.
   They were divided into albumin infused (AI) and albumin non-infused
   (ANI) groups. Hemodynamic monitoring and laboratory parameters including
   plasma renin activity (PRA) were compared between baseline, 48 h and day
   6 of LVP. Their outcome at 3 months and maximal follow-up were noted.
   Results: 32 children (AI, n = 17; ANI, n = 15) had comparable baseline
   characteristics and 90.6\% had high PRA at onset. The incidence of PPCD
   was 37.5\% (ANI: 67\%; AI: 12\%, p = 0.003), occurred if ascitic fluid
   extraction was > 197.5 ml/kg (sensitivity: 90\%; specificity: 50\%, p =
   0.01) and if flow rate was higher in ANI group (1224 +/- 476 vs. 678 +/-
   214 ml/h, p = 0.009). ANI patients were susceptible to asymptomatic,
   persistent hyponatremia (baseline vs. day 6, 131 +/- 4 vs. 128 +/- 6
   mEq/L; p = 0.04) and had higher rates of recurrent ascites (42\%) and
   hospital readmission (67\%) within 3 months. No survival benefit among
   the AI or non-PPCD groups was demonstrated.
   Conclusions: LVP is safe in all age groups, best performed under albumin
   cover to overcome the problems of PPCD and hyponatremia. It is prudent
   to restrict volume extraction to less than 200 ml/kg actual dry weight
   for all and flow rate of 680 ml/h in ANI. (C) 2015 European Association

Title = {{Extended Scope of the Use of the Peroneal Perforator Flap in Lower Limb
   Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background The advantages of the peroneal perforator flap include a
   short harvesting time, thinness, and pliability. Due to the presence of
   a short pedicle and small vessel diameter, without peroneal vessel
   sacrifice, this flap is commonly used for distal limb reconstruction,
   but is rarely used for knee and proximal and middle lower leg
   reconstruction. We describe our experience with the application of a
   versatile peroneal perforator free flap for knee and proximal and middle
   lower leg reconstruction through supermicrosurgery.
   Methods Between October 2010 and August 2014, 22 patients with
   small-to-medium-sized defects on their knee and proximal and middle
   lower leg underwent reconstruction surgery using a peroneal perforator
   free flap. End-to-end anastomosis using a supermicrosurgery technique is
   often necessary, given the extremely small perforator vessel caliber
   (often less than 1.0 mm).
   Results The flap sizes ranged from 5 x 3 to 14 x 5.5 cm. The mean
   duration required for recipient perforator dissection was 30 minute,
   mean pedicle length was 4.5 cm, and mean duration required for flap
   harvesting was 31 minutes. Overall, 20 patients showed no complications;
   1 case each showed total and partial necrosis.
   Conclusion The use of a peroneal perforator free flap for knee and
   proximal and middle lower leg reconstruction, via supermicrosurgery, for
   small- and medium-sized defects had several advantages, including the
   short duration required for flap harvesting and securing the recipient
   vessel, and the avoidance of damage to a main artery. Moreover, the
   thinness and pliability of the flap ensured the absence of contour
   deformity and tissue defect mismatches.}},

Abstract = {{The phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene, which is associated with carotenoid
   biosynthesis, was isolated from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.). The
   open reading frame of IbPDS gene is comprised of 1719-base pairs and
   encodes a polypeptide of 573 amino acid residues. The deduced IbPDS
   protein sequence was homologous with that of other PDS proteins of
   various plant species. Also, the IbPDS gene appears to be a member of
   multiple gene families and further, the differences in the copy numbers
   among the five cultivars were considered to lead to differences in tuber
   color and carotenoid contents. Investigation of the mRNA expression of
   IbPDS revealed the greatest expression in the leaf tissue of sweet
   potatoes under both normal conditions and methyl viologen (MV) stress.
   The IbPDS cDNA was introduced to Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi under the
   control of the CaMV 35S promoter using Agrobacterium-mediated gene
   transfer techniques, thereby resulting in an increase in tolerance to MV
   (2, 10, and 50 A mu M). These results occurred owing to the elevated
   antioxidant capacity of carotenoids in transgenic plants.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD52
   monoclonal antibody used as induction in kidney transplantation (KTX)
   since 2003. Few studies have evaluated long-term outcomes of this agent
   or changes in outcomes over time.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements A retrospective cohort
   study was performed examining United States registry data from 2003 to
   2014 of primary KTX recipients receiving induction with alemtuzumab (AZ;
   n=5521) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG; n=8504) and maintenance
   immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil and early
   withdrawal of steroids. The primary outcome was overall death-censored
   graft survival (DCGS), and secondary outcomes were overall patient
   survival and 1-year acute rejection. Multivariate models were fit with
   donor, recipient, and transplant covariates. Because poorer outcomes
   with AZ may occur from a learning curve impact with the use of a new
   medication, transplant year was categorized into three time periods to
   evaluate outcomes over time (2003-2005, 2006-2008, >= 2009), and an
   interaction term of induction type with transplant year category was
   included in all models to test for era impacts.
   Results On multivariate analysis of DCGS there was a significant
   interaction between AZ and era (P<0.001). AZ was significantly
   associated with inferior DCGS in the earliest 2003-2005 era (adjusted
   hazard ratio {[}aHR], 2.21; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI], 1.72
   to 2.84) but not in the middle 2006-2008 era (aHR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 0.96
   to 1.36) or the most recent 2009-2014 era (aHR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 0.90 to
   1.29) compared with ATG. Risk-adjusted patient survival (aHR, 1.32; 95\%
   CI, 1.08 to 1.61; aHR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.09 to 1.46; and aHR, 1.10; 95\%
   CI, 0.93 to 1.29 by era, respectively) and acute rejection (adjusted
   odds ratio {[}aOR], 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.42; aOR, 0.94; 95\% CI,
   0.82 to 1.07; aOR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.81 to 0.98 by era, respectively)
   with AZ was comparable with ATG in the most recent era; however, there
   was no significant interaction with time (P=0.13 and P=0.06,
   respectively).
   Conclusions Current alemtuzumab utilization is associated with
   comparable graft and patient survival and acute rejection compared with
   ATG. Graft survival with alemtuzumab has improved over time.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Optimal treatment strategy in children with advance stage
   Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) still remains controversial.
   Aim: To evaluate the clinical profile and the efficacy of chemotherapy
   (CT) as a treatment modality in paediatric HL.
   Materials and Methods: Retrospective case record evaluation of
   paediatric HL cases over 5 years (October 2005 to October 2010) period.
   Results: Thirty five cases (31 boys) with a median age of eight years
   were studied. 24 cases were < 10-year-old, and 23 had late stage disease
   (stage III to IV). B-symptoms were present in 60\%, bulky mediastinal
   disease in 25.7\%, and spleen involvement in 60\% cases. None had bone
   marrow involvement.
   Most common histological type was nodular sclerosis (28.6\%). Most cases
   received ABVD/COPP or ABVD regimen. Two cases needed BEACOPP due to
   progressive disease, and 4 needed low-dose involved field radiotherapy
   (RT). At a mean (SD) extended event-free follow-up of 42.7(+/- 17.1)
   months, four cases relapsed (one was lost to follow-up, and three were
   treated with chemotherapy and low-dose involved field RT). None died due
   to the disease.
   Conclusion: Present study found systemic CT alone to be an effective
   therapy in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. However, a small sample in
   present study limits the generalisability of these findings. The
   findings needs to be replicated in larger population, preferably
   randomized clinical trials, before any firm conclusion can be made.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{157}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The growing need for efficient vehicles has led many researchers to
   explore various ways to utilize waste heat from the Internal Combustion
   Engine (ICE) to improve vehicle fuel economy. Past efforts in Waste Heat
   Recovery (WHR) have focused primarily on recovering waste heat from
   Conventional Vehicles (CV), which dissipate more than two-thirds of the
   fuel energy as waste heat. In general, WHR has always been considered as
   a secondary component to the vehicle powertrain and as a result it has
   had little success, particularly in light-duty vehicles. This
   investigation explores WHR from a broader perspective to better
   understand the possibilities and limits of WHR from CVs to future highly
   hybridized vehicles. Fuel energy distribution in the ICE is used to
   evaluate the sources of waste heat and identify exhaust energy recovery
   as the most promising method for improving ICE thermal efficiency.
   Fundamental analysis of conventional and hybrid powertrain design is
   used to investigate how they impact the availability of exhaust energy
   from the ICE. Models and simulations of several engines and vehicles are
   used to validate the theory presented for effective WHR from light-duty
   vehicles. The analysis focuses on how available exhaust energy changes
   for different vehicles, how it varies with drive cycles, and how the
   induced back pressure from an exhaust energy recovery system affects ICE
   performance. The results indicate that effective WHR is difficult to
   achieve in light-duty conventional vehicles, but is viable in a highly
   hybridized vehicles, where ICE thermal efficiency can be increased by at
   least 15 percent over various drive cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   during the period from 2007 to 2013. For each case, serum creatinine
   before and within a few days after the MRI were compared. In addition,
   the patients were analyzed for the development of nephrogenic systemic
   fibrosis (NSF), a reported complication of gadolinium in chronic kidney
   disease. The pre-MRI serum creatinine values ranged from 0.36 to 4.86
   mg/dL, with 70 patients (20\%) having values1.5 mg/dL. A comparison of
   the pre- and post-MRI serum creatinine values did not demonstrate a
   clinically significant difference (mean change=0.017 mg/dL; P=0.38),
   including those patients with a pre-MRI serum creatinine1.5 mg/dL. In
   addition, no cases of NSF were noted. In conclusion, our findings
   suggest that MRI with low-dose gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance) is a
   nonnephrotoxic imaging modality in liver transplant candidates, and its
   use can be cautiously expanded to liver transplant candidates with
   concomitant renal insufficiency. Liver Transpl 21:1340-1346, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 became the predominant circulating
   strain in the United States during the 2013-2014 influenza season.
   Little is known about the epidemiology of severe influenza during this
   season.
   METHODS. A retrospective cohort study of severely ill patients with
   influenza infection in intensive care units in 33 US hospitals from
   September 1, 2013, through April 1, 2014, was conducted to determine
   risk factors for mortality present on intensive care unit admission and
   to describe patient characteristics, spectrum of disease, management,
   and outcomes.
   RESULTS. A total of 444 adults and 63 children were admitted to an
   intensive care unit in a study hospital; 93 adults (20.9\%) and 4
   children (6.3\%) died. By logistic regression analysis, the following
   factors were significantly associated with mortality among adult
   patients: older age (>65 years, odds ratio, 3.1 {[}95\% CI, 1.4-6.9],
   P=.006 and 50-64 years, 2.5 {[}1.3-4.9], P=.007; reference age 18-49
   years), male sex (1.9 {[}1.1-3.3], P=.031), history of malignant tumor
   with chemotherapy administered within the prior 6 months (12.1
   {[}3.9-37.0], P<.001), and a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
   score (for each increase by 1 in score, 1.3 {[}1.2-1.4], P<.001).
   CONCLUSION. Risk factors for death among US patients with severe
   influenza during the 2013-2014 season, when influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was
   the predominant circulating strain type, shifted in the first
   postpandemic season in which it predominated toward those of a more
   typical epidemic influenza season.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Impact of weight loss on cardiac structure has not been extensively
   investigated in large, multi-ethnic, community-based populations. We
   investigated the longitudinal impact of weight loss on cardiac structure
   by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).
   Methods and results 2351 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis (MESA) who underwent CMR at Exam 1 (2002) and Exam 5
   (2011) were included. Primary outcomes were percentage change in LV mass
   (indexed to height) and LV mass-to-volume ratio (concentric LV
   remodelling). Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the
   association between outcomes and weight change. At median 9.4 years'
   follow-up, 639 individuals (27\%) experienced >5\% weight loss (median
   6.9kg) and 511 (22\%) had >5\% weight gain (median 6.4kg). A >5\% weight
   gain was associated with the greatest increase in LV mass (+5.4\%
   median) and LV mass-to-volume ratio (+12.2\% median). Adjusting for
   medications, hypertension/diabetes (and change in these risk factors),
   age, race and other risk factors, every 5\% weight loss was associated
   with a 1.3\% decrease in height-indexed LV mass and 1.3\% decrease in LV
   mass-to-volume ratio (p<0.0001). There was no effect
   modification/confounding by age, race, gender or baseline BMI. Change in
   LV mass-to-volume ratio was roughly linear, specifically for modest
   degrees of weight loss (-10\% to +10\%). Change in LV mass was linear
   with weight loss, suggesting no threshold of weight loss is needed for
   LV mass regression.
   Conclusions In a large multi-ethnic population, weight loss is
   associated with beneficial effects on cardiac structure, independent of
   age, race, gender, BMI and obesity-related cardiometabolic risk. There
   is no threshold of weight loss required to produce these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple juxtacrine and paracrine interactions occur between cancer
   cells and non-cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that
   direct tumor progression. Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are an
   integral component of the TME, and the majority of breast tumor stroma
   is comprised of CAFs. Heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and
   non-cancer cells of the TME occur via soluble agents, including
   cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and secreted microRNAs. We
   previously identified a microRNA signature indicative of hyperactive
   MAPK signaling (hMAPK-miRNA signature) that significantly associated
   with reduced recurrence-free and overall survival. Here we report that
   the hMAPK-miRNA signature associates with a high metric of stromal cell
   infiltrate, and we investigate the role of microRNAs, particularly
   hMAPK-microRNAs, secreted by CAFs on estrogen receptor (ER) expression
   in breast cancer cells. ER-positive MCF-7/ltE2- cells were treated with
   conditioned media (CM) from CAFs derived from breast cancers of
   different PAM50 subtypes (CAF(BAS), CAF(HER2), and CAF(LA)). CAF CM
   isolated specifically from ER-negative primary breast tumors led to ER
   repression in vitro. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission
   electron microscopy confirmed the presence of CAF-secreted exosomes in
   CM and the uptake of these exosomes by the ER+ MCF-7/ltE2- cells.
   Differentially expressed microRNAs in CAF CM as well as in MCF-7/ltE2-
   cells treated with this CM were identified. Knockdown of miR-221/222 in
   CAF(BAS) resulted in knockdown of miR221/222 levels in the conditioned
   media and the CM from CAF(BAS); miR221/222 knockdown rescued ER
   repression in ER-positive cell lines treated with CAF(BAS)-CM.
   Collectively, our results demonstrate that CAF-secreted microRNAs are
   directly involved in ER-repression, and may contribute to the
   MAPK-induced ER repression in breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors planned a clinical and histopathologic study to
   examine the behavior of nasolabial tissues (full-thickness skin flap)
   after being inset into the oral cavity for oral submucous fibrosis
   (OSMF) under the premise that skin that is foreign tissue to the oral
   cavity would be devoid of pathologic changes.
   Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with OSMF and mouth openings
   with an interincisal distance shorter than 28 mm were included. The flap
   was evaluated clinically for 10 years, during which biopsy specimen was
   obtained from the mucocutaneous junction of the inset flap for
   histopathologic examination.
   Results: In this series, complications such as flap loss, infection,
   flap necrosis, obstructive sialadenitis, and damage to facial nerve
   branches were not observed. However, intraoral hair growth and extraoral
   scar at the donor site were seen in all patients, 3 of whom subsequently
   underwent scar revision. Histopathologically, the inset flap showed
   decreased keratinization and loss of adnexal structures. A mean mouth
   opening of 43.2 mm was achieved at 10 years postoperatively (mean
   increase, 24.4 mm). No relapse was encountered, even at the last
   follow-up.
   Conclusion: The nasolabial island flap or any other full-thickness skin
   flap could be a viable and reliable option for reconstruction of
   intraoral defects from OSMF. (C) 2015 American Association of Oral and

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the investigation of the relationship between
   financial development and income inequality in case of Iran. In doing
   so, we have applied the ARDL bounds testing approach to examine the
   long-run relationship in the presence of structural break in the series.
   The unit root properties have been tested by applying Zivot and Andrews
   (in J Bus Econ Stat 10:251-270, 1992) and Clemente et al. (in Econ Lett
   59, 175-182, 1998) structural break tests. The VECM Granger causality
   approach is used to detect the direction of the causal relationship
   between financial development and income inequality. Moreover,
   Greenwood-Jovanovich (GJ) hypothesis has also been tested for Iranian
   economy. Our results confirm the long run relationship between the
   variables. Furthermore, financial development reduces income inequality.
   Economic growth worsens income inequality, but inflation and
   globalization improve income distribution. Finally, GJ hypothesis is
   found as well as U-shaped relationship between globalization and income
   inequality in case of Iran. This study might provide new insights for
   policy makers to reduce income inequality by making economic growth more
   fruitful for poor segment of population and directing financial sector
   to provide access to financial resources of poor individuals at cheaper
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates contributes to
   tuberculosis (TB) control through detection of possible outbreaks.
   However, 20\% of U.S. cases do not have an isolate for testing, and 10\%
   of cases with isolates do not have a genotype reported. TB outbreaks in
   populations with incomplete genotyping data might be missed by
   genotyping-based outbreak detection. Therefore, we assessed the
   representativeness of TB genotyping data by comparing characteristics of
   cases reported during January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010, that had a
   genotype result with those cases that did not. Of 22,476 cases, 14,922
   (66\%) had a genotype result. Cases without genotype results were more
   likely to be patients <19 years of age, with unknown HIV status, of
   female sex, U.S.-born, and with no recent history of homelessness or
   substance abuse. Although cases with a genotype result are largely
   representative of all reported U.S. TB cases, outbreak detection methods

Abstract = {{Iron (Fe) deficiency is a common agricultural problem that affects both
   the productivity and nutritional quality of plants. Thus, identifying
   the key factors involved in the tolerance of Fe deficiency is important.
   In the present study, the zir1 mutant, which is glutathione deficient,
   was found to be more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the wild type, and
   grew poorly in alkaline soil. Other glutathione-deficient mutants also
   showed various degrees of sensitivity to Fe-limited conditions.
   Interestingly, we found that the glutathione level was increased under
   Fe deficiency in the wild type. By contrast, blocking glutathione
   biosynthesis led to increased physiological sensitivity to Fe
   deficiency. On the other hand, overexpressing glutathione enhanced the
   tolerance to Fe deficiency. Under Fe-limited conditions,
   glutathione-deficient mutants, zir1, pad2 and cad2 accumulated lower
   levels of Fe than the wild type. The key genes involved in Fe uptake,
   including IRT1, FRO2 and FIT, are expressed at low levels in zir1;
   however, a split-root experiment suggested that the systemic signals
   that govern the expression of Fe uptake-related genes are still active
   in zir1. Furthermore, we found that zir1 had a lower accumulation of
   nitric oxide (NO) and NO reservoir S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Although
   NO is a signaling molecule involved in the induction of Fe
   uptake-related genes during Fe deficiency, the NO-mediated induction of
   Fe-uptake genes is dependent on glutathione supply in the zir1 mutant.
   These results provide direct evidence that glutathione plays an
   essential role in Fe-deficiency tolerance and NO-mediated Fe-deficiency
   signaling in Arabidopsis.}},

   responses and type-1 diabetes progression}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Adipocyte dysfunction correlates with the development of diabetes. Here
   we show that mice with a adipocyte-specific deletion of the
   SUMO-specific protease SENP1 gene develop symptoms of type-1 diabetes
   mellitus (T1DM), including hyperglycaemia and glucose intolerance with
   mild insulin resistance. Peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-deficient
   mice exhibit heightened NF-kappa B activity and production of
   proinflammatory cytokines, which induce CCL5 expression in adjacent
   pancreatic islets and direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islets.
   Mechanistic studies show that SENP1 deletion in adipocytes enhances
   SUMOylation of the NF-kappa B essential molecule, NEMO, at lysine
   277/309, leading to increased NF-kappa B activity, cytokine production
   and pancreatic inflammation. We further show that NF-kappa B inhibitors
   could inhibit pre-diabetic cytokine production, beta-cell damages and
   ameliorate the T1DM phenotype in SENP1-deficient mice. Feeding a
   high-fat diet augments both type-1 and type-2 diabetes phenotypes in
   SENP1-deficient mice, consistent with the effects on adipocyte-derived
   NF-kappa B and cytokine signalling. Our study reveals previously
   unrecognized mechanism regulating the onset and progression of T1DM
   associated with adipocyte dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{In 2 studies, we examined whether explicit distractors are necessary and

   operationalized as the decrease in the size of the interference effect
   as a function of naming RT. For all naming tasks, mean naming RTs were
   significantly longer in the interference condition than in the control
   condition. The slopes of the interference effects for the longest naming
   RTs correlated with the magnitude of the mean interference effect in
   both the semantic blocking task and the picture word interference task,
   suggesting that selective inhibition was involved to reduce the
   interference from strong semantic competitors either invoked by a single
   explicit competitor or strong implicit competitors in picture naming.
   However, there was no correlation between the slopes and the mean
   interference effect in the Stroop task, suggesting less importance of
   selective inhibition in this task despite explicit distractors. Whereas
   the results of the semantic blocking task suggest that an explicit
   distractor is not necessary for triggering inhibition, the results of
   the Stroop task suggest that such a distractor is not sufficient for
   evoking inhibition either.}},

Title = {{Optimal design of hybrid renewable energy systems in buildings with low
   to high renewable energy ratio}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{We develop a simulation-based meta-heuristic approach that determines
   the optimal size of a hybrid renewable energy system for residential
   buildings. This multi-objective optimization problem requires the
   advancement of a dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization
   algorithm that maximizes the renewable energy ratio of buildings and
   minimizes total net present cost and CO2 emission for required system
   changes. Three proven performance metrics evaluate the quality of the
   Pareto front generated by the proposed approach. The obtained results
   are compared against two reported multi-objective optimization
   algorithms in the related literature. Finally, an existing residential
   apartment located in a cold Canadian climate provides a test case to
   apply the proposed model and optimally size a hybrid renewable energy
   system. In this test application, the model investigates the potential
   use of a heat pump, a biomass boiler, wind turbines, solar heat
   collectors, photovoltaic panels, and a heat storage tank to produce
   renewable energy for the building. Furthermore, the utilization of
   plug-in electric vehicles for transportation reduces gasoline use where
   all power is generated by the building, and the utility provides the
   means to match intermittent renewable generation from solar and wind to
   the building electrical loads. Model results show that under the chosen
   meteorological conditions and building parameters a wind turbine, and
   plug-in electric vehicle technologies are consistently the optimal
   option to achieve a target renewable energy ratio. In particular, the
   optimization result shows that the renewable energy ratio can achieve
   near 100\% by installing a 73 kW wind turbine, a 200 kW biomass boiler,
   and using plug-in electric vehicles. This option has a net present cost
   of C\$705,180 and results in total CO2 emission of 2.4 ton/year.
   Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact
   of economic constants on net present cost of the obtained non-dominated
   solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of gastroschisis (GS) has increased globally. Maternal age
   and smoking are risk factors and aboriginal communities may be more
   commonly affected. Factors leading to this increased incidence are
   otherwise unclear. We investigate maternal sociodemography, air
   pollution and personal risk factors comparing mothers of infants with GS
   with a control group of infants with diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in a
   large population-based analysis.
   Data were collected from a national, disease-specific pediatric surgical
   database (May 2006-June 2013). Maternal community sociodemographic
   information was derived from the Canadian 2006 Census. Univariate and
   multivariable analyses were performed examining maternal factors related
   to diagnosis of GS.
   GS infants come from poorer, less educated communities with more
   unemployment, less pollution, fewer immigrants, and more aboriginal
   peoples than infants with CDH. Teen maternal age, smoking, and illicit
   drug use, are associated with GS.
   Mothers of infants with GS are younger, more likely to smoke and come
   from socially disadvantaged communities with higher proportions of
   aboriginal peoples but lower levels of air pollution compared to mothers
   of CDH infants. Identification of maternal risks provides direction for
   prenatal screening and public health interventions.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{The western Caribbean Basin is notable for its tectonic stability. It
   has experienced no historical earthquakes or the tsunami that sometimes
   accompany them. This paper describes a single, wedge-shaped,
   boulder-covered, coastal berm on the Yucatan coast of Mexico that
   stretches unbroken for 50 km across a coastal segment characterized by
   rocky headlands that alternate with crescent beaches. The remainder of
   the 350 km of Yucatan coast consists mostly of mangrove that extends 1
   to 30 km inland, often behind long, sandy beaches. On the headlands, the
   surface of the berm is densely paved with boulders large boulders on its
   seaward face and smaller boulders and cobbles on its gently sloping
   inland surface. The top of the berm reaches an elevation >4 m, above the
   reach of all but the largest modern storm waves. Berm sediments on the
   headlands consist of two distinct layers of unbedded coarse sand with
   numerous randomly distributed boulders and cobbles in the lower layer
   and a crudely textured gravel and sand layer above. At first glance the
   two layers appear to be separated by 20 cm of white sand above a thin,
   discontinuous zone of dark, greyish sand that contains isolated balls
   and smears of black organic material, apparently derived from a soil, or
   possibly leaf litter. The berm and its associated boulders track the
   modern coastal morphology in precise detail as it follows the form of
   modern headlands, bays, and transcoastal channels, indicating that
   deposition took place after development of the present coast. The berm
   sediments record two or three large waves, depending on whether the wave
   that deposited the boulder pavement is regarded as part of the second
   wave or as a separate wave. Radiocarbon dating indicates that at least
   one wave struck the coast approximately 1500 years before present.
   Minimum wave run-up exceeds 4 m above present sea level, and inland
   inundation reached 400 m along bays and transcoastal channels. The
   position and elevation of the berm, its lack of well-developed internal
   bedding, the paving of the berm surface by thousands of boulders, and
   its 400-m extent inland along channels and bays are features commonly
   associated with tsunami. However, some recent studies conclude that all
   of the features listed also can be produced by mega-hurricanes. Placed
   in the context of our literature search of the recent history of
   hurricanes and tsunami in the Caribbean Basin, we conclude that the
   single berm on the Yucatan coast represents an anomalous event for this
   area and that the berm sediments bear a strong similarity to
   descriptions of sediments from some historical tsunami and are unlike
   sedimentary features associated with historical hurricanes.}},

   menage a trois}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Proteins targeting actin filament barbed ends play a pivotal role in
   motile processes. While formins enhance filament assembly, capping
   protein (CP) blocks polymerization. On their own, they both bind barbed
   ends with high affinity and very slow dissociation. Their barbed-end
   binding is thought to be mutually exclusive. CP has recently been shown
   to be present in filopodia and controls their morphology and dynamics.
   Here we explore how CP and formins may functionally coregulate filament
   barbed-end assembly. We show, using kinetic analysis of individual
   filaments by microfluidics-assisted fluorescence microscopy, that CP and
   mDia1 formin are able to simultaneously bind barbed ends. This is
   further confirmed using single-molecule imaging. Their mutually weakened
   binding enables rapid displacement of one by the other. We show that
   formin FMNL2 behaves similarly, thus suggesting that this is a general
   property of formins. Implications in filopodia regulation and barbed-end
   structural regulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares three contract forms, including short-term contract
   with price discrimination, short-term contract without price
   discrimination, and long-term contract with price commitment for

   long-term contract generates the largest profit for firms. Moreover, we
   find that switching costs make the market more competitive when
   consumers have changed preferences, and the higher the switching costs,
   the more competitive. Our theory combines linear-city duopoly and
   switching-cost model and the results are consistent with literature, for
   example price commitment is valuable. Our findings shed light on the
   practice of different forms of dynamic pricing in various industries

Abstract = {{Pericardial tuberculosis (TB) is associated with high therapy failure
   and high mortality rates. Antibiotics have to penetrate to site of
   infection at sufficient non-protein bound concentrations, and then enter
   bacteria to inhibit intracellular biochemical processes. The antibiotic
   concentrations achieved in pericardial fluid in TB pericarditis have
   never been measured before. We recruited two cohorts of patients with TB
   pericarditis, and left a pigtail catheter in-situ for serial drug
   concentration measurements over 24 h. Altogether, 704 drug
   concentrations were comodeled for pharmacokinetic analyses. The drug
   concentrations achieved in pericardial fluid were compared to the
   minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinical Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis isolates. The total rifampicin concentration
   pericardial-to-serum ratios in 16 paired samples were 0.19 +/- 0.33. The
   protein concentrations of the pericardial fluid in TB pericarditis were
   observed to be as high as in plasma. The non-protein bound rifampicin
   concentrations in pericardial fluid were 4-fold lower than rifampicin
   MICs in the pilot study, and the peak concentration was 0.125 versus
   0.208 mg/L in the second (p = 0.001). The rifampicin clearance from
   pericardial fluid was 9.45 L/h versus 7.82 L/h in plasma (p = 0.002).
   Ethambutol peak concentrations had a pericardial-to-plasma ratio of 0.55
   +/- 0.22; free ethambutol peak concentrations were 2.30-lower than MICs
   (p < 0.001). The pericardial fluid pH was 7.34. The median pyrazinamide
   peak concentrations were 42.93mg/L versus a median MIC of 800mg/L at pH
   7.34 (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between isoniazid
   pericardial fluid and plasma concentrations, and isoniazid peak
   concentrations were above MIC. This is the first study to measure
   anti-TB drug concentrations, pH and protein in the pericardial TB fluid.
   Pericardial concentrations of the key sterilizing drugs for TB were
   below MIC, which could contribute to poor outcomes. A new regimen that
   overcomes these limitations might need to be crafted. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Determination of Critical Shear Stresses for Erosion and Deposition

Abstract = {{Accurate determination of the critical shear stress associated with the
   erosion and deposition of sediments is an important component of
   numerical models used to predict and quantify sediment behavior and
   transport across intertidal flats. In this study, water depth, wave
   parameters, near-bed turbulent velocity, suspended sediment
   concentration (SSC), and intratidal bed-level changes were measured to
   determine the erosion (tau(ce)) and deposition (tau(cd)) thresholds of
   sediments on an intertidal mudflat at Jiangsu, China. Based on
   integrated field measurements of bed-level changes and hydrodynamics,
   the bed shear stresses of currents (tau(c)), waves (tau(w)), and
   combined current-wave action (tau(cw)) were calculated, and the critical
   shear stress required for erosion (tau(ce) = 0.14 N/m(2)) and deposition
   (tau(cd) = 0.08 N/m(2)) of these sediments was determined. Both values
   are in agreement with an estimate of tau(ce) (0.13 N/m(2)) that was
   based on water content and tau(cd) values calculated by previous works,
   indicating that the value of tau(ce) estimated for these sediments is
   controlled primarily by the water content of the sediments. During field
   measurements, deposition occurred (tau(cw) < tau(cd)) when current
   action exceeded wave energy (tau(c) > tau(w)) during calm weather,
   whereas erosion occurred (tau(cw) > tau(ce)) when wave action increased
   dramatically during rough weather. Our field data showed that high
   current velocities lead to low tau(c), possibly because high SSC reduced
   the drag coefficient, which is variable during a tide, and further
   caused low tau(c) under high current velocities. Additionally, bedforms
   characteristic of intertidal mudflat (e.g., gullies, small creeks,
   ripples, or saltmarsh) has a significant influence on the drag
   coefficient of the bed. These observations suggest that the bed level
   responds strongly to changing hydrodynamic conditions, and also that
   waves are of great importance to erosion. This study demonstrates that
   the in situ determination of the parameters that control erosion and
   deposition is a useful approach to obtaining values of tau(ce) and
   tau(cd), which provide the basis for a mechanistic understanding of the
   morphological evolution and development of predictive sediment transport
   and erodibility models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the bronze chickens unearthed in southwestern
   China dating back to the time from the Shang to the Han Dynasties. Among
   them, one bronze rooster from the pit No. 2 at the Sanxingdui Site looks
   similar to domestic chicken in appearance. Since it was unearthed
   together with bronze birds symbolizing the Sun, we may deduce that the
   bronze rooster probably symbolizes an idea that rooster crows at
   sunrise. In addition, most other bronze chickens unearthed in
   southwestern China are used as staff-head. This pattern perhaps is
   related to the fact that rooster crows and can be used for timing. The
   author concludes that the study of these bronze chickens, including
   their typology and archaeological background within the context of the
   biological habits of relevant animals as well as corresponding cultural
   phenomena, can to a certain extent help us identify the species of such
   animal-shaped artifacts and further supplement the identification
   criteria of domesticated animals.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines whether background music gives young Japanese adults

   participated in the experiment. The two conditions were as follows: the
   with-music' condition, where BGM was played during a 20-minute
   conversation, and the no-music' condition, where BGM was absent. The
   participants were divided into eight small groups, consisting of two
   males and two females each. Four other students (two males and two
   females) participated in pairs (two couples) in each group as the target
   conversation partners (called guests' here). The participants rated
   their impressions of the guests of the opposite sex before and after the
   conversation. The guests were instructed to keep the conversation smooth
   and amicable. The results showed that irrespective of the presence of
   background music, face-to-face conversation between young males and
   females led to a change in their impression of their partner and created
   intimacy between them. The biggest difference between the no-music and

Abstract = {{Predicting the occurrence and timing of adverse pregnancy events such as
   preterm birth is an important analytical challenge in obstetrical
   practice. Developing statistical approaches that can be used to assess
   the risk and timing of these adverse events will provide clinicians with
   tools for individualized risk assessment that account for a woman's
   prior pregnancy history. Often adverse pregnancy outcomes are subject to
   competing events; for example, interest may focus on the occurrence of
   pre-eclampsia-related preterm birth, where preterm birth for other
   reasons may serve as a competing event. We propose modelling the type
   and timing of adverse outcomes in repeated pregnancies. We formulate a
   joint model, where types of adverse outcomes across repeated pregnancies
   are modelled by using a polychotomous logistic regression model with
   random effects, and gestational ages at delivery are modelled
   conditionally on the types of adverse outcome. The correlation between
   gestational ages conditional on the adverse pregnancies is modelled by
   the semiparametric normal copula function. We present a two-stage
   estimation method and develop the asymptotic theory for the estimators
   proposed. The model and estimation procedure proposed are applied to the
   National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consecutive
   pregnancies study data and evaluated by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) structure can include

   cyclic loads. The main contribution of this work focuses on the
   identification and physical interpretation of complex failure mechanisms
   in harness satin fabric. For this purpose a detailed fractographic
   analysis was carried out to qualitatively assess the surface fractures
   in these type of laminates. Results obtained for cyclic loaded CLS
   specimens were compared to analytical closed form solutions available in

Abstract = {{A 63-year-old man dropped a metal chunk onto his left foot during his
   work and suffered a crush injury of the left forefoot. He underwent
   Chopart's amputation followed by stump coverage with sole skin at the
   orthopedic department on the same day. He was referred to our department
   for reconstruction because of poor vascularization and subsequent
   necrosis of tissue at the stump. After the necrotic tissue was debrided,
   exposure of the talus bone was noted. An artificial dermis was then
   applied to the stump wound, followed by local negative pressure wound
   therapy. After 3 weeks, the generation of a strong dermis-like tissue
   was observed at the site of artificial dermis grafting. We then
   performed flow-through free anterolateral thigh flap grafting to
   reconstruct the stump wound. This procedure involved suturing of the
   peroneal muscle group and tibialis anterior muscle, which were cut off
   during Chopart's amputation, and suturing the soft tissue surrounding
   the calcaneus firmly to the fascia lata of the anterolateral thigh flap,
   followed by suturing of the flap to the skin defect of the left foot.
   There were neither postoperative complications, such as skin ulcer and
   equinus/varus deformity, nor need for secondary repair of the grafted
   flap, so the patient was able to smoothly enter a rehabilitation program
   including gait training. The current reconstruction technique for the
   tissue defect following Chopart's amputation, consisting of artificial
   dermis grafting, negative pressure wound therapy, and flow-through free
   anterolateral thigh flap grafting, enabled safe and smooth gait
   rehabilitation with a forefoot prosthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation from a tetrahedral four-component system to an
   XYZ-orthogonal coordinate axis system has been solved using the geometry
   of a tetrahedron. If a four component mixing ratio is described as t, l,
   r, and f (here, t + l + r + f = 1), the transforming equations can be
   written as
   x = (r + 1 - l)/2
   y = root 3/2 t + root 3/6 f
   and
   z = root 6/3 f
   A tetrahedral plot diagram can be easily constructed using the
   algorithms described in this paper. We present an implementation of
   these algorithms in a custom-designed Microsoft Excel spreadsheet,
   including adjustable viewing angles for the tetrahedral plot. This will
   be of general utility for petrological or mineralogical studies of
   quaternary systems.}},

Title = {{Photo-Fries rearrangement of phenyl salicylate studied by
   two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{131-135}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Photo-Fries rearrangement of phenyl salicylate was examined by real-time
   infrared (IR) monitoring in conjunction with density functional theory
   (DFT) calculation. Changes in the spectral features were readily
   captured during the photo-induced chemical reaction of the phenyl
   salicylate by means of two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy.
   The obvious variations of spectral intensities due to the production of
   2,2'-dihydroxybenzophenone and 2,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone are clearly
   identified to provide in-depth understanding to the photo-Fries
   rearrangement. Namely, when exposed to UV-irradiation, the majority of
   the phenyl salicylate undergoes photothermal degradation. Further
   irradiation to the rest of the phenyl salicylate then results in the
   production of 2,2'-dihydroxybenzophenone followed by the development
   2,4'-dihydroxybenzo-phenome products. Such delay in the production of
   2,4'-dihydroxybenzo-phenome implies the presence of some more pathways,
   which makes its reaction efficiency lower than that of
   2,2'-dihydroxybenzophenone. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of services within technology-based business in terms of
   customer value is increasingly well-understood by manufacturing
   companies. Manufacturing companies are trying to restructure their
   business models by adding the concept of service that is required to
   make a process of value co-creation with customers. Human resources are
   a core factor in the implementation of this notion in the practical
   field. In a technology-based business, technical personnel must have not
   only technology-oriented thinking but also service-oriented thinking in
   order to generate new value propositions. In this work, we propose an
   approach to transform the way of thinking and support knowledge
   co-creation with others with a focus on new corporate value
   propositions. We combined a service innovation chart with a business
   model thinking methodology to create a new approach intended for the
   development of technology and service thinking within technical
   personnel. Our objective is to help manufacturing companies create a
   service climate and clarify the knowledge co-creation process. We
   conducted action research by introducing our approach to 25 technical
   personnel employed by a Japanese monitor maker and obtained data
   including feedback on its usability and the impact on corporate business
   models. The findings of this study will help personnel to generate
   technology and service-based innovation concepts, thereby promoting
   servitization in technology-based companies.(C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Cerium-doped cadmium zinc sulfide nanoparticles (CdZnS:Ce) were
   synthesized by chemical bath deposition method with three different
   concentrations of cerium (1.2, 2.5 and 3.84 mol\%). X-ray diffraction
   pattern revealed the formation of cadmium zinc sulfide nanoparticles
   with cubic and hexagonal structure. It was observed that the presence of
   ceria did not alter the structure of CdZnS. Average crystallite size was
   measured from X-ray diffraction data by using Scherrer's formula. From
   the study of absorption spectra, band-to-band absorption was obtained at
   455 and 470 nm, respectively, for the Ce-doped (2.5 and 3.84 mol\%)
   CdZnS nanoparticles. Energy band gap for undoped and Ce-doped CdZnS
   varied from 3.45 to 3.15 eV with error +/-0.05 eV. The presence of
   cerium was confirmed by energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays. The effect
   of dopant concentration on the photoluminescence intensity was also
   studied. The photoluminescence emission peak was observed at 520, 540
   and 560 nm, respectively, for the Ce-doped (1.2, 2.5 and 3.84 mol\%)
   CdZnS nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence analysis
   demonstrated that the Ce3+ ions uniformly substituted Cd2+ sites or
   interstitial sites in CdZnS lattice, which influenced the optical
   properties. An increase in the concentration of cerium shifted the
   UV-Vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence emission spectra toward
   the higher wavelength side. Particle size and the crystallinity of
   CdZnS:Ce nanoparticles were confirmed through transmission electron
   microscopy and selected area electron diffraction patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The eruption of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (SLIP) at the
   Permo-Triassic boundary was synchronous with environmental degradation
   and the largest known mass extinction in the geological record. The
   volatile emissions associated with these eruptions have been linked to
   the environmental change yet we understand little of their source and
   magnitude and how they varied with time. There are a number of possible
   sources for the volatiles that were emitted during the eruptions: the
   mantle (including metasomatized lithosphere), volatile-rich sediments
   (through metamorphism or direct assimilation) and the crustal basement.
   To assess the relative importance of these sources (with the exception
   of the metamorphic outgassing source), we have conducted a geochemical
   study of melt inclusions hosted by clinopyroxene in Siberian Traps
   low-Ti tholeiitic lavas and sills of the Khakanchansky, Ayansky and
   Khonnamakitsky Formations. The magmas were not emplaced into or erupted
   onto evaporite deposits, in contrast to samples studied previously. The
   trace element compositions of the melt inclusions are highly variable
   compared with the uniform whole-rocks, exhibiting a wide range of La/Yb
   ratios from 0.7 to 9.5. The melt geochemistry is consistent with
   relatively large degrees of partial melting of a dominantly peridotite
   mantle source. A negative Nb anomaly indicates a degree of crustal
   contamination, but there is no evidence for contamination by
   volatile-rich evaporites. Enrichment of some of the melts in large ion
   lithophile elements (Ba, Sr) indicates their interaction with a fluid.
   We suggest that, consistent with the observed depletion in other
   incompatible trace elements in the melt inclusions, the volatile
   concentrations in the melts were relatively low, and that subsequently
   the melts underwent variable degrees of degassing in the crust. Overall,
   the melts are more volatile-poor than those reported previously from the
   SLIP and were erupted after the first ``pulse{''} of more volatile-rich
   magmas described by Sobolev et al. (2015). These volatile-poor magmas
   may have been widespread across the region during the Siberian Traps
   eruptions once a pyroxenite component in the mantle source had been
   exhausted.}},

Abstract = {{One of the modern trends of chromatography is the miniaturization of the
   analytical equipment. A successful way to carry out miniaturization is
   to use planar technologies based on methods developed for the creation
   of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The most important part of any
   chromatographic system is a column, which determines both the quality
   and the separation time of the analyzed mixture. The review considers
   the methods of the deposition of stationary phases (SP) on the planar
   capillary column for gas chromatography. These methods are based on
   traditional methods for capillary gas chromatography, as well as
   borrowed from those used in planar technologies. The methods of
   stationary phase deposition for gas-liquid and gas-solid chromatography
   are described; also, a comparison of the prepared columns based on their
   chromatographic parameters is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Disruptions in circadian rhythms and dopaminergic activity are involved
   in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, though their interaction
   remains unclear. Moreover, a lack of animal models that display
   spontaneous cycling between mood states has hindered our mechanistic
   understanding of mood switching. Here, we find that mice with a mutation
   in the circadian Clock gene (Clock Delta 19) exhibit rapid mood-cycling,
   with a profound manic-like phenotype emerging during the day following a
   period of euthymia at night. Mood-cycling coincides with abnormal
   daytime spikes in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic activity,
   tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and dopamine synthesis. To determine
   the significance of daytime increases in VTA dopamine activity to manic
   behaviors, we developed a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm that
   produces a sustained increase in dopamine neuronal activity and find
   that this induces a manic-like behavioral state. Time-dependent
   dampening of TH activity during the day reverses manic-related behaviors
   in Clock Delta 19 mice. Finally, we show that CLOCK acts as a negative
   regulator of TH transcription, revealing a novel molecular mechanism
   underlying cyclic changes in mood-related behavior. Taken together,
   these studies have identified a mechanistic connection between circadian
   gene disruption and the precipitation of manic episodes in bipolar
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of guarding the prisoners of war in the People's
   Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and in the Ministry of Internal
   Affairs (MVD) camps of the USSR in the war and post-war years underwent
   essential changes. If at the beginning of the war the convoy troops
   escort was allocated on guarding the soldiers of the enemy at the rate
   of 1 convoy for 8 prisoners of war, in 1943 it was impossible to
   allocate escort at this rate because of the mass arrival of prisoners of
   war in People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs camps. Escort number
   for guarding the contingent at works was determined at the rate of 1
   convoy for 15 prisoners of war, in 1944 - already for 25 prisoners. The
   insufficient organization of guarding, proximity of a front line, strong
   belief of the German soldiers in a victory of Wehrmacht led to escapes.
   In 1943 the share of prisoners of war that made escape was the highest
   during all years of prisoners staying in the USSR and made 0,4\% of
   their total number in the NKVD camps in the end of the year. In 1945
   over 100 new camps for the prisoners of war consisting of more than 1600
   camp subdivisions were organized in the USSR. During this organizational
   period the share of the prisoners of war who made escape grew a little.
   However, almost all escapes were unsuccessful. In 1946 only 29 escaped
   prisoners out of 5761 weren't caught. During the post-war period the
   auxiliary teams formed of the prisoners of war started playing the
   increasing value for guarding the camps. The number of the convoy troops
   was annually reduced. Help to the management of camps in 1947 in a
   capture of the escaped prisoners of war was given by crews of tens of
   thousands of people from the local population. In the conditions of
   reducing the convoy troops the regime camp and camp offices for the
   prisoners who made earlier escape with the strengthened guard were
   created to prevent the growth of escapes. In 1949 in the not-regime
   camps the teams of self-guarding consisted of the checked prisoners of
   war (anti-fascists) were entered. The created system of guarding the
   NKVD-MVD camps was reliable. In 1943-1948 only 350 prisoners of war out
   of 11403 who made escape were not caught.}},

Abstract = {{Zonation patterns of riparian vegetation have been sampled and described
   in mountain streams in two catchments in the Hottentots-Holland
   Mountains, Western Cape, South Africa. Six main vegetation types that
   differ in structure and species composition, are dominant along these
   river banks: Aquatic vegetation, Wetbanks, Palmiet, Scrub, Forest and
   Shrubland (Fynbos). The study aims to correlate the vegetation patterns
   to flooding patterns, in particular the inundation frequency and stream
   power. A problem arises: because these catchments are ungauged, like
   most mountain catchments, with the only weirs at the downstream end of
   the catchment. Discharge data at the weirs are extrapolated to the sites
   upstream by multiplication with a factor based on the size of the
   subcatchment that drains through a sample site. In this way, recurrence
   intervals for floods in mountain streams are derived. Discharges at
   sites are also calculated using bed roughness (Manning's n) and slope in
   straight sections with uniform flow conditions. Stream power is derived
   from the discharges calculated in this manner. The combination of stream
   power and recurrence intervals explains the occurrence of most
   vegetation types occurring on the banks, except for one type:
   Afromontane Forest. This type is probably more dependent on other
   factors, such as protection from fire and the depth of the groundwater
   table.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Walking is one of the most commonly recommended activities
   for sedentary individuals. When performed at the correct intensity, it
   can provide cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, and other benefits
   by providing a training effect in addition to reducing the risk of death
   from cardiovascular diseases and other chronic health conditions.
   Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to assess whether
   individuals who practiced regular unsupervised walking carry out the
   activity safely and with sufficient effort intensity parameters to have
   a positive physiological (training) effect. The secondary objective was
   to compare the training heart rate (HR) and the stability of the HR
   within the ideal range of training between the sexes. Method:
   Individuals were selected from walking tracks within the city of Belo
   Horizonte, Brazil. The study included subjects from 40 to 60 years of
   age who had practiced walking for at least two months prior to the
   study, walking at least three times a week. Individuals who agreed to
   participate in the survey were asked to walk 15 minutes at their usual
   pace with their HR measured every 5 minutes using a heart rate monitor.
   Their average walking HR was compared to the average training HR based
   on the formula: (220 - age) x 70 to 80\% that would result in a positive
   physiological training effect. Results: Of the 142 individuals
   evaluated, 25.4\% achieved the average training HR. This result was
   significantly lower than those who did not achieve the average training
   HR while walking (p=0.002). There were significant differences between
   men and women who had reached the training HR (p=0.0001). Conclusion:
   The authors found that individuals who walk regularly performed outside
   the range of the ideal HR intensity that would cause a positive
   physiological effect and therefore would probably not achieve a
   beneficial training effect while walking.}},

Volume = {{226}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Lettuce plants were exposed to different toxic levels of arsenic (As) to
   induce an oxidative stress response, and the role of nitric oxide (NO)
   (provided as sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) as an attenuating agent of this
   stress condition was evaluated. Plants were treated with 50 mu M of As
   with or without 100 mu M SNP added to the nutrient solution. The
   hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde concentrations
   and enzymatic activities were measured. The increase in As concentration
   detected in the leaves was followed by a significant increase in H2O2
   and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. However, the presence of SPN
   promoted a reduction in the concentration of these oxidative agents and
   also reduced the translocation of As to the shoots. The enzymatic
   activities in the plants exposed to As were increased, which indicates
   the active participation of these enzymes in the reduction of oxidative
   stress induced by the metalloid. In the plants exposed to As and SNP,
   the enzymatic activities were not so high; this result was possibly
   related to the direct action of NO in scavenging the generated toxic
   metabolites and with the reduction in the translocation of the pollutant
   to the shoots. Lettuce and leaves of other vegetables are usually
   ingested, and this study shows an alternative to avoid human
   contamination with As.}},

Abstract = {{A penetrating X-ray imaging technology is applied to study the soil
   ionization under surge current, by which grayscale images are obtained.
   Based on soil breakdown mechanism, there are series of discharge
   channels generating in the soil. By comparing the discharge time and
   imaging time, the filamentary paths, which can be directly observed in
   these grayscale images, are determined to be discharge air channels. The
   principle and process of imaging are introduced in detail in this paper.
   According to the Beer-Lambert law, the relationship between grayscale
   value and equivalent air thickness of any points in the discharge
   channel area has been proposed. Image processing technology is used to
   dispose the grayscale images to make them more distinct for analysis
   without losing the accurate information of the original images by
   maintaining their grayscale value percentage. Analyses of experimental
   imaging results are also presented, and effects of factors, such as
   configuration of grounding electrode and amplitude of surge current, are
   considered on the distribution of discharge channels as well. In
   addition, soil residual resistivity of discharge area was calculated by
   a finite-element method, according to experiment parameters and 3-D
   diagram of discharge area.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a defect concentration-modified top electrode on the
   bipolar resistance switching of transparent Al-doped ZnO/ZnO/ITO
   {[}AZO(TE)/ZnO/ITO(BE)] devices was investigated. Different oxygen
   vacancy concentrations in the top electrode, Al-doped ZnO, can be simply
   controlled by modulating the sputtering working pressure condition from
   1.2 to 12 mTorr. The oxygen vacancy concentration between AZO and ZnO
   may trigger oxygen diffusion at the interface and affect the switching
   characteristic. High oxygen release from a ZnO resistive layer caused by
   excessive oxygen vacancy concentration at the top electrode is
   responsible for reducing the memory window as a result of reduced oxygen
   available to rupture the filament. Top electrode based on lower oxygen
   vacancy concentration has a higher memory window and an asymmetric
   resistive switching characteristic. However, all set of devices have
   excellent endurance of more than 10(4) cycles. This study showed that an
   Al-doped ZnO top electrode helps not only to achieve a transparent
   device but also to enhance memory properties by providing a suitable
   oxygen vacancy concentration.}},

Title = {{A life-cycle perspective on automotive fuel cells}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{884-896}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The production and end-of-life (EoL) processes for current and future
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for road passenger
   vehicle applications were analysed and quantified in the form of life
   cycle inventories. The current PEMFC technology is characterised by
   highly sensitive operating conditions and a high system mass. For each
   core component of PEMFC there are a range of materials under development
   and the research aimed to identify those considered realistic for a 2020
   future scenario and according to commercial goals of achieving higher
   performance, increased power density, greater stability and a marked
   reduction of costs. End-of-life scenarios were developed in
   consideration of the materials at the focus of recovery efforts.
   The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) addressed the production and EoL
   of the fuel cell systems with inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to
   assess influences on the results from the key fuel cell parameters. The
   second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health
   burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with
   comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced
   to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission
   standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel
   cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the
   indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the
   fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far
   greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results
   show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern
   ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only
   be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources.
   However, even such ``clean{''} hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a
   reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle
   perspective within the time frame considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cartographic roadmaps used for navigating from A to B provide a strong
   metaphor for innovation roadmaps used at firms for navigating from the
   present to the future. Now ready to move beyond this metaphorthe pace
   and proliferation of knowledge on innovation roadmapping have reached a
   point at which it would be useful to lay out some groundwork for
   extended theorizing and research in this area. This paper contributes
   here by reporting on a qualitative inductive research based on
   documented practitioners' insights. To better understand the phenomenon
   of innovation roadmapping (what it is and what it is not) and its impact
   on innovation performance, this study builds concepts in the context of
   strategic innovation management theory. Through a systematic analysis of
   the qualitative data extracted from 12 cases selected from the extant
   literature, this research found five concepts with common ground in
   these cases and built a framework in which innovation roadmapping is
   established by (1) a strategy of time pacing, (2) synchronizing
   dialogues, and (3) mapping innovation elements to a timeline.
   Furthermore, the systematic analysis of the documented practitioners'
   insights indicates that roadmapping affects either the innovation
   performance of (4) competitive timing or (5) industry synergy. Overall,
   this leads to an initial formulation of theory with this conceptual
   framework and six related propositions. The key insights for innovation
   managers in industrial firms are that, in striving for competitive
   timing or industry synergy, roadmapping provides a means to achieve
   these objectives and, in deploying roadmapping in the organization,
   dialogue and pacing are critically important.}},

Abstract = {{Carcinomas of the mandible may require resection of a segment of bone
   (continuity defect), partial removal of bone (discontinuity defect),
   tongue, and floor of the mouth and muscle attachments. Patients
   undergoing such treatment suffer from facial disfigurement, loss of
   muscle function, loss of neuromuscular coordination resulting in
   inability to masticate and swallow acceptably. Surgical reconstruction
   may not always be possible because of high reoccurrence rate, inability
   of the patient to cope with another surgery etc. The treatment of choice
   in non surgical cases is prosthetic rehabilitation using guiding flange
   prosthesis. This article describes the management of a patient who had
   undergone hemimandibulectomy and was not willing for a surgical
   reconstruction. Interim maxillary ramp prosthesis was given to the
   patient 15 days postoperatively followed by definitive guiding flange
   prosthesis for two years after which the patient was able to occlude in
   centric occlusal position without any aid.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of brain drain, gain and circulation in the Indian context
   presents a fruitful sociological and policy relevant experience to
   understand the phenomena as it unfolded over many decades. As this essay
   demonstrates, 1960s to 1980s emerged as the phase of brain drain. The
   country witnessed considerable economic growth and development of S\&T
   infrastructure coupled with the emergence of science community and
   intellectual climate in the 1990s. The development reversed the process
   of brain drain. A historical perspective is adopted which presents ample
   data and empirical evidence to map the evolution and operation of three
   phases. Towards mapping the last phase of brain circulation, it is shown
   that the country embarked on the development of ICT software sector and
   become globally relevant and competitive. In an unexpected way the
   growth and dynamics of this high technology service oriented sector has
   unravelled the process of brain drain transforming it into brain

Abstract = {{Purpose: Semilunar coronally advanced flap (SCAF) and its modifications
   or adjuncts have been proposed in the literature for root coverage. Low
   level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to enhance wound healing. The
   aim of this split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was to
   assess the effects of LLLT application with respect to root coverage
   after SCAF procedure for the treatment of human maxillary multiple
   adjacent facial gingival recessions.
   Materials and Methods: Ten subjects with bilateral multiple adjacent
   maxillary facial gingival recession defects (Miller I and II) were
   included in this study (20 in test, 20 in control group). A diode laser
   (810 nm) at 0.3 watts was applied to test sites during and 1 week after
   surgery for 10 seconds. Comparisons of the surgical sites were made with
   clinical measurements.
   Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between
   test and control sites in the change in gingival recession depth,
   gingival recession width, clinical attachment level, and width of the
   keratinized tissue measurements after 6 months (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p
   = 0.006, and p =< 0.001, respectively). The test group presented
   significantly greater complete root coverage (N = 18/20, 90\%) compared
   with the control group (N = 6/20, 30\%) at 6 months post-operatively.
   Conclusion: Within the confines of this study, the results depicted that
   a Low Level Laser Technique application may enhance the predictability
   of SCAF procedure. Further long-term studies with more sample sizes are
   needed for a stronger evidence base.}},

   X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) were utilized to investigate the
   different structural parameters and elemental composition. Incorporation
   of Ho3+ ions increased the dc resistivity while a decrease in the
   saturation magnetization (M-s), 66.68-57.08 emu/g, followed by decrease
   in Curie temperature (766.83-758.15 K), exchange integral (J), and
   anisotropy was observed. The obtained values of M-s. were found to be
   very high as compared to the values reported in the bulk form. The
   dielectric constant (epsilon') and dielectric loss tangent (tan delta)
   were investigated as a function of frequency and the behavior is
   explained on the basis of Maxwell-Wagner model and Koop's theory.
   Additionally, a maiden attempt was made to explore the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a stochastic model for glandular structures in
   histology images of tissue slides stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin,
   choosing colon tissue as an example. The proposed Random Polygons Model
   (RPM) treats each glandular structure in an image as a polygon made of a
   random number of vertices, where the vertices represent approximate
   locations of epithelial nuclei. We formulate the RPM as a Bayesian
   inference problem by defining a prior for spatial connectivity and
   arrangement of neighboring epithelial nuclei and a likelihood for the
   presence of a glandular structure. The inference is made via a
   Reversible-Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. To the best of our
   knowledge, all existing published algorithms for gland segmentation are
   designed to mainly work on healthy samples, adenomas, and low grade
   adenocarcinomas. One of them has been demonstrated to work on
   intermediate grade adenocarcinomas at its best. Our experimental results
   show that the RPM yields favorable results, both quantitatively and
   qualitatively, for extraction of glandular structures in histology
   images of normal human colon tissues as well as benign and cancerous
   tissues, excluding undifferentiated carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to study the effect of depth of phase change
   material over the absorber surface of an integrated collector-storage
   type flat plate solar water heater. Flat plate solar water heaters are
   extensively used all over the world to utilize the natural source of
   solar energy. In order to utilize the solar energy during off-sunshine
   hours, it is inevitable to store and retain solar thermal energy as long
   as possible. Here, phase change material is not used for heat storage,
   but to minimize losses during day and night time only. The depth of
   phase change material over a fixed depth of water in a solar thermal
   collector is an important geometric parameter that influences the
   maximum temperature rise during peak solar irradiation and hence the
   losses. From the results of the studies for different masses of paraffin
   wax phase change material layers, the optimum depth corresponding to the
   maximum heat gain till evening is found to be 2 mm, and the heat
   retention till the next day morning is found to be 4 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DCs) are key in connecting innate and adaptive
   immunity. Their potential in inducing specific immune responses has made
   them interesting targets for immunotherapeutic approaches. Our research
   group was the first to exploit the naturally occurring myeloid DCs
   (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in therapeutic vaccination trials
   against melanoma. To develop primary DC subsets as an optimal vaccine,
   the identification of a clinically applicable adjuvant activating both
   subsets is required. Although the expression of pathogen recognition
   receptors differs distinctly between the DC subsets, both pDCs and mDCs
   can respond to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) via Toll-like receptors 7 and
   8, respectively. Since ssRNA is easily degraded by RNases, we stabilized
   anionic RNA by complexing it with the positively charged protein
   protamine. This leads to the formation of protamine-RNA complexes with
   varying features depending on ionic content. We subsequently
   investigated the immunostimulatory effect of complexes that formed
   various salt concentrations on purified DC subsets. Both mDCs and pDCs
   upregulated maturation markers and produced pro-inflammatory cytokines
   in a dose-dependent way to the protamine-RNA complexes. This was
   dependent on endosomal acidification and correlated partly with the
   uptake of protamine-RNA complexes. Furthermore, both DC subsets induced
   T cell proliferation and IFN gamma secretion in a beneficial ratio to
   IL-10. These results indicate that protamine-RNA complexes can be used
   to stimulate human mDC and pDC ex vivo for use in immunotherapeutic
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{How does feasibility of efficient repeated trade depend on the features
   of the environment such as persistence of values, private information
   about their evolution, or trading frequency? We derive a necessary and
   sufficient condition for efficient, unsubsidized, and voluntary trade,
   which implies that efficient contracting requires sufficient congruence
   of expectations. This translates to bounds on persistence of values and
   on private information about their evolution, and distinguishes
   increasing patience from more frequent interaction; the latter need not
   facilitate efficiency even when the former does. We also discuss
   second-best mechanisms and extend the characterization to general
   dynamic collective choice problems.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Bicycle spoke injury (BSI) mostly occurs in
   children as a result of entrapment of the leg in the bicycle spokes. No
   guideline or protocol exists that defines what type of radiography is
   indicated to diagnose or rule out a fracture commonly associated with
   these injuries. The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the type of
   radiographs that are obtained in children with BSI, (2) to assess in
   which anatomical regions fractures occur and (3) to evaluate on which
   radiographs a fracture can be detected in children with BSI.
   Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed in
   paediatric patients presenting at the Emergency Department (ED) of a
   university hospital with a paediatric surgery department between June
   2008 and December 2013.
   Results: In 99 of the 320 children (31.4\%) evaluated with radiography
   following BSI a fracture was diagnosed. In almost two third of the
   patients (63\%) radiographic imaging of two or more anatomical regions
   was performed. In 98 children (99\%) the fracture was located at the
   distal tibia or fibula. All fractures were diagnosed on a radiograph of
   the ankle or lower leg (including the ankle region). No fractures of the
   foot were diagnosed.
   Conclusion: We suggest that in children with a clinical suspicion of a
   fracture at the ankle region, in which no fracture is seen at the
   radiograph of the ankle, no additional radiographs are necessary. (C)

Abstract = {{The levamisole-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor present at

   subunits, with the exact composition varying between species. We tested
   the ability of two well-conserved nicotinic receptor subunits, UNC-38

   levamisole-resistance and locomotion defects of Caenorhabditis elegans
   strains with null deletion mutations in the unc-38 and unc-29 genes. The
   parasite cDNA5 were cloned downstream of the relevant C. elegans
   promoters and introduced into the mutant strains via biolistic
   transformation. The UNC-38 subunit of H. contortus was able to
   completely rescue both the locomotion defects and levamisole resistance
   of the null deletion mutant VC2937 (ok2896), but no C elegans expressing
   the A. suum UNC-38 could be detected. The H. contortus UNC-29.1 subunit
   partially rescued the levamisole resistance of a C. elegans null
   mutation in unc-29 VC1944 (ok2450), but did cause increased motility in
   a thrashing assay. In contrast, only a single line of worms containing
   the A. suum UNC-29 subunit showed a partial rescue of levamisole

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{80-95}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The claim that ethnic diversity within the living environment would
   hamper bonding and bridging social capital has been studied extensively,
   producing highly inconsistent findings. We studied whether ethnic
   diversity effects depend on the geographic scale at which ethnic
   diversity is measured. We examined ethnic diversity effects on intra-
   and inter-ethnic contacts in the neighborhood, respectively on
   opposition to ethnic in- and out-group neighbors. Hypotheses were
   derived from Blau's meeting opportunities thesis and contact theory,
   ethnic competition theory, and constrict theory. Using information about
   2545 Dutch respondents with their locality defined as egohoods and
   administrative units, we found that ethnic diversity effects vary with
   the geographic scale. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is
   positively associated with bridging social capital. At larger scales,
   the findings are mixed: ethnic diversity is positively related to
   inter-ethnic contacts and opposition to out-group neighbors. Ethnic
   diversity of smaller localities is negatively related to bonding social
   capital. In contrast to often-made claims that diversity within the
   local context would matter most, estimates of diversity effects are not
   always stronger when diversity measures are aggregated to smaller
   geographic areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{LOH at chromosome arms 3p, 9p, 11q, and 17p are well-established
   oncogenetic aberrations in oral precancerous lesions and promising
   biomarkers to monitor the development of oral cancer. Noninvasive LOH
   screening of brushed oral cells is a preferable method for precancer
   detection in patients at increased risk for head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma (HNSCC), such as patients with Fanconi anemia. We determined
   the prevalence of LOH in brushed samples of the oral epithelium of 141
   patients with Fanconi anemia and 144 aged subjects, and studied the
   association between LOH and HNSCC. LOH was present in 14 (9.9\%)
   nontransplanted patients with Fanconi anemia, whereas LOH was not
   detected in a low-risk group (n = 50, >58 years, nonsmoking/nonalcohol
   history) and a group with somewhat increased HNSCC risk (n = 94, >58
   years, heavy smoking/excessive alcohol use); Fisher exact test, P =
   0.023 and P = 0.001, respectively. Most frequent genetic alteration was
   LOH at 9p. Age was a significant predictor of LOH (OR, 1.13, P = 0.001).
   Five patients with Fanconi anemia developed HNSCC during the study at a
   median age of 39.6 years (range, 24.8-53.7). LOH was significantly
   associated with HNSCC (Fisher exact test, P = 0.000). Unexpectedly, the
   LOH assay could not be used for transplanted patients with Fanconi
   anemia because donor DNA in brushed oral epithelium, most likely from
   donor leukocytes present in the oral cavity, disturbed the analysis.
   Noninvasive screening using a LOH assay on brushed samples of the oral
   epithelium has a promising outlook in patients with Fanconi anemia.
   However, assays need to be adapted in case of stem cell transplantation,
   because of contaminating donor DNA. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The promotion of renewable energy production requires the cooperation of
   previously unrelated actors. In the Netherlands, a government subsidy
   pushes biomethane producers into a relationship with operators of the
   gas network. However, this cooperation proved to be very difficult. This
   research analyzes the problematic interaction between producers and
   network operators in the case of biomethane injection in the Dutch
   natural gas grid. We draw on the concept of `institutional logics' to
   improve our understanding of this interaction and to identify divergent
   practices and belief systems. This research contributes to the
   multilevel perspective on socio-technical transitions, in particular to
   insights into the interaction between the biomethane niche and gas
   regime. Based on interviews and secondary data sources we find diverging
   logics for biomethane producers and network operators. The differences
   regarding the goals pursued, decisionmaking style, and the scale of
   operations hamper productive cooperation. We also observe that `boundary
   spanning' individuals step in to increase mutual understanding and to
   forge productive working relationships. However, the existing logics
   leave very little room for maneuvering, given the embeddedness and
   stability of logics in thinking, acting, and physical infrastructure.
   Mismatching institutional logics form a serious hurdle for successful
   biomethane injection, and thus hinder the transition towards more
   renewable energy production. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of the Pt/SiO2 model catalysts as thin films on the
   surface of tantalum supports with a mixture of NO + O-2 (1: 1) was
   studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The pressure of the
   reaction mixture was varied from 6 to 64 mbar, and the temperature was
   varied from room temperature to 500A degrees C. Two types of the
   catalysts, in which the Pt/Si atomic ratios were similar to 0.1 and
   similar to 0.3 (0.1-Pt/SiO2 and 0.3-Pt/SiO2, respectively) according to
   the XPS data, were studied. In 0.1-Pt/SiO2, the particles of platinum
   predominantly had a size from 1 to 2.5 nm; a wide Pt particle size
   distribution in a range from 1 to 15 nm with a maximum at similar to 4
   nm was characteristic of 0.3-Pt/SiO2. The interaction of all of the
   samples with NO + O-2 at room temperature led to the dissolution of
   oxygen atoms in the bulk of platinum metal particles. As the reaction
   temperature was increased, PtO (x) platinum oxide particles were formed:
   from small Pt particles in 0.1-Pt/SiO2 at 300A degrees C and from larger
   particles in 0.3-Pt/SiO2 at 400-500A degrees C. It was established that
   the reactivity of platinum oxide particles toward hydrogen also depended
   on the particle size. The small particles of platinum oxide were
   converted into platinum metal under the action of hydrogen (16 mbar) at
   300A degrees C. The coarse particles of PtO (x) in the samples of
   0.3-Pt/SiO2 were reduced much more easily starting with room
   temperature.}},

Title = {{Interunit handoffs from emergency department to inpatient care: A

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDEmergency department (ED) to inpatient physician handoffs are
   subject to complex challenges. We assessed physicians' perceptions of
   the ED admission handoff process and identified potential barriers to
   safe patient care.
   METHODSWe conducted a cross-sectional survey at a 627-bed tertiary care
   academic medical center. Eligible participants included all resident,
   fellow, and faculty physicians directly involved in admission handoffs
   from emergency medicine (EM) and 5 medical admitting services. The
   survey addressed communication quality, clinical information,
   interpersonal perceptions, assignment of responsibilities,
   organizational factors, and patient safety. Participants reported their
   responses via a 5-point Likert scale and an open-ended description of
   handoff-related adverse events.
   RESULTSResponse rates were 63\% for admitting (94/150) and 86\% for EM
   physicians (32/37). Compared to EM respondents, admitting physicians
   reported that vital clinical information was communicated less
   frequently for all 8 content areas (P < 0.001). Ninety-four percent of
   EM physicians felt defensive at least sometimes. Twenty-nine percent of
   all respondents reported handoff-related adverse events, most frequently
   related to ineffective communication. Sequential handoffs were common
   for both EM and admitting services, with 78\% of physicians reporting
   they negatively impacted patient care.
   CONCLUSIONPhysicians reported that patient safety was often at risk
   during the ED admission handoff process. Admitting and EM physicians had
   divergent perceptions regarding handoff communication, and sequential
   handoffs were common. Further research is needed to better understand
   this complex process and to investigate strategies for improvement.

Abstract = {{Although freshwater (FW) is the ancestral habitat for larval mosquitoes,
   multiple species independently evolved the ability to survive in
   saltwater (SW). Here, we use quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to
   investigate the genetic architecture of osmoregulation in Anopheles
   mosquitoes, vectors of human malaria. We analyzed 1134 backcross progeny
   from a cross between the obligate FW species An. coluzzii, and its
   closely related euryhaline sibling species An. merus. Tests of 2387
   markers with Bayesian interval mapping and machine learning (random
   forests) yielded six genomic regions associated with SW tolerance.
   Overlap in QTL regions from both approaches enhances confidence in QTL
   identification. Evidence exists for synergistic as well as disruptive
   epistasis among loci. Intriguingly, one QTL region containing ion
   transporters spans the 2Rop chromosomal inversion that distinguishes
   these species. Rather than a simple trait controlled by one or a few
   loci, our data are most consistent with a complex, polygenic mode of
   inheritance.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The aim was to determine the quantitative contribution of
   naturally-occurring arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to phosphorus (P)
   uptake by wheat in the field in a semi-arid, agricultural environment.
   Findings were compared with a pot experiment in the same soil in order
   to assess the predictive value of pot experiments. Similar compartmented
   systems were used in both experiments, to provide radioactive P only to
   the AM fungal assemblage. Delivery of P to the plants was tracked and
   the contributions of the AM uptake pathway quantified. AM colonisation
   from the soil in both experiments was low and variable. A range of
   colonisation morphologies indicated the presence of several different AM
   fungi. By 44 d (pot experiment) and 67 d (field experiment) the AM
   pathway delivered P to all 10 plants in pots and 115/120 plants in the
   field. The contributions were 3-40\% of total P to whole plants in pots
   and 6.5-21\% to shoots in the field, equivalent to means of
   approximately 0.48 and 0.16 kg P ha(-1), respectively (minimum
   estimates, see text). There was no significant relationship between \%
   root length colonised and amount of P delivered via the AM pathway in
   either experiment. Even with low AM colonisation, the natural assemblage
   of indigenous AM fungi made a significant contribution to P uptake by
   wheat, a plant that is often regarded not to benefit from AM
   colonisation. We conclude that it is feasible to use compartmented
   systems in the field to estimate the quantitative contribution of AM
   fungi to P uptake by plants and that it is unwise to ignore the AM
   contribution in research aimed to understand mechanisms potentially
   contributing to P uptake efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The robustness and parametric sensitivity of a high-shear wet
   granulation process during scale-up were investigated for a formulation
   containing over 50\% by weight of a hydrophobic active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API). The sensitivity of granule properties-such as particle
   site distribution, bulk density and dissolution rate with respect to
   both formulation (binder/solids ratio) and process parameters (agitation
   rate and wet massing time) was determined at three different scales
   (0.5, 4.0 and 25.0 L). For a fixed impeller speed at a given granulator
   scale, the dissolution rate was found to be strongly correlated with
   bulk density, and both parameters could be controlled relatively
   precisely by the wet massing time. However, during scale-up and for
   variable agitation rates (expressed by the dimensionless Froude number)
   dissolution rate was found to be a non-trivial function of both granule
   size distribution and granule density. A set of process parameters for
   which the formulation was robust during scale-up was identified. (C)

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the limits and efficacies of the Fiber
   Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material for strengthening mid-rise RC
   buildings against seismic actions. Turkey, the region of the highest
   seismic risk in Europe, is chosen as the case-study country, the
   building stock of which consists in its vast majority of mid-rise RC
   residential and/or commercial buildings. Strengthening with traditional
   methods is usually applied in most projects, as ordinary construction
   materials and no specialized workmanship are required. However, in cases
   of tight time constraints, architectural limitations, durability issues
   or higher demand for ductile performance, FRP material is often opted
   for since the most recent Turkish Earthquake Code allows engineers to
   employ this advanced-technology product to overcome issues of inadequate
   ductility or shear capacity of existing RC buildings. The paper compares
   strengthening of a characteristically typical mid-rise Turkish RC
   building by two methods, i.e., traditional column jacketing and FRP
   strengthening, evaluating their effectiveness with respect to the
   requirements of the Turkish Earthquake Code. The effect of FRP
   confinement is explicitly taken into account in the numerical model,
   unlike the common procedure followed according to which the demand on
   un-strengthened members is established and then mere section analyses
   are employed to meet the additional demands.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior and use of shelter by 426 domestic horses on 166 pastures
   was studied in relation to weather conditions in a temperate climate.
   The pastures varied in availability and type of shelter (artificial
   and/or natural). Observations were carried out once per pasture, but to
   increase the number of replicates in some classes of weather conditions,
   observations on some horses were repeated. Horses were observed without
   interfering with their everyday routine. At each sampling time, weather
   conditions, such as ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed,
   precipitation, and cloud cover were noted. A 5-point ordinal scale was
   used to score the horses' behavioral response to flies, defined as
   insect-avoiding comfort behavior. The mean use of the artificial
   shelters was 37.6\% per observation moment. When dry air temperature was
   lower than 7.1 degrees C or higher than 25.2 degrees C, a 2-degree fit
   showed a higher artificial (man-made) shelter use. This is explained by
   the dampening effect of the artificial shelters on ambient temperature
   during cold circumstances, the temperature outside artificial shelter
   was lower than inside, whereas during warm circumstances temperature
   outside was higher. Regardless of temperature, but when wind speed was
   >2.8 m/s, shelter use was higher on rainy days than on dry days.
   Sheltering was also observed inside the thermo-neutral zone of horses
   (41.0\% of the total observation time). This behavior could be explained
   by other micro-environment related aspects, such as insect harassment.
   These results suggest that having access to shelter seems important for
   horses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To determine if positive dual staining of p16/Ki-67 in cytology
   samples from women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined
   significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)
   or normal cytological reports with presence of high-risk human
   papillomavirus (HPV), helps in predicting the risk of developing
   high-grade cervical lesions during one-year of follow-up after a normal
   initial colposcopy. Materials and Methods: One-hundred and sixty women
   with ASC-US, LSIL or otherwise normal cytology, but with the presence of
   high-risk HPV, were referred to the colposcopy Unit of our Hospital.
   Cytology and HPV testing were repeated and dual staining of p16/Ki-67
   performed on a new cytological specimen, and subsequently patients were
   colposcopically assessed and prospectively followed-up for one year,
   after which the colposcopy was repeated. An optional intermediate
   colposcopical assessment after six months was also offered. Results: Out
   of 143/160 women with a normal initial colposcopy, 13 were ultimately
   lost to follow-up. Out of the remaining 130, nine developed
   histologically verified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or higher
   grade (CIN2+) lesions during the one-year follow-up period. Two thirds
   of them (6/9) were initially p16/Ki-67-positive. Conclusion: Biomarker
   detection may identify women at higher risk of CIN2+, and these women
   may benefit from early colposcopic assessment. Women who test negatively
   for the biomarkers could eventually follow a less aggressive protocol.}},

Title = {{Synchronization of laying by great spotted cuckoos and recognition

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{608-615}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Brood parasites rely entirely on the parental care of host species to
   raise the parasitic nestlings until independence. The reproductive
   success of avian brood parasites depends on finding host nests at a
   suitable stage (i.e. during egg laying) for parasitism and weakly
   defensive (i.e. non-ejector) hosts. Finding appropriate nests for
   parasitism may, however, vary depending on ecological conditions,
   including parasite abundance in the area, which also varies from one
   year to another and therefore may influence coevolutionary relationships
   between brood parasites and their hosts. In this scenario, we explored:
   1) the degree of laying synchronization between great spotted cuckoos
   Clamator glandarius and magpies Pica pica during two breeding seasons,
   which varied in the level of selection pressure due to brood parasitism
   (i.e. parasitism rate); 2) magpie responses to natural parasitism in the
   pre-laying period and successfulness of parasitic eggs laid at this
   stage; and 3) magpie responses to experimental parasitism performed at
   different breeding stages. We found that, during the year of higher
   parasitism rate, there was an increase in the percentage of parasitic
   eggs laid before magpies started laying. However, the synchronization of
   laying was poor both years regardless of the differences in the
   parasitism rate. The ejection rate was significantly higher during the
   pre-egg-laying and the post-hatching stages than during the laying
   stage, and hatching success of parasitic eggs laid during the
   pre-egg-laying stage was zero. Thus, non-synchronized parasitic eggs are
   wasted and therefore poor synchronization should be penalized by natural
   selection. We discuss four different hypotheses explaining poor
   synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a conceptual analysis of some of the basic notions
   for the practice of interactive art and the relations among them. A
   sound understanding of these notions is essential for the creation of
   the aesthetics of artistically behaving systems. Interactivity, agency,

   practice, understanding that they are at least as important as the
   materials that physically instantiate the pieces and installations that
   constitute the body of interactive art. Interactivity is defined and
   confronted to the metaphor of the conversation and to the idea of
   designing interactive systems with artistic purposes. The notions of
   agency, behavior and performativity are reviewed through the reading of
   Andrew Pickering's account for the ontology of Cybernetics and in
   relation to interactive art practices. Finally, the concept of emergence
   and Peter Cariani's emergence-relative-to-a-model are presented as a
   theoretical framework with which the analysis and creation of unexpected
   and non pre-designed behaviors in interactive systems can be based.}},

Title = {{On the interaction between tree canopy position and environmental

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Understanding how trees affect their understorey plants and
   soils is crucial to understand savanna ecosystems. Most studies focus on
   the differences between canopy and open microsites, but how do different
   positions within large tree canopies influence soils and plants? Are
   these potential differences likely to change depending on environmental
   conditions (i.e. annual rainfall and grazing)?
   Location: One hundred sites across a rainfall gradient (220-1400 mm) in
   NSW, Australia.
   Methods: We measured the cover, richness and community composition of
   understorey plants and 12 soil attributes related to infiltration,
   erodibility and fertility across three positions within the canopy of
   large eucalypts (trunk, mid-canopy and edge) and in open areas. We also
   estimated the percentage similarity in plant communities across
   microsites, and the percentage species within the landscape occurring
   solely in one of the four microsites assayed. We tested the interactions
   between the effect of environmental conditions (rainfall and grazing)
   and canopy position on all these soil and vegetation attributes.
   Results: Soil attributes explained similar to 50\% of the effect of
   trees on understorey plants, and soil attributes improved with proximity
   to the trunk and increasing rainfall. The effect of canopy position 9
   rainfall interactions depended on the response variable considered.
   These interactions did not affect soil attributes, the percentage of
   facilitation-obligate species or species richness, and weakly affected
   plant composition. However, we found a strong reduction in similarity
   among plant communities within edge and mid-canopy compared with open
   sites towards drier environments, and canopy position x rainfall
   interactions also significantly affected plant cover. We attribute these
   weak interactions between canopy position and environmental conditions
   to richness or the frequency of facilitation to the high turnover of
   facilitated species across microsites and across different environmental
   conditions.
   Conclusions: Our study can be used to better understand community
   dynamics in ecosystems with scattered trees by showing the differential
   effects of trees on their understorey. Our results also contribute to
   the body of research on the relationships between plant-plant
   interactions and the environment by illustrating the importance of
   gradient length and the number of different microsites considered.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe increased risk of mental health problems in children and
   adolescents with intellectual disability (ID) has been reported in
   several studies. However, almost no research has been conducted on
   parents' experiences with the general mental health system. We have
   investigated the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in
   children with ID as well as the availability and quality of mental
   health care from the parents' point of view.
   MethodsTeachers of specialised schools for ID in Berlin were asked to
   complete the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) of the Child Behavior
   Checklist. Information was collected for 1226 children and adolescents
   aged 6-18 years with mild to profound ID (response 70.5\%). The
   availability and quality of mental health care was assessed by a
   questionnaire given to parents who had already been seeking help for
   their children. A total of 330 parents completed the questionnaires
   (response 62.0\%). In addition to univariate analysis, we conducted
   multiple logistic regressions regarding the psychopathology reported by
   teachers (TRF-syndrome scales) and difficulties concerning mental health
   care reported by parents for a paired sample of 308 children.
   ResultsOverall, 52.4\% of the children and adolescents with ID had a
   total problem score on the TRF in the deviant range (47.1\% when
   eliminating four items reflecting cognitive deficits). Compared with the
   general population normative sample of children, this is a three-time
   higher prevalence. The most striking problems were thought problems
   (schizoid and obsessive-compulsive), aggressive behaviour, attention
   problems and social problems. Parents whose children had more severe
   behavioural or emotional dysfunction reported more difficulties with the
   mental health system. From the parents' point of view, mental health
   professionals frequently did not feel responsible or were not
   sufficiently skilled for the treatment of children with ID. As a
   consequence, 96\% of all parents were longing for specialised in- and
   outpatient services.
   ConclusionsThis study confirms the findings from other studies regarding
   the high rate of co-occurrence of ID and mental health problems in
   youths. Results indicate that both are strongly requested by parents:
   specialised in- and outpatient services, as well as more professional
   general services and equitable treatment for all children, with and
   without ID.}},

Title = {{Further evidence for the deficit account of the test anxiety-test
   performance relationship from a high-stakes admission testing setting}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Based on meta-analytic evidence of a moderate negative correlation
   between test anxiety and test performance some researchers hypothesized
   that trait test anxiety may induce measurement bias. Two competing
   models have been advanced to account for the observed test anxiety-test
   performance relationship: the deficit hypothesis and the interference
   hypothesis. The interference hypothesis predicts that trait test anxiety
   induces measurement bias in items of intermediate difficulty, while the
   deficit hypothesis claims that test anxiety has no causal effect on test
   performance. Despite the practical relevance of this topic only few
   studies directly tested these predictions and none of them was conducted
   in real life high-stakes settings, which may limit the ecological
   validity of their findings. Therefore we tested these competing
   predictions in a high-stakes admission testing situation by means of
   structural equation modeling and item response theory analyses. A total
   of N = 1768 applicants to a medical university participated in the
   present study. After completing four cognitive ability tests as part of
   the admission test respondents filled a trait test anxiety
   questionnaire, which measured trait worry, trait task-irrelevant
   thinking and trait emotionality. In line with previous findings the
   results indicated that none of the trait test anxiety components induced
   measurement bias across different levels of trait test anxiety. Thus,
   the present findings were most consistent with a deficit account of the
   test anxiety-test performance relationship. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{In batteries associated with waste electrical and electronic equipment

   to WEEE and the fate of these metals in the end-of-life systems. In
   2011, approximately 40 Mg REE and 325 Mg cobalt were disposed of with
   WEEE-batteries. The end-of-life recycling rate for cobalt was 14\%, for
   REE 0\%. The volume of waste batteries can be expected to grow, but
   variation in the battery composition makes it difficult to forecast the
   future secondary raw material potential. Nevertheless, product specific

Abstract = {{The FEM-1 protein of Caenorhabditis elegans plays a crucial role in the
   nematode sex-determination pathway. Here, we reported the
   characterization of three members of Fem-1 gene family in Etiocheir
   sinensis (designated EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and EsFem-1c), which were
   homologs of the nematode FEM-1 protein. The amino acid sequences of
   EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and EsFem-1c contained eight, nine, and eight
   ankyrin repeats, respectively. None of the ankyrin repeats had its own
   specific signature, and the evolution of ankyrin repeat was not
   completely independent. The predicted three-dimensional structure of
   EsFem-1 proteins exhibited highly similar superhelical conformation,
   especially the N-terminal six contiguous ankyrin repeats, which provided
   a binding surface for the protein-protein interaction. Phylogenetic tree
   based on the amino acid sequences revealed that EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and
   FsFem-1c were divided into three obvious separated clades. EsFem-1 genes
   were highly expressed in fertilized egg, 2-4 cell and blastula stage
   comparing with larval stage (P <0.01), which suggested they might be
   maternal genes. They also showed a certain degree of sexually dimorphic
   expression in some tissues. Notably, the highest expression of EsFem-1a
   was in the hepatopancreas, with EsFem-1b in testes and EsFem-1c in
   muscle (P <0.05), which indicated their potential role in a broad array
   of tissues. In addition, the genes initially involved in-sex
   differentiation were not limited to those specifically expressed in the
   developing gonad. Taken together, these results suggested that EsFem-1
   might function in crab early sex determination and late gonad
   development. The identification of Fem-1 gene family in E. sinensis
   provides a new insight into crab sex-determination mechanism. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Query language modeling based on relevance feedback has been widely
   applied to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval. However,
   intra-query term dependencies (i.e., the dependencies between different
   query terms and term combinations) have not yet been sufficiently
   addressed in the existing approaches. This article aims to investigate
   this issue within a comprehensive framework, namely the Aspect Query
   Language Model (AM). We propose to extend the AM with a hidden Markov
   model (HMM) structure to incorporate the intra-query term dependencies
   and learn the structure of a novel aspect HMM (AHMM) for query language
   modeling. In the proposed AHMM, the combinations of query terms are
   viewed as latent variables representing query aspects. They further form
   an ergodic HMM, where the dependencies between latent variables (nodes)
   are modeled as the transitional probabilities. The segmented chunks from
   the feedback documents are considered as observables of the HMM. Then
   the AHMM structure is optimized by the HMM, which can estimate the prior
   of the latent variables and the probability distribution of the observed
   chunks. Our extensive experiments on three large-scale text retrieval
   conference (TREC) collections have shown that our method not only
   significantly outperforms a number of strong baselines in terms of both
   effectiveness and robustness but also achieves better results than the
   AM and another state-of-the-art approach, namely the latent concept
   expansion model. (c) 2014Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Memantine non-competitively blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in
   order to inhibit beta-amyloid (Af3) secretion, and has been used to
   treat moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the
   mechanisms underlying the role of memantine in the autophagy and
   apoptosis of neuronal cells in AD, as well as the association between
   neuronal autophagy and apoptosis have yet to be elucidated. The present
   study aimed to establish an AD cell model overexpressing the
   695-amino-acid Swedish mutant of A13 precursor protein (APP695swe) in
   order to observe the effects of memantine on the cell viability,
   autophagy and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells in the AD model, and to
   investigate the associated underlying mechanisms. A pcDNA3.1-APP695
   plasmid was transfected into the SH-SY5Y cells. Reverse
   transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot
   analyses demonstrated that the AD cell model was successfully
   established. MTT assays demonstrated that memantine was able to
   upregulate neuronal cell survival, and acridine orange staining and flow
   cytometry demonstrated that memantine (5 TiM) was able to inhibit
   neuronal autophagy and apoptosis. Following neuronal autophagy induction
   by rapamycin, cell apoptosis rates increased significantly. Further
   experiments revealed that memantine was able to upregulate the
   expression of signaling molecules phosphorylated (p)-phosphoinositide
   3-kinase, p-Akt and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and also
   inhibited the phosphorylation of the B-cell lymphoma 2/Beclin-1 complex
   via mitogen-activated protein lcinase 8. In conclusion, the results of
   the present study demonstrated that in the AD cell model, autophagy was
   able to promote apoptosis. Memantine exerted anti-autophagic and
   anti-apoptotic functions, and mTOR-dependent as well as independent
   autophagic signaling pathways were involved in this process. Therefore,
   these results of the present study strongly supported the use of
   memantine as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 hollow microspheres were successfully synthesized via a controlled
   hydrolysis reaction, which involved the deposition of an inorganic
   coating of TiO2 on the surface of carbon spheres and subsequent removal
   of carbon spheres by calcination in air. The as-prepared TiO2 hollow
   microspheres with an average diameter of 200 nm presented a novel
   morphology, which was constructed by closely crosslinked TiO2
   nanochains. The morphology of the hollow sphere can be controlled by
   varying the concentration of TiCl3 solution. A possible formation
   mechanism was also proposed. The photo-degradation of rhodamine B (RhB)
   aqueous solution showed that TiO2 hollow microspheres exhibited higher
   photocatalytic activity than that of TiO2 nanoparticles. The enhanced
   photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared TiO2 microspheres here could
   result from their hollow structures assembled by TiO2 nanochains and
   large light-harvesting efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{La1-z Nd (z) Fe4-x Co (x) Sb-12 skutterudites were prepared by using
   melting, quenching, annealing, and hot pressing. The major phase was the
   skutterudite phase but small amounts of FeSb2 phases were observed. In
   addition, especially for the Co-compensated specimens (x = 0.5),
   (La,Nd)Sb-2 phases existed. The electrical conductivity decreased with
   increasing temperature, showing a degenerate semiconductor behavior. The
   electrical conductivity decreased with increasing La and Co contents due
   to a decrease in the carrier concentration. All specimens showed p-type
   characteristics, having positive signs of the Seebeck coefficient and
   the Hall coefficient. The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing
   temperature and reached a maximum value at 823 K. The power factor (PF)
   increased with decreasing Co content, and La0.75Nd0.25Fe4Sb12 showed a
   peak value of the PF = 3.0 m Wm(-1) K-2 at 823 K. The electronic thermal
   conductivity decreased with increasing Co content, and for a fixed Co
   content, the lattice thermal conductivity decreased with increasing
   filling fraction of Nd. The thermal conductivity increased due to
   bipolar conduction at temperatures above 623 K. The dimensionless figure
   of merit (ZT) had a maximum value of ZT = 0.82 at 823 K for
   La0.75Nd0.25Fe4Sb12.}},

Abstract = {{Supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) is of great interest as a
   sand-flushing fluid with significant potential advantages; therefore, it
   is of fundamental and practical importance to investigate its sand
   transporting mechanism. Numerical simulation was conducted to analyse
   the heat transfer along the whole deviated wellbore, and the results
   served as boundary conditions for the multiphase flow model of CO2
   transporting sand. In addition, the physical properties of CO2 as a
   function of temperature and pressure were considered in the numerical
   simulation. The multiphase flow model was solved to investigate the
   effects of various factors on the sand transporting efficiency of CO2,
   including displacement, sand production rate and annulus eccentricity,
   in which the sand size distribution at the annulus entrance was set
   based on the measurement data from the experiments. The computed results
   show that the sand transporting efficiency decreases with inclination
   abruptly at first and subsequently increases, which is consistent with
   the experimental results. The inclination where sand is most difficult
   to transport varies from 48 to 72 degrees and depends on the sand's
   diameter and production rate at the bottom hole. The efficiency can be
   improved by increasing displacement with a trend that is greater at
   first and later slows. A larger sand production rate at the bottom hole
   means it is more difficult to transport sand. The efficiency decreases
   with increasing eccentricity at first and subsequently begins to
   increase when the eccentricity reaches 0.8. Under the same conditions,
   the pressure drop of sand-flushing with CO2 is 52.3\% that observed with
   water. The results lay an important foundation for practical
   application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Japonica rice (Oryza sativa, L.), Fangxin 4 was cultured under ambient
   night temperature (ANT) and high night temperature (HNT) in greenhouse.
   The average HNTs were 4.7 degrees C and 8.6 degrees C greater than ANTs
   in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The effects of HNT on formation of
   amyloplast, crystalline structure, thermal properties, and molecular
   structure were investigated during grain filling stage of 10-35 d after
   anthesis. Results indicated that amylose contents were gradually formed
   along with the maturing of rice amyloplast. Moreover, amylose content of
   HNT treatment decreased by 7.13\%-15.44\% compared with that of ANT at
   35 d after anthesis. T-O, T-P, T-C and Delta H-gel for HNT were higher
   than those of ANT. From 10 to 35 d, relative crystallinity presented an
   increase-decrease-increase pattern, and the relative crystallinity of
   HNT was 4.06\%-14.51\% higher than that of ANT at 35 d after anthesis.
   Amylopectin under ANT had a higher percentage of degree of
   polymerization (DP) 6-11, while amylopectin under HNT had a higher
   percentage of DP 12-23. HNT stress had an influence on the formation of
   amylose content and amylopectin structure, and then changed the
   crystalline and thermal properties of rice starch. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As the upcoming 3D video coding standard, high efficiency video coding
   (HEVC) based 3D video coding (3D-HEVC) has been drafted. In 3D-HEVC, the
   computational complexity of mode decision process is significantly high
   due to exhaustive modes' checks for coding units (CU) derived from
   recursive quad-tree partitioning. In this paper, we propose an early
   merge mode decision method for complexity reduction of dependent texture
   views. First, inter-view correlation and hierarchical depth correlation
   of coding modes are separately analyzed for B frame and P frame. Then,
   conditions to early determine merge mode coded CUs are derived based on
   the correlations. All of the early determined CUs only check merge modes
   in the mode decision process, which brings considerable complexity
   reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   achieve average 20.4\% of encoding time saving for dependent texture
   views with negligible rate distortion performance loss. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a general multi-channel source separation framework where
   additional audio references are available for one (or more) source(s) of
   a given mixture. Each audio reference is another mixture which is

   sources. Deformations between the sources of interest and their
   references are modeled in a linear manner using a generic formulation.
   This is done by adding transformation matrices to an excitation-filter
   model, hence affecting different axes, namely frequency, dictionary
   component or time. A nonnegative matrix co-factorization algorithm and a
   generalized expectation-maximization algorithm are used to estimate the
   parameters of the model. Different model parameterizations and different
   combinations of algorithms are tested on music plus voice mixtures
   guided by music and/or voice references and on professionally-produced
   music recordings guided by cover references. Our algorithms improve the

Abstract = {{The response of a convective ocean basin to variations in atmospheric
   temperature is explored using numerical models and theory. The results
   indicate that the general behavior depends strongly on the frequency at
   which the atmosphere changes relative to the local response time to
   air-sea heat flux. For high-frequency forcing, the convective region in
   the basin interior is essentially one-dimensional and responds to the
   integrated local surface heat flux anomalies. For low-frequency forcing,
   eddy fluxes from the boundary current into the basin interior become
   important and act to suppress variability forced by the atmosphere. A
   theory is developed to quantify this time-dependent response and its
   influence on various oceanic quantities. The amplitude and phase of the
   temperature and salinity of the convective water mass, the meridional
   overturning circulation, the meridional heat flux, and the air-sea heat
   flux predicted by the theory compare well with that diagnosed from a
   series of numerical model calculations in both strongly eddying and
   weakly eddying regimes. Linearized analytic solutions provide direct
   estimates of each of these quantities and demonstrate their dependence
   on the nondimensional numbers that characterize the domain and
   atmospheric forcing. These results highlight the importance of mesoscale
   eddies in modulating the mean and time-dependent ocean response to
   atmospheric variability and provide a dynamical framework with which to
   connect ocean observations with changes in the atmosphere and surface
   heat flux.}},

Abstract = {{A contemporary challenge across the natural sciences is the simultaneous
   optical imaging or stimulation of small numbers of cells or colloidal
   particles organized into arbitrary geometries. We demonstrate the use of
   temporal focusing with holographic optical tweezers in order to achieve
   depth-resolved two-photon imaging of trapped objects arranged in
   arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) geometries using a single objective.
   Trapping allows for the independent position control of multiple objects
   by holographic beam shaping. Temporal focusing of ultrashort pulses
   provides the widefield two-photon depth-selective activation of
   fluorescent samples. We demonstrate the wide-field depth-resolved
   illumination of both trapped fluorescent beads and trapped HL60 cells in
   suspension with full 3D positioning control. These approaches are
   compatible with implementation through scattering media and can be
   beneficial for emergent studies in colloidal science and particularly
   optogenetics, offering targeted photoactivation over a wide area with
   micrometer-precision depth control. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{To engage in purposeful behavior, it is important to make plans, which
   organize subsequent actions. Most studies of planning involve look-ahead
   puzzle tasks that are unrelated to personal goals. We developed a task
   to assess autobiographical planning, which involves the formulation of
   personal plans in response to real-world goals, and examined
   autobiographical planning in 63 adults during fMRI scanning.
   Autobiographical planning was found to engage the default network,
   including medial-temporal lobe and midline structures, and executive
   control regions in lateral pFC and parietal cortex and caudate. To
   examine how specific qualitative features of autobiographical plans
   modulate neural activity, we performed parametric modulation analyses.
   Ratings of plan detail, novelty, temporal distance, ease of plan
   formulation, difficulty in goal completion, and confidence in goal
   accomplishment were used as covariates in six hierarchical linear
   regression models. This modeling procedure removed shared variance among
   the ratings, allowing us to determine the independent relationship
   between ratings of interest and trial-wise BOLD signal. We found that
   specific autobiographical planning, describing a detailed, achievable,
   and actionable planning process for attaining a clearly envisioned
   future, recruited both default and frontoparietal brain regions. In
   contrast, abstract autobiographical planning, plans that were
   constructed from more generalized semantic or affective representations
   of a less tangible and distant future, involved interactions among
   default, sensory perceptual, and limbic brain structures. Specific
   qualities of autobiographical plans are important predictors of default
   and frontoparietal control network engagement during plan formation and
   reflect the contribution of mnemonic and executive control processes to
   autobiographical planning.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated the effects of hot water, UV-C irradiation
   and their combination on the induction of resistance to anthracnose
   disease and on quality improvement in harvested mangoes. Naturally
   infected mango fruits were harvested, surface-disinfested with a
   solution of 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite and air dried. The fruits were
   then treated with UV-C irradiation at a dose 6.16 kJ m(-2), with hot
   water at 55 degrees C for 5 mm or with hot water followed by UV-C
   irradiation. Untreated fruits served as the control. All fruit samples
   were kept at 13 degrees C for 12 days. The combined treatment
   significantly suppressed the severity of anthracnose symptoms compared
   with either single treatment. Additionally, the specific activities of
   key plant defense-related enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase
   (PAL), peroxidase (POD), chitinase (CHI) and beta-1,3-glucanase (GLU),
   increased in both the peel and the pulp of the mango fruits. The
   expressions of the MI-PAL, MI-POD, MI-CHI and MI-GLU genes in the mango
   peel were markedly enhanced in the fruits treated with the combined
   treatment in comparison with those treated with hot water or UV-C alone,
   while the control fruits showed the lowest expression of these genes.
   The combined treatment or UV-C treatment alone significantly delayed
   fruit ripening by maintaining fruit firmness, retarding the progressive
   increase of total soluble solids (TSS) and delaying the decrease in
   titratable acidity (TA). Weight loss was not significantly different
   among the treatments. The results suggested that the combination of hot
   water and UV-C treatment may be used as a tool not only for suppressing
   anthracnose disease but also for improving the quality of harvested
   mangoes by inducing the expression of plant defense-related genes. (C)

Abstract = {{Modeling realistic discharge flow-rate and headway features at
   signalized intersections is critical to the design of traffic signals,
   since they play a critical role in determining the start-up lost times
   and intersection capacity. Traditional queue discharge models are either
   microscopic or stochastic, and macroscopic traffic flow models for
   signalized intersections are based on overly simplistic assumptions.
   They are incapable of modeling traffic dynamics at signalized
   intersections as well as capturing realistic queue discharge features.
   In this study we propose a modified Cell Transmission Model (CTM) by
   substituting the traditional demand function, which is constant under
   over-saturated conditions, with a linearly decreasing function. The new
   demand function is defined through a combination of conventional
   macroscopic parameters, including critical density, free-flow speed, jam
   density, and an additional parameter, jam demand. Analytically we show
   that the new model reproduces observed features in the discharge
   flow-rate and headway. We further present a new definition of lost times
   at the macroscopic level based on the modified CTM. Calibration with
   observations in existing studies, as well as new observations, further
   suggest that the model can reasonably capture all traffic queue
   discharge features. We also discuss solutions to the new model under
   various Riemann problem scenarios and show that they produce realistic
   results while offering observable improvements in the modeling of
   traffic dynamics under certain scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   homologue genes with differential regulation}},
Journal = {{PROTOPLASMA}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1421-1437}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) catalyse a wide variety of
   oxygenation/hydroxylation reactions that facilitate diverse metabolic
   functions in plants. Specific CYP families are essential for the
   biosynthesis of species-specialized metabolites. Therefore, we
   investigated the role of different CYPs related to secondary metabolism
   in Withania somnifera, a medicinally important plant of the Indian
   subcontinent. In this study, complete complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of four
   different CYP genes were isolated and christened as WSCYP93Id,
   WSCYP93Sm, WSCYP734B and WSCYP734R. These cDNAs encoded polypeptides
   comprising of 498, 496, 522 and 550 amino acid residues with their
   deduced molecular mass of 56.7, 56.9, 59.4 and 62.2 kDa, respectively.
   Phylogenetic study and molecular modelling analysis of the four cloned
   WSCYPs revealed their categorization into two CYP families (CYP83B1 and
   CYP734A1) belonging to CYP71 and CYP72 clans, respectively. BLASTp
   searches showed similarity of 75 and 56 \%, respectively, between the
   two CYP members of CYP83B1 and CYP734A1 with major variances exhibited
   in their N-terminal regions. The two pairs of homologues exhibited
   differential expression profiles in the leaf tissues of selected
   chemotypes of W. somnifera as well as in response to treatments such as
   methyl jasmonate, wounding, light and auxin. Light and auxin regulated
   two pairs of WSCYP homologues in a developing seedling in an interesting
   differential manner. Their lesser resemblance and homology with other
   CYP sequences suggested these genes to be more specialized and distinct
   ones. The results on chemotype-specific expression patterns of the four
   genes strongly suggested their key/specialized involvement of the CYPs
   in the biosynthesis of chemotype-specific metabolites, though their
   further biochemical characterization would reveal the specificity in
   more detail. It is revealed that WSCYP93Id and WSCYP93Sm may be broadly
   involved in the oxygenation reactions in the plant and, thereby, control
   various pathways involving such metabolic reactions in the plant. As a
   representative experimental validation of this notion, WSCYP93Id was
   heterologouly expressed in Escherichia coli and catalytic capabilities
   of the recombinant WSCYP93Id protein were evaluated using withanolides
   as substrates. Optimized assays with some major withanolides (withanone,
   withaferin A and withanolide A) involving spectrophotometric as well as
   high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based evaluation (product
   detection) of the reactions showed conversion of withaferin A to a
   hydroxylated product. The genes belonging to other CYP group are
   possibly involved in some specialised synthesis such as that of
   brassinosteroids.}},

   was monitored as well. To obtain an indication of the PAC2 cell line
   metabolizing capacity, the expression of genes belonging to cyp1, cyp2
   and cyp3 families was assessed upon exposure to B{[}a]P. Genotoxic
   responses were observed in all the used methods, and quantitative
   random-amplified polymorphic DNA and amplified fragment length
   polymorphism proved to be more sensitive by revealing DNA alterations
   even when the Comet assay indicated lack of significant damage. The PAC2
   cell line demonstrated basal and B{[}a]P-induced expression of several
   cyp genes, suggesting its ability to metabolize indirect acting
   xenobiotics to a certain point. Based on these results, PAC2 cells seem
   to be sensitive zebrafish in vitro model in the genotoxicity assessment
   of the direct acting genotoxicant; however, they are less sensitive
   toward the indirect acting genotoxicant due to their limited
   metabolizing properties. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.
   In this study, we assessed PAC2 cell line responses toward different
   forms of genotoxic stress by using the battery of tests: the Comet
   assay, quantitative random-amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment
   length polymorphism and expression of several DNA repair, oxidative
   stress response and xenobiotic metabolism genes. PAC2 cell line
   exhibited genotoxic responses in all used test methods upon direct, and
   to a lower extent upon indirect acting genotoxicant.}},

Journal = {{ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{38-49}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In preparing the way for the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders,
   there is a pressing need to begin probing the transient sky in a fully
   robotic fashion using the current generation of radio telescopes.
   Effective exploitation of such surveys requires a largely automated
   data-reduction process. This paper introduces an end-to-end automated
   reduction pipeline, AMIsurvey, used for calibrating and imaging data
   from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array. AMIsurvey makes use
   of several component libraries which have been packaged separately for
   open-source release. The most scientifically significant of these is
   chimenea, which implements a telescope-agnostic algorithm for automated
   imaging of pre calibrated multi-epoch radio-synthesis data, of the sort
   typically acquired for transient surveys or followup. The algorithm aims
   to improve upon standard imaging pipelines by utilizing iterative
   RMS-estimation and automated source-detection to avoid so called
   `Clean-bias', and makes use of CASA subroutines for the underlying
   image-synthesis operations. At a lower level, AMIsurvey relies upon two
   libraries, drive-ami and drive-casa, built to allow use of mature
   radio-astronomy software packages from within Python scripts. While
   targeted at automated imaging, the drive-casa interface can also be used
   to automate interaction with any of the CASA subroutines from a generic
   Python process. Additionally, these packages may be of wider technical
   interest beyond radio-astronomy, since they demonstrate use of the
   Python library pexpect to emulate terminal interaction with an external
   process. This approach allows for rapid development of a Python
   interface to any legacy or externally-maintained pipeline which accepts
   command-line input, without requiring alterations to the original code.

Title = {{Field measurements of NOx and mercury from oxy-fuel compression
   condensates at the Callide Oxyfuel Project}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{485-493}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Callide Oxyfuel Project (COP) is the world's largest operating
   oxy-fuel plant and has successfully demonstrated the retrofitting
   capability for oxy-fuel to capture CO2. The compression of the raw flue
   gas at the COP has also demonstrated that NOx and Hg can also be removed
   as part of the liquid condensate. This work presents field tests
   conducted on the condensates to determine the stability of captured NOx
   and Hg species when depressurised. These tests involved sampling liquid
   condensate directly into a customised aeration vessel and measuring the
   evolved gases over an 8-12 h period. The low-pressure condensate
   (similar to 4 bar) showed that 3-18\% of captured NOx species and
   0.5-1.2\% of the Hg were volatile, while the high-pressure condensate
   (24 bar) re-emitted 2-68\% of captured NOx and 0.05-12.5\% of the
   captured Hg. These tests showed that volatile Hg was related to volatile
   NOx and that this volatility of condensates changed with time as the
   compression plant operated from start-up. Equilibrium calculations of
   HNO2 in the gas and liquid phases supported the volatility measurements,
   suggesting that the rate of oxidation of HNO2 to HNO3 in the condensed
   phase is slow. Overall, the conditions which favoured NOx stability in
   the condensates, namely longer residence and higher pressure also
   favoured Hg stability. This work has shown that emissions from an
   oxy-fuel compression plant must include those emanating from
   depressurised condensates and suggest that the re-emitted species may
   not the same as in typical combustion flue gas, but the result of
   higher-pressure conversion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to dosimetrically compare 6-and
   10-MV photon beam energies in high-risk prostate cancer patients of
   various body habitus using a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
   radiation delivery technique. The objectives of the study were to
   evaluate whether dosimetric differences exist and to investigate whether
   differences are dependent on patient body habitus.
   Methods and materials: Forty patients with various body habitus who had
   previously received treatment to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes
   with VMAT techniques were chosen. Patients were planned in the Pinnacle3
   treatment planning system with double or triple SmartArc plans with
   6-and 10-MV photon energies. All patients were optimized with the same
   planning objectives and normalized such that 95\% of the planning target
   volume (PTV) received the prescription dose. Patients were evaluated for
   PTV and organ at risk (OAR) parameters for the bladder, rectum, small
   bowel, penile bulb, and sigmoid colon. Metrics used for comparison were
   D2\%, D-98\%, homogeneity, conformity, and dose falloff for the PTV and
   D-2\%, D-mean, V-80\%, V-60\%, and V-40\% for OARs. Statistical
   differences were evaluated with a paired-sample Wilcoxon signed rank
   test with a significance level of .05.
   Results: For the PTV, there were no statistically significant
   differences in D-mean, D-2cc, conformation number, and homogeneity index
   values, but the dose falloff parameters, R-50 and R-25, showed a median
   improvement of 6.7\% (P < .01) and 6.2\% (P < .01), respectively, with
   10 MV.A correlation between patient anterior-posterior distance (dAP)
   and percentage reduction in R-50 of 0.436\% per centimeter (P < .01) was
   determined. For OARs, statistically significant reductions in dose
   metrics were found in the small bowel and bladder, but increases in the
   D-2cc of 3.5\% in the penile bulb (P < .01) and 0.2\% in the rectum
   (P=.02) were shown with 10 MV. The use of 10 MV also demonstrated a
   statistically significant reduction in the total number of monitor units
   of 15.9\% (P < .01) compared with 6 MV.
   Conclusions: The study showed that 10 MV provides a faster dose falloff
   than 6 MV for patients whose prostate and pelvic lymph nodes are treated
   using a VMAT technique irrespective of body habitus; however, the
   improvement in dose falloff is dependent on body habitus and increases
   as the patient body habitus increases. (C) 2015 American Society for

Abstract = {{Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease. In addition
   to their inhibitory effects on cholesterol synthesis, statins have
   beneficial effects in patients with sepsis and pneumonia, although
   molecular mechanisms have mostly remained unclear. Using human airway
   epithelial cells as a proper in vitro model, we show that prior exposure
   to physiological nanomolar serum concentrations of simvastatin (ranging
   from 10-1,000 nM) confers significant cellular resistance to the
   cytotoxicity of pneumolysin, a pore-forming toxin and the main virulence
   factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This protection could be
   demonstrated with a different statin, pravastatin, or on a different
   toxin, a-hemolysin. Furthermore, through the use of gene silencing,
   pharmacological inhibitors, immunofluorescence microscopy, and
   biochemical and metabolic rescue approaches, we demonstrate that the
   mechanism of protection conferred by simvastatin at physiological
   nanomolar concentrations could be different from the canonical
   mevalonate pathways seen in most other mechanistic studies conducted
   with statins at micromolar levels. All of these data are integrated into
   a protein synthesis-dependent, calcium-dependent model showing the
   interconnected pathways used by statins in airway epithelial cells to
   elicit an increased resistance to pore-forming toxins. This research
   fills large gaps in our understanding of how statins may confer host
   cellular protection against bacterial infections in the context of
   airway epithelial cells without the confounding effect from the presence
   of immune cells. In addition, our discovery could be potentially
   developed into a host-centric strategy for the adjuvant treatment of
   pore-forming toxin associated bacterial infections.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe group of autoinflammatory syndromes associated with
   Pyoderma gangrenosum, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis are poorly
   defined and difficult to control with currently available treatment
   modalities.
   ObjectivesWe describe a patient with PASH syndrome and report about the
   successful multimodal treatment with infliximab, cyclosporine, and
   dapsone.
   MethodsA review of the available literature to date about this group of
   autoinflammatory diseases was performed. We performed genetic analysis
   for PSTPIP1 mutations associated with PAPA syndrome.
   ResultsA 22-year-old woman presented to our department with pyoderma
   gangrenosum, concomitant acne, and suppurative hidradenitis. She had
   previously been treated unsuccessfully with etanercept, adalimumab,
   fumaric acid and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) anakinra without
   prolonged remission. Treatment with intravenous infliximab in
   combination with cyclosporine and dapsone lead to sudden and prolonged
   improvement of the clinical symptoms that we classified as PASH
   syndrome. We review the literature about this group of diseases and
   report the third case of PASH syndrome to date.
   ConclusionPASH syndrome and associated diseases should be considered
   whenever hidradenitis suppurativa is found in association with pyoderma
   gangrenosum. We provide a systematic overview about PASH syndrome and
   suggest a novel multimodal therapeutic regimen beyond isolated
   inhibition of TNF or IL-1.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers design and scenario work as a team-coaching
   experience. It presents the componential theory of learning in coaching
   and the underlying componential model of creative learning, highlighting
   some ideas and showing some possibilities of using them for creating and
   implementing a creative learning environment necessary for the success
   of both design and scenario work. The benefits of other methods and
   tools of educational science and psychology are also briefly described.
   Finally, possibilities arising from the new as well as the usual
   perspectives on design and scenario work for educational science and
   psychology - more precisely, coaching and creativity research - are
   dealt with. In the last section of the article, general principles used
   are highlighted and summarized. Some connections to fundamental
   questions of the role of sciences, arts, theory and practice as well as
   of the location of design and scenario work are discussed. Thereby, a
   possible solution to the related controversy is initially proposed.
   Overall, this article shows some of the areas in which educational
   science and psychology, on the one side, and design and scenario work,
   on the other, can be of mutual benefit. It aims to initiate further
   discussions about connections among the mentioned fields, and seeks to
   suggest some possibilities for interdisciplinary research and
   utilization of its results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Whole wheat pasta offers improved nutritional value compared with
   regular pasta but lacks appeal to many consumers owing to its negative
   organoleptic properties, such as texture and taste. Various approaches
   have been studied to improve these properties in whole wheat products.
   Optimizing bran particle size showed its potential in noodles, but
   studies of its effects in pasta are scarce. Therefore, we produced
   spaghetti enriched with bran fractions similar in chemical composition
   but with varying median particle sizes of 90, 160, 370, and 440 mu m.
   The effect of bran particles and their median size on dried and cooked
   pasta was studied by light microscopy and three-dimensional magnetic
   resonance imaging. In general, bran particle size did not influence the
   macrostructure in cooked spaghetti. However, larger bran particles
   created a more heterogeneous microstructure in contrast to smaller
   particles and affected starch granule swelling. Sensory analysis
   indicated a preference for pasta containing smaller particles. Our
   results give new insight into the microstructural features responsible
   for the negative consumer appeal, and they could be used to guide future
   efforts in designing improved pasta formulations.}},

Abstract = {{This is a retrospective cohort study of adults with a primary diagnosis

   purpose was to assess the prevalence of home treatment of DVT in the

   no PE, 85 (88.5\%) were hospitalized and 11 (11.5\%) were discharged to
   home. Most of the patients discharged to home received
   low-molecular-weight heparin, 9 (81.8\%) of 11. None were prescribed new
   oral anticoagulants. Early discharge in 2 days occurred 28 (32.9\%) of
   85 patients. Most (64.3\%) received enoxaparin and/or warfarin at early
   discharge. Rivaroxaban was prescribed in 7 (25.0\%) of those discharged

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{The phylogeny of Galliformes (landfowl) has been studied extensively;
   however, the associated chronologies have been criticized recently due
   to misplaced or misidentified fossil calibrations. As a consequence, it
   is unclear whether any crown-group lineages arose in the Cretaceous and
   survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg; 65.5 Ma) mass extinction. Using
   Bayesian phylogenetic inference on an alignment spanning 14,539 bp of
   mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, four fossil calibrations,
   and a combination of uncorrelated lognormally distributed relaxed-clock
   and strict-clock models, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular
   phylogeny for 225 of the 291 extant Galliform taxa. These analyses
   suggest that crown Galliformes diversified in the Cretaceous and that
   three-stem lineages survived the K-Pg mass extinction. Ideally,
   characterizing the tempo and mode of diversification involves a
   taxonomically complete phylogenetic hypothesis. We used simple
   constraint structures to incorporate 66 data-deficient taxa and inferred
   the first taxon-complete phylogenetic hypothesis for the Galliformes.
   Diversification analyses conducted on 10,000 timetrees sampled from the
   posterior distribution of candidate trees show that the evolutionary
   history of the Galliformes is best explained by a rate-shift model
   including 1-3 clade-specific increases in diversification rate. We
   further show that the tempo and mode of diversification in the
   Galliformes conforms to a three-pulse model, with three-stem lineages
   arising in the Cretaceous and inter and intrafamilial diversification
   occurring after the K-Pg mass extinction, in the Paleocene-Eocene
   (65.5-33.9 Ma) or in association with the Eocene-Oligocene transition
   (33.9 Ma). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded
   community-based organizations (CBOs) to deliver Many Men, Many Voices
   (3MV) to young men of color who have sex with men. Although 3MV, a
   group-level behavioral intervention designed to reduce human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors of black men who have sex
   with men (MSM), has shown effectiveness when delivered in a controlled
   research environment, there is limited evidence that the intervention is
   associated with similar outcomes in ``real world{''} settings. For the
   current project, CDC funded three CBOs to conduct outcome monitoring of
   the 3MV intervention to determine if young MSM of color report changes
   in HIV risk behaviors postintervention. Using a repeated measures
   design, risk behaviors were collected at baseline and again at 3 and 6
   months postintervention. Changes in risk behaviors were assessed using

Title = {{Thermal wrinkling of nanoimprinted SU-8 with masked UV-exposure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When wrinkling can be provided in a controlled way, this has potential
   for a lot of applications, e.g., in optics or microelectromechanical
   systems. This paper reports on localized wrinkles generated with an SU-8
   layer on silicon; the surface is hardened by a deep-ultraviolet (UV)
   treatment (172 nm); the size of the wrinkling area is defined by masked
   UV-exposure. In addition, the SU-8 surface is provided with topography
   via capillary force lithography beforehand. To identify the interaction
   between masked UV-exposure and deep-UV treatment several issues are
   addressed; the size of the wrinkling area, the deep-UV treatment time,
   and the dose for the masked exposure. Different types of wrinkling are
   observed, an undulated type, a parallel type, and a zig-zag type. To
   define a clear wrinkling area an exposure dose of at least 160 mJ/cm(2)
   is advised with a 5 mu m-thick SU-8 layer. Then, the wrinkles orient in
   parallel to the edges of the wrinkling area. The impact of topography on
   wrinkling within a defined wrinkling area is investigated by applying
   different types of prepatterns, lines, holes, and V-grooves. Typically,
   the geometry of the prepattern is smaller than the geometry of the
   wrinkling area. When the prepattern is unidirectional as in the case of
   lines, an anisotropic response of wrinkling is observed, which can be
   understood on the basis of a corrugated surface, featuring a weaker and
   a stronger direction. When wrinkling is controlled by the choice of
   adequate boundary conditions, this provides an easy method to cover the
   SU-8 surface with largely regular wrinkling patterns. (C) 2015 American

   All 363 graduate nursing programs in the United States were surveyed

   across program curricula and their perceptions of the influence that the
   APRN Consensus Model has exerted on preparing the next generation of
   APRNs to meet the growing needs of the older adult population. Of the
   202 schools responding, 138 reported GPN content in one or more clinical
   programs, with the majority of content in non-PMHNP programs. Only 17
   schools reported offering a GPN program, track, or minor. The majority
   of schools (n = 169) perceived that they were adequately well-prepared
   to meet the APRN Consensus Model's guidelines regarding inclusion of
   aging-related didactic and clinical educational experiences in all APRN
   education programs; nearly two thirds (n = 132) perceived a moderate to
   significant influence of the Consensus Model on institutional infusion
   of GPN into curricula. Compared with a similar survey 10 years ago,
   there was little change in the proportion of schools reporting GPN in
   clinical programs and few schools provide GPN programs, tracks, or

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that repress the
   translation and reduce the stability of target mRNAs in animal cells.
   microRNA-31 (miR-31) is known to play a role in cancer, bone formation
   and lymphatic development. However, studies to understand the function
   of miR-31 in embryogenesis have been limited. We examined the regulatory
   role of miR-31 in early development using the sea urchin as a model.
   miR-31 is expressed at all stages of development and its knockdown (KD)
   disrupts the patterning and function of primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs),
   which form the embryonic skeleton spicules. We identified that miR-31
   directly represses Pmar1, Alx1, Snail and VegfR7 within the PMC gene
   regulatory network using reporter constructs. Further, blocking the
   miR-31-mediated repression of Alx1 and/or VegfR7 in the developing
   embryo resulted in defects in PMC patterning and skeletogenesis. The
   majority of the mislocalized PMCs in miR-31 KD embryos did not express
   VegfR10, indicating that miR-31 regulates VegfR gene expression within
   PMCs. In addition, miR-31 indirectly suppresses Vegf3 expression in the
   ectoderm. These results indicate that miR-31 coordinately suppresses
   genes within the PMCs and in the ectoderm to impact PMC patterning and
   skeletogenesis. This study identifies the novel function and molecular
   mechanism of miR-31-mediated regulation in the developing embryo.}},

Abstract = {{Results that indicate the grouping of droplets of the same size in
   certain regions of space have been obtained during in situ measurements
   of the instantaneous structure and spatial and temporal distribution of
   rains (using methods based on the effect of abnormally high modulation
   of the scattered light). Calculations that show that such a grouping can
   be associated with wind gusts and intense turbulence are presented. It
   is shown that a lateral wind gust leads to the grouping of drops of
   different sizes in different layers. The processes of spatial selection
   and grouping are considered for both the laminar flow in the case of
   droplets and for the turbulent flow regime in the case of the coarse
   fraction of drops. It is stated that the clustering of particles can
   lead to a sharp increase in the received signal strength and the
   anomalous dependence of the backscatter cross section on the wavelength.
   This means that not only the microstructure of scatterers, but also the
   dynamic state of the atmosphere should be considered in the
   interpretation of radar data, e.g., Z-I ratio. The considered clustering
   mechanism can cause the rapid formation of raindrops in the clouds.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of employing the rare-earth Sc2O3 high-K (similar to 16)
   dielectric in passivating Ge surfaces for metal-oxide-semiconductor
   device application is studied in terms of occurring inherent
   paramagnetic point defects, operating as detrimental charge traps. To
   assess their atomic nature, low temperature K-band electron spin
   resonance (ESR) experiments have been carried out in combination with
   electrical probing, including capacitance-voltage, internal
   photoemission and photoconductance observations, on
   (100)Ge/(GeO2)/Sc2O3/HfO2 stacks grown by atomic layer deposition
   subjected to various processing steps. In stacks with Ge directly
   contacted with Sc2O3, without an additional O-supply processing step,
   ESR reveals the presence of a prominent signal of powder pattern shape,
   centered at g = 2.0017(2). It is ascribed to O-deficiency centers
   located in the Sc2O3-based dielectric, which from combined electrical
   analysis are concluded to be at the origin of substantial electron
   trapping (similar to 6 x 10(12) cm(-2)) in near-interfacial layers.
   Generally, the data suggest that O-deficiency caused by oxidation of Ge
   (O-scavenging) emerges as a crucial parameter in defect generation,
   leading to the conclusion that the suppression of defect generation will
   require a sufficient supply of oxygen during critical manufacturing
   steps. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Mouse Round-window Approach for Ototoxic Agent Delivery: A Rapid and
   Reliable Technique for Inducing Cochlear Cell Degeneration}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Investigators have utilized a wide array of animal models and
   investigative techniques to study the mammalian auditory system. Much of
   the basic research involving the cochlea and its associated neural
   pathways entails exposure of model cochleae to a variety of ototoxic
   agents. This allows investigators to study the effects of targeted
   damage to cochlear structures, and in some cases, the self-repair or
   regeneration of those structures. Various techniques exist for delivery
   of ototoxic agents to the cochlea. When selecting a particular
   technique, investigators must consider a number of factors, including
   the induction of inadvertent systemic toxicity, the amount of cochlear
   damage produced by the surgical procedure itself, the type of lesion
   desired, animal survivability, and reproducibility/reliability of
   results. Currently established techniques include parenteral injection,
   intra-peritoneal injection, trans-tympanic injection, endolymphatic sac
   injection, and cochleostomy with perilymphatic perfusion. Each of these
   methods has been successfully utilized and is well described in the
   literature; yet, each has various shortcomings. Here, we present a
   technique for topical application of ototoxic agents directly to the
   round window niche. This technique is non-invasive to inner ear
   structures, produces rapid onset of reliably targeted lesions, avoids
   systemic toxicity, and allows for an intra-animal control (the
   contra-lateral ear). Results stemming from this approach have helped
   deeper understanding of auditory pathophysiology, cochlear cell
   degeneration, and regenerative capacity in response to an acute injury.
   Future investigations may use this method to conduct interventional
   studies involving gene therapy and stem cell transplantation to combat
   hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore workers are subjected to a unique physical and cultural
   environment which has the ability to affect their size and shape.
   Because they are heavier than the UK adult population we hypothesized
   they would have larger torso dimensions which would adversely affect
   their ability to pass one another in a restricted space. A sample of 210
   male offshore workers was selected across the full weight range, and
   measured using 3D body scanning for shape. Bideltoid breadth and maximum
   chest depth were extracted from the scans and compared with reference
   population data. In addition a size algorithm previously calculated on
   44 individuals was applied to adjust for wearing a survival suit and
   re-breather device. Mean bideltoid breadth and chest depth was 51.4 cm
   and 27.9 cm in the offshore workers, compared with 49.7 cm and 25.4 cm
   respectively in the UK population as a whole. Considering the
   probability of two randomly selected people passing within a restricted
   space of 100 cm and 80 cm, offshore workers are 28\% and 34\% less
   likely to pass face to face and face to side respectively, as compared
   with UK adults, an effect which is exacerbated when wearing personal
   protective equipment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Title = {{Reliability tests and guidelines for B-mode ultrasound assessment of

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1200-1208}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{IntroductionUltrasound represents a validated and relatively inexpensive
   diagnostic device for assessing central adiposity; however, widespread
   adoption has been impeded by the lack of reliable standard operating
   procedures.
   PurposeTo examine the reliability of, and describe guidelines for,
   ultrasound-derived recording of intra-abdominal fat thickness (IAT) and
   maximal preperitoneal fat thickness (PFT).
   MethodsUltrasound scans were obtained from 20 adults (50\% female,
   267years, 245kg/m(2)) on three different mornings. IAT was assessed 2cm
   above the umbilicus (transverse plane) measuring from linea alba to: (i)
   anterior aorta, (ii) posterior aorta and (iii) anterior aspect of the
   vertebral column. PFT was measured from linea alba to visceral
   peritoneum in (i) sagittal and (ii) transverse planes, immediately over
   and inferior to the xiphi-sternum, respectively.
   ResultsFor IAT, the criterion intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
   of 075 was exceeded for measurements to anterior aorta (095), posterior
   aorta (094) and vertebra (096). The reliability coefficient expressed as
   a percentage of the mean (RC\%) was lowest (better) for measurement to
   vertebrae (98\%). For PFT, mean thickness was comparable for sagittal
   (174cm) and transverse (176cm) planes; ICC values were also comparable
   for both planes (098 vs. 098, respectively), as were RC\% (75\% vs.
   71\%, respectively).
   ConclusionsIAT assessments to the vertebra were marginally more reliable
   than those to other structures. While PFT assessments were equally
   reliable for both measurements planes, precise probe placement was
   easier for the sagittal plane. Based on these findings, guidelines for
   the reliable measurement of central adiposity using ultrasound are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{It has been long accepted that ocean wave conditions recorded from
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard satellites resolve large scale
   swells. SARs make use of its displacement to achieve fine resolution;
   however the random surface motions can reduce its nominal azimuthal
   resolution. Accordingly, the SAR spectral azimuth response mirrors the
   probability distribution of the radial velocity component of the
   scatters. This effect, quantified in a measure called the azimuth
   cutoff, is estimated by defining a scale based on the fitting of a
   Gaussian function to the radar cross section azimuth spectrum. The
   independent measure provides additional sea state information related to
   the root mean square surface orbital wave velocity. We use data recorded
   from the European Space Agency's ENVISAT advanced SAR in the C-band
   spanning its lifetime 2003-2012. Our purpose is to first establish the
   validity of the azimuth cutoff using both colocated buoys and modeled
   wave data. Some systematic biases are corrected using other SAR derived
   parameters, improving the accuracy of the estimate. Despite our efforts,
   errors exist in the presence of swell, extreme wind waves, and related
   to the wave direction. Under the majority of the sea states the
   parameter is well behaved. As a final point, applications using the wave
   orbital velocities are described in terms of diagnosing a spectral wave
   model and the wave climate. As illustrated, the returned radar signal
   provides useful sea state information that resolves wind speeds, wave
   orbital velocities from the wind waves, and swells.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Vector acoustic intensity provides both the direction and magnitude of
   energy flow at the probe location and is, hence, more informative than
   acoustic pressure measurements. However, this important quantity has
   seen little application previously in aeroacoustics. In the present
   work, an intensity probe, consisting of four microphones, captured the
   radiated field to the sideline and aft of a tethered, full-scale
   military jet aircraft as one engine was operated at multiple engine
   conditions. Data from each probe location provide a frequency-dependent
   map of the sound flow near the aircraft. The vector acoustic intensity
   is estimated using a recently developed processing technique that
   extends the upper-frequency limit of the traditional
   cross-spectrum-based calculations. The dominant intensity vectors are
   traced back to the jet centerline as a method of approximating the
   extent and location of the source region as a function of frequency. As
   expected for jet mixing noise sources, the resulting source region
   estimates contract and move upstream with increasing frequency. A
   comparison of estimated source regions and intensity directionalities
   between military and afterburner engine conditions reveals important
   distinctions in the sound fields. (C) 2015 Institute of Noise Control

Abstract = {{It is a common research finding that conscious thought helps people to
   avoid racial discrimination. These three experiments, however,
   illustrate that conscious thought may increase biased face memory, which
   leads to increased judgment bias (i.e., preferring White to Black
   individuals). In Experiments 1 and 2, university students formed
   impressions of Black and White housemate candidates. They judged the
   candidates either immediately (immediate decision condition), thought
   about their judgments for a few minutes (conscious thought condition),
   or performed an unrelated task for a few minutes (unconscious thought
   condition). Conscious thinkers and immediate decision-makers showed a
   stronger face memory bias than unconscious thinkers, and this mediated
   increased judgment bias, although not all results were significant.
   Experiment 3 used a new, different paradigm and showed that a Black male
   was remembered as darker after a period of conscious thought than after
   a period of unconscious thought. Implications for racial prejudice are
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Alberta, Canada, between 2008 and 2012, to determine the adaptability of
   winter pea and lentil. Two winter pea cultivars, Specter and Windham,
   and one winter lentil cultivar, Morton, were seeded at three fall
   planting dates and three seeding rates. Spring cultivars were grown for
   comparison. In southern Alberta, winter pea and lentil yielded up to
   39\% more than spring types. The highest winter pea yield was achieved
   when planting was completed during the first 3 wk of September. The
   highest winter lentil yield was achieved when planting was completed in
   the second and third weeks of September. Seeding rate had little or no
   impact on yield; therefore, winter pea should be seeded at 75 plants
   m(-2) and winter lentil at 110 plants m(-2). Seed was analyzed to
   compare constituent parameters. There were minor differences in the
   composition of winter and spring pulses. Windham had lower starch but
   higher resistant starch, protein, crude fat, and ash content compared
   with spring pea cultivars. Specter had higher resistant starch but was
   similar to Cutlass for all other parameters. Morton had a higher starch
   content than CDC Redberry; however, starch quality was similar. Winter
   pulses have potential to create new and profitable opportunities for
   growers in the Bow Island and Lethbridge areas of southern Alberta.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality simulator training has become important for acquiring
   arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS (TM)
   has been developed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate face
   and construct validity, executed according to a protocol used previously
   to validate arthroscopic simulators.
   Twenty-seven participants were divided into three groups having
   different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered
   questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the
   simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one
   standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user
   friendliness were further determined by giving participants three
   exercises and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire.
   Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and beginners.
   Median task times were not significantly different for all repetitions
   between novices and intermediates, and between intermediates and
   experts. Median face validity was 8.3 for the outer appearance, 6.5 for
   the intra-articular joint and 4.7 for surgical instruments. Educational
   value and user friendliness were perceived as nonsatisfactory,
   especially because of the lack of tactile feedback.
   The ArthroS (TM) demonstrated construct validity between novices and
   experts, but did not demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements
   should be mainly focused on the development of tactile feedback. It is
   necessary that a newly presented simulator is validated to prove it
   actually contributes to proficiency of skills.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the patterns of change in serum antimullerian
   hormone (AMH) during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and their
   relation to concurrent response and in vitro fertilization (IVF)
   pregnancy outcomes.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Academic medical center.
   Patient(s): A total of 113 consecutive fresh IVF embryo transfer cycles
   from September 1, 2012 through January 1, 2013.
   Intervention(s): Serial serum AMH measurements were analyzed on each day
   that serum estradiol (E-2) was drawn during COH.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Relationship between the rate of COH AMH change
   {[}Delta ng/mL per day] (stratified into tertiles), and ovarian
   response, and pregnancy outcomes.
   Result(s): During COH, AMH declined. Age and ovarian reserve testing
   were associated with the rate of AMH decline (RAD). Women with
   intermediate and minimal RAD had statistically significantly fewer
   follicles >= 12 mm, lower peak serum E-2, fewer oocytes, and inferior
   early embryo development compared with women with the greatest RAD.
   Compared with patients with the lowest RAD, clinical pregnancy was more
   likely in patients with the greatest RAD in the total population
   (adjusted odds ratio 3.51; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03, 11.94) and
   among patients older than 35 years (adjusted odds ratio 6.95; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.09, 44.1).
   Conclusion(s): The rate of COH AMH decline was associated with ovarian
   reserve testing, oocyte yield, embryo progression, and clinical
   pregnancy rates, particularly in women older than 35 years. These
   results suggest that dynamic AMH levels may provide a novel intracycle
   approach to predict response and treatment outcomes after IVF. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient constant-time bilateral filter that
   produces a near-optimal performance tradeoff between approximate
   accuracy and computational complexity without any complicated parameter
   adjustment, called a compressive bilateral filter (CBLF). The
   constant-time means that the computational complexity is independent of
   its filter window size. Although many existing constant-time bilateral
   filters have been proposed step-by-step to pursue a more efficient
   performance tradeoff, they have less focused on the optimal tradeoff for
   their own frameworks. It is important to discuss this question, because
   it can reveal whether or not a constant-time algorithm still has plenty
   room for improvements of performance tradeoff. This paper tackles the
   question from a viewpoint of compressibility and highlights the fact
   that state-of-the-art algorithms have not yet touched the optimal
   tradeoff. The CBLF achieves a near-optimal performance tradeoff by two
   key ideas: 1) an approximate Gaussian range kernel through Fourier
   analysis and 2) a period length optimization. Experiments demonstrate
   that the CBLF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in
   terms of approximate accuracy, computational complexity, and usability.}},

Abstract = {{Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.
   Indonesia places the world's third major leprosy case contributor.
   Surabaya City is a leprosy-endemic area. This study aimed to early
   detect subclinical leprosy based on measurement of anti-PGL-1 antibody
   levels (IgM) and to determine factors related to subclinical leprosy
   among children in Surabaya City. This study was analitic using
   cross-sectional design. The study population was families having leprosy
   sufferers. Samples were selected by simple random sampling technique and
   30 family heads were selected by rapid school and village survey on
   April -May 2015. Data was collected by interview using questionnaire.
   Specimen was taken from peripheral blood of fingertip using capillary
   tube and filter paper method. Serological test was conducted in
   Airlangga University Leprosy Laboratory of Institute of Tropical
   Diseases to determine leprosy-specific antibody levels using ELISA
   method. Seropositive result as cut off point determined 3 >= 245 u/ml
   showed subclinical leprosy. Results of serological test showed eight
   respondents (26.7\%) were positive suffering subclinical leprosy.
   Results of analysis using chi-square test showed contact record (p value
   = 0.034; RP = 4.500) and duration of contact (p value = 0.028; RP =
   5.182) were factors related to subclinical leprosy infection among
   children. Serological test of anti-PGL-1 antibody levels (IgM) was used
   in subclinical leprosy-screening activity.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal power-delay tradeoff is studied for a time-slotted
   independently and identically distributed fading point-to-point link,
   with perfect channel state information at both transmitter and receiver,
   and with random packet arrivals to the transmitter queue. It is assumed
   that the transmitter can control the number of packets served by
   controlling the transmit power in the slot. The optimal tradeoff between
   average power and average delay is analyzed for stationary and monotone
   transmitter policies. For such policies, an asymptotic lower bound on
   the minimum average delay of the packets is obtained, when average
   transmitter power approaches the minimum average power required for
   transmitter queue stability. The asymptotic lower bound on the minimum
   average delay is obtained from geometric upper bounds on the stationary
   distribution of the queue length. This approach, which uses geometric
   upper bounds, also leads to an intuitive explanation of the asymptotic
   behavior of average delay. The asymptotic lower bounds, along with
   previously known asymptotic upper bounds, are used to identify three new
   cases where the order of the asymptotic behavior differs from that
   obtained from a previously considered approximate model, in which the
   transmit power is a strictly convex function of real valued service
   batch size for every fade state.}},

Abstract = {{Despite rapidly growing understandings and dependency on single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), highly variable autosomal short tandem
   repeats (STRs) are still regarded as the most established method to
   differentiate individuals at forensic level. Here with large number of
   various ethnic groups we undertook this study to reveal the genetic
   structure of the most densely populated part of South Asia i.e. the
   Bangladesh. The purpose of this work was to estimate population
   parameters based on the allele frequencies obtained for 15 polymorphic
   autosomal STR loci investigated in caste and tribal populations from
   Bangladesh (n = 706). We compared the results in a broader context by
   merging 24 different populations of Asia to pertain their affinity.
   Various statistical analyses suggested a clear cut demarcation of tribal
   and non-tribal in Bangladesh. Moreover, beside the phylogenetic
   structure of the studied populations, it is found that the mean
   heterozygosity value was highest among the populations of Bangladesh,
   likely because of gene flow from different directions. However,
   Tonchangya, Adi and Khumi showed sign of genetic isolation and reduced
   diversity, possibly as a result of genetic drift and/or strong founder
   effects working on small endogamous populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Dimensional structure and correlates of posttraumatic stress symptoms

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{178-185}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous
   construct, and some have suggested that PTSD triggered by acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS) may differ from PTSD due to prototypical traumas.
   Methods: We conducted the first examination of the latent structure of
   PTSD symptoms after suspected ACS in 399 adults in the REactions to
   Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study, an observational cohort
   study of patients recruited from the emergency department during
   evaluation for ACS. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we compared the
   4-factor dysphoria, 4-factor numbing, and 5-factor dysphoric arousal
   models of PTSD.
   Results: Although all models fit well, the dysphoria model was selected
   as the best-fitting model. Further, there was measurement invariance of
   the dysphoria model by sex. PTSD dimensions evidenced differential
   associations with indicators of threat perception during ACS evaluation
   and adherence to cardiprotective medication.
   Limitations: One limitation of this investigation is the use of
   self-report measures. In addition, only one-third of the sample was
   diagnosed with ACS at discharge; the remaining participants received
   diagnoses such as chest pain without a cardiac diagnosis, another
   symptom/disease process (e.g, hypertensive chronic kidney disease), or
   another cardiac disease.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that suspected ACS-related PTSD symptoms
   are best-represented by a 4-factor structure distinguishing between
   specific (e.g., re-experiencing) and non-specific (dysphoria) symptoms
   of PTSD that has received support in the broader PTSD literature. (C)

Abstract = {{Adrenoreceptors (ARs) are widely expressed and play essential roles
   throughout the body. Different subtype adrenoceptors elicit distinct
   effects on cell proliferation, but knowledge remains scarce about the
   subtype-specific effects of 2-ARs on the proliferation of embryonic
   pluripotent stem (PS) cells that represent different characteristics of
   proliferation and cell cycle regulation with the somatic cells. Herein,
   we identified a 2-AR/AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in embryonic PS cells
   and found that the pathway stimulation inhibited proliferation and cell
   cycle progression involving modulating the stem cell growth and cycle
   regulatory machinery. Embryonic stem (ES) cells and embryonal carcinoma
   stem (ECS) cells expressed functional -ARs coupled to AC/cAMP/PKA
   signaling. Agonistic activation of -ARs led to embryonic PS cell cycle
   arrest and proliferation inhibition. Pharmacological and genetic
   analyzes using receptor subtype blocking and RNA interference approaches
   revealed that this effect selectively depended on 2-AR signaling
   involving the regulation of AKT, ERK, Rb, and Cyclin E molecules. Better
   understanding of the effects of 2-ARs on embryonic PS cell proliferation
   and cycle progression may provide new insights into stem cell biology
   and afford the opportunity for exploiting more selective ligands
   targeting the receptor subtype for the modulation of stem cells. J.

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are a kind of nanostructured semiconductor crystals
   with the size range of 1-10 nm. Their unique photophysical properties
   and potential toxicity to human health have aroused wide concern of
   scientists and general public. However, the interaction mechanism of QPs
   on human serum albumin (HSA, the vital protein in human blood) from both
   structural and functional perspectives is rarely reported. In the
   present work, effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine-capped CdTe quantum dots
   with fluorescence emission peak at 612 nm (QD5-612) on the conformation
   and function of HSA were investigated by spectroscopic methods,
   molecular docking study and esterase activity assay. The hydrophobic
   interaction between HSA and QDs-612 was spontaneous with the binding
   constants calculated to be 6.85 x 10(5) L mol(-1) (298 K) and 8.89 x
   10(5) L mol(-1) (308 K). The binding of QDs-612 to HSA induced the
   static quenching of fluorescence and the changes of secondary structure
   and microenvironment of Tyr-411 residue, which resulted in serious
   decrease on the hydrolysis of substrate p-nitrophenylacetate in esterase
   activity assay of HSA. This work confirms the possibility on direct
   interaction of QDs-612 with HSA and obtains a possible mechanism of
   relationship between conformation and function of HSA. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Investigating the Effect of Improved Fracture Conductivity on Production
   Performance of Hydraulically Fractured Wells: Field-Case Studies and
   Numerical Simulations}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional reservoirs require extensive hydraulic-fracturing
   treatments to produce fluids economically and efficiently. The main
   purpose of such treatments is to create complex fracture networks with
   high-conductivity paths deeper into the nonstimulated reservoir regions.
   Proppants play an important role in maintaining good-quality fracture
   conductivities, which then greatly affect long-term production
   performance. In addition, research on proppants has shown a reduction in
   conductivities under downhole stresses and multiphase-flow behaviours.
   Therefore, it is important to study the effect different proppants and
   conductivities have on production performance through actual field
   cases.
   To evaluate the production performance of wells completed with different
   proppants, the authors proposed an integrated work flow for
   characterization and simulation of unconventional reservoirs. This work
   flow is unique because of the stochastic fracture-network-generation
   algorithms and improved unstructured-grid-generation techniques. Both
   analysis of field-production data and numerical simulations were
   performed on eight wells in the CAPA field of North Dakota. For the
   field-data analysis, three public-data resources were reviewed to
   prepare a summary of reservoir properties, fracture properties, proppant
   properties, and production history. For the numerical simulations, all
   the wells were modelled and simulated with the proposed work flow.
   Finally, sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the
   effects of fracture conductivities and natural fractures.
   After completing the field-case studies and reservoir simulations, it
   was concluded that with the same fracture design, higher fracture
   conductivity improves production performance. Pumping a smaller volume
   of upgraded proppants with higher conductivity not only improves
   long-term production performance, but also justifies the additional
   costs and reduces the overall operation time of the entire
   hydraulic-fracturing job. The stimulated reservoir volume was greatly
   increased, as was the production performance, where natural fractures
   exist.
   In this paper, field-data analysis was applied in the Bakken to
   demonstrate the integrated unconventional work flow. The proposed
   unstructured-gridding algorithms can be incorporated into any
   preprocessor to handle complex networks. Reservoir, fracture, and
   proppant characterization and reservoir simulation of the field cases
   can help engineers prepare and interpret simulation input and output.}},

Abstract = {{Since the solidification of water droplet is the initial and essential
   process in the whole process of frosting, a model is developed by the
   lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) that applies the velocity and temperature

   phase transition in the present model are both based on the
   pseudo-potential model combined with the en-thalpy formation. By this LB
   model, the solidification process is simulated in form of temperature
   and solid phase variations in water droplet on cold flat plate, and the
   shape of solid phase in freezing can also be predicted. In addition, we
   apply the present LB model to preliminarily study the frost formation
   process. Numerical results agree well with our experimental data. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the accuracy of initial biopsy in the diagnosis of
   basal cell carcinoma (BCC) histologic subtype.
   Methods: Retrospective histopathologic review of patients with a
   diagnosis of primary periocular BCC from 2006 to 2013 inclusive.
   Results: A total of 174 primary BCCs were identified. BCCs were
   classified as nodular, superficial, or aggressive (including mixed cases
   with an aggressive component). Punch biopsies were used in 41\% of
   cases, while the remaining patients underwent shave or incision
   biopsies. The final histologic subtypes at excision were nodular (59\%),
   superficial (7\%), nodular and superficial (7\%), and aggressive (51\%).
   The overall concordance between the BCC subtype identified in the biopsy
   specimen and the subsequent excision specimen was 54\%. In total, there
   were 51 cases (29\%) of BCC, which included aggressive subtypes, of
   which 52\% of initial biopsies failed to detect an aggressive component.
   There were 45 cases (26\%) of mixed BCC, and an aggressive histologic
   subtype was present in 73\% of these cases.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of initial biopsy for BCC histologic subtype
   at excision is highest for nodular BCC. For aggressive BCC, biopsy was
   able to detect the aggressive component in only 48\% of cases. This may
   have implications for choice of treatment modality.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIt has been shown that 14-3-3 sigma serves as a tumor
   suppressor gene, and is downregulated in various tumor tissues. However,
   the role of 14-3-3 sigma during the initiation and progression of lung
   squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is not well understood.
   MethodsThe expression status of 14-3-3 sigma in archival tissue samples
   from 40 lung SqCC patients (36 with normal bronchia, 19 squamous
   metaplasia, and 17 dysplasia/carcinoma in situ, in their tissue samples)
   was examined by immunohistochemical analysis. The proliferation rate and
   tumor formation ability of the H520 cell transfected with 14-3-3 sigma
   was tested with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and nude mice
   subcutaneous injection, respectively.
   ResultsIn the normal bronchial epithelia, 14-3-3 sigma was highly
   expressed, whereas it was significantly decreased in precancerous and
   cancerous tissues. Compared with matched invasive cancer tissues, the
   expression level of 14-3-3 sigma in squamous metaplasia was
   significantly higher (P = 0.049), while that in dysplasia/carcinoma in
   situ showed no significant changes (P = 0.135). Statistical analysis
   showed that the expression level of 14-3-3 sigma in tumor tissue was
   associated with the differentiation grade of the tumor (P = 0.001) and
   the prognosis of the patient (P = 0.003). The overexpression of 14-3-3
   sigma significantly suppressed the proliferation of H520 cells in vitro
   and in vivo.
   ConclusionThe inactivation of 14-3-3 sigma may be a very early event in
   tumorigenesis and could facilitate the initiation and progression of
   lung SqCC in a sustainable way.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury often
   occurs during liver surgery and may cause liver failure. Our previous
   studies revealed that Mindin is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic
   stroke. However, the function of Mindin in hepatic I/R injury remains
   unknown.
   Methods: Partial hepatic warm ischemia was induced in parallel in global
   Mindin knockout mice (Mindin KO), hepatocyte-specific Mindin knockdown
   mice, hepatocyte-specific Mindin transgenic mice (Mindin TG), myeloid
   cell-specific Mindin TG mice (LysM-Mindin TG), and their corresponding
   controls, followed by reperfusion. Hepatic histology, serum
   aminotransferase, inflammatory cytokines, and hepatocyte apoptosis and
   proliferation were examined to assess liver injury. The molecular
   mechanisms of Mindin function were explored in vivo and in vitro.
   Results: Mindin KO and hepatocyte-specific Mindin knockdown mice
   exhibited less liver damage than controls, with smaller necrotic areas
   and lower serum transaminase levels. Mindin deficiency significantly
   suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine and chemokine
   production, and hepatocyte apoptosis, but increased hepatocyte
   proliferation following hepatic I/R injury. In contrast, the opposite
   pathological and biochemical changes were observed in
   hepatocyte-specific Mindin TG mice, whereas no significant changes in
   liver damage were found in LysM-Mindin TG mice compared to
   non-transgenic controls. Mechanistically, Akt signaling was activated in
   livers of Mindin KO mice but was suppressed in Mindin TG mice. Most
   importantly, Akt inhibitor treatment blocked the protective effect of
   Mindin deficiency on hepatic I/R injury.
   Conclusions: Mindin is a novel modulator of hepatic I/R injury through
   regulating inflammatory responses, as well as hepatocyte apoptosis and
   proliferation via inactivation of the Akt signaling pathway. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In an acyclic multicast network, it is well known that a linear network
   coding solution over GF(q) exists when q is sufficiently large. In
   particular, for each prime power q no smaller than the number of
   receivers, a linear solution over GF(q) can be efficiently constructed.
   In this paper, we reveal that a linear solution over a given finite
   field does not necessarily imply the existence of a linear solution over
   all larger finite fields. In particular, we prove by construction that:
   1) for every omega >= 3, there is a multicast network with source
   outdegree omega linearly solvable over GF(7) but not over GF(8), and
   another multicast network linearly solvable over GF(16) but not over
   GF(17); 2) there is a multicast network linearly solvable over GF(5) but
   not over such GF(q) that q > 5 is a Mersenne prime plus 1, which can be
   extremely large; 3) a multicast network linearly solvable over GF(q(m1))
   and over GF(q(m2)) is not necessarily linearly solvable over
   GF(q(m1+m2)); and 4) there exists a class of multicast networks with a
   set T of receivers such that the minimum field size q(min) for a linear
   solution over GF(q(min)) is lower bounded by Theta(root vertical bar T
   vertical bar), but not every larger field than GF(q(min)) suffices to
   yield a linear solution. The insight brought from this paper is that not
   only the field size but also the order of subgroups in the
   multiplicative group of a finite field affects the linear solvability of
   a multicast network.}},

Abstract = {{Interannual variability of thermal front west of Luzon Island during the
   winter of 1993-2013 is examined with the method of singular value
   decomposition (SVD) and a suite of satellite measurements in this paper.
   It is found that both the area and intensity of the thermal front west
   of Luzon Island show apparent interannual variability. Further study
   based on SVD shows that the interannual variability of the thermal front
   is highly associated with El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and
   the correlation coefficient between Nino3.4 index and the first
   Principal Component (PC1) of thermal front can reach -0.65. The
   mechanism can be described as follows. In El Nino (La Nina) years, the
   East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is weakened (enhanced), inducing weaker
   (stronger) local wind stress curl (WSC) west of Luzon Island, and
   resulting in weakened (enhanced) Luzon cold eddy, which finally leads to
   the weakening (enhancement) of the thermal front.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Zero-valent iron has received considerable attention for its potential
   application in the removal of heavy metals from water. This paper
   considers the possibility of removal of zinc ions from water by causing
   precipitates to form on the surface of iron. The chemical states and the
   atomic concentrations of solids which have formed on the surface of
   zero-valent iron as well as the type of the deposited polycrystalline
   substances have been analyzed with the use of X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The BET
   surface area, the pH at point of zero charge (pHPZC), the ORP of the
   solutions, and the pH and chemical concentrations in the solutions have
   also been measured. Furthermore, the paper also considers the
   possibility of release of zinc from the precipitates to demineralised
   water in changing physicochemical and chemical conditions. In a wide
   range of pH values, ZnxFe(3-x)O(4) (where x <= 1) was the main compound
   resulting from the removal of zinc in ionic form from water. In neutral
   and alkaline conditions, the adsorption occurred as an additional

   2011, and bottom-surfacesediments for TOC in the autumn of 2010 were
   collected from the Black Sea coastline of Turkey. According to the
   results, concentrations of AS in seawaterwerechanged withseasons,
   regions and distance from the anthropogenic sources including industrial
   and domestic discharges. Generally, winter values of ASwere higher than
   autumn at the nearshore stations of the eastern and middle Black Sea
   coasts. Maximum AS values(except Yenice River mouth) were measuredin
   surface seawater of Ordu and in bottom seawater of Sile in the autumnand
   in surface and bottom seawater of Bafra in the winter. Additionally, the
   highest amount of AS in both seasons near Yenice River mouth showed the
   influence of the river. On the other hand, the highest amount of TOC was
   obtained in the sediment of Igneada (9.73\%) and the C/N ratiosindicated
   that organic matters in the sediment samplescould berelatedtoboth marine
   and terrestrial sources. Anionic surfactant
   valueswerepositivelycorrelated(r=0.8-0.9) with total suspended solid,

Abstract = {{Identification of extracellular conductive pilus-like structures (PLS)
   i.e. microbial nanowires has spurred great interest among scientists due
   to their potential applications in the fields of biogeochemistry,
   bioelectronics, bioremediation etc. Using conductive atomic force
   microscopy, we identified microbial nanowires in Microcystis aeruginosa
   PCC 7806 which is an aerobic, photosynthetic microorganism. We also
   confirmed the earlier finding that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 produces
   microbial nanowires. In contrast to the use of highly instrumented
   continuous flow reactors for Synechocystis reported earlier, we
   identified simple and optimum culture conditions which allow increased
   production of nanowires in both test cyanobacteria. Production of these
   nanowires in Synechocystis and Microcystis were found to be sensitive to
   the availability of carbon source and light intensity. These structures
   seem to be proteinaceous in nature and their diameter was found to be
   4.5-7 and 8.5-11 nm in Synechocystis and M. aeruginosa, respectively.
   Characterization of Synechocystis nanowires by transmission electron
   microscopy and biochemical techniques confirmed that they are type IV
   pili (TFP) while nanowires in M. aeruginosa were found to be similar to
   an unnamed protein (GenBank : CAO90693.1). Modelling studies of the
   Synechocystis TFP subunit i.e. PilA1 indicated that strategically placed
   aromatic amino acids may be involved in electron transfer through these
   nanowires. This study identifies PLS from Microcystis which can act as
   nanowires and supports the earlier hypothesis that microbial nanowires
   are widespread in nature and play diverse roles.}},

Abstract = {{Salts of the antiviral drug Arbidol (umifenovir) with pharmaceutically
   relevant benzoate and salicylate anions were obtained, and their crystal
   structures were described. For Arbidol salicylate, an unstable solvate
   with acetonitrile was also found and characterized. Analysis of the
   conformational preferences of the Arbidol molecule in the crystal
   structures showed that it adopts two types of conformations, namely open
   and closed, both of which correspond to local conformational energy
   minima of the isolated molecule. Thermal stability of the Arbidol
   salicylate solvates with chloroform and acetonitrile was analyzed by
   means of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric
   analysis. The standard thermodynamic functions of the salt formation
   were determined. The Gibbs energy change of the process was found to be
   negative, indicating that the formation of the salts from individual
   components is a spontaneous process. The dissolution study of the
   Arbidol salts performed in aqueous buffer solutions with pH 1.2 and 6.8
   showed that both salts dissolve incongruently to form an Arbidol
   hydrochloride monohydrate at pH 1.2 and an Arbidol base at pH 6.8,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is of concern to the pharmaceutical
   industry, and reliable preclinical screens are required. Previously, we
   established an in vitro bile acid-dependent hepatotoxicity assay that
   mimics cholestatic DILI in vivo. Here, we confirmed that this assay can
   predict cholestatic DILI in clinical situations by comparing in vitro
   cytotoxicity data with in vivo risk. For 38 drugs, the frequencies of
   abnormal increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), transaminases,
   gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma GT), and bilirubin were collected
   from interview forms. Drugs with frequencies of serum marker increases
   higher than 1\% were classified as high DILI risk compounds. In vitro
   cytotoxicity was assessed by monitoring lactate dehydrogenase release
   from rat and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCRHs and SCHHs)
   incubated with the test drugs (50 mu M) for 24 hours in the absence or
   presence of a bile acids mixture. Receiver operating characteristic
   analyses gave optimal cutoff toxicity values of 19.5\% and 9.2\% for ALP
   and transaminases in SCRHs, respectively. Using this cutoff, high- and
   low-risk drugs were separated with 65.4-78.6\% sensitivity and
   66.7-79.2\% specificity. Good separation was also achieved using SCHHs.
   In conclusion, cholestatic DILI risk can be successfully predicted using
   a sandwich-cultured hepatocyte-based assay.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{25-33}},

Abstract = {{Muscodor cinnamomi was selected and investigated for its in vitro
   ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to solubilize different
   toxic metal (Ca, Co, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn)-containing insoluble minerals and
   tolerance to metals, herbicides and an insecticide. The results
   indicated that this fungus is able to produce IAA (45.36 +/- 2.40 mu g
   ml(-1)) in liquid media. This phytohormone stimulated coleoptile
   elongation, and increased seed germination and root elongation of tested
   plants. The metal tolerance and solubilizing ability depended on the
   type of insoluble minerals. M. cinnamomi showed the highest growth
   tolerance on Ca-containing media at 150 mM, followed by Zn-containing
   media at 100 mM and Cd-containing media at 10 mM. This fungus tolerated
   the three herbicides (2,4-D-dimethylammonium, glyphosate and paraquat
   dichloride) and an insecticide (methomyl) at the recommended dosages for
   field application. Moreover, M. cinnamomi completely controlled
   Rhizoctonia solani AG-2 root rot in tomato plants, and increased root
   length, shoot dry weight and root dry weight. This is the first report
   of in vitro IAA production, solubilization of insoluble metal minerals,
   and tolerance to herbicides, an insecticide and Metals as well as the
   plant growth promoting ability of M. cinnamomi. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{For outdoor hydrogen sensing using a quartz friction pressure gauge
   (Q-gauge), we investigated the influence of ambient temperature on the
   output from a Q-gauge, because the change in the baseline of the Q-gauge
   output might be comparable in degree to the changes resulting from
   hydrogen leakage, which results in an error for hydrogen sensing. At
   constant relative humidity, the output from the Q-gauge changed with the
   change in temperature within the range 15-50 degrees C. The largest
   differences in the output with respect to temperature corresponded to
   those seen in hydrogen leakage with about 6 vol\% hydrogen
   concentration, judging from the correlation between the change in the
   Q-gauge and hydrogen concentration. 6 vol\% hydrogen concentration is
   clearly higher than the necessary minimum for detection of hydrogen
   concentration because one-fourth of the low explosive level hydrogen
   concentration is 1 vol\%; therefore, temperature calibration is
   necessary for outdoor use of this hydrogen sensing method. We tried to
   suppress the influence of temperature on the Q-gauge output using the
   temperature dependence of the experimental output. We found that the
   influence of temperature could be reduced to change the output by less
   than 1 vol\% hydrogen concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: The study objective was to perform a randomized trial of
   brain protection during total aortic arch replacement and identify the
   best way to assess brain injury.
   Methods: From June 2003 to January 2010, 121 evaluable patients were
   randomized to retrograde (n = 60) or antegrade (n = 61) brain perfusion
   during hypothermic circulatory arrest. We assessed the sensitivity of
   clinical neurologic evaluation, brain imaging, and neurocognitive
   testing performed preoperatively and 4 to 6 months postoperatively to
   detect brain injury.
   Results: A total of 29 patients (24\%) experienced neurologic events.
   Clinical stroke was evident in 1 patient (0.8\%), and visual changes
   were evident in 2 patients; all had brain imaging changes. A total of 14
   of 95 patients (15\%) undergoing both preoperative and postoperative
   brain imaging had evidence of new white or gray matter changes; 10 of
   the 14 patients had neurocognitive testing, but only 2 patients
   experienced decline. A total of 17 of 96 patients (18\%) undergoing both
   preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive testing manifested
   declines of 2 or more reliable change indexes; of these 17, 11 had
   neither imaging changes nor clinical events. Thirty-day mortality was
   0.8\% (1/121), with no neurologic deaths and a similar prevalence of
   neurologic events after retrograde and antegrade brain perfusion (22/60,
   37\% and 15/61, 25\%, respectively; P = .2).
   Conclusions: Although this randomized clinical trial revealed similar
   neurologic outcomes after retrograde or antegrade brain perfusion for
   total aortic arch replacement, clinical examination for postprocedural
   neurologic events is insensitive, brain imaging detects more events, and
   neurocognitive testing detects even more. Future neurologic assessments
   for cardiovascular procedures should include not only clinical
   examination but also brain imaging studies, neurocognitive testing, and
   long-term assessment.}},

   current divider}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Kinetic, time-dependent, electromagnetic, particle-in-cell simulations
   of the inductive current divider are presented. The inductive current
   divider is a passive method for controlling the trajectory of an
   intense, hollow electron beam using a vacuum structure that inductively
   splits the beam's return current. The current divider concept was
   proposed and studied theoretically in a previous publication
   {[}Swanekamp et al., Phys. Plasmas 22, 023107 (2015)]. A central post
   carries a portion of the return current (I1), while the outer conductor
   carries the remainder (I-2) with the injected beam current given by I-b
   = I-1 + I-2. The simulations are in agreement with the theory which
   predicts that the total force on the beam trajectory is proportional to
   (I-2 - I-1) and the force on the beam envelope is proportional to Ib.
   Independent control over both the current density and the beam angle at
   the target is possible by choosing the appropriate current-divider
   geometry. The root-mean-square (RMS) beam emittance (epsilon(RMS))
   varies as the beam propagates through the current divider to the target.
   For applications where control of the beam trajectory is desired and the

   is endogenous and selective, by which we mean that bidders with higher
   values are more likely to enter. In a model where potential bidders are
   symmetric, we show that three alternative designs can significantly
   outperform the `standard auction with simultaneous and free entry' when
   entry is selective. When bidders are asymmetric, we show that level of
   bid preference that maximizes a seller's revenues is significantly
   affected by the degree of selection. We also describe recent empirical
   and econometric work that shows that the degree of selection can be
   identified and estimated using standard types of auction data. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the influence of limestone
   particle size in the diets with different contents of Ca on the
   biomechanical and geometrical measurements of tibia and femur bones,
   digestibility of nutrients, and selected biochemical blood variables.
   The experiment was conducted with 108 laying hens, allocated to 9
   treatments of 6 replicates (cages), with 2 layers in each cage. A 3 x 3
   factorial arrangement, with 3 dietary concentrations of Ca (3.20\%,
   3.70\%, and 4.20\%) and 3 levels of dietary substitutions (0, 25, and
   50\%) of fine particles of limestone (FPL; diameter, 0.2-0.6 mm) with
   large particles of limestone (LPL; diameter, 1.0 to 1.4 mm), was used.
   The hens were fed with experimental diets from 25 to 70 wk of age. At wk
   45 a balance experiment was conducted, and after termination of the
   experiment, i.e., at wk 70, tibia and femur bones, and blood samples,
   were collected for analysis. Neither dietary Ca concentration nor
   limestone particle size had an effect on dry matter, organic matter,
   ether extract, N-free extracts, crude fiber, and crude ash
   digestibility, and P retention and excretion; however, Ca excretion
   increased linearly and Ca relative retention decreased linearly with
   increasing Ca dietary concentration (P < 0.05). No effect of limestone
   particle size on tibia and femur biomechanical and geometrical
   measurements, tibia and femur mineralization, serum alkaline phosphatase
   activity, and serum Ca and P concentration, was observed. Increased
   dietary Ca concentration enhanced linearly tibia and femur bone breaking
   strength, yielding load, stiffness, and Ca concentration (P < 0.05).
   Serum alkaline phosphatase activity decreased linearly with increasing
   Ca dietary concentration (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this
   study demonstrated that a content of 3.20-3.70\% Ca in a layer's diet is
   not sufficient through the entire laying cycle to maintain optimal bone
   quality; however, partial substitution of fine- with large-particle
   limestone does not improve Ca and P retention and bones quality
   variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently isolated spore-forming pigmented marine bacteria Bacillus
   indicus HU36 are sources of oxygenated carotenoids with original
   structures (about fifteen distinct yellow and orange pigments with
   acylated d-glucosyl groups). In this study, we evaluated the stability
   (sensitivity to iron-induced autoxidation) and antioxidant activity
   (inhibition of iron-induced lipid peroxidation) of combinations of
   bacterial HU36 carotenoids with the bacterial vitamin menaquinone MQ-7
   and with phenolic antioxidants (vitamin E, chlorogenic acid, rutin).
   Unexpectedly, MQ-7 strongly improves the ability of HU36 carotenoids to
   inhibit Fe-II-induced lipid peroxidation, although MQ-7 was not consumed
   in the medium. We propose that their interaction modifies the carotenoid
   antioxidant mechanism(s), possibly by allowing carotenoids to scavenge
   the initiating radicals. For comparison, -carotene and lycopene in
   combination were shown to exhibit a slightly higher stability toward
   iron-induced autoxidation, as well as an additive antioxidant activity
   as compared to the carotenoids, individually. HU36 carotenoids and
   phenolic antioxidants displayed synergistic activities in the inhibition
   of linoleic acid peroxidation induced by heme iron, but not by free
   iron. Synergism could arise from antioxidants interacting via electron
   transfer through the porphyrin nucleus of heme iron. Overall, combining
   antioxidants acting via complementary mechanisms could be the key for
   optimizing the activity of this bacterial carotenoid cocktail.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation of a low-dimensional electron system over liquid helium
   was performed. It was shown that inclusion of an additional potential
   acting in the plane of the charge sheet leads to compression of the
   system in the direction of the external force. Such a potential arises
   in experiment when a system of surface electrons is formed over a
   profiled substrate where the potential is proportional to the holding
   electric field. It was found that in this case the system passes
   sequentially through the configurations consisting of several linear
   chains and undergoes a transition from the state of two-dimensional
   electron crystal to the zigzag configuration earlier predicted by
   Chaplik. With further increase in the holding field, the system becomes
   a single linear chain. The dispersion relations for the collective
   plasma oscillations of the zigzag configuration of electrons were
   calculated by the method of the equations of motion. It was found that
   one of the longitudinal oscillation modes is acoustic, whiles the other
   is optical. Both transverse oscillation modes were found to be optical.
   The results were compared with the dispersion relations earlier obtained
   for a single chain of electrons. It was shown that the dispersion
   relations of transverse plasma oscillations are more stable than the
   transverse mode of the oscillations of a single chain. The influence of
   magnetic field on the spectrum of plasma oscillations of the zigzag
   configuration of electrons was studied. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe invivo levels of inflammatory mediators in chronic atopic
   dermatitis (AD) skin are not well-defined due to the lack of a
   non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling technique.
   ObjectivesTo investigate the cytokine milieu in interstitial fluid (ISF)
   collected from chronic lesional AD skin as compared to ISF from
   non-lesional AD skin and/or healthy donor skin.
   MethodsISF was obtained using a minimally invasive technique of creating
   micropores in the skin by a laser, and harvesting ISF through
   aspiration. We determined the levels of 33 cytokines by Luminex and
   ELISA in ISF and plasma from sixteen AD patients and twelve healthy
   individuals. In seven AD patients, we analysed the IL-13, IL-31, IL-17,
   IL-22 and IFN- production by T cells isolated from lesional skin. AD
   patients were genotyped for the filaggrin gene (FLG)-null mutations
   2282del4, R501X, R2447X and S3247X.
   ResultsTwenty-five of 33 examined mediators were detected in the ISF.
   The levels of IL-1, IL-1, IL-18, IL-1RA, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-,
   RANTES(CCL-5), MIG(CXCL-9), IP-10(CXCL-10), TARC(CCL-17), VEGF and G-CSF
   showed significant differences between either lesional, non-lesional
   and/or healthy skin. IP-10 levels in ISF from lesional and non-lesional
   AD skin showed significant correlation with IP-10 blood levels. IP-10
   also showed a significant correlation with clinical severity (SCORAD),
   as did IL-13. Levels of both IP-10 and IL-13 were more pronounced in
   patients with FLG-null mutations. Furthermore, FLG-null mutation
   carriers had more severe AD.
   ConclusionThe presented minimally invasive technique is a valuable tool
   to determine the invivo cytokine profile of AD skin.}},

   chromatography with conductometric detection was used for quantitative
   analysis. The efficiency of fluoride extraction from the cellulose

   urban air particle matter SRM-1648a. The best results for extraction
   were obtained when water and the anionic surfactant
   N-Cetyl-N-N-N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used in an
   ultrasonic bath. The limits of detection and quantification for the
   whole procedure were 8 mu g/L and 24 mu g/L, respectively. The linear
   range of calibration was 0.01-10 mg/L, which corresponds to 0.0001-0.1

Title = {{A potential role for 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X in metastasis of bladder
   urothelial carcinoma}},
Journal = {{UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: It is widely accepted that sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) and sialyl
   Lewis A (sLeA, also known as CA 19-9) glycans expressed on cancer cells
   function in E-selectin-mediated metastasis. Recently, it was reported
   that 6-sulfo sLeX glycans detected by the MECA-79 monoclonal antibody
   are expressed in roughly a quarter of gastric adenocarcinoma cases, and
   that these cases show a poorer prognosis than MECA-79-negative cases do.
   The present study was undertaken to assess expression of 6-sulfo sLeX
   glycans in bladder urothelial carcinoma and evaluate potential clinical
   implications.
   Materials and methods: We analyzed 78 specimens representing bladder
   urothelial carcinoma, as well as 4 bladder urothelial carcinoma cell
   lines, by immunostaining with a battery of anticarbohydrate antibodies.
   We also undertook an E-selectin.IgM chimera binding assay to assess
   E-selectin binding to 6-sulfo sLeX expressed on bladder urothelial
   carcinoma cells and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction and complementary DNA transfection to determine which
   N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferases function in 6-sulfo sLeX
   biosynthesis in those cells. Finally, we performed
   double-immunofluorescence staining for MECA-79 and either CD3 or CD8 to
   evaluate potential association between high endothelial venule
   (HEV)-like vessels and tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes.
   Results: 6-Sulfo sLeX glycans were expressed in similar to 20\% of
   bladder urothelial carcinoma cases, particularly in plasmacytoid and
   micropapillary variants. Positive cells were also bound by
   E-selectin.IgM chimeras in a calcium-dependent manner. Transcripts
   encoding N-acetylducosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase-2 were detected
   preferentially in HT-1197 bladder urothelial carcinoma cells expressing
   6-sulfo sLeX, and transfection of the enzyme complementary DNA into
   HT-1376 cells, which do not express 6-sulfo sLeX glycans, resulted in
   cell surface expression of 6-sulfo sLeX. Furthermore, 6-sulfo sLeX
   glycans were expressed in HEV-like vessels induced in and around
   lymphocyte aggregates formed near carcinoma cell nests. These HEV-like
   vessel-associated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were composed primarily
   of CD3(+) T cells, with a fraction of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that 6-sulfo sLeX glycans likely play
   2 roles in bladder urothelial carcinoma progression: one in lymphocyte
   recruitment to enhance antitumor immune responses, and the other in
   E-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelial cells,
   which is potentially associated with metastasis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain but also an
   important source of building blocks for proteins, lipids, and nucleic
   acids. Little is known about the use of glucose for biosynthesis in
   tissues at the cellular level. We demonstrate that local cerebral
   metabolic activity can be mapped in mouse brain tissue by quantitatively
   imaging the biosynthetic products deriving from {[}U-C-13]glucose
   metabolism using a combination of in situ electron microscopy and
   secondary ion mass-spectroscopy (NanoSIMS). Images of the C-13-label
   incorporated into cerebral ultrastructure with ca. 100 nm resolution
   allowed us to determine the timescale on which the metabolic products of
   glucose are incorporated into different cells, their sub-compartments
   and organelles. These were mapped in astrocytes and neurons in the
   different layers of the motor cortex. We see evidence for high metabolic
   activity in neurons via the nucleus C-13 enrichment. We observe that in
   all the major cell compartments, such as e.g. nucleus and Golgi
   apparatus, neurons incorporate substantially higher concentrations of
   C-13-label than astrocytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for regulating the concentrations of specific cellular proteins

   protein degradation by the proteasome is receiving increasing attention.
   Efficient proteasomal protein degradation requires a degron with
   two,components: a ubiquitin tag that is recognied by :the proteasome and
   a disordered region at which the proteasoine engages the substrate and
   initiates degradation. Here we show that degradation rates can be
   regulated by modulating the disordered initiation region by the binding
   of modifier molecules, in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that
   artificial modulation of proteasome initiation is a versatile method for
   conditionally inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of Specific

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas is often complicated
   because of adherence of craniopharyngiomas to adjacent brain structures.
   A strategy involving neuroendoscopic procedures followed by stereotactic
   radiotherapy is less invasive, avoiding brain damage. However, long-term
   follow-up of this strategy has not been investigated in depth.
   METHODS: Cystic craniopharyngiomas in 9 patients were treated with
   neuroendoscopic cyst aspiration and fenestration, followed by
   fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT). The neuroendoscopic
   procedure focused on widening of cyst fenestration and extensive
   irrigation of the cyst contents. FSRT was performed using 6 fixed beams,
   an 8-mm margin to cover the gross tumor volume with a 95\% isodose line,
   and a target delivered dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 72.9 months. Tumor control was
   achieved in 8 of 9 patients (88.9\%). Marked tumor volume reduction was
   obtained with the neuroendoscopic procedure alone (26.1\%) at 6 months
   (20.4\%), 1 year (11.0\%), and 2 years (3.1\%). One recurrent case
   showed multilobulated cysts, and a second surgery was required 1 year
   after the treatment. Clinical symptoms such as headache and visual
   disruption were rapidly alleviated after the neuroendoscopic procedure.
   No new visual disturbances, endocrinopathy, or hypothalamic dysfunction
   was observed during follow up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopic cyst aspiration and fenestration followed
   by FSRT is a less invasive, powerful strategy for treating adult cystic
   craniopharyngiomas.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development birth cohort was
   designed to elucidate interactions between environment and genetics
   underlying development of asthma and allergy. Over 3600 pregnant mothers
   were recruited from the general population in four provinces with
   diverse environments. The child is followed to age 5 years, with
   prospective characterization of diverse exposures during this critical
   period. Key exposure domains include indoor and outdoor air pollutants,
   inhalation, ingestion and dermal uptake of chemicals, mold, dampness,
   biological allergens, pets and pests, housing structure, and living
   behavior, together with infections, nutrition, psychosocial environment,
   and medications. Assessments of early life exposures are focused on
   those linked to inflammatory responses driven by the acquired and innate
   immune systems. Mothers complete extensive environmental questionnaires
   including time-activity behavior at recruitment and when the child is 3,
   6, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 months old. House dust collected during a
   thorough home assessment at 3-4 months, and biological specimens
   obtained for multiple exposure-related measurements, are archived for
   analyses. Geo-locations of homes and daycares and land-use regression
   for estimating traffic-related air pollution complement
   time-activity-behavior data to provide comprehensive individual exposure
   profiles. Several analytical frameworks are proposed to address the many
   interacting exposure variables and potential issues of co-linearity in
   this complex data set.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Dental resin-based restorative materials are used in a
   variety of dental treatment modalities such as root-end filling,
   perforation sealing, and adhesion of fractured roots. However, the
   prognosis after such treatments is not necessarily favorable because
   they fail to promote healing of the surrounding alveolar tissue. In the
   present study, non-biodegradable poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   (polyHEMA)-based hydrogel particles were fabricated as a carrier vehicle
   for drug delivery that is applied to dental resins.
   Methods. The loading and release characteristics of bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) from the polyHEMA-based
   hydrogel particles were evaluated over time in culture. The hydrogel
   particles were immersed into an aqueous FITC-labeled BSA solution and
   were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). To
   determine the activity of the FGF-2 released from the particles, the
   proliferation of osteoblast-like cells cultured with eluates collected
   from the particles for up to 14 days was determined.
   Results. CLSM revealed that BSA was adsorbed to the surface of the
   hydrogel particles. A sustained release of BSA and FGF-2 from the
   particles was detected for up to 14 days. The eluates from the
   FGF-2-loaded particles increased the proliferation of the
   osteoblast-like cells, suggesting that the activity of FGF-2 was
   maintained for at least 2 weeks within the particles.
   Significance. These polyHEMA-based non-degradable hydrogel particles may
   be useful tools that can be applied to dental restorative materials to
   achieve sustained delivery of drugs that promote tissue regeneration.

Abstract = {{To study the effect of oral administration of dimethyl dimethoxy
   biphenyl dicarboxylate (DDB) on adjusting angiogeneic/inflflammatory
   mediators and ameliorating the pathology of bones in rats with
   collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
   Wistar rat model of CIA was set up using bovine collagen type II. Fifty
   rats were divided into fifive groups randomly: normal, CIA model, DDB
   treatment, methotrexate (MTX) treatment, and combined DDB+MTX treatment.
   Ankle joints of rats were imaged with digital X-ray machine to show the
   destruction of joints. Fore and hind paw and knee joints were removed
   above the ankle joint then processed for haematoxylin and eosin
   staining. Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
   platelet derived growth factor, interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-4, tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were
   quantifified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nitric oxide levels
   were detected by Griess reagent.
   Compared with the CIA model group, a remarkable reduction in various
   angiogenic (VEGF and IL-8) and inflflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-4
   and COX-2) after treatment with DDB either alone or combined with MTX P
   < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Histopathological and X-ray fifindings were
   confifirmatory to the observed DDB anti-arthritic effect. The
   DDB-treated group showed amelioration in signs of arthritis which
   appeared essentially similar to normal.
   Our data shed light on the therapeutic effificacy of DDB in experimental
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with a choice drug (MTX) and it may
   be offered as a second-line drug in the treatment of RA.}},

Title = {{Paleontology and Darwin's Theory of Evolution: The Subversive Role of
   Statistics at the End of the 19th Century}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the subversive role of statistics paleontology at
   the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. In
   particular, I will focus on German paleontology and its relationship
   with statistics. I argue that in paleontology, the quantitative method
   was questioned and strongly limited by the first decade of the 20th
   century because, as its opponents noted, when the fossil record is
   treated statistically, it was found to generate results openly in
   conflict with the Darwinian theory of evolution. Essentially, statistics
   questions the gradual mode of evolution and the role of natural
   selection. The main objections to statistics were addressed during the
   meetings at the Kaiserlich-Konigliche Geologische Reichsanstalt in
   Vienna in the 1880s. After having introduced the statistical treatment
   of the fossil record, I will use the works of Charles L,o Lesquereux
   (1806-1889), Joachim Barrande (1799-1833), and Henry Shaler Williams
   (1847-1918) to compare the objections raised in Vienna with how the
   statistical treatment of the data worked in practice. Furthermore, I
   will discuss the criticisms of Melchior Neumayr (1845-1890), one of the
   leading German opponents of statistical paleontology, to show why, and
   to what extent, statistics were questioned in Vienna. The final part of
   this paper considers what paleontologists can derive from a statistical
   notion of data: the necessity of opening a discussion about the
   completeness and nature of the paleontological data. The Vienna
   discussion about which method paleontologists should follow offers an
   interesting case study in order to understand the epistemic tensions
   within paleontology surrounding Darwin's theory as well as the variety
   of non-Darwinian alternatives that emerged from the statistical
   treatment of the fossil record at the end of the 19th century.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{765-770}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Insects and crustaceans represent critical, dominant animal groups (by
   biomass and species number) in terrestrial and aquatic systems,
   respectively. Insects (hexapods) and crustaceans are historically
   grouped under separate taxonomic classes within the Phylum Arthropoda,
   and the research communities studying hexapods and crustaceans are quite
   distinct. More recently, the hexapods have been shown to be
   evolutionarily derived from basal crustaceans, and the clade
   Pancrustacea recognizes this relationship. This recent evolutionary
   perspective, and the fact that the Society for Integrative and
   Comparative Biology has strong communities in both invertebrate biology
   and insect physiology, provides the motivation for this symposium.
   Speakers in this symposium were selected because of their expertise in a
   particular field of insect or crustacean physiology, and paired in such
   a way as to provide a comparative view of the state of the current
   research in their respective fields. Presenters discussed what aspects
   of the physiological system are clearly conserved across insects and
   crustaceans and how cross-talk between researchers utilizing insects and
   crustaceans can fertilize understanding of such conserved systems.
   Speakers were also asked to identify strategies that would enable
   improved understanding of the evolution of physiological systems of the
   terrestrial insects from the aquatic crustaceans. The following
   collection of articles describes multiple recent advances in our
   understanding of Pancrustacean physiology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the modeling of a thermodynamic cooling system is
   considered, with the emphasis on dealing with the time-varying delay. A
   detailed characterization of the system output is performed first in the
   frequency domain, which successfully yields information relating to the
   location in the physical structure, which causes the time-varying delay.
   Three approaches are compared for modeling this delay: 1) using an
   adaptive fractional delay; 2) using an adaptive tapped delay line; and
   3) using a polynomial delay. In addition, it is shown that the use of a
   carefully designed perturbation signal with harmonic suppression is
   advantageous in this case, as the percentage output power contained in
   the nonexcited harmonics can serve as a measure of the relative variance
   of the delay since the system is found to be largely linear.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate microfibril-reinforced composites with linear
   low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) matrix were manufactured by four
   industrial processing methods: compression moulding, slit-die extrusion
   with calendering, extrusion blow moulding and injection moulding. The
   microfibrils were generated in situ by blending the two polymers
   together and thermomechanically processing the blend. Thin sheets were
   manufactured in all the processes, except injection moulding, which was
   employed for making containers. The oxygen permeability of the films was
   determined using a commercial machine. The greatest improvement in
   oxygen barrier property (compared to neat LLDPE films), was found in the
   compression-moulded microfibrillar composite (MFC) films. Two existing
   theoretical models were modified to reasonably forecast the oxygen
   permeability of compression-moulded MFC films. The parallel filler model
   provides a very good fit to the experimental data for the full mass
   ratio range. The Lewis and Nielsen model was also trialled for various
   polymer combinations, producing reasonable results with minor
   modifications.}},

Abstract = {{In Cu wire technology, it is observed that the Cu-Al IMC formation
   increases from a very thin layer of a few nm to a few pm after subjected
   to annealing process. The identified IMC phases are mainly CuAl2, CuAl
   and Cu9Al4, whereas the other three phases which are less reported are
   Cu4Al3, Cu3Al2 and Cu3Al. The reliability risk of Cu-Al IMC is commonly
   known, with the degradation of voids or crack propagation from ball
   periphery to internal ball bond direction after long duration of
   annealing. However, the cause of the degradation is not well
   established. This paper will focus on the study of the degradation of
   Cu-Al IMC layers with and without the presence of a mold compound by
   using ex-situ post annealing and in-situ annealing method on the same
   assembled sample. The ex-situ post annealing sample is studied using
   focus ion beam (FIB) after the molded sample had underwent a standard
   High Temperature Storage (HTS) at 150 degrees C for 1000 h. The in-situ
   annealing sample is studied using a transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) on a lamella with Cu-Al interface but without the presence of a
   mold compound. The result shows that the IMC formed are identified as
   CuAl2, CuAl and Cu9Al4 via Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDX). These
   IMC are seen to grow increasingly with the duration of annealing process
   for both methods. The native Al oxide lines are seen for both methods
   and were embedded in between the IMC The degradation starts at the ball
   periphery with cracks and voids at IMC are seen for the ex-situ
   postannealing sample but it is not observed under in-situ annealing
   sample. It is found that the degradation of the IMC is not caused by
   propagation of microcrack; instead it is assumed to be the influence of
   additive within the mold compound itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   ZUCKER FATTY RAT MODEL}},
Journal = {{MICROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{653-661}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to examine volumetric changes in
   fat flaps after stresses as well as their relationship with capillary
   density (CD) in a Zucker fatty rat model. Methods: A total of 12 male
   Zucker-fa/fa rats were randomly divided into two stress groups.
   Superficial epigastric fat flaps were evaluated on the right side as
   control and on the left side as the stress (ischemic or congestive)
   condition in the same rat in order to avoid biases. Stress conditions
   were made by obstructing the pedicle vessels with a vascular clip for 3
   hours. The volumes of these flaps were measured weekly. After 12 weeks
   of measurements, the CD of harvested flaps was examined in
   histologically immunostained sections. Percent changes in the
   body-weight-corrected flap volume {[}cFV(\%)], the stress/control ratio
   {[}FV-ratio(\%)], and the stress/control ratio of CD (CD-ratio) were
   defined. Results: cFV(\%) 12 weeks after surgery was 34.7 +/- 26.7 in
   the control flaps and 13.2 +/- 10.5 in the stress flaps. The
   FV-ratio(\%) after 12 weeks was 7.4-202.5 (70.2 +/- 77.9) in the
   ischemic group and 14.6 +/- 6.3 (37.7 +/- 22.2) in the congestive group.
   The difference in variance between two groups was significant (P =
   0.030). cFV(\%) correlated with total CD (P = 0.011). The FV-ratio(\%)
   correlated with the CD-ratio (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Weekly
   measurements of flap volumes in the Zucker fatty rat model were new and
   useful methods. The FV-ratio(\%) in the congestive group decreased at a
   constant rate, while that in the ischemic group decreased or increased
   slightly. The rate of decreases in the flap volume correlated with CD.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces HybridMR, a novel model for the execution of
   MapReduce (MR) computation on hybrid computing environment. Using this
   model, high performance cloud resources and heterogeneous desktop
   personal computers (PCs) in Internet or Intranet can be integrated to
   form a hybrid computing environment. Thanks to HybridMR, the computation
   and storage capability of large scale desktop PCs can be fully utilized
   to process large scale datasets. HybridMR relies on two innovative
   solutions to enable such large scale data-intensive computation. The
   first one is HybridDFS, which is a hybrid distributed file system.
   HybridDFS features reliable distributed storage that alleviates the
   volatility of desktop PCs, thanks to fault tolerance and file
   replication mechanism. The second innovation is a new node
   priority-based fair scheduling (NPBFS) algorithm has been developed in
   HybridMR to achieve both data storage balance and job assignment balance
   by assigning each node a priority through quantifying CPU speed, memory
   size, and input and output capacity. In this paper, we describe the
   HybridMR, HybridDFS, and NPBFS. We report on performance evaluation
   results, which show that the proposed HybridMR not only achieves
   reliable MR computation, reduces task response time, and improves the
   performance of MR, but also reduces the computation cost and achieves a
   greener computing mode. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) represent a new analytical tool
   for understanding geographic processes. Among the fundamental solutions
   to advancing and deepening the development of VGEs are geographic
   modeling, geographic simulation, and geographic knowledge sharing.
   Forest is a major component of the geographic environment. This article
   proposes an integrated approach for analyzing and exploring plant growth
   processes and the relationship between plant growth and the environment,
   and describes the development of a software prototype that integrates
   ontology, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual plant techniques. The
   strategy is as follows: First, we collect existing information on the
   growth and development patterns, morphological structure, and
   environment of a chosen plant from the botany, forestry, and ecology
   literature. Then, we construct an ontology framework to organize the
   collected information and individual cases into a knowledge base and
   support the inferential reasoning, botanical modeling and simulation.
   Through rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR),
   complex relationships between tree growth and the environment can be
   extracted. Next, the newly derived knowledge is integrated with a 3D
   method for modeling the growth of individual tree based on the same
   ontology framework. Finally, based on the description of the tree
   species, environment, growth stage, and phenophase, among other factors,
   key tree morphology parameters are derived via semantic reasoning. Using
   these parameters, a new 3D tree model is generated that is consistent
   with the specific habitat and growth phase. Our approach is useful for
   users who have little knowledge of botany or who lack the computer
   skills to construct realistic 3D tree models that are faithful to
   botanical features.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic flowmeters have potential for wide application in natural gas
   and hydrogen flow measurements in China. Accurate measurement is
   essential; thus, data fusion of acoustic paths is of importance. A data
   integration method for multi-path flowmeter measurement is introduced
   and investigated in this study. The novel data integration method is
   based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Computational fluid dynamics
   has been used to simulate the flows, and a laboratory scale system was
   established to obtain experimental measurements. The results of the
   simulations and experiments reveal that the method is able to reduce
   measurement error compared with four traditional integration methods in
   flow-rate measuring in a long straight pipe. Furthermore, both the
   simulation and experiment results validate the integration method for
   non-ideal flow conditions, such as flow downstream a single elbow or a
   180 degrees bend. The relative errors are within 1\%, instead of more
   than 2\%, which is typical for traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{SnO2/CNTs nanocomposite was prepared via a layer by layer adsorption and
   in situ deposition process with SnCl4 as tin source, NaBH4 as reducing
   agent and CNTs well dispersed in aqueous solution of SDBS as matrix.
   Microscopic structure shows that rutile SnO2 nanoparticles with diameter
   of 2 similar to 3 nm are uniformly coated onto the surface of the CNTs.
   This reveals that the BH4- and Sn4+ ions absorbing onto the surface of
   CNTs could effectively suppress the homogeneous nucleation and growth of
   SnO2, and form uniform SnO2/CNTs nanocomposite with co-axial structure.
   The composite delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1425.7 mAh/g
   and its reversible capacity is still as high as 500 mAh/g at a current
   density of 50 mAh/g. The capacity and cycle stability are all better

Abstract = {{The effect of storage period before reheating on the volatile
   composition and lipid oxidation of steamed yellowtail fish muscle
   samples {[}ordinary muscle (OM) and dark muscle (DM)] was studied to
   evaluate the quality of fish meat in the cook-chill process. In OM and
   DM samples that were reheated on day 7 of storage, the levels of 26
   compounds and most volatiles (47), respectively, were significantly
   higher than in samples that were steamed only once. In DM steamed only
   once and in DM reheated after 7 days of storage, values of nine and 32
   compounds, respectively, were significantly higher than in OM under
   identical conditions. In both muscle types, the peroxide values (PVs)
   and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values significantly
   increased when the meat was stored for 7 days before reheating. Reheated
   DM showed significantly lower values and significantly lower tendency
   for PV except for day 1 of storage and significantly higher TBARS values
   at day 7 of storage compared to those in reheated OM. In reheated muscle
   of both types, the fatty acid composition was not significantly
   different from that of samples steamed only once, except for 20:5n-3 of
   DM. Sensory evaluation showed that at days 3 and 7 of storage, the odor
   of reheated fish slices had deteriorated. Therefore, steamed yellowtail
   meat reheated after refrigerated storage of up to 3 days could be
   consumed without deterioration of its odor and nutritive value.}},

   equations arising from the one-center atomic-orbital close-coupling
   approach. We have considered calculations that allow couplings to the n

   that neglect the effect of all states other than the initial and final
   states of the target atom. The sensitivity of the cross sections to the
   sign of the projectile charge as well as the influence of the mechanism
   of possible electronic transitions allowed by the techniques under
   consideration have been studied. The calculated cross sections are

Abstract = {{This article examines the political contestations over sexual and
   reproductive rights reform in the Philippines from an intersectional
   perspective. Specifically, it considers the Reproductive Health (RH)
   Bill which was enacted in 2012 to unpack the various competing interests
   and identities of coalitions that are mobilised by sexual and
   reproductive freedom in the Philippines. It demonstrates how the
   distinct reform agenda contained in the RH Bill is a direct outcome of
   the power differentials between and within coalitions. This suggests
   that the bill serves to benefit some at the expense of others based on
   how different actors are situated within the intersections of class,
   gender, sexuality, religion and nation. Data for this research comes
   from the triangulation of various sources including semi-structured
   interviews, the RH bill text, and official government and non-government
   publications. The case of the RH Bill in the Philippines highlights the
   interdependence between the recognition of sexual and reproductive
   freedom as a human right and the redistribution of power and resources
   in society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aristolochic acid (AA) is a carcinogenic, mutagenic and nephrotoxic
   compound commonly isolated from members of the plant family of
   Aristolochiaceae (such as Aristolochia and Asarum) and used in Chinese
   herbal medicine. Use of AA and AA-containing plants causes chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) and upper urinary tract carcinoma (UUC); however,
   the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. miRNAs regulate a number
   of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation
   and metabolism. This study explored differentially expressed miRNAs
   between AA-induced upper urothelial tract cancer (AAN-UUC) and
   non-AAN-UUC tissues. Patients with AAN-UUC and non-AAN-UUC (n=20/group)
   were recruited in the present study. Five tissue samples from each group
   were used for miRNA microarray profiling and the rest of the tissue
   samples were subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction analysis including seven selected miRNAs for
   confirmation. A total of 29 miRNAs were differentially expressed between
   AAN-UUC and non-AAN-UUC tissues (P<0.05). TargenScan and Gene ontology
   analyses predicted the functions and targeted genes of these
   differentially expressed miRNAs, i.e. Akt3, FGFR3, PSEN1, VEGFa and AR.
   Subsequently, expression of the selected differentially expressed miRNAs
   (Hsa-miR-4795-5p, Hsa-miR-488, Hsa-miR-4784, Hsa-miR-330, Hsa-miR-3916,
   Hsa-miR-4274 and Hsa-miR-181c) was validated in another set of tissue
   samples. A total of 29 miRNAs were identified to be differentially
   expressed between AAN-UUC and non-AAN-UUC tissues and these miRNA target
   genes in FGFR3 and Akt pathways, which regulate cell growth and tumor
   progression, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Integrating professional expertise in diet, exercise and
   behavioural support may provide more effective preventive health
   services but this needs testing. We describe the design and baseline
   results of a trial in the Illawarra region of New South Wales,
   Australia.
   Methods: The HealthTrack study is a 12 month randomised controlled trial
   testing effects of a novel interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention
   versus usual care. The study recruited overweight and obese adults 25-54
   years resident in the Illawarra. Primary outcomes were weight, and
   secondary outcomes were disease risk factors (lipids, glucose, blood
   pressure), and behaviour (diet, activity, and psychological factors).
   Protocols, recruitment and baseline characteristics are reported.
   Results: Between May 2014 and April 2015, 377 participants were
   recruited and randomised. The median age (IQR) of the mostly female
   sample (74\%) was 45 (37-51) years. The sample comprised obese (BMI 32
   (29-35) kg/m(2)) well educated (79\% post school qualifications)
   non-smokers (96\%). A high proportion reported suffering from anxiety
   (26.8\%) and depression (33.7\%). Metabolic syndrome was identified in
   34.9\% of the sample.
   Conclusions: The HealthTrack study sample was recruited to test the
   effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach to preventive healthcare
   in self-identified overweight adults in the Illawarra region. The
   profile of participants gives some indication of those likely to use
   services similar to the trial design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In response to infection, patients with inborn errors of metabolism may
   develop a functional deterioration termed metabolic decompensation. The
   biochemical hallmarks of this disruption of metabolic homeostasis are
   disease specific and may include acidosis, hyperammonemia or
   hypoglycemia. In a model system previously published by our group, we
   noted that during influenza infection, mice displayed a depression in
   hepatic mitochondrial enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Based on
   these findings, we hypothesized that this normal adaptation may extend
   to other metabolic pathways, and as such, may impact various inborn
   errors of metabolism. Since the liver is a critical organ in inborn
   errors of metabolism, we carried out untargeted metabolomic profiling of
   livers using mass spectrometry in C57B1/6 mice infected with influenza
   to characterize metabolic adaptation. Pathway analysis of metabolomic
   data revealed reductions in CoA synthesis, and long chain fatty acyl CoA
   and camitine species. These metabolic adaptations coincided with a
   depression in hepatic long chain 3-oxidation mRNA and protein. To our
   surprise, the metabolic changes observed occurred in conjunction with a
   hepatic innate immune response, as demonstrated by transcriptional
   profiling and flow cytometry. By employing an immunomodulation strategy
   to deplete Kupffer cells, we were able to improve the expression of
   multiple genes involved in 3-oxidation. Based on these findings, we are
   the first to suggest that the role of the liver as an immunologic organ
   is central in the pathophysiology of hepatic metabolic decompensation in
   inborn errors of metabolism due to respiratory viral infection. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: Peripheral nerve ultrasound has become an effective
   imaging technique. However, imaging of cranial nerves, especially in
   healthy volunteers, has received minimal attention. The objectives of
   this study were to describe the sonographic characteristics of the
   facial nerve and to establish average values of its diameter. Methods:
   The extra-cranial part of the facial nerve was scanned bilaterally along
   its longitudinal axis inside the parotid gland using a 13-MHz probe in
   50 healthy adults. The diameter was measured at the nerve's thickest
   region. Results: The facial nerve appeared as a thin, tubular,
   hypoechoic structure inside the parotid gland. The mean facial nerve
   diameter was 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm, and the mean side-to-side difference in
   diameter was 0.1 +/- 0.1 mm. Conclusions: The average facial nerve
   diameter values may provide help with identification of nerve
   abnormalities using ultrasound. Muscle Nerve52: 767-771, 2015}},

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of conventional chemical insecticides and bacterial toxins to
   control lepidopteran pests of global agriculture has imposed significant
   selection pressure leading to the rapid evolution of insecticide
   resistance. Transgenic crops (e.g., cotton) expressing the Bt Cry toxins
   are now used world wide to control these pests, including the highly
   polyphagous and invasive cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. Since
   2004, the Cry2Ab toxin has become widely used for controlling H.
   armigera, often used in combination with Cry1Ac to delay resistance
   evolution. Isolation of H. armigera and H. punctigera individuals
   heterozygous for Cry2Ab resistance in 2002 and 2004, respectively,
   allowed aspects of Cry2Ab resistance (level, fitness costs, genetic
   dominance, complementation tests) to be characterised in both species.
   However, the gene identity and genetic changes conferring this
   resistance were unknown, as was the detailed Cry2Ab mode of action. No
   cross-resistance to Cry1Ac was observed in mutant lines. Biphasic
   linkage analysis of a Cry2Ab-resistant H. armigera family followed by
   exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) marker mapping and candidate gene
   sequencing identified three independent resistance-associated INDEL
   mutations in an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter gene we named
   HaABCA2. A deletion mutation was also identified in the H. punctigera
   homolog from the resistant line. All mutations truncate the ABCA2
   protein. Isolation of further Cry2Ab resistance alleles in the same gene
   from field H. armigera populations indicates unequal resistance allele
   frequencies and the potential for Bt resistance evolution.
   Identification of the gene involved in resistance as an ABC transporter
   of the A subfamily adds to the body of evidence on the crucial role this
   gene family plays in the mode of action of the Bt Cry toxins. The
   structural differences between the ABCA2, and that of the C subfamily
   required for Cry1Ac toxicity, indicate differences in the detailed
   mode-of-action of the two Bt Cry toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Many gender differences in travel have begun to converge.
   Has convergence occurred for household-serving travel, which constitutes
   a very large and growing share of all trips? Moreover, what explains the
   division of household-serving travel in heterosexual couples? In
   answering these questions, we test the salience of three theories about
   the gendered division of household labor: (1) time availability, (2)
   microeconomic, and (3) gender socialization. Methods. Using data from
   the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 to 2012, we calculated the
   female-to-male ratio of household-serving trips in several types of
   households (i.e., singles vs. couples and male vs. female breadwinner
   households). Results. There was some empirical support for each theory,
   but we find the most consistent and compelling evidence for gender
   socialization. We observe substantial gender differences in child-and
   household-serving trips apart from household formation; even in
   households where women earn more, are better educated, or work more
   hours than their partners, women still make about half again as many
   child-serving and grocery-shopping trips as their male partners.
   Conclusion. Despite dramatic changes in women's labor force
   participation over the past half-century, the gender division of
   household-serving travel remains strong.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to determine the factors
   having a role in the occurrence of acute back pain following spinal
   anesthesia.
   MethodsSix hundred and forty-nine patients who underwent surgery under
   spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective observational study.
   Patients' age, sex, BMI, ASA physical status, educational status,
   history of back pain, spinal needle radius, spinal interspace level of
   intervention, method of approach for spinal anesthesia, position during
   spinal anesthesia, angle of puncture with respect to the spinal
   ligaments, magnitude of pain during intervention, number of lumbar
   punctures, number of bony contacts, amount of bupivacaine administered
   intrathecally, type of surgical procedure, surgical position, duration
   of the surgery, and duration of anesthesia parameters were recorded.
   Patients were inquired for existence and magnitude of back pain on the
   1st day and the 4th week postoperatively. Multivariate analysis is
   performed via logistic regression model to parameters that are found to
   be significant in univariate analysis.
   ResultsAssessment of the data from the postoperative 1st day showed
   29.3\% of the patients suffered back pain. Postspinal acute back pain
   was related to the number of bony contacts (P=0.016), history of back
   pain (P=0.0001), spinal needle radius (P=0.022), and duration of the
   surgery (P=0.037).
   ConclusionContrary to the common belief, it is demonstrated in this
   study that number of lumbar punctures, method of approach and position
   of the spinal anesthesia, age, sex, surgical position, and the type of
   the surgery did not correlate with occurrence of acute back pain
   following spinal anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary tract infection is the third most leading cause of infection in
   pediatric age group, causing high morbidity and mortality. Resistance to
   broad spectrum beta lactams mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamase
   and AmpC beta lactamase enzymes is an increasing problem worldwide.
   Unfortunately the ESBL producers often also have resistance determinants
   to other antibiotic groups, leaving an extremely limited range of
   effective agents. Study was conducted on 100 non repetitive mid stream
   urine samples collected in a sterile container from pediatric patients
   suspected of urinary tract infection. All enterobacteriaceae isolates
   were subjected for detection of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. 72
   enterobacteriaceae were isolated in the study. Among them ESBL producers
   were 47(65.27\%), pure AmpC producers were 23(31.94\%) and 31(43.05\%)
   were co-producers (ESBL+AmpC). In the present study, E.coli was the
   commonest isolate causing UTI in children with highest production of Amp
   C. Klebsiella spps showed highest production of ESBL. Simple disc tests
   can be used to detect ESBL and Amp C beta lactamases especially where
   resources for molecular detection are not available. Many of these
   beta-lactamases disseminate rapidly being plasmid mediated. Hence it is
   necessary that rapid detection of these enzymes should be done and
   immediate control measures should be implemented to prevent their
   dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most contagious and

   used inactivated FMD vaccines have short lived immunity besides risk of
   handling live virus. We studied recombinant FMD virus like particles
   (VLPs) encoded by FMDV type O/IND/R2/75 polyprotein genes expressed in
   Sf9 cells and adjuvanted with CpG or Poly I:C in inducing protective
   immune response in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs immunized with VLP + CpG
   vaccine had shown markedly higher cell mediated immunity (CMI) in
   comparison to the conventional vaccine group as evident from higher
   levels of IgG2 than Ig Gl. Although the humoral response was less in VLP
   + CpG compared to conventional vaccine, the lymphocyte stimulation index
   was more in VLP + CpG compared to conventional and VLP + Poly I:C
   vaccine groups. Finally the challenge experiments on 28 and 56 dpv had
   shown 75\% protection in VLP + CpG immunized guinea pigs primary and
   boosted animals, while 50\% and 62\% protection in VLP + Poly I:C in
   primary and boosted animals, respectively. In conclusion, CpG adjuvant
   was found to be superior followed by ISA206 and Poly I:C in eliciting
   protection in VLP based FMD vaccines in guinea pigs. (C) 2015 The

   literatures to differentiate internally organized attention from

   conceptualizes two ways that public managers can internally organize

Abstract = {{A new numerical algorithm for the analysis of single line to ground
   faults on short overhead transmission lines is presented in this paper.
   It is based upon synchronized sampling at two line ports, and an
   accurate fault model including the arcing phenomena and tower footing
   resistance at the fault point. The core of the algorithm is an efficient
   nonrecursive parameter estimation method. A dynamic arc model is
   included in the fault model to represent the arc's interaction with the
   external power network. The algorithm accurately estimates the arc
   voltage amplitude, tower footing resistance, and the fault location,
   simultaneously. The algorithm is derived in the time domain, and is
   based on the synchronized acquisition of currents and voltages at both
   line terminals. Case studies based on simulated data are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. In particular, the
   sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to synchronization errors,
   harmonics, line capacitance, and fault resistance were explored with
   lumped, distributed, transposed, and untransposed line models.}},

Abstract = {{Particle size distribution (PSD) is a relevant property of powdered
   solid matter since it directly influences the functionality of solid
   products such as pharmaceutics, cosmetics, abrasives, ceramics, metals,
   pigments, catalysts, and chemical reactants. Several methods and
   techniques, based on various physical laws, are available to determine
   the PSD. In all the existing approaches particulate matter homogeneity
   is assumed, e.g. unique chemical composition, crystalline phases,
   refractive index, density, and shape for the entire population of
   particles. A real sample might be a mixture of a number of materials,
   each of them with well-defined physical properties and particle size
   distributions. The simultaneous measurement of particle size and
   particle nature is still not achievable with the existing technologies.
   Here we present the concept and the results of a new experimental setup

Abstract = {{Small mammal populations living on contaminated sites are exposed to
   various chemicals. Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), two well-known
   nonessential trace metals, accumulate in different organs and are known
   to cause multiple adverse effects. To develop nonlethal markers in
   ecotoxicology, the present work aimed to study the relationships between
   blood parameters (hematocrit, leukocyte levels and granulated
   erythrocyte levels) and Cd and Pb concentrations in the soil and in the
   liver and kidneys of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Individuals were
   trapped along a pollution gradient with high levels of Cd, Pb and zinc
   (Zn) contamination. The results indicated that hematological parameters
   were independent of individual characteristics (age and gender). Blood
   parameters varied along the pollution gradient, following a pattern
   similar to the accumulation of Cd in the organs of the wood mice. No
   relationship was found between the blood parameters studied and Pb
   concentrations in the organs or in the environment. The hematocrit and
   leukocyte number decreased with increasing concentrations of Cd in the
   kidneys and/or in the liver. Moreover, the hematocrit was lower in the
   animals that were above the thresholds (LOAELs) for Cd concentrations in
   the liver. These responses were interpreted as a warning of potential
   negative effects of Cd exposure on the oxygen transport capacity of the
   blood (e.g., anemia). The present results suggest that blood parameters,
   notably hematocrit, may offer a minimally invasive biomarker for the
   evaluation of Cd exposure in further ecotoxicological studies. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study presents the synthesis of diatom-FeOx composite as a novel
   sorbent for arsenic removal from water. The unique porous architecture
   of the diatom was utilized to immobilize iron oxide to form the
   composite. The surface area was as high as 70 m(2)/g. The adsorption
   isotherms for As (III) and As (V) followed the Langmuir, Freundlich and
   D-R models. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity for arsenite (As III)
   was 10,000 mu g/g and arsenate (As V) was 12,500 mu g/g. The
   pseudo-second order rate equation was found to effectively describe the
   kinetics of arsenic adsorption. This study opens the door for the

Title = {{Level of Fecal Calprotectin Correlates With Endoscopic and Histologic
   Inflammation and Identifies Patients With Mucosal Healing in Ulcerative
   Colitis}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), mucosal
   healing is an important goal of treatment. However, mucosal healing is
   difficult to determine on the basis of clinical evaluation alone, and
   endoscopy is uncomfortable and can cause complications. Fecal
   calprotectin (FC) is a marker of inflammation, and its levels have been
   associated with disease activity. We investigated the association
   between level of FC and mucosal healing and clinical disease activity in
   patients with UC.
   METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study of 120
   patients with active or inactive UC who underwent sigmoidoscopy at
   Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre from September 2012 through
   2014. Endoscopic inflammation was evaluated by using the Mayo Endoscopic
   Score (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)
   and histologic inflammatory activity by a slightly modified Harpaz
   Index, which measures acute inflammation. The Partial Mayo Score was
   used to measure the clinical disease activity.
   RESULTS: A cutoff level of FC of 192 mg/kg identified patients with
   endoscopic evidence of mucosal healing, which was based on the MES and
   UCEIS, with positive predictive values of 0.71 and 0.65, respectively;
   negative predictive values were 0.90 and 0.93, respectively. A cutoff
   level of 171 mg/kg identified patients with histologic evidence of
   mucosal healing, with positive predictive value of 0.75 and negative
   predictive value of 0.90. Levels of FC increased significantly with
   increases in endoscopic and histologic disease activity. There was high
   concordance between MES and UCEIS as well as between MES or UCEIS and
   histologic inflammatory activity. The histologic activity index had an
   interobserver variation of 4.35\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Level of FC identifies patients with UC who have endoscopic
   and histologic features of mucosal healing and correlates with
   endoscopic and histologic inflammatory activity. The UCEIS seems to be
   as accurate as the MES in identifying patients with mucosal healing and
   as easy to use. The histologic activity index had a high concordance
   with recognized endoscopic score systems.}},

   cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 and alpha-hemolysin constituted the
   majority (15.8\%) carried by UPEC isolates. Phylogenetic group
   classification revealed that 57.5\% of UPEC belonged to group D.
   Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that 70.5\% and 65.1\% of the
   isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively.
   Moreover, 50.0\% of UPEC were capable of producing extended spectrum

Abstract = {{A model examining the effects of an increasing number of maltreatment
   subtypes experienced on antisocial behavior, as mediated by impulsivity
   and moderated by a polygenic index of dopaminergic genotypes, was
   investigated. An African American sample of children (N = 1,012, M age =
   10.07) with and without maltreatment histories participated. Indicators
   of aggression, delinquency, and disruptive peer behavior were obtained
   from peer-and counselor-rated measures to form a latent variable of
   antisocial behavior; impulsivity was assessed by counselor report. Five
   genotypes in four dopaminergic genes (dopamine receptors D4, D2, known
   as DRD4, DRD2; dopamine active transporter 1, known as DAT1; and
   catechol-O-methyltransferase, known as COMT) conferring heightened
   environmental sensitivity were combined into one polygenic index. Using
   structural equation modeling, a first-stage, moderated-mediation model
   was evaluated. Age and sex were entered as covariates, both as main
   effects and in interaction with maltreatment and the gene index. The
   model had excellent fit: chi(2) (32, N = 1,012) = 86.51, p < .001;
   comparative fit index = 0.982, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.977, root mean
   square error of approximation = 0.041, and standardized root mean square
   residual = 0.022. The effect of maltreatment subtypes on antisocial
   behavior was partially mediated by impulsivity (beta = 0.173, p < .001),
   and these relations were moderated by the number of differentiating
   dopaminergic genotypes. Specifically, a significant Gene x Environment
   interaction (beta = 0.016, p = .013) indicated that the relation between
   maltreatment and impulsivity was stronger as children evinced more
   differentiating genotypes, thereby strengthening the mediational effect
   of impulsivity on antisocial behavior. These findings elucidate the
   manner by which maltreated children develop early signs of antisocial
   behavior, and the genetic mechanisms involved in greater vulnerability
   for maladaptation in impulse control within the context of child
   maltreatment.}},

Abstract = {{A progressive decline in a male's propensity to mate with the same
   female, combined with a heightened sexual interest in new females, is
   known as the Coolidge effect. The Coolidge effect has been reported in a
   number of taxa and is thought to be adaptive, as males distribute sperm
   evenly across multiple females thereby maximising fitness. Here we
   looked for the Coolidge effect in the Australian field cricket,
   Teleogryllus oceanicus (Le Guillou). We found that males did not show
   greater sexual interest in novel females compared with their previous
   mates. Moreover, we did not find any decline in the quality of
   ejaculates transferred by males when mating sequentially with the same
   female, or an increase in ejaculate quality when males were presented
   with novel females. Our results are in contrast with findings
   investigating the Coolidge effect in other insects, which may reflect
   differences among species in the fitness benefits associated with mating
   repeatedly with the same female. We argue that examinations of the
   Coolidge effect need to be incorporated routinely into studies that
   examine the benefits of polyandry for females, because of the potential
   impact of reduced ejaculate expenditure by males in monandrous
   treatments.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Pages = {{875-887}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the last three decades, a number of Asian thinkers supportive of, or
   opposed to, authoritarian rule have developed culture-based theories of
   democracy that challenge, or buttress, a liberal, Western understanding
   of democratic rule. The most famous expression was the Asian values
   discourse of government-linked intellectuals in Singapore and Malaysia,
   but there has also been a political Confucianist critique of Western
   democracy in China as well as claims that only Thai-style democracy is
   appropriate in Thailand. Less well known is a pro-democratic stance in
   Asia rooted in the region's major religious traditions. These apparently
   contradictory discourses have been dialectically related in the
   post-Cold War era: authoritarian rulers reacted to universalist claims
   about democracy with assertions of cultural particularism which, in
   turn, triggered a reaction by Asian democrats who pointed to the liberal
   character of world religions practiced in the region. While the
   civilizational critique of Western democracy (the origins of which can
   be traced to Imperial Germany and Meiji Japan) has contributed to
   democratic decline in the region, there has also been push back by
   offering an interpretation based on East Asia's major religious
   traditions to show that Asian values are not incompatible with
   democracy.}},

   We present three field note examples from observation in a hospice ward,
   which illuminate how researcher awareness of aspects of
   intersubjectivity can add valuable insights to data and analysis. Out of
   the examples, we elaborate on three arguments: (a) how the researcher's
   lived experience of time and space during fieldwork triggers new
   research questions, (b) how observations as an embodied activity can
   bring new insights and open new layers of meaning, and (c) the value of
   observations in gaining insight into relational aspects in a hospice.}},

Abstract = {{Motile bacteria can overcome the transport limitations that hinder many
   cancer therapies. Active bacteria can penetrate through tissue to
   deliver treatment to resistant tumor regions. Bacterial therapy has had
   limited success, however, because this motility is heterogeneous, and
   within a population many individuals are non-motile. In human trials,
   heterogeneity led to poor dispersion and incomplete tumor colonization.
   To address these problems, a swarm-plate selection method was developed
   to increase swimming velocity. Video microscopy was used to measure the
   velocity distribution of selected bacteria and a microfluidic
   tumor-on-a-chip device was used to measure penetration through tumor
   cell masses. Selection on swarm plates increased average velocity
   fourfold, from 4.9 to 18.7m/s (P<0.05) and decreased the number of
   non-motile individuals from 51\% to 3\% (P<0.05). The selected phenotype
   was both robust and stable. Repeating the selection process consistently
   increased velocity and eliminated non-motile individuals. When selected
   strains were cryopreserved and subcultured for 30.1 doublings, the
   high-motility phenotype was preserved. In the microfluidic device,
   selected Salmonella penetrated deeper into cell masses than unselected
   controls. By 10h after inoculation, control bacteria accumulated in the
   front 30\% of cell masses, closest to the flow channel. In contrast,
   selected Salmonella accumulated in the back 30\% of cell masses,
   farthest from the channel. Selection increased the average penetration
   distance from 150 to 400m (P<0.05). This technique provides a simple and
   rapid method to generate high-motility Salmonella that has increased
   penetration and potential for greater tumor dispersion and clinical
   efficacy. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 2397-2405. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{The cystic fibrosis (CF) airways are colonized by polymicrobial
   communities with high bacterial load and are influenced by frequent
   antibiotic exposures. This community includes diverse streptococci, some
   of which have been directly or indirectly associated with pulmonary
   exacerbations. As many streptococci are naturally competent, horizontal
   transfer of antibiotic-resistant determinants coupled with frequent
   and/or chronic antibiotic exposure may contribute to high resistance
   rates. In this study, we assessed antibiotic resistance in 413
   streptococcal isolates from adult CF patients against nine antibiotics
   relevant in CF treatment. We observed very low rates of cephalosporin
   resistance {[}cefepime and ceftriaxone (<2 \%)], and higher rates of
   resistance to tetracycline (similar to 34 \%) and
   sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (similar to 45 \%). The highest rate of
   antibiotic resistance was to the macrolides {[}azithromycin (56.4 \%)
   and erythromycin (51.6 \%)]. We also investigated the molecular
   mechanisms of macrolide resistance and found that only half of our
   macrolide-resistant streptococci isolates contained the me! (efflux
   pump) or erm (methylation of 23S ribosomal target site) genes. The
   majority of isolates were, however, found to have point mutations at
   position 2058 or 2059 of the 23S ribosomal subunit - a molecular
   mechanism of resistance not commonly reported in the non-pyogenic and
   non-pneumococcal streptococci, and unique in comparison with previous
   studies. The high rates of resistance observed here may result in poor
   outcomes where specific streptococci are contributing to CF airway
   disease and serve as a reservoir of resistance genes within the CF
   airway microbiome.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Concepts regarding the mechanism of radioactive decay of nuclei are
   developed on the basis of a hypothesis that there is a dynamic
   relationship between the electronic and nuclear subsystems of an atom,
   and that fluctuating initiating effects of the electronic subsystem on a
   nucleus are possible. Such relationship is reflected in experimental
   findings that show the radioactive decay of nuclei might be determined
   by a positive difference between the mass of an initial nucleus and the
   mass of an atom's electronic subsystem, i.e., the mass of the entire
   atom (rather than that of its nucleus) and the total mass of the decay
   products. It is established that an intermediate nucleus whose charge is
   lower by unity than the charge of the initial radioactive nucleus is
   formed as a result of the above fluctuating stimuli that initiate
   radioactive decay, and its nuclear matter is thus in an unbalanced
   metastable state of inner shakeup, affecting the quark subsystem of
   nucleons. The intermediate nucleus thus experiences radioactive decay
   with the emission of alpha or beta particles. At the same time, the high
   energy (with respect to the chemical scale) of electrons in plasma
   served as a factor initiating the processes in different nuclear
   chemical transformations and radioactive decays in low-temperature
   plasma studied earlier, particularly during the laser ablation of metals
   in aqueous solutions of different compositions and in near-surface
   cathode layers upon glow discharge. It is shown that a wide variety of
   nucleosynthesis processes in the Universe can be understood on the same
   basis, and a great many questions regarding the formation of light
   elements in the solar atmosphere and some heavy elements (particularly
   p-nuclei) in the interiors of massive stars at late stages of their
   evolution can also be resolved.}},

Abstract = {{The asymmetric unit of the title salt, C10H20N3O2+center dot C24H20B-,
   contains two cations and two tetraphenylborate ions. The C-N bond
   lengths in the central CN3 unit of the guanidinium ions range between
   1.323 (2) and 1.381 (2) angstrom, indicating partial double-bond
   character. The central C atoms are bonded to the three N atoms in a
   nearly ideal trigonal-planar geometry and the positive charge is
   delocalized in the CN3 plane. The cationic six-membered rings are
   nonplanar, the dihedral angles between the N/C/N and C/C/C planes
   ranging from 45.8 (1) to 53.6 (1)degrees. In the crystal, C-H center dot
   center dot center dot pi interactions are present between the
   guanidinium H atoms and the phenyl rings of the tetraphenylborate ions.
   The phenyl rings form aromatic pockets, in which the guanidinium ions
   are embedded.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify early follow-up measures that will predict the
   dynamics of prolactin (PRL) decrease and adenoma shrinkage in men
   harboring macroprolactinomas.
   Methods: A single-center historical prospective study including a
   consecutive group of 71 men with pituitary macroadenomas (>= 10 mm) and
   hyperprolactinemia (PRL >7 times the upper limit of normal {[}ULN])
   treated medically with cabergoline. Comparisons of PRL normalization
   rates were performed according to PRL levels achieved at 6 months,
   maximal adenoma shrinkage during follow-up, and other patient
   characteristics. Correlations were analyzed to identify characteristics
   of PRL suppression dynamics.
   Results: PRL levels after 6 months of treatment correlated positively
   with current PRL levels (r = 0.74; P<.001), with time to PRL
   normalization (r = 0.75; P<.001), and with adenoma diameter following
   treatment (r = 0.38; P=.01). Adenoma shrinkage depicted by first
   magnetic resonance imaging on treatment correlated with maximal adenoma
   shrinkage during follow-up (r = 0.56; P=.006). Five patients had nadir
   PRL levels = 3 times the ULN (51 ng/mL) and showed slower response to
   cabergoline treatment, with consistently higher PRL levels compared with
   responding patients throughout follow-up (mean 6-month PRL levels, 519
   +/- 403 ng/mL versus 59 +/- 118 ng/mL; P<.001).
   Conclusion: Six-month PRL level might serve as a surrogate marker for
   PRL normalization and adenoma shrinkage dynamics among men harboring
   macroprolactinomas.}},

Abstract = {{Delirium is a common and potentially devastating problem for older

   implement a clinical algorithm for improving delirium detection and
   management and (2) assess the impact of the clinical algorithm on length
   of stay, discharge disposition and patient satisfaction. The pilot study
   was implemented on an orthopedic unit to evaluate the effectiveness of a
   clinical protocol for delirium detection and management to improve
   outcomes. Outcomes of 33 elderly post-operative hip fracture patients
   were compared to historical controls from the same unit. Delirium was
   detected in 18\% of patients. Length of stay was reduced by 22\% (P <
   .001), discharge disposition showed a 13\% improvement (P = .17) and
   patient satisfaction scores showed a 15\% (P = .15) improvement
   post-intervention. Implementation of a clinical algorithm to promote
   early detection and treatment of delirium in post-operative hip fracture
   patients is feasible and associated with improved outcomes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A database is presented with 278 tests on non-slender reinforced
   concrete beams with vertical stirrups. These beams are commonly referred
   to as non-slender beams because they have shear span-depth ratios (aid)
   less than 2.4. In keeping with European terminology the term ``deep
   beams{''} is not used for these beams, because in Europe, deep beams are
   often defined only for ratios of a/d < 1 and always contain vertical as
   well as horizontal reinforcement in their web. After having applied
   several control/filtering criteria, 178 beams remained in the evaluation
   database that can be used to check conservativeness and accuracy of
   relevant design provisions. For example, the application of
   strut-and-tie models of ACI 318-14 to non-slender beams with stirrups
   (and without any horizontal skin reinforcement) was unconservative-that
   is, it yielded database analysis results that were above the desired 5\%
   fractile. Almost all unconservative estimations were obtained for test
   specimens with very low amounts of stirrups. This problem can be solved
   either by increasing the required amount of minimum reinforcement in the
   vertical direction or by placing a minimum amount of reinforcement in
   both the horizontal and vertical direction. It is also important to note
   that a comparison with Kani's shear valley showed that for a/d < 1, the
   valley was not filled up to the full flexural capacity, despite the
   presence of vertical stirrups in test specimens.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Water temperature controls many biochemical and ecological processes in
   rivers, and theoretically depends on multiple factors. Here we formulate
   a model to predict daily averaged river water temperature as a function
   of air temperature and discharge, with the latter variable being more
   relevant in some specific cases (e.g., snowmelt-fed rivers, rivers
   impacted by hydropower production). The model uses a hybrid formulation
   characterized by a physically based structure associated with a
   stochastic calibration of the parameters. The interpretation of the
   parameter values allows for better understanding of river thermal
   dynamics and the identification of the most relevant factors affecting
   it. The satisfactory agreement of different versions of the model with
   measurements in three different rivers (root mean square error smaller
   than 1 degrees C, at a daily timescale) suggests that the proposed model
   can represent a useful tool to synthetically describe medium- and
   long-term behavior, and capture the changes induced by varying external
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Strain Rate Effect on Development Length of Steel Reinforcement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Accidental or premeditated explosions have detrimental effects on the
   infrastructure near the center of explosion and pose major threats to
   human life. Thus, research is currently underway to study the effects of
   explosions on infrastructure systems with the ultimate goal of
   minimizing infrastructure damage and saving lives. Because reinforced
   concrete is the most common building material used in blast-resistant
   infrastructure design and construction, understanding the effect of
   blast loads on reinforced concrete components is essential to reaching
   this goal. The prevailing design philosophy for blast-resistant
   structures is energy dissipation through reinforcement yielding
   (ductility) and large bending deformations without the incidence of
   nonductile failure modes such as shear and bond. However, information
   regarding the bond behavior and strength of steel reinforcement-concrete
   bonds under blast loads is rather scant; therefore, this paper reports
   on an experimental program designed to investigate the strain rate
   effect on steel reinforcement-concrete bond. Reinforced concrete beams
   longitudinally reinforced with 15M, 20M, or 25M were tested in a shock
   tube under simulated blast loading. The test results show that high
   strain rate increases the steel reinforcement-concrete bond strength and
   thus, that the static load development lengths of these bars are
   adequate for developing their dynamic yield strengths at high strain
   rate. The dynamic increase factor for bond stress is determined to be
   1.11 for 15M, 2.24 for 20M, and 3.68 for 25M bar. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Viterbi decoding is commonly used for several protocols, but
   computational cost is quite high and thus it is necessary to implement
   it effectively. This paper describes GPU implementation of Viterbi
   decoder utilizing three-point Viterbi decoding algorithm (TVDA), in
   which the received bits are divided into multiple chunks and several
   chunks are decoded simultaneously. Coalesced access and Warp Shuffle,
   which is new instruction introduced are also utilized in order to
   improve decoder performance. In addition, iterative execution of
   parallel chunks decoding reduces the latency of proposed Viterbi decoder
   in order to utilize the decoder as a part of GPU-based SDR transceiver.
   As the result, the throughput of proposed Viterbi decoder is improved by
   23.1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Mammals have adapted to a variety of natural environments from
   underwater to aerial and these different adaptations have affected their
   specific perceptive and cognitive abilities. This study used a
   computer-controlled touchscreen system to examine the visual
   discrimination abilities of horses, particularly regarding size and
   shape, and compared the results with those from chimpanzee, human and
   dolphin studies. Horses were able to discriminate a difference of 14\%
   in circle size but showed worse discrimination thresholds than
   chimpanzees and humans; these differences cannot be explained by visual
   acuity. Furthermore, the present findings indicate that all species use
   length cues rather than area cues to discriminate size. In terms of
   shape discrimination, horses exhibited perceptual similarities among
   shapes with curvatures, vertical/horizontal lines and diagonal lines,
   and the relative contributions of each feature to perceptual similarity
   in horses differed from those for chimpanzees, humans and dolphins.
   Horses pay more attention to local components than to global shapes.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal contamination of water resources is a major public health concern
   in densely populated areas since these water bodies are used for
   drinking water production or recreational purposes. A main source of
   this contamination originates from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in
   regions with combined sewer systems. Thus, the treatment of CSO
   discharges is urgent.
   In this study, we explored whether ozonation or UV irradiation can
   efficiently reduce pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites
   in CSOs. Experiments were carried out in parallel settings at the
   outflow of a stormwater settling tank in the Ruhr area, Germany.
   The results showed that both techniques reduce most hygienically
   relevant bacteria, parasites and viruses. Under the conditions tested,
   ozonation yielded lower outflow values for the majority of the tested
   parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

   concentration after irradiation; the lower the oxygen concentration, the
   more slowly the color fades, and this process is irreversible in the
   absence of oxygen. This compound could be used for the fast detection of
   oxygen by naked eye recognition of the color change and recycled at

Abstract = {{Weld pool geometry performs an important function in improving weld
   quality during welding. In the present work, the influences of deposited
   metal material parameters, including surface tension gradient, magnetic
   permittivity, and thermal expansion coefficient, on weld pool geometry
   were investigated. Fusion length (FL) and fusion ratio (FR) were
   proposed to analyze weld pool evolution quantitatively. Results reveal
   that surface tension gradient exerts the most significant effects on
   weld pool geometry. The effects of magnetic permittivity are less
   extensive than those of surface tension gradient, and thermal expansion
   coefficient exerts only slight influences on weld pool geometry.
   Considering the effects of surface tension gradient, magnetic
   permittivity, and thermal expansion coefficient, a classification method
   for deposited metals was proposed. Based on the characteristics of the
   weld pool geometry, heat and mass transfer processes in the weld pool,
   and application conditions, various types of deposited metals were
   analyzed. Comparison of the simulated and experimental results showed
   that the error ranges of FR and FL are 3.66-4.53\% and 1.03-2.83\%,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the goals of transportation system construction and management is
   to improve individuals' accessibility or the ease of reaching desired
   activities, destinations and services. However, many transportation
   network design models instead focus on maximizing individuals' mobility
   or the ease of movement within the network. By adapting a space time
   prism analysis framework, this paper aims to address a new urban network
   design problem to maximize the system-wide transportation accessibility
   between major activity locations, subject to a given highway
   construction budget. By constructing a time-dependent space time
   network, we formulate the problem as a linear integer programming model
   to maximize the number of accessible activity locations within travel
   time budget for road users. A Lagrangian relaxation solution framework
   effectively decomposes the original complex problem into classical
   subproblems such as knapsack and time-dependent least cost problems.
   Various examples and discussions are provided to consider the
   effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling
   accessibility-enhancement strategies such as congestion mitigation and
   land use policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that as individuals become attached to a place,
   they are more likely to protect that place. Managers of natural area
   tourism destinations may be able to use this relationship to assist in
   sustainably managing such places. An on-site visitor survey was
   administered at Ningaloo Marine Park, Australia, to examine the effect
   of a multi-dimensional place attachment construct on pro-environment
   behavioral intentions. The behaviors encompassed three categories based
   on the perceived level of commitment and where the behaviors physically
   occurred. They included on-site actions by visitors, visitors telling
   others how to act on-site, and off-site actions to conserve the Marine
   Park. Structural equation modeling revealed place identity directly
   affecting all three behavioral categories, the effect increasing with
   the level of commitment required to undertake the pro-environment
   behaviors. This suggests that a sophisticated understanding of place
   identity is essential for the management of natural area tourism
   destinations.}},

   range from .82 to .88; quality manager competence consists of six latent
   variables, the reliability of test found from .73 to .92; the training
   variable is measured four items with ratio scale, the reliability
   carries a alpha value of .68. The samples, drawn by simple random
   sampling method, are 132 quality managers. 105 completed questionnaires
   representing 83.33 percent are returned. SmartPLS is used in data
   analysis. The findings indicate positive relationship between knowledge
   management and competency of quality managers. In contrast, training has
   no impact on the competency, but both explain ability of quality
   managers at 60.50\%. Based on the information mentioned above, the
   knowledge management process is a crucial factor to develop and elevate
   competence of quality managers.}},

   accelerated artificial conditions that allow for the proposal of a
   comprehensive mechanism of EVOH oxidation. The photochemical behaviour
   of EVOH/zeolite nanocomposites with different morphology and size of

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a semi-empirical numerical model
   for a solar hydrogen system consisting of a proton exchange membrane
   electrolyser (PEM) powered by photovoltaic panels to produce hydrogen as
   fuel for cooking applications, focussing on Jamaica as a suitable
   case-study. The model was developed in TRNSYS and includes a novel
   numerical component based on FORTRAN to model the operation of the PEM
   electrolyser. The numerical component was developed based on operational
   data from a purpose constructed small-scale experimental rig. The
   numerical model was calibrated using data from the experimental rig
   powered by operational data from a photovoltaic panel system in the UK
   and predicted photovoltaic panel power data from Jamaica. For the test
   conditions, experiments indicated an electrolysis maximum efficiency of
   63.6\%. The calibrated model was used to develop a case study analysis
   for a small community in Jamaica with a daily cooking demand of 39.6 kWh
   or 1.7 kg of H-2 gas. Simulations indicate that the H-2 production plan
   is sufficient for the cooking needs of the case-study. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concrete is by far the most used building material in the world, but is
   facing a large environmental challenge due to its cement content. The
   production of portland cement is responsible for 5 to 8\% of worldwide
   CO2 emissions. Waste and supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) such
   as blast-furnace slag can be used as partial or total substitute for
   portland cement to avoid or to reduce this negative effect. This work
   explores the study of durability and the mechanical behavior of
   concretes using urban and industrial waste glasses as a potential
   alkaline activator for slag (AAS).
   The development of strengths and microstructure in the concretes
   activated with waste glass were also comparable to the parameters
   observed in AAS concretes prepared with conventional activators.
   Durability tests, including chloride penetration resistance,
   freezing-and-thawing resistance, carbonation, resistivity, and porosity,
   were conducted and the effect of the different parameters such as the
   activator type is discussed.}},

Title = {{Critical limb ischemia: thrombogenic evaluation of two autologous cell

Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDCell therapy has been proposed as a salvage limb procedure in
   critical limb ischemia (CLI). Autologous cell therapy products (CTP) are
   obtained from patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease to be
   injected at the site of ischemia. Thrombogenicity of CTPs has not yet
   been assessed. The objectives were: 1) to assess thrombotic risk in
   candidates for cell therapy, 2) to evaluate two different CTPs in terms
   of thrombogenic potential, and 3) to evaluate clinical thrombotic
   events.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSIn this ancillary study of a Phase I and II
   clinical trial, bone marrow (BM)-CTPs (n=20) and CTPs obtained by
   cytapheresis (peripheral blood {[}PB]-CTPs; n=20) were compared.
   Inflammatory and coagulation markers were measured at baseline and 24
   hours after CTP implantation. CTP cell content and tissue factor (TF)
   expression (mRNA and protein) were analyzed. Thrombin generation
   assessed CTP-related thrombogenicity.
   RESULTSAll patients presented cardiovascular risk factors. At baseline,
   the patients' biologic profile was characterized by high levels of
   fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6, and
   plasmatic TF, whereas IL-10 was low. Although different in terms of cell
   composition, both BM- and PB-CTPs support low thrombin generation.
   Twenty-four hours after implantation, biologic markers remained stable
   in the PB-CTP group, except for IL-6. In the BM-CTP group, a significant
   increase of IL-6 but also of CRP and D-dimer was observed. Clinically,
   one single patient developed deep vein thrombosis 24 hours after the
   implantation of autologous PB-CTP.
   CONCLUSIONCTPs supported low thrombin generation and were well tolerated
   after calf implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Principles of the molecular statistical theory of small multicomponent
   drops/microcrystals in a three-dimensional bulk and in two-dimensional
   adsorption systems are developed. Equations of the theory are derived
   using the cluster approach. The theory describes discrete distributions
   of molecules in space (on a size scale comparable to the molecular size)
   and continuous molecular distributions (at short distances inside cells)
   upon their translational and vibrational motions. The theory provides a
   unified description of the equilibrium molecular distributions in three
   aggregate states and at their interfaces. Pair intermolecular
   interaction potentials (such as the Mie potential) in several
   coordination spheres that determine lattice structure compressibility
   are taken into account. For simplicity, it is considered that the sizes
   of mixture components are virtually the same. Structural cell
   distribution functions for the transition region of curved interfaces
   are derived. Expressions for the pressure tensor components inside small
   bodies are obtained, allowing us to calculate the thermodynamic
   characteristics of a vapor-liquid interface, including surface tension.
   Questions regarding the consistency between the theory of phase
   transitions in small systems and the traditional theory of associate
   (cluster) formation and the transition to systems limited in the total
   volume value are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI offers the unique opportunity of assessing the structural
   connections of human brains in vivo. With the advance of diffusion MRI
   technology, multi-shell imaging methods are becoming increasingly
   practical for large scale studies and clinical application. In this
   work, we propose a novel method for the analysis of multi-shell
   diffusion imaging data by incorporating compartment models into a
   spherical deconvolution framework for fiber orientation distribution
   (FOD) reconstruction. For numerical implementation, we develop an
   adaptively constrained energy minimization approach to efficiently
   compute the solution. On simulated and real data from Human Connectome
   Project (HCP), we show that our method not only reconstructs sharp and
   clean FODs for the modeling of fiber crossings, but also generates
   reliable estimation of compartment parameters with great potential for
   clinical research of neurological diseases. In comparisons with publicly
   available DSI-Studio and BEDPOSTX of FSL, we demonstrate that our method
   reconstructs sharper FODs with more precise estimation of fiber
   directions. By applying probabilistic tractography to the FODs computed
   by our method, we show that more complete reconstruction of the corpus
   callosum bundle can be achieved. On a clinical, two-shell diffusion
   imaging data, we also demonstrate the feasibility of our method in
   analyzing white matter lesions.}},

Title = {{Pesticide exposure and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: A case-control
   study using a geographic information system (GIS) to link SEER-Medicare
   and California pesticide data}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of
   primary liver cancer, is associated with low survival. U.S. studies
   examining self-reported pesticide exposure in relation to HCC have
   demonstrated inconclusive results. We aimed to clarify the association
   between pesticide exposure and HCC by implementing a novel data linkage
   between Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)Medicare and
   California Pesticide Use Report (PUR) data using a geographic
   information system (GIS).
   Methods: Controls were frequency-matched to HCC cases diagnosed between
   2000 and 2009 in California by year, age, race, sex, and duration of
   residence in California. Potential confounders were extracted from
   Medicare claims. From 1974 to 2008, pounds (1 pound represents 0.45 kg)
   of applied organophosphate, organochlorine, and carbamate pesticides
   provided in PURs were aggregated to the ZIP Code level using area
   weighting in a GIS. ZIP Code exposure estimates were linked to subjects
   using Medicare-provided ZIP Codes to calculate pesticide exposure.
   Agricultural residents were defined as living in ZIP Codes with a
   majority area intersecting agricultural land cover according to the
   1992, 2001, and 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) rasters.
   Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the
   association between pesticide exposure and HCC.
   Results: Among California residents of agriculturally intensive areas,
   previous annual ZIP Code-level exposure to over 14.53 kg/km(2) of
   organochlorine pesticides (75th percentile among controls) was
   associated with an increased risk of HCC after adjusting for liver
   disease and diabetes (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR] 1.87,95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.17, 2.99; p = 0.0085). ZIP Code-level organochlorines
   were significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC among males
   (adjusted OR 2.76, 95\% CI 1.58, 4.82; p=0.0004), but not associated
   with HCC among females (adjusted OR 0.83, 95\% CI 035, 1.93; p=0.6600)
   (interaction p=0.0075).
   Conclusions: This is the first epidemiologic study to use GIS-based
   exposure estimates to study pesticide exposure and HCC. Our results
   suggest that organochlorine pesticides are associated with an increase
   in HCC risk among males but not females. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Polyisobutylene (PIB) and its copolymers are used in a wide range of
   commercial products owing to their high chemical stability,
   impermeability, elasticity, and biocompatibility. The development of
   arborescent PIB (arb-PIB) opens many new possibilities for tuning PIB's
   properties and for introducing new functionalities. In this work,
   arb-PIB with short isoprene-rich terminal sequences (arb-PIB-co-IP) was
   functionalized to provide arborescent epoxide, allylic alcohol, and
   carboxylic acid derivatives of PIB. The carboxylic acid derivative was
   used to conjugate the antiproliferative agent paclitaxel (PTX) for
   investigation as a potential vascular stent coating. The thermal,
   tensile, and rheological properties of all of the functionalized arb-PIB
   materials were studied and compared to their linear analogues in order
   to gain insight into the effects of polymer architecture on these
   properties as well as to determine their suitability as potential
   medical device coatings. A coating using the PTX conjugate was found to
   release PTX much more slowly than control formulations with physically
   encapsulated drug, yet was still able to prevent cell adhesion and
   proliferation on their surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   external formate}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{345-351}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen gas (H-2) production was studied in bacteria cultured at
   different pH conditions, and on different carbon substrates. H-2
   production by Escherichia coli was first studied during glycerol
   fermentation when external formate (10 mM) was supplemented. Changes in
   H-2 production rate (V-H2) were determined when in the assays glycerol
   and/or formate were supplemented at pH 7.5 and pH 6.5, using single and
   double mutants coding large subunits of different hydrogenases (Hyd-1,
   Hyd-2 and Hyd-3) as well as selC (coding for formate dehydrogenases),
   hyaB hybC (coding for large subunits of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, respectively)
   selC or hyaB hybC hycE (coding for large subunit of Hyd-3) triple
   mutants at both pHs. The results point out that Hyd-3 becomes mainly
   responsible for H-2 production by E. coli during glycerol fermentation
   when external formate is added; Hyd-4 can also contribute to H-2
   production. Besides, in the glycerol supplemented assays, three
   hydrogenases can work in H-2 producing mode and only deletion of three
   of them decreases the production of H-2 which might be due to
   disturbance of H-2 cycling. This is of significance in application of
   different carbon sources in renewable energy production technology using
   bacteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   1.5 and 2.5 mol\% of Al2O3 . The in-vitro bioactivity of these samples
   was assessed by immersion in SBF solution for different time periods
   under physiological conditions. The formation of hydroxy carbonate
   apatite (HCA) layer on the surface of the glass samples after SBF
   treatment was confirmed by FTIR, XRD and SEM. The partial substitution
   of Al2O3 for K2O in glass demonstrated a significant increase in
   mechanical properties such as compressive strength and elastic modulus,
   respectively. The cytotoxicity, cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis
   and cell attachment were assessed using human osteosarcoma U2-OS cell
   lines. The cell culture studies demonstrated that the samples containing
   high concentration of Al2O3 showed a cytotcodc nature against cell
   lines. But the blood compatibility showed that all the samples were
   tolerant. Finally, this study clearly concludes that the optimization of
   Al2O3 in present potash based bioactive glasses would be potential
   biomaterials for biomedical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{The formation of naturally derived materials with wet stable fibrous
   architectures is paramount in order to mimic the features of tissues at
   the molecular and microscopic scale. Here, we investigated the formation
   of wet-spun fibres based on collagen-derived polypeptides with
   comparable chemical composition and varied molecular weight. Gelatin and
   hydrolysed fish collagen (HFC) were selected as widely available linear
   amino-acidic chains of high and low molecular weight, respectively, and
   functionalised in the wet-spun fibre state in order to preserve the
   material geometry in physiological conditions. Wet-spun fibre diameter
   and morphology were dramatically affected depending on the polypeptide
   molecular weight, wet-spinning solvent (i.e. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and
   dimethyl sulfoxide) and coagulating medium (i.e. acetone and ethanol),
   resulting in either bulky or porous internal geometry. Dry-state tensile
   moduli were significantly enhanced in gelatin and HFC samples following
   covalent crosslinking with activated 1,3-phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) (E:
   726 +/- 43-844 +/- 85 MPa), compared to samples crosslinked via
   intramolecular carbodiimide-mediated condensation reaction (E: 588 +/-
   38 MPa). Resulting fibres displayed a dry diameter in the range of 238
   +/- 18-355 +/- 28 mu m and proved to be mechanically stable (E: 230 kPa)
   following equilibration with PBS, whilst a nearly complete degradation
   was observed after 5-day incubation in physiological conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{Various stirring methods, including a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen
   bubbling, and ultrasonic stirring, were investigated to debubbling
   hydrogen during electrodeposition of 25 mu m-thick Co76Ni18P6 layers on
   copper. Microstructure observation shows that a lot of hillocks form on
   the surface of Co-Ni-P films when using magnetic stirring. While a
   smooth surface morphology was obtained for those using nitrogen bubbling
   and ultrasonic stirring. This manifests effective depriving of hydrogen
   during electrodeposition with the later two stirring methods. All
   Co-Ni-P layers exhibit the coexistence of hexagonal closed packing (HCP)
   and face-centered cubic phases. The films obtained using magnetic
   stirring have a random crystalline orientation and longitudinal magnetic
   anisotropy showing intrinsic coercivity (H-ci) 1.45 kOe and remanence
   (M-r) 7.7 kG. Nitrogen bubbling bestows Co-Ni-P layers a rather strong
   HCP (002) texture, which leads to the enhanced perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy showing out-of-plane H-ci 2.65 kOe and M-r 1.9 kG. On the
   other hand, samples deposited using ultrasonic stirring have a
   relatively weak HCP (002) texture, and thus the magnetic behavior is
   longitudinal. Ultrasound vibration induces local heating and cavitation
   on the electroplating surface leading to the deteriorated (002) texture
   and surface roughening than that of the nitrogen bubbling.}},

Abstract = {{Mining of frequent patterns in databases has been studied for several
   years. However, real-world databases contain noise and frequent pattern
   mining which extracts patterns that are absolutely matched is not
   enough. Therefore, a research field called fault-tolerant frequent
   pattern (FT-pattern) mining is proposed to deal with this problem. In
   this paper, we consider the problem of mining proportional FT-patterns.
   That is, the number of faults tolerable in a pattern is proportional to
   the length of the pattern. To reduce the disk I/O times, a depth-first
   mining approach is proposed to mine proportional FT-patterns efficiently
   in large database. Moreover, a set of experiments is performed to show
   the advantage of the approach. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms the other existing approach when the
   database size is large.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of O during the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of B-doped
   diamond results in the suppression of B incorporation into the diamond
   film. In this study, we demonstrate that the amount of residual O within
   the chamber is higher at the beginning of the diamond growth due to the
   O-contaminated chamber walls, and is decreased after a certain time
   period. This leads to a gradual increase of the B incorporation by more
   than one order of magnitude during the early growth phases of
   nanocrystalline diamond (NCD). We further show that this suppression of
   B incorporation at the early growth phases of B-doped diamond is
   influenced by the growth rate of the film. This is attributed to the
   constant time period whereby most of the residual O interacts with the
   B-precursors in the gas phase by forming stable B-O species, which are
   flushed out from the chamber exhaust. Furthermore, the constant B
   profile of an NCD film grown in a loadlock hot-filament CVD (HFCVD)
   system reveals that the amount of residual O is constant and minimal
   during the growth process. Therefore, our work proves that the use of a
   loadlock overcomes the B-suppression problem at the early growth phases
   of diamond, making it the optimal solution for the growth of highly
   conductive thin diamond films. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

   the genus Streptomyces on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data
   (97.73-98.07 \% similarity). The strain exhibited cell-wall chemotype I
   and phospholipid type II. The menaquinones present were MK-9 (H-6), MK-9
   (H-8) and MK-10 (H-2). Major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15 (: 0),
   iso-C-16 : 0, iso-C-15 : 0, and anteiso-C-17 : 0. The level of DNA-DNA
   relatedness between strain T66T and closely related type strains was
   determined to be below 40 \%. Strain T66T had spiral spore chains and a
   rugose spore surface that is different from its closest relatives.
   Comparison of the genotypic and phenotypic features confirmed that
   strain T66T (=KEMB 9005-219(T) =KACC 18226(T) =NBRC 110902(T)) should be
   considered as the type strain of a novel species in the genus
   Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces fabae sp. nov. is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the expression profile of a gene is a critical piece of
   information required to build an understanding of the normal and
   essential functions of that gene and any role it may play in the
   development or progression of disease. High-throughput, large-scale
   efforts are on-going internationally to characterise reporter-tagged
   knockout mouse lines. As part of that effort, we report an open access
   adult mouse expression resource, in which the expression profile of 424
   genes has been assessed in up to 47 different organs, tissues and
   sub-structures using a lacZ reporter gene. Many specific and informative
   expression patterns were noted. Expression was most commonly observed in
   the testis and brain and was most restricted in white adipose tissue and
   mammary gland. Over half of the assessed genes presented with an absent
   or localised expression pattern (categorised as 0-10 positive
   structures). A link between complexity of expression profile and
   viability of homozygous null animals was observed; inactivation of genes
   expressed in >= 21 structures was more likely to result in reduced
   viability by postnatal day 14 compared with more restricted expression
   profiles. For validation purposes, this mouse expression resource was
   compared with Bgee, a federated composite of RNA-based expression data
   sets. Strong agreement was observed, indicating a high degree of
   specificity in our data. Furthermore, there were 1207 observations of
   expression of a particular gene in an anatomical structure where Bgee
   had no data, indicating a large amount of novelty in our data set.
   Examples of expression data corroborating and extending
   genotype-phenotype associations and supporting disease gene candidacy
   are presented to demonstrate the potential of this powerful resource.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian Football League's (AFL's) Father-Son rule is a unique
   player drafting rule that allows sons of former players to be selected
   by their father's club. The rules that determine eligibility have
   undergone numerous changes since its introduction in 1949, including
   rules for new teams from outside of the traditional Victorian-based
   clubs that had no history of fathers from which Father-Son selections
   could be derived. The observed number of Father-Son selections to each
   club is markedly different between the Victorian-based clubs, and
   between the Victorian and non-Victorian-based clubs. In this paper, a
   demographic model and player data from the AFL and the state leagues are
   used to estimate the annual number of available sons to each of the AFL
   clubs. Results show that the observed number of selections can largely
   be explained by the number of available sons. The model can also be used
   to predict the number of available sons into the future, and so can be
   used to guide management decisions regarding competitive balance if
   further modifications to the AFL's Father-Son rule are required. (C)

Journal = {{ANNALS OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{362}},
Pages = {{370-423}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Contemporary understanding of correlations in quantum many-body systems
   and in quantum phase transitions is based to a large extent on the
   recent intensive studies of entanglement in many-body systems. In
   contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum nonlocality in
   these systems, mostly because the available multipartite Bell
   inequalities involve high-order correlations among many particles, which
   are hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally.
   Standard, ``theorist- and experimentalist-friendly{''} many-body
   observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely
   three...) particles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality
   for this scenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently,
   however, we have succeeded in constructing multipartite Bell
   inequalities that involve two- and one-body correlations only, and
   showed how they revealed the nonlocality in many-body systems relevant
   for nuclear and atomic physics (Tura et al., Science 344 (2014) 1256].
   With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On
   the one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell
   inequalities, pertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved
   parties. On the other hand, we present a couple of new results
   concerning such Bell inequalities. First, we characterize their
   tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum violations of these
   inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with the number of
   parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell inequalities
   which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke states-ground states of physically
   relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we shortly
   discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic
   systems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity
   of designed nanostructures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Total renal volume (TRV) is an important
   quantitative indicator of the progression of autosomal dominant
   polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The Consortium for Radiologic Imaging
   Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease proposes a method for TRV
   computation based on manual tracing and geometric modeling. Alternative
   approaches for TRV computation are represented by the application of
   advanced image processing techniques. In this study, we aimed to compare
   TRV estimates derived from these two different approaches.
   Materials and Methods: The nearly automated technique for the analysis
   of magnetic resonance (MR) images was tested on 30 ADPKD patients. TRV
   was computed from both axial (KVax) and coronal (KVcor) acquisitions and
   compared to measurements based on geometric modeling (KVap) by linear
   regression and Bland-Altman analysis. In addition, to assess
   reproducibility, intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were
   computed.
   Results: Linear regression analysis between KVax and KVcor resulted in
   an excellent correlation (KVax = 1 KVcor - 0.78; r(2) = 0.997).
   Bland-Altman analysis showed a negligible bias and narrow limits of
   agreement (bias: -11.7 mL; SD: 54.3 mL). Similar results were obtained
   by comparison of volumes obtained applying the nearly automated method
   and the one based on geometric modeling (y = 0.98x + 75.9; r(2) = 0.99;
   bias: -53.7 mL; SD: 108.1 mL). Importantly, geometric modeling does not
   provide reliable TRV estimates in huge kidney affected by regional
   deformation. lntraobserver and interobserver variability resulted in
   very small percentage error <2\%.
   Conclusions: The results of this study provide the feasibility of using
   a nearly automated approach for accurate and fast evaluation of TRV also
   in markedly enlarged ADPKD kidneys including exophytic cysts.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common male-predominant
   type of cancer worldwide. There is no effective treatment regimen
   available for advanced-stage disease and chemotherapy is generally
   ineffective in these patients. The number of studies on the prevalence
   of K-Ras mutations in HCC patients is currently limited. A total of 58
   patients from 6 comprehensive cancer centers in 4 metropolitan cities of
   Turkey were enrolled in this study. Each center committed to enroll
   approximately 10 random patients whose formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
   tumor tissues were available for K-Ras, exon 2 genotyping. Two methods
   were applied based on the availability of adequate amounts of tumor DNA.
   In the first method, the samples were processed using TheraScreen. The
   genomic DNA was further used to detect the 7 most frequent somatic
   mutations (35G>A; 35G>C; 35G>T; 34G>A; 34G>C; 34G>T and 38G>A) in codons
   12 and 13 in exon 2 of the K-Ras oncogene by quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR). In the second method, the genomic DNA was
   amplified by PCR using primers specific for K-Ras exon 2 with the GML
   SeqFinder Sequencing System's KRAS kit. The identified DNA sequence
   alterations were confirmed by sequencing both DNA strands in two
   independent experiments with forward and reverse primers. A total of 40
   samples had adequate tumor tissue for the mutation analysis. A total of
   33 (82.5\%) of the investigated samples harbored no mutations in exon 2.
   All the mutations were identified via a direct sequencing technique,
   whereas none were identified by TheraScreen. In conclusion, in our
   patients, HCC exhibited a remarkably low (<20\%) K-Ras mutation rate.
   Patients harboring K-Ras wild-type tumors may be good candidates for
   treatment with epidermal growth factor inhibitors, such as cetuximab.}},

Abstract = {{We examine updated Wechsler IQ data in 7-year old twins from the
   Louisville Twin Study for evidence of an interaction between the
   heritability of IQ and socioeconomic status. Data records that had never
   been entered were recovered, allowing us to increase previously reported
   sample sizes by more than 20 \%. Twin families were assigned
   socioeconomic status scores using a Hollingshead index based on parental
   education and occupation. A structural equation model in which genetic
   and environmental variances were modeled as squared linear functions of
   SES provided ambiguous replication of earlier findings from the National
   Collaborative Perinatal Project: relations between SES and heritability
   for performance and full scale IQ were in the same direction as the
   previous report, but at p < 0.07. As was the case in Turkheimer et al.
   (Psychol Sci 14(6):623-628, 2003), no interaction was found for VIQ.
   These results cannot yet be taken as a definitive replication of
   Turkheimer et al. (Psychol Sci 14(6):623-628, 2003). Many more
   measurement occasions, subtests and environmental moderators remain to

Abstract = {{It is a truism that Ancient Greece has influenced the Western World,
   indeed the whole world, in more ways than one. The contributions of the
   ancient Greeks across the entire spectrum of human activity, be it
   science, technology, art or literature, cannot be overestimated. This
   essay focuses on the metier that the medical doctor of today serves
   daily through teaching, laboratory and clinical research or practice;
   namely, medicine and the related sciences. This, inevitably, will bring
   to mind the Hippocratic Oath, our constitutional Charter of Ethics,
   attributed to Hippocrates, the most outstanding figure in the history of
   Western medicine. It will also remind us of the Corpus Hippocraticum, a
   collection of more than sixty medical treatises carried down to us from
   antiquity under the name of Hippocrates, but most probably produced
   largely by his disciples and followers between the 5th and 4th centuries
   B.C. This Corpus laid the foundations for the scientific analysis,
   development and growth of medicine as it is known today. Modern Greece,
   however, may also in her own right lay claim to being a true heir to the
   legacy left by Hippocrates, a claim most admirably exemplified in the
   person of Dr George Papanicolaou, the renowned 19th century Greek
   pioneer in cytology and early cancer detection, and inventor of the
   ``Pap smear{''}. This essay is itself a short journey into the past,
   drawing special attention to certain important features of the lasting
   achievements of both Hippocrates and Papanicolaou and the impact they
   have had on the history of medicine, and identifying a number of
   questions concerning the ethics of modern medical research.}},

Pages = {{2167-2178}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the effect of dissolution of salts on the
   hydrogen-bonded network in liquid water, near-infrared absorption
   spectra of aqueous solutions of 16 salts, containing Na+ as common
   cation, were measured in the region where the first overtone of the -OH
   stretching mode of water is observed. Although the spectral variations
   of water resulting from dissolution of a salt is dependent on the kind
   of salt, principal component analysis of the observed spectra revealed
   that all spectral variations for the 16 salts were almost reproducible
   with only three components. The first component corresponds to the
   average of the observed spectra, while the other two components are
   responsible for the variations. The second component, which almost
   coincides with the component of the spectral variation of water from
   changes in temperature, was found to explain mainly the spectral changes
   by salts that destroy the hydrogen-bonded network. On the other hand,
   the third component, which includes the spectral changes at a lower
   wavenumber region than the second component, was found to mainly explain
   the spectral variation from the salts that expand the hydrogen-bonded
   network. These results suggest that observed spectral variations are not
   due to direct interaction between ions and water molecules, but due to
   the change of the hydrogen-bonded network because all variations
   produced by these 16 salts can be explained by only two components. The
   results suggest also that the mechanisms of destruction and expansion of
   the hydrogen-bonded network by the anions may be different.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to model unsteady fluid dynamics in a compressor
   network by using a bond graph is presented. The model is intended in
   particular for compressor control system development. First, we develop
   a bond graph model of a single compression system. Bond graph modeling
   offers a different perspective to previous work by modeling the
   compression system based on energy flow instead of fluid dynamics.
   Analyzing the bond graph model explains the energy flow during
   compressor surge. Two principal solutions for compressor surge problem
   are identified: upstream energy injection and downstream energy
   dissipation. Both principal solutions are verified in bond graph
   modelings of single compression system equipped with a surge avoidance
   system (SAS) and single compression system equipped with an active
   control system. Moreover, the bond graph model of single compressor
   equipped with SAS is able to show the effect of recycling flow to the
   compressor upstream states which improves the current available model.
   The bond graph model of a single compression system is then used as the
   base model and combined to build compressor network models. Two
   compressor networks are modeled: serial compressors and parallel
   compressors. Simulation results show the surge conditions in both
   compressor networks.}},

Abstract = {{Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) have been isolated from various sea-ice
   organisms. Their characterisation points to a crucial role in protecting
   the organisms in sub-zero environments. However, their in situ abundance
   and diversity in natural sea-ice microbial communities is largely
   unknown. In this study, we analysed the expression and phylogenetic
   diversity of eukaryotic IBP transcripts from microbial communities of
   Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. IBP transcripts were found in abundances
   similar to those of proteins involved in core cellular processes such as
   photosynthesis. Eighty-nine percent of the IBP transcripts grouped with
   known IBP sequences from diatoms, haptophytes and crustaceans, but the
   majority represented novel sequences not previously characterized in
   cultured organisms. The observed high eukaryotic IBP expression in
   natural eukaryotic sea ice communities underlines the essential role of
   IBPs for survival of many microorganisms in communities living under the
   extreme conditions of polar sea ice.}},

Abstract = {{Operational flexibility is an important property of electric power
   systems and plays a crucial role for the transition of today's power
   systems, many of them based on fossil fuels, towards power systems that
   can efficiently accommodate high shares of variable Renewable Energy
   Sources (RES). The availability of sufficient operational flexibility is
   a necessary prerequisite for the effective grid integration of large
   shares of fluctuating power feed-in from variable RES, especially wind
   power and Photovoltaics (PV).
   This paper establishes the necessary framework for quantifying and
   visualizing the technically available operational flexibility of
   individual power system units and ensembles thereof. Necessary metrics
   for defining power system operational flexibility, namely the power
   ramp-rate, power and energy capability of generators, loads and storage
   devices, are presented. The flexibility properties of different power
   system unit types, e.g. load, generation and storage units that are
   non-controllable, curtailable or fully controllable are qualitatively
   analyzed and compared to each other. Quantitative results and
   flexibility visualizations are presented for intuitive power system
   examples.
   An outlook for the usage of the here proposed methods in power system
   control centers is given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity, defined according to body mass index (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), is an
   increasing problem in the world's population. The proportion of
   extremely obese patients (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) in intensive care units

   70 kg/m(2)) with postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome
   (ARDS) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The
   first patient developed severe pneumonia with ARDS on the fourth day
   postsurgical intervention, and venovenous ECMO was performed. At 6-month
   follow-up after successful weaning from extracorporeal lung support and
   mechanical ventilation, the patient was well but required noninvasive
   ventilation. The second patient developed ARDS because of severe sepsis
   after treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Extracorporeal lung support

Abstract = {{A compensation of atmospheric effects is essential for mm-sensitivity in
   differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR)
   techniques. Numerical weather predictions are used to compensate these
   disturbances allowing a reduction in the number of required radar
   scenes. Practically, predictions are solutions of partial differential
   equations which never can be precise due to model or initialisation
   uncertainties. In order to deal with the chaotic nature of the
   solutions, ensembles of predictions are computed. From a stochastic
   point of view, the ensemble mean is the expected prediction, if all
   ensemble members are equally likely. This corresponds to the typical
   assumption that all ensemble members are physically correct solutions of
   the set of partial differential equations. DInSAR allows adding to this
   knowledge. Observations of refractivity can now be utilised to check the
   likelihood of a solution and to weight the respective ensemble member to
   estimate a better expected prediction.
   The objective of the paper is to show the synergy between ensemble
   weather predictions and differential interferometric atmospheric
   correction. We demonstrate a new method first to compensate better for
   the atmospheric effect in DInSAR and second to estimate an improved
   numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensemble mean. Practically, a least
   squares fit of predicted atmospheric effects with respect to a
   differential interferogram is computed. The coefficients of this fit are
   interpreted as likelihoods and used as weights for the weighted ensemble
   mean. Finally, the derived weighted prediction has minimal expected
   quadratic errors which is a better solution compared to the
   straightforward best-fitting ensemble member. Furthermore, we propose an
   extension of the algorithm which avoids the systematic bias caused by
   deformations. It makes this technique suitable for time series analysis,
   e.g. persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). We validate the
   algorithm using the well known Netherlands-DInSAR test case and first
   show that the atmospheric compensation improves by nearly 40\% compared
   to the straightforward technique. Second, we compare our results with
   independent sea level pressure data. In our test case, the mean squared
   error is reduced by 29\% compared to the averaged ensemble members with
   equal weights. An application demonstration using actual Sentinel-1 data
   and a typical test site with significant subsidence (Mexico City)
   completes the paper. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {{Introduction: Our aim was to evaluate the findings of intraoperative
   nerve monitoring (IONM) in two cases with preoperative vocal cord palsy.
   Case 1: a 61-year-old female with recurrent goiter underwent secondary
   thyroidectomy. The preoperative evaluation of the vocal cords revealed
   right vocal cord paralyses without atrophy. The right recurrent
   laryngeal nerve (RLN) was found to be anatomically intact and preserved.
   The electrical responses of the vocal cords were elicited via IONM. Case
   2: a 26-year-old male, who presented with preoperative right vocal cord
   palsy with atrophy, underwent completion thyroidectomy secondary to
   papillary carcinoma. The right RLN was explored and found to be tied and
   interrupted. There was no signal from the RLN with IONM. Conclusion:
   Even in cases with vocal cord palsy detected preoperatively, the nerve
   should be explored intraoperatively, and should never be sacrificed
   before an evaluation by nerve monitoring. A palsied RLN which has
   electrical activity should be protected to maintain the vocal cord's
   neural tone and to prevent its atrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the association between primary biliary cirrhosis
   (PBC) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published

   (CI) comparing CAD risk in patients with PBC versus non-PBC controls.
   Pooled risk ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were combined using a
   random-effect model and generic inverse variance of DerSimonian and
   Laird methods.
   Result: Four studies with 3362 patients with PBC were identified and
   included in our data analysis. The pooled risk ratio of CAD in patients
   with PBC was 1.57 (95\% CI, 1.21-2.06). The statistical heterogeneity
   was low with an I-2 of 38\%.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a statistically significant increased

Abstract = {{The development of large, software-intensive systems is a complex
   undertaking that we generally tackle by a divide and conquer strategy.
   Companies thereby face the challenge of coordinating individual aspects
   of software development, in particular between requirements engineering
   (RE) and software testing (ST). A lack of REST alignment can not only
   lead to wasted effort but also to defective software. However, before a
   company can improve the mechanisms of coordination they need to be
   understood first. With REST-bench we aim at providing an assessment tool
   that illustrates the coordination in software development projects and
   identify concrete improvement opportunities. We have developed
   REST-bench on the sound fundamentals of a taxonomy on REST alignment
   methods and validated the method in five case studies. Following the
   principles of technical action research, we collaborated with five
   companies, applying REST-bench and iteratively improving the method
   based on the lessons we learned. We applied REST-bench both in Agile and
   plan-driven environments, in projects lasting from weeks to years, and
   staffed as large as 1000 employees. The improvement opportunities we
   identified and the feedback we received indicate that the assessment was
   effective and efficient. Furthermore, participants confirmed that their
   understanding on the coordination between RE and ST improved. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) image-derived features
   ({''}radiomics{''}) could help in individualizing patient management.
   Simple geometric features of tumors (necrosis, edema, active tumor) and
   first-order statistics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are used in
   clinical practice. However, these features provide limited
   characterization power because they do not incorporate spatial
   information and thus cannot differentiate patterns. The aim of this work
   is to develop and evaluate a methodological framework dedicated to
   building a prognostic model based on heterogeneity textural features of
   multimodal MRI sequences (T1. T1-contrast. T2 and FLAIR) in GBM. The
   proposed workflow consists in i) registering the available 3D multimodal
   MR images and segmenting the tumor volume, ii) extracting image features
   such as heterogeneity metrics and iii) building a prognostic model by
   selecting, ranking and combining optimal features through machine
   learning (Support Vector Machine). This framework was applied to 40
   histologically proven GBM patients with the endpoint being overall
   survival (OS) classified as above or below the median survival (15
   months). The models combining features from a maximum of two modalities
   were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A
   classification accuracy of 90\% (sensitivity 85\%, specificity 95\%) was
   obtained by combining features from T1 pre-contrast and T1 post-contrast
   sequences. Our results suggest that several textural features in each MR
   sequence have prognostic value in GBM. (C) 2015 AGBM. Published by

Abstract = {{A combinatorial approach of candidate gene-based association analysis
   and genome-wide association study (GWAS) integrated with QTL mapping,
   differential gene expression profiling and molecular haplotyping was
   deployed in the present study for quantitative dissection of complex

   mapping in a flowering time association panel (92 diverse desi and

   of 5724 SNPs discovered from 82 known flowering chickpea gene orthologs
   of Arabidopsis and legumes as well as 832 gene-encoding transcripts that
   are differentially expressed during flower development in chickpea. GWAS
   using both genome-wide GBS- and candidate gene-based genotyping data of
   30,129 SNPs in a structured population of 92 sequenced accessions (with
   200-250 kb LD decay) detected eight maximum effect genomic SNP loci
   (genes) associated (34 \% combined PVE) with flowering time. Six
   flowering time-associated major genomic loci harbouring five robust QTLs
   mapped on a high-resolution intra-specific genetic linkage map were
   validated (11.6-27.3 \% PVE at 5.4-11.7 LOD) further by traditional QTL
   mapping. The flower-specific expression, including differential up- and
   down-regulation (> three folds) of eight flowering time-associated genes
   (including six genes validated by QTL mapping) especially in early
   flowering than late flowering contrasting chickpea accessions/mapping
   individuals during flower development was evident. The gene
   haplotype-based LD mapping discovered diverse novel natural allelic
   variants and haplotypes in eight genes with high trait association
   potential (41 \% combined PVE) for flowering time differentiation in
   cultivated and wild chickpea. Taken together, eight potential
   known/candidate flowering time-regulating genes {[}efl1 (early flowering
   1), FLD (Flowering locus D), GI (GIGANTEA), Myb (Myeloblastosis), SFH3
   (SEC14-like 3), bZIP (basic-leucine zipper), bHLH (basic

   including novel markers, QTLs, alleles and haplotypes delineated by

Abstract = {{Background: Recruitment of individuals into clinical trials is a
   critical step in,completing studies. Reports examining the effectiveness
   of different recruitment strategies, and specifically in infertile
   couples, are limited.
   Methods: We investigated recruitment methods used in two NIH sponsored
   trials, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS II) and Assessment
   of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS),
   and examined which strategies yielded the greatest number of
   participants completing the trials.
   Results: 3683 couples were eligible for screening. 1650 participants
   were randomized and 1339 completed the trials. 750 women were randomized
   in PPCOS II; 212 of the participants who completed the trial were
   referred by physicians. Participants recruited from radio ads (84/750)
   and the internet (81/750) resulted in similar rates of trial completion
   in PPCOS II. 900 participants were randomized in AMIGOS. 440
   participants who completed the trial were referred to the study by
   physicians. The next most successful method in AMIGOS was the use of the
   internet, achieving 78 completed participants. Radio ads proved the most
   successful strategy in both trials for participants who earned <\$50,000
   annually. Radio ads were most successful in enrolling white patients in
   PPCOS II and black patients in AMIGOS. Seven ancillary Clinical Research
   Scientist Training (CREST) sites enrolled 324 of the participants who
   completed the trials.
   Conclusions: Physician referral was the most successful recruitment
   strategy. Radio ads and the internet were the next most successful
   strategies, particularly for women of limited income. Ancillary clinical
   sites were important for overall recruitment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Several biodiesel fuel samples produced from rapeseed oil by the
   noncatalyzed transesterification reaction with supercritical ethanol at
   various temperatures from (593 to 653) K and molar ethanol to rapeseed
   oil ratios from (6:1 to 20:1) were used to measure kinematic viscosity.
   Measurements were made using the capillary viscometer (VPZ-2, Labtex
   Corn., Moscow). The combined expanded uncertainty of the kinematic
   viscosity measurements at the 95 \% confidence level with a coverage
   factor of k = 2 is estimated to be 0.35 \%. All measurements were made
   at temperature of 313.5 K (ASTM D445) and at atmospheric pressure. The
   effect of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) content on the kinematic
   viscosity of biodiesel fuel samples at 313.15 K was studied. The
   correlation between the FAEEs concentration in biodiesel fuel samples
   and their measured kinematic viscosity at 313.15 K was found. The
   derived correlation between the kinematic viscosity and the FAEEs
   contents allows controlling the progress of the rapeseed oil
   transesterification process with supercritical ethanol.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate Ricci flows of almost Kahler structures on
   Lie algebroids when the fundamental geometric objects are completely
   determined by (semi) Riemannian metrics, or (effective) regular
   generating Lagrange/Finsler functions. There are constructed canonical
   almost symplectic connections for which the geometric flows can be
   represented as gradient ones and characterized by nonholonomic
   deformations of Grigory Perelman's functionals. The first goal of this
   paper is to define such thermodynamical type values and derive almost
   Kahler-Ricci geometric evolution equations. The second goal is to study
   how fixed Lie algebroid, i.e. Ricci soliton, configurations can be
   constructed for Riemannian manifolds and/or (co) tangent bundles endowed
   with nonholonomic distributions modelling (generalized) Einstein or
   Finsler-Cartan spaces. Finally, some examples of generic off-diagonal
   solutions for Lie algebroid-type Ricci solitons and (effective) Einstein
   and Lagrange-Finsler algebroids are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Weeds produce a large quantity of seed, which generate several
   generations during the crop cycle. Their biological characteristics,
   such as seed and seedling vigor, allow weeds to persist in unfavorable

   Aniaranthus hybridus L. (pigweed) and Malva parviflora L. (cheeseweed)
   seed vigor using physiological cold test, accelerated aging and standard
   germination in light and darkness and on seedling vigor using a physical
   test, emergence and root growth in substrates with different
   granulometries and two seeding depths in function of seed size. The
   combination of species, seed size, and physiological test constituted
   one treatment with four replications with 25 seeds. In physical tests,
   the combination species, seed size, substrate granulometry and sowing
   depth constituted one treatment with four replications of five seeds.
   Multiple ANOVAs and the Tukey test of comparison of means (p <= 0.01)
   were performed with data of all trials. Both sizes of amaranth seed were
   100 \% viable and cheeseweed seed was 80 \% viable. After the cold and
   accelerated aging tests, germination percentages were lower than those
   of standard germination and higher in amaranth than in cheeseweed (p <=
   0.01). There were no differences between seed sizes within species.
   Emergence percentage of shoots from large seeds sown 1 cm deep in the
   medium and coarse granulometries was higher than that from seeds sown in
   fine substrate 2 cm deep (p <= 0.01). Considering all the factors, final
   root lengths were similar. Cheeseweed seedlings from large seeds took
   longer to deplete their reserves than small seeds and amaranth seeds of
   both sizes. Amaranth was more vigorous than cheeseweed.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that the way in which parents
   discuss everyday emotional experiences with their young children (i.e.,
   elaborative reminiscing) has significant implications for child
   cognitive and socioemotional functioning, and that maltreating parents
   have a particularly difficult time in engaging in this type of dialogue.
   This dyadic interactional exchange, therefore, has the potential to be
   an important process variable linking child maltreatment to
   developmental outcomes at multiple levels of analysis. The current
   investigation evaluated the role of maternal elaborative reminiscing in
   associations between maltreatment and child cognitive, emotional, and
   physiological functioning. Participants included 43 maltreated and 49
   nonmaltreated children (aged 3-6) and their mothers. Dyads participated
   in a joint reminiscing task about four past emotional events, and
   children participated in assessments of receptive language and emotion
   knowledge. Child salivary cortisol was also collected from children
   three times a day (waking, midday, and bedtime) on 2 consecutive days to
   assess daily levels and diurnal decline. Results indicated that
   maltreating mothers engaged in significantly less elaborative
   reminiscing than did nonmaltreating mothers. Maternal elaborative
   reminiscing mediated associations between child maltreatment and child
   receptive language and child emotion knowledge. In addition, there was
   support for an indirect pathway between child maltreatment and child
   cortisol diurnal decline through maternal elaborative reminiscing.
   Directions for future research are discussed, and potential clinical
   implications are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe plastic reconstruction of the ear after microscopically
   controlled tumor surgery is a particular challenge. The chondrocutaneous
   helix rim advancement flap (CHRAF) is perfectly suited for the repair of
   different defects of the helix and even defects beyond.
   ObjectiveHere, we describe two known and two new modifications of the
   CHRAF that enlarge the scope of application in tumor surgery of the ear.
   MethodsWe demonstrate the different techniques and practical application
   of the repair and evaluate the benefits and limitations.
   ResultsThe CHRAF and its modifications is an excellent method for repair
   of various defects of the helical region of the ear.
   ConclusionThe CHRAF and its modifications proves to be an good
   alternative to other methods of closure by preserving the anatomical
   contour and mechanical and acoustic functions in a single-staged
   procedure with excellent aesthetic results. The two new modifications we
   introduced here, enlarge the known armentarium for very large defects of
   the upper pole and the mid-helix of the ear.}},

Title = {{Development of new anatomy reconstruction software to localize cardiac
   isochrones to the cardiac surface from the 12 lead ECG}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) of the cardiac muscle
   can help the pre-procedure planning of the ablation of ventricular
   arrhythmias by reducing the time to localize the origin. Our
   non-invasive ECGI system, the cardiac isochrone positioning system
   (CIPS), requires non-intersecting meshes of the heart, lungs and torso.
   However, software to reconstruct the meshes of the heart, lungs and
   torso with the capability to check and prevent these intersections is
   currently lacking. Consequently the reconstruction of a patient specific
   model with realistic atrial and ventricular wall thickness and
   incorporating blood cavities, lungs and torso usually requires
   additional several days of manual work. Therefore new software was
   developed that checks and prevents any intersections, and thus enables
   the use of accurate reconstructed anatomical models within CIPS. In this
   preliminary study we investigated the accuracy of the created patient
   specific anatomical models from MRI or CT. During the manual
   segmentation of the MRI data the boundaries of the relevant tissues are
   determined. The resulting contour lines are used to automatically morph
   reference meshes of the heart, lungs or torso to match the boundaries of
   the morphed tissue. Five patients were included in the study; models of
   the heart, lungs and torso were reconstructed from standard cardiac MRI
   images. The accuracy was determined by computing the distance between
   the segmentation contours and the morphed meshes. The average accuracy
   of the reconstructed cardiac geometry was within 2 mm with respect to
   the manual segmentation contours on the MRI images. Derived wall volumes
   and left ventricular wall thickness were within the range reported in
   literature. For each reconstructed heart model the anatomical heart axis
   was computed using the automatically determined anatomical landmarks of
   the left apex and the mitral valve. The accuracy of the reconstructed
   heart models was well within the accuracy of the used medical image data
   (pixel size <1.5 mm). For the lungs and torso the number of triangles in
   the mesh was reduced, thus decreasing the accuracy of the reconstructed
   mesh. A novel software tool has been introduced, which is able to
   reconstruct accurate cardiac anatomical models from MRI or CT within
   only a few hours. This new anatomical reconstruction tool might reduce
   the modeling errors within the cardiac isochrone positioning system and
   thus enable the clinical application of CIPS to localize the PVC/VT
   focus to the ventricular myocardium from only the standard 12 lead ECG.

   offending is related to low perceived behavioral conduct. Violent-only
   (vs. non-) offending is negatively related to perceived behavioral
   conduct in both boys and girls. In addition, violent-only (vs. non-)
   offending is related to low perceived scholastic competence in girls but
   high perceived scholastic competence in boys. Both property and violent
   (vs. non-) offending is related to low perceived behavioral conduct but
   high perceived close friendship. The findings generally support the view

Abstract = {{In the past decades several definitions of oral leukoplakia have been
   proposed, the last one, being authorized by the World Health
   Organization (WHO), dating from 2005. In the present treatise an
   adjustment of that definition and the 1978 WHO definition is suggested,
   being : ``A predominantly white patch or plaque that cannot be
   characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disorder; oral
   leukoplakia carries an increased risk of cancer development either in or
   close to the area of the leukoplakia or elsewhere in the oral cavity or
   the head-and-neck region{''}. Furthermore, the use of strict diagnostic
   criteria is recommended for predominantly white lesions for which a
   causative factor has been identified, e.g. smokers' lesion, frictional
   lesion and dental restoration associated lesion. A final diagnosis of
   such leukoplakic lesions can only be made in retrospect after successful
   elimination of the causative factor within a somewhat arbitrarily chosen
   period of 4-8 weeks. It seems questionable to exclude ``frictional
   keratosis{''} and ``alveolar ridge keratosis{''} from the category of
   leukoplakia as has been suggested in the literature. Finally, brief
   attention has been paid to some histopathological issues that may cause
   confusion in establishing a final diagnosis of leukoplakia.}},

Abstract = {{Radial diffusion experiments have been carried out to assess the
   migration of Cl-36, as chloride, through a cementitious backfill
   material. Further experiments in the presence of cellulose degradation
   products were performed to assess the effect of organic ligands on the
   extent and rate of chloride diffusion. Results show that breakthrough of
   Cl-36 is dependent on chloride concentration: as the carrier
   concentration increases, both breakthrough time and the quantity
   retained by the cement matrix decreases. Experiments in the presence of
   cellulose degradation products also show a decrease in time to initial
   breakthrough. However, uptake at various carrier concentrations in the
   presence of organic ligands converges at 45\% of the initial
   concentration as equilibrium is reached. The results are consistent with
   organic ligands blocking sites on the cement that would otherwise be
   available for chloride binding, though further work is required to
   confirm that this is the case. Post-experimental digital autoradiographs
   of the cement cylinders, and elemental mapping showed evidence of
   increased Cl-36 activity associated with black ash-like particles in the
   matrix, believed to correspond to partially hydrated glassy
   calcium-silicate- sulfate-rich clinker.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of
   magnetic-resonance-arthrography (MRA) by experienced musculoskeletal
   radiologists in patients with traumatic-anterior-shoulderinstability
   (TASI), after feedback protocol execution.
   Materials and methods: Forty-five surgically confirmed MRA's were used
   to enhance personal feedback, to discuss differences in outcome between
   MRA assessment and surgical findings and to fine-tune definition
   interpretation agreement of 7 different TASI-related lesions, between
   experienced musculoskeletal radiologists and experienced orthopaedic
   shoulder surgeons. After execution of the feedback protocol 20 new,
   surgically confirmed, MRA's were assessed by 2 experienced
   musculoskeletal radiologists using a seven-lesion standardized scoring
   form. Kappa coefficients, sensitivity, specificity, and differences in
   percentage agreement or correct diagnosis (p-value, McNemar's test) were
   calculated per lesion and overall per 7 lesion types to assess whether
   diagnostic reproducibility and accuracy was improved.
   Results: Per 7 lesion types, the overall kappa and percentage of
   agreement, between the 2 radiologists, were dramatically increased in
   comparison with our former study (k=0.81 versus k=0.48 and 90.7\% versus
   78.2\%, respectively). The overall sensitivity of radiologist 1
   increased from 45.9\% to 87.8\%, the overall sensitivity of radiologist
   2 increased from 63.5\% to 79.6\% and the overall specificity of
   radiologist 2 increased from 80.1\% to 85.7\%. Furthermore, the overall
   percentage of correct diagnosis of both radiologist was also exceedingly
   higher (85.7\% and 83.6\%) compared to our former study (74.4\% and
   74.8\%).
   Conclusion: The implementation of our feedback protocol dramatically
   improved the reproducibility and accuracy of high field MRA by
   experienced musculo skeletal radiologist in patients with traumatic
   anterior shoulder instability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Based on the premise of journalism as a text resulting from intellectual
   endeavour, this article undertakes a sustained examination of the
   thought of author and newspaper editor Charles Brunsdon Fletcher
   (1859-1946) in relation to Asia and the Pacific. It examines three books
   and lead newspaper editorials published during Fletcher's time as editor
   of the Brisbane Courier (1898-1903) and the Sydney Morning Herald
   (1918-37). Fletcher argued that geographic proximity necessitated closer
   ties between Australia and her neighbours, while the White Australia
   policy had restricted Australia's potential for economic and population
   growth particularly in the tropical north. Such views placed Fletcher
   among a small but articulate movement of the period, which encouraged
   greater understanding of Australia's regional neighbours. In identifying
   such sentiment in newspaper editorials, this research reveals greater
   diversity in opinion in Australian journalism on migration and race than
   was previously known.}},

Title = {{Comparing future patterns of energy system change in 2 degrees C

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{436-449}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper systematically compares modeled rates of change provided by
   global integrated assessment models aiming for the 2 degrees C objective
   to historically observed rates of change. Such a comparison can provide
   insights into the difficulty of achieving such stringent climate
   stabilization scenarios. The analysis focuses specifically on the rates
   of change for technology expansion and diffusion, emissions and energy
   supply investments. The associated indicators vary in terms of system
   focus (technology-specific or energy system wide), temporal scale
   (timescale or lifetime), spatial scale (regional or global) and
   normalization (accounting for entire system growth or not). Although
   none of the indicators provide conclusive insights as to the
   achievability of scenarios, this study finds that indicators that look
   into absolute change remain within the range of historical growth
   frontiers for the next decade, but increase to unprecedented levels
   before mid-century. Indicators that take into account or normalize for
   overall system growth find future change to be broadly within historical
   ranges. This is particularly the case for monetary-based normalization
   metrics like GDP compared to energy-based normalization metrics like
   primary energy. By applying a diverse set of indicators alternative,
   complementary insights into how scenarios compare with historical
   observations are acquired but they do not provide further insights on
   the possibility of achieving rates of change that are beyond current day
   practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In anteroposterior (AP)-gliding mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty
   (TKA), the femoral component can theoretically slide forward resulting
   in a more anterior contact point, causing pain due to impingement. A
   lower lever arm of the extensor apparatus can also attribute to higher
   patella pressures and pain. The goal of this study was to determine the
   contact point in a cohort of mobile- and fixed-bearing TKAs, to
   determine whether the contact point lies more anteriorly in
   mobile-bearing TKA and to confirm whether this results in anterior knee
   pain.
   We used 38 fixed-bearing TKA and 40 mobile-bearing TKA from a randomized
   trial with straight lateral knee X-rays and measured the contact point.
   The functional outcome was measured by Knee Society Score at 12 months
   postoperatively. Pain scores were analysed using a VAS score (0-100 mm)
   in all patients at rest and when moving. Difficulty at rising up out of
   a chair was also assessed using a VAS score.
   The contact point in mobile-bearing TKA was situated at 59.5 \% of the
   AP distance of the tibia and in the fixed-bearing TKA group at 66.1 \%
   (P < 0.05). Patients with mobile- and fixed-bearing TKAs had similar
   knee scores, pain scores and difficulty in chair rise. No significant
   correlation was found between contact point and knee pain.
   The hypothesis of a more anterior contact point in the mobile-bearing
   cohort was confirmed but no correlation with functional and pain scores
   in this cohort could be found. The tibiofemoral contact point could not
   be correlated with a different clinical outcome and higher incidence of
   anterior knee pain. This study further adds to the knowledge on possible
   differences between mobile- and fixed-bearing prostheses. Next to that,
   bad outcomes could not be explained by CP.

Abstract = {{Objective To measure tidal volume, plethysmography changes and gas
   exchange during respiratory support at birth.
   Design The following parameters were measured: (1) expired tidal volumes
   (Vte (mL/kg)) using respiratory function monitoring, (2) changes in
   plethysmography (AU/kg) per breath using respiratory inductance
   plethysmography (bands placed around rib cage (RC) and abdomen (AB)) and
   (3) expired CO2 (ECO2) levels using a volumetric CO2 monitor. For
   respiratory support, a T-piece resuscitator and facemask were used with
   peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 25 cm H2O and positive end expiratory
   pressure 5 cm H2O. Data were analysed during the sustained inflation
   (SI), positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and breathing on continuous
   positive airway pressure (CPAP).
   Setting The delivery rooms of the Leiden University Medical Center,
   Leiden, and V. Buzzi, Milan. Patients: 15 preterm infants with a
   gestational age 28 (27-31) weeks and a birth weight of 1080 (994-1300)
   g.
   Results Vte for PPV inflations, PPV inflations with breathing and
   spontaneous breathing were significantly different (4.4 (2.5-8.6) vs 8.8
   (5.7-11.4) vs 5.7 (3.3-9.8); p<0.0001)). Spontaneous breathing led to
   the highest ECO2 levels and during PPV, ECO2 levels were higher when the
   inflations coincided with breathing (32 (23-38) vs 20 (13-25) vs 2
   (3-11) mm Hg; p<0.0001). Little change in plethysmography amplitude
   occurred during the SI, PPV and breathing at the RC. There was gain in
   plethysmography amplitude at the AB during the SI, PPV, but most with
   breathing.
   Conclusions While Vte during breathing on CPAP was lower compared with
   PPV coinciding with breathing, breathing on CPAP was most effective in
   gas exchange and plethysmography amplitude gain compared with PPV and
   PPV coinciding with breathing.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates factors that influence opinion in the
   decision to fly on fully autonomous passenger airliners primarily from
   the perspective of aviation and technology professionals. Bayesian
   statistical inference and a two-level fractional factorial survey are
   used to sample passengers' views on fully autonomous airliners. Eight
   trust, safety, and cost factors are incorporated into a vignette set in
   the future. Factors include automation levels, safety records, liability
   guarantees, airline integrity, and service disruptions. Dependent
   variables exist in five post-vignette questions and essentially ask
   Would you or Would you not be willing to fly on a fully autonomous
   airliner? Sixteen versions of the vignette, each with unique trust,
   safety, and cost levels, present varying (unknown) degrees of influence
   to the survey respondents. For every demographic, the research shows a
   99\% statistically significant difference between the prior and
   posterior sampled population proportions willing to fly. The most
   significant positive influence involves integrity characteristics of the
   airline, while the most negative influence relates to life insurance
   liability guarantees. Research from 2003 suggested that this mode of
   travel would be acceptable to only 10.5\% of respondents. When the 2003
   research is used as a Bayesian prior probability, the resulting
   posterior probability for the demographics sampled can be modeled as a
   beta distribution, indicating 95\% probability that the sampled
   proportion of the population willing to fly is between 33.2\% and
   36.4\%. After adjusting for age and profession demographics to match the
   US population, the 95\% probability bounds on the proportion willing to
   fly are 31.35\% and 34.15\%. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are important CF clinical
   events.
   Methods: We studied time to next PEx following intravenous (IV)
   antibiotic PEx treatment among Cleveland Ohio CF center patients
   occurring between January 2010 and September 2014. Patient demographics,
   clinical presentations, and treatments were modeled by Cox proportional
   hazards regression to identify covariates associated with time to next
   PEx.
   Results: 193 patients were treated for PEx; 155 had a subsequent
   IV-treated PEx. Six covariates were associated with future PEx hazard:
   number of PEx in the prior year (hazard ratio 25.1 for >= 3 and 4.4 for
   1-2 prior-year PEx versus none; P < .0001), IV treatment duration in
   weeks (1.2; P = .0004), percent hospital treatment (1.1; P = .0018), and
   chronic inhaled aminoglycosides (2.5; P < .0001), leukotriene modifiers
   (1.8; P = .0031), and high dose ibuprofen (0.52; P = .0006).
   Conclusions: Time to next PEx was profoundly associated with prior-year
   PEx, suggestive of high-risk PEx phenotypes that warrant recognition and
   further study. (C) 2015 European Cystic Fibrosis Society. Published by

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the amount of tooth
   colour change, rebound rate and tooth sensitivity in patients submitted
   to a bleaching technique with 6\% hydrogen peroxide (HP) with or without
   2\% nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA).
   MethodsSixty subjects were included in this examiner-blinded, randomized
   clinical trial using a 6\% HP gel with or without 2\% n-HA. Tooth colour
   and tooth sensitivity were analysed before and after treatment. All data
   were analysed statistically.
   ResultsAfter bleaching, both treatments demonstrated significant
   improvements in tooth shade (P<0.05 for both groups). At the 9-month
   recall, tooth shade remained significantly lighter than at baseline
   (P<0.05 for both groups). However, a relapse of the tooth shade was
   observed compared with the immediate post-bleaching result (P<0.05). 6\%
   HP with 2\% n-HA produced significantly lower sensitivity (P<0.05) than
   the bleaching product without n-HA. Colour change evaluation resulted in
   no difference between the two groups.
   ConclusionBoth treatments demonstrated significant improvements in tooth
   shade. The bleaching effectiveness of the tested products was
   comparable. The use of 6\% HP with 2\% n-HA reduced the incidence of
   sensitivity during the bleaching treatment compared to a bleaching agent
   that did not contain n-HA.}},

Abstract = {{Istanbul is located in the northwest part of Turkey and has the greatest
   population of any city in the country. Istanbul and its surroundings
   were researched for wind potential. Energy production from wind was
   evaluated technically and economically in this study. Corlu, Kumkoy and
   Sile sites were examined. Other sites in the same region (Goztepe,
   Kirecburnu, Bahcekoy, Florya and Kartal) were also evaluated but the
   results were not satisfactory, and for this reason, these sites were not
   examined in this study. When we checked daily, monthly and yearly wind
   speed values and frequency distributions, the wind energy potential of
   Corlu, Kumkoy and Sile were greater than other sites. Corlu, Kumkoy and
   especially Sile's wind speed data are statistically decreasing. A Nordex
   N117 91m hub height wind turbine can produce 6099 MWh in Corlu, 6459 MWh
   in Sile, 7265 MWh in Kumkoy. A Nordex N117 91m hub height wind turbine
   can produce 6471 MWh in Corlu, 7439 MWh in Sile and 8175 MWh in Kumkoy.
   The energy costs were calculated by the average of 36 years of wind
   measurement data using Nordex N117 turbines. Energy costs with Nordex
   N117 91 m and 140 m hub height in Corlu, Sile and Kumkoy are 0.025-
   0,027 US\$/ KWh, 0.022- 0,025 US\$/ KWh, 0.020- 0,023 US\$/ KWh,

Abstract = {{`Function' and `use' are keywords that design researchers customarily
   employ when referring to human-artifact engagements. However, there is
   little consensus about how the concepts of function and use relate to
   each other, to the intentions of `designers' and `users', or to their
   actions and encompassing contexts. In this paper, I synthesize
   literature from design research, material culture studies, design
   anthropology, and function theory in order to critically compare
   different attitudes to human-artifact engagements, implicit in
   characterizations of function and use. I identify design-centric,
   communicative, and use-centric attitudes, and discuss their assumptions
   and implications for design theory. I conclude by outlining principles
   for theoretically and computationally approaching use as an embodied and
   temporally contingent process as a form of making'. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A variety of protein expression tags with different biochemical
   properties has been used to enhance the yield and solubility of
   recombinant proteins. Ubiquitin, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)
   and prokaryotic ubiquitin like MoaD (molybdopterin synthase, small
   subunit) fusion tags are getting more popular because of their small
   size. In this paper we report on the use of ubiquitin-like small
   archaeal modifier proteins (SAMPs) as fusion tags since they proved to
   increase expression yield, stability and solubility in our experiments.
   Equally important, they did not co-purify with proteins of the
   expression host and there was information that their specific
   JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) protease can recognize the
   C-terminal VSGG sequence when SAMPs fused, either branched or linearly
   to target proteins, and cleave it specifically. SAMPs and JAMM proteases
   from Haloferax volcanii, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Methanococcoides
   burtonii and Nitrosopumilus maritimus were selected, cloned, expressed
   heterologously in Escherichia coli and tested as fusion tags and
   cleaving proteases, respectively. Investigated SAMPs enhanced protein
   expression and solubility on a wide scale. T. acidophilum SAMPs Ta0895
   and Ta01019 were the best performing tags and their effect was
   comparable to the widely used maltose binding protein (MBP) and N
   utilization substance protein A (NusA) tags. Moreover, H. volcanii SAMP
   Hvo\_2619 contribution was mediocre, whereas M. burtonii Mbur\_1415
   could not be expressed. Out of four investigated JAMM proteases, only
   Hvo\_2505 could cleave fusion tags. Interestingly, it was found active
   not only on its own partner substrate Hvo\_2619, but it also cleaved off
   Ta0895. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   In-depth interviews were carried out and open coding strategy was used
   as method of analysis. Results show a tendency of mothers to establish
   insecure attachment relations, difficulties of tuning and expression of
   affection, and a predominance of a permissive parenting style around
   food. This has important implications for prevention and treatment of
   obesity, focusing on the attachment bond between mother and child.}},

   rectified signal averaging.
   Results: Positive predictive values of 86.6\% and 77.5\% and
   sensitivities of 100\% and 90\% were achieved for focal and generalized
   seizures respectively.
   Conclusion: Results for focal seizures are in accordance with the
   literature, and detection of generalized seizures is improved after
   including respiratory information.
   Significance: These findings could improve monitoring systems in
   epilepsy, and closed-loop techniques that aim to stop seizures. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{1-13}},

Abstract = {{An important part in the numerical simulation of tsunami and storm surge
   events is the accurate modeling of flooding and the appearance of dry
   areas when the water recedes. This paper proposes a new algorithm to
   model inundation events with piecewise linear Runge-Kutta discontinuous
   Galerkin approximations applied to the shallow water equations. This
   study is restricted to the one-dimensional case and shows a detailed
   analysis and the corresponding numerical treatment of the inundation
   problem.
   The main feature is a velocity based ``limiting{''} of the momentum
   distribution in each cell, which prevents instabilities in case of
   wetting or drying situations. Additional limiting of the fluid depth
   ensures its positivity while preserving local mass conservation. A
   special flux modification in cells located at the wet/dry interface
   leads to a well-balanced method, which maintains the steady state at
   rest. The discontinuous Galerkin scheme is formulated in a nodal form
   using a Lagrange basis. The proposed wetting and drying treatment is
   verified with several numerical simulations. These test cases
   demonstrate the well-balancing property of the method and its stability
   in case of rapid transition of the wet/dry interface. We also verify the
   conservation of mass and investigate the convergence characteristics of
   the scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
   promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival, transduces
   pro-angiogenic signals and regulates immune cell differentiation and
   function. We hypothesized that temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, would
   curtail experimental mesothelioma progression in vivo by limiting tumour
   cell growth, abrogating tumour angiogenesis and modulating
   immune/inflammatory tumour milieu.
   Methods: We produced flank and pleural syngeneic murine mesotheliomas by
   delivering AE17 and AB1 murine mesothelioma cells into the right flank
   or the pleural space of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, respectively. Animals
   were given five times/week intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg
   temsirolimus or vehicle and were sacrificed on day 26 (flank) or on day
   15 (pleural) post-tumour cell propagation.
   Results: Temsirolimus limited mesothelioma growth in vivo by stimulating
   tumour cell apoptosis, inhibiting tumour angiogenesis, enhancing tumour
   lymphocyte abundance and blocking pro-tumour myeloid cell recruitment.
   Pleural fluid accumulation was significantly mitigated in AE17 but not
   in AB1 mesotheliomas. In vitro, temsirolimus hindered mesothelioma cell
   growth, NF-kappaB activation and macrophage migration.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, temsirolimus apart from inducing tumour cell
   apoptosis, targets tumour angiogenesis and influences inflammatory
   tumour microenvironment to halt experimental mesothelioma growth in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Penile dysmorphic disorder (PDD) is shorthand for men diagnosed with
   body dysmorphic disorder, in whom the size or shape of the penis is
   their main, if not their exclusive, preoccupation causing significant
   shame or handicap. There are no specific measures for identifying men
   with PDD compared to men who are anxious about the size of their penis
   but do not have PDD. Such a measure might be helpful for treatment
   planning, reducing unrealistic expectations, and measuring outcome after
   any psychological or physical intervention. Our aim was, therefore, to
   validate a specific measure, termed the Cosmetic Procedure Screening
   Scale for PDD (COPS-P). Eighty-one male participants were divided into
   three groups: a PDD group (n = 21), a small penis anxiety group (n =
   37), and a control group (n = 23). All participants completed the COPS-P
   as well as standardized measures of depression, anxiety, social phobia,
   body image, quality of life, and erectile function. Penis size was also
   measured. The final COPS-P was based on nine items. The scale had good
   internal reliability and significant convergent validity with measures
   of related constructs. It discriminated between the PDD group, the small
   penis anxiety group, and the control group. This is the first study to
   develop a scale able to discriminate between those with PDD and men
   anxious about their size who did not have PDD. Clinicians and
   researchers may use the scale as part of an assessment for men
   presenting with anxiety about penis size and as an audit or outcome
   measure after any intervention for this population.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the research of the optical device for
   two-dimensional straightness measurement of technological machines.
   Mathematical study of an optical device, operating on the phase
   principle and measuring transversal displacements of machine parts in
   two directions (X and Y) during their linear longitudinal motion in a
   machine (alongside the Z axis), is presented. How to estimate the range
   of travel along the Z axis is analytically shown. At this range, the
   measurer gives correct measurements of transverse displacement. The
   necessary distance from the objective focus to the image plane was
   defined mathematically. The sample results of measuring the displacement
   of the table of a technological machine by using the optical device are
   presented in the paper. This optical device for non-contact straightness
   measurement can be used for measurement straightness in turning,
   milling, drilling, grinding machines and other technological machines,
   also in geodesy and cartography, and for moving accuracy testing of
   mechatronic devices, robotics and others.}},

   activities}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{189-196}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While the mining industry is steadfastly committed to the goal of
   increasing extraction of minerals, the failure to recognize the
   existence of biophysical constraints to extraction results in massive
   degradation to socio-ecological systems. In this paper, we propose an
   innovative approach for analyzing mineral extraction which links the use
   and management of natural resources by means of the
   Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model developed by Georgescu-Roegen. Mining is a
   productive process that not only depletes minerals ores but also affects
   other natural resources that are needed to maintain life-supporting
   processes over time. The central claim is the need of recognizing the
   existence of biophysical limits to extraction in order to manage natural
   resources as irreplaceable providers of ecosystem services. By providing
   a new conceptualization for operationalizing the ecosystem services
   approach based on the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model, we intend to
   challenge the current extractivist narrative that assumes unregulated
   practices, monetary indicators, technological advancements and
   substitutable resources. We argue that limits to mining activities
   should depend on a biophysical evaluation of the effects of these
   activities on the environment. Furthermore, social deliberation is
   required to determine whether extraction should occur and to what extent
   it is socially acceptable while still maintaining the integrity of
   socio-ecological systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{RNA polymerase III (Pol III) synthesizes small RNA molecules that are
   essential for cell viability. Accurate initiation of transcription by
   Pol III requires general transcription factor TFIIIB, which is composed
   of three subunits: TFIIB-related factor BRF1, TATA-binding protein and
   BDP1. Here we report the molecular characterization of BRF1 in
   Trypanosoma brucei (TbBRF1), a parasitic protozoa that shows distinctive
   transcription characteristics. In silico analysis allowed the detection
   in TbBRF1 of the three conserved domains located in the N-terminal
   region of all BRF1 orthologues, namely a zinc ribbon motif and two
   cyclin repeats. Homology modelling suggested that, similarly to other
   BRF1 and TFIIB proteins, the TbBRF1 cyclin repeats show the
   characteristic structure of five alpha-helices per repeat, connected by
   a short random-coiled linker. As expected for a transcription factor,
   TbBRF1 was localized in the nucleus. Knock-down of TbBRF1 by RNA
   interference (RNAi) showed that this protein is essential for the
   viability of procyclic forms of T. brucei, since ablation of TbBRF1 led
   to growth arrest of the parasites. Nuclear run-on and quantitative
   real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that transcription of all the Pol
   III-dependent genes analysed was reduced, at different levels, after
   RNAi induction.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the relationship between laboratory, functional,
   disease activity markers and bone mineral density (BMD) loss in patients
   with spondyloarthropathies (SpAs).
   Methods: A cohort of 41 SpA patients were followed up for 4 years.
   Disease activity indices, spinal mobility and laboratory tests, BMD
   using were monitored at the baseline and 4- year follow- up. The 4\% BMD
   loss at either of the proximal femurs was defined as significant.
   Results: Over the 4- year study period, 27\% of SpA patients experienced
   femoral BMD loss. Baseline BMD > 0.85 g/cm(2) (p = 0.011) was the
   baseline factor associated with BMD loss at 4-year follow- up. Several
   clinical and functional tests were helpful in identifying the BMD loss
   at follow- up: CRP > 15.6 mg/L (sens. 91\%, spec. 70\%), ESR > 29 mm/h
   (sens. 82\%, spec. 73\%), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity
   Index (BASDAI) > 4.75 (sens. 91\%, spec. 62\%). At follow- up anti-TNF
   alpha treatment history, stable or improved lateral flexion and
   intermalleolar distance (NPV, accordingly, 95\%, 88\% and 87\%), made
   BMD loss unlikely. Deterioration of the physician assessment of global
   disease activity (PAGDA) score from baseline to follow- up was a
   remarkable predictor of BMD loss (PPV = 0.83), while stable or improved
   score excluded the BMD loss (NPV = 0.83). According to multiple logistic
   regression analysis, baseline BMD value and follow- up CRP levels, when
   considered together, identify BMD status correctly in 85\% of SpA
   patients (Nagelkerke R-2 = 0.676).
   Conclusion: Baseline BMD, anti-TNF alpha treatment, PAGDA score, spinal
   mobility tests and disease activity markers are useful factors in
   predicting the BMD loss in SpA patients and can provide surrogate
   information on BMD status. (C) 2015 Lithuanian University of Health

Abstract = {{Outcomes from patients suffering hip fracture remain poor, with 9\%
   mortality at 30 days and 35\% at 1 year. Despite robust guidelines these
   mortality rates have undergone little change. Admission serum lactate in
   patients with sepsis or suffering general trauma has been shown to be an
   indicator of adverse clinical outcomes. We investigated whether venous
   lactate can predict mortality for hip fracture patients.
   Over a 12-month period the admission venous lactate of all patients
   presenting to our institution with hip fractures was prospectively
   collated. Demographic and patient survivorship data were also
   prospectively recorded. Multivariate binary logistic regression and Cox
   proportional hazards ratio analysis was used to evaluate the
   relationship between admission venous lactate and 30-day mortality and
   early survivorship, whilst adjusting for age and gender.
   770 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 80 years. The
   overall 30-day mortality for this cohort was 9.5\%. Admission venous
   lactate was associated with early death. A 1 mmol/L increase in venous
   lactate resulted in a 1.9 (95\% CI 1.5-2.3 p < 0.0001) fold increase in
   the odds of 30-day mortality and a 1.4 (95\% CI: 1.2-1.6 p < 0.0001)
   factor increase in the risk of death at any time after hip fracture.
   Admission venous lactate remained a predictor of mortality despite
   adjustment for patients American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
   grade. Those with an admission serum lactate of 3 mmol/L or greater were
   particularly at risk. This cohort had a 30-day mortality odds that was
   5-fold higher than those whose level was less than 3 mmol/L (p < 0.0001)
   and at any-time risk of death that was 1.9 times higher (p < 0.0001).
   Those with a level of less than 3 mmol/L had a 30-day mortality of
   6.8\%. For those with an admission venous lactate of 3 mmol/L or greater
   this was four times higher at 28\%. The difference was statistically
   significant (p < 0.0001).
   Elevated admission venous lactate following hip fracture is a predictor
   of early death. Venous lactate may be useful as a prognostic indicator
   or risk stratifier in patients with proximal femoral fractures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{To date, methods used to disambiguate inventors in the United States
   Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database have been rule- and
   threshold-based (requiring and leveraging expert knowledge) or
   semi-supervised algorithms trained on statistically generated artificial
   labels. Using a large, hand-disambiguated set of 98,762 labeled USPTO
   inventor records from the field of optoelectronics consisting of four
   sub-samples of inventors with varying characteristics (Akinsanmi et al.,
   2014) and a second large, hand-disambiguated set of 53,378 labeled
   inventor records corresponding to a subset of academics in the life
   sciences (Azoulay et al., 2012), we provide the first supervised
   learning approach for USPTO inventor disambiguation. Using these two
   sets of inventor records, we also provide extensive evaluations of both
   our algorithm and three examples of prior approaches to USPTO
   disambiguation arguably representative of the range of approaches used
   to-date. We show that the three past disambiguation algorithms we
   evaluate demonstrate biases depending on the feature distribution of the
   target disambiguation population. Both the rule- and threshold-based
   methods and the semi-supervised approach perform poorly (10-22\% false
   negative error rates) on a random sample of optoelectronics inventors -
   arguably the closest of our sub-samples to what might be expected of the
   majority of inventors in the USPTO (based on disambiguation-relevant
   metrics). The supervised learning approach, using random forests and
   trained on our labeled optoelectronics dataset, consistently maintains
   error rates below 3\% across all of our available samples. We make
   public both our labeled optoelectronics inventor records and our code to
   build supervised learning models and disambiguate inventors (see
   http://www.cmu.edu/epp/disambiguation). Our code also allows users to
   implement supervised learning approaches with their own representative

   film, the director explored different aspects: the `destape', the `S'
   rated and `X' rated films. The difficulties of making films of this type
   prompted Jesus Franco to leave Spain to shoot `Necronomicon' (1967). He
   reached the fullness of his creation through softcore films interpreted
   by his muse Soledad Miranda. The strength of the director's voyeurism
   converted these hardcore movies into female hardcores with or without
   the actress and in the subsequent years. The evolution of the law will
   bring about a double phenomenon: the double versions and the `soft to
   hard' films, i.e. movies which had already been shot and to which
   pornographic elements were added. Such manipulations which Jesus Franco
   accepted or even assumed responsibility of are not only circumstantial
   insofar as the whole cinematographic work of the director is a form of
   constant manipulation. With the pornographic film, the director
   completed his career though the total `visibility' of his films does not
   really correspond to voyeurism and it is no wonder that that the `X'
   films which were shot in Spain were his partner and actress Linda
   Romay's making. Even if the evolution of Spain during the transition
   didn't equate that of the director's creation, it remains that the
   former, having to adapt laws to the cinema, contributed to alter Jesus
   Franco's trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (c-MWCNT)
   reinforced poly(m-aminophenol (PmAP) nanocomposite film was fabricated
   by in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of m-aminophenol in
   presence of c-MWCNTs, and exploited it as an effective sensor material
   for detection of aliphatic alcohols. The presence site-selective
   interaction between the conjugated PmAP chain and the pi-bonded surface
   of c-MWCNT was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman
   spectroscopy. The morphological analysis of the nanocomposite showed the
   formation of PmAP coating (thickness similar to 100 nm) on the CNT
   surfaces. The X-ray and electron diffraction patterns of the
   nanocomposites indicated the crystalline nature of the PmAP matrix. The
   nanocomposite with small quantity of c-MWCNT (2 wt\%) was found to have
   sensing response about 114\% and 96\% higher than that of pure PmAP for
   methanol and ethanol vapor (90 ppm). This dramatic improvement of
   sensing performance might be attributed to the favorable interactions of
   c-MWCNTs with conjugated PmAP chains that subsequently generate a
   pathway for possible H-bonding/dipole interaction with the alcohol
   molecules. The nanocomposite sensor also exhibits distinct features of
   the response curves and responsivity values for different aliphatic
   alcohols, which could be used as a basis for the selective detection of
   these pollutant vapors. The UV-vis and FT-IR analyses were used to
   explain the sensing mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermal runaway was studied in a continuous tubular pilot reactor under
   steady-state regime. Different accident scenarii were conducted by
   making some errors on reactant concentrations and/or temperature feed.
   To prevent thermal runaway, control by direct contact by solvent

   allowed controlling the maximum reaction temperature. A simplified
   analytical method to estimate the maximum reaction temperature along the
   reactor was used.
   Benefit of this control method was the diminution of computational time.
   Furthermore, by injecting solvent to control maximum reaction
   temperature, there is no need to shut down the unit. The control method

Abstract = {{In an ever more artificially illuminated world, common moth behaviour,
   flight-to-light, causes declines in their abundance and diversity that
   can have severe impacts on ecosystems. To test if it is possible to
   reduce the number of moths attracted to artificially illuminated
   objects, the original lighting of 15 cultural heritage buildings in
   Slovenia was substituted with blue or yellow lighting. These three
   illumination types differed in the amount of luminance, percentage of UV
   and short-wavelength light which are known to affect flight-to-light of
   moths. During our three-year field study approximately 20\% of all known
   moth species in Slovenia were recorded. The blue and yellow illumination
   type attracted up to six times less specimens and up to four times less
   species compared to the original illumination type. This was true for
   all detected moths as well as within separate moth groups. This gives
   our study a high conservation value: usage of alternative,
   environmentally more acceptable illumination can greatly reduce the
   number of moths attracted to artificially illuminated objects. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objectives Recently, we reported a high prevalence (16\%) of urogenital
   Chlamydia trachomatis infections among women in a rural setting in South
   Africa. Molecular epidemiological studies on C. trachomatis infections
   could provide insights into the characteristics of this epidemic, yet
   such data are not available. The objective of this study was therefore
   to assess the distribution of C. trachomatis strains among women from a
   South African rural community, the Mopani district, and to compare it
   with strains from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Methods High-resolution multilocus sequence typing (hr-MLST) was used to
   study urogenital C. trachomatis infections in women visiting primary
   healthcare facilities across rural Mopani District in Limpopo Province,
   South Africa. Sequence types (STs) were compared with 100 strains from
   women visiting the sexually transmitted infection clinic in Amsterdam,
   the Netherlands.
   Results Full hr-MLST data were obtained for C. trachomatis infection in
   43 women from Mopani district. Using the complete hr-MLST profile of all
   43 women from Mopani district, 26 STs could be identified, of which 18
   (69\%) were novel to the hr-MLST database. The remaining STs clustered
   together with strains from Amsterdam.
   Conclusions Hr-MLST data revealed a diverse molecular epidemiology with
   novel STs and a specific cluster for the Mopani district. Also C.
   trachomatis types that occur worldwide were detected.}},

Title = {{Glass forming ability and crystallisation behaviour of sub-alkaline
   silicate melts}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{25-44}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic solidification behaviour and glass forming ability (GFA)
   of natural sub-alkaline silicate melts have been experimentally
   quantified via cooling-induced solidification approach. GFA is measured
   by the critical cooling rate Rc, the rate at which a melt solidifies <=
   2 area\% of crystals. Cooling rates of 9000, 1800, 180, 60,7 and 1
   degrees C/h have been run between 1300 degrees C (super-liquidus region)
   and 800 degrees C (quenching temperature), at air fO(2) and ambient P
   for six silicate melts with compositions ranging from basalt (B) to
   rhyolite (R) (i.e., B-100, B80R20, B60R40, B40R60, B20R80 and R-100) and
   water contents comprised between 53 (B-100) and 384 (B20R80) ppm. The
   ranges of cooling rates and chemical compositions used in this study are
   the broadest ever investigated in the Earth sciences.
   The phase proportions (area\%) were determined by image analysis on
   about 500 back-scattered electron images collected over different
   magnifications. Phases are glass, clinopyroxene (cpx), spinel (sp) and
   plagioclase (pig). Sp is ubiquitous with abundance of few area\% and
   nucleates earlier than silicate crystals. Cpx solidifies in all runs
   except in R-100 and its abundance follows asymmetric broad Gaussian-like
   trends (with tails towards low rates) as a function of cooling rate.
   Moving from B-100 to B40R60 these trends conserve their shape but shift
   progressively to lower cooling rates and mineral abundances. Pig
   crystallises only at low cooling rates and in SiO2-poor compositions.
   Run-products with low amounts of crystals (<= 5 area\%) clearly show
   that cpx preferentially nucleates on surfaces of sp, whereas a
   significant crystallisation of cpx (>5 area\%) is observed with
   decreasing cooling rate and with changing composition from B100 to
   B20R80. The crystallisation of silicate crystals is related to the
   chemical diffusivity of components in the melt. Also the initial
   crystallisation of pig occurs preferentially on cpx. In general, the
   amount of crystals decreases as the cooling rate increases; however, in
   some cases, the amount of crystals remains constant or even decreases
   for B80R20 with decreasing cooling rate. Rc values change over 5 orders
   of magnitude being <1, 7, 620, 3020, 8020 and 9000 degrees C/h for
   R-100, B20R80, B40R60, B60R40 and B80R20 and 13100, respectively. The
   variation of Rc can be modelled through NBO/T (nonbridging oxygen per
   tetrahedron) parameter by the following equation:
   Rc = a/\{1 + e(-{[}(NBO/T - b)/c])\} where a, band care fitting
   parameters equal to 9214, 0.297 and 0.040, respectively. Similarly to
   other glass-forming liquids (network, metallic and molecular systems),
   Rc for natural sub-alkaline silicate melts is inversely related to the
   reduced glass transition parameter Trg (Trg = Tg / Tm) and can be
   quantified with the equation Re = a x Trg(-b), where a and b are 1.19 x
   10(-4) and 28.7, respectively.
   These results may be used to retrieve the solidification conditions of
   aphyric, degassed and oxidised lavas; in addition, our data provide
   general constrains on the crystallisation kinetics of natural
   crystal-bearing silicate melts erupted on Earth (e.g. lavas with
   phenocrysts). The relationship between crystal content and cooling rate
   suggests that the solidification path induced by degassing can be also
   complex and nonlinear. The growth of crystals with size up to 1 mm from
   a nearly anhydrous superheated silicate melt indicates that variable
   cooling conditions of lavas have to be accounted to discriminate among
   minerals formed before, during and after eruptions. Moreover, our
   results can be used to design glass-ceramics from naturally available
   easy to find, low-cost starting materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The use of biodegradable nanoparticles as antigen delivery vehicles is
   an attractive approach to overcome the problems associated with the use
   of Alum-based classical adjuvants. Herein we report, the design and
   development of protamine-based nanoparticles as novel antigen delivery
   systems, using recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen as a model viral
   antigen.
   The nanoparticles, composed of protamine and a polysaccharide
   (hyaluronic acid or alginate), were obtained using a mild ionic
   cross-linking technique. The size and surface charge of the
   nanoparticles could be modulated by adjusting the ratio of the
   components. Prototypes with optimal physicochemical characteristics and
   satisfactory colloidal stability were selected for the assessment of
   their antigen loading capacity, antigen stability during storage and in
   vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept studies. In vitro studies showed that
   antigen-loaded nanoparticles induced the secretion of cytokines by
   macrophages more efficiently than the antigen in solution, thus
   indicating a potential adjuvant effect of the nanoparticles. Finally, in
   vivo studies showed the capacity of these systems to trigger efficient
   immune responses against the hepatitis B antigen following intramuscular
   administration, suggesting the potential interest of
   protamine-polysaccharide nanoparticles as antigen delivery systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite a lack of randomized trials comparing breast-conserving therapy
   (BCT) and mastectomy, BCT represents a standard of care in the
   management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Traditionally, BCT has
   consisted of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant
   radiotherapy (RT), with multiple randomized trials demonstrating an
   approximately 50\% reduction in rates of local recurrence with adjuvant
   RT. However, over the past 2 decades, several trials have been performed
   to identify a low-risk cohort of patients for whom BCS alone would
   provide an acceptably low risk of local recurrence. Currently, patients
   who can forgo adjuvant RT without significantly increasing their chance
   of local recurrence have not been consistently identified. While future
   studies will look at tumor genetics to help identify low-risk cohorts,
   modern RT also allows for shortened courses of treatment to reduce the
   duration of adjuvant RT.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC sequestration
   potentials were investigated in the soils of Republic of Serbia. Organic
   carbon stocks were estimated for soil layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm based
   on the results from a database and using soil and land use maps. The
   database included a total of 1,140 soil profiles which corresponded to
   4335 soil horizons. To establish the relationship between organic carbon
   content and soil type, a soil map of Serbia was adapted to the WRB
   classification and divided into 15,437 polygons (map units). We
   calculated the SOC stock values for each reference soil group based on
   mean values of SOC at 0-30 and 0-100 cm and their areas. The largest SOC
   stocks for the soil layers 0-30 cm were found in Cambisol 194.76 x
   10(12) g and Leptosol 186.43 x 10(12) g, and for the soil layers 0-100
   cm in Cambisol 274.87 x 10(12) g and Chermozem 230.43 x 10(12) g. Based
   on the size of the reference groups, total area of Republic of Serbia,
   and the mean SOC values for each reference group, we calculated the
   total SOC stocks. The obtained values for the soil layers 0-30 cm and
   0-100 cm amounted to 695.31 x 10(12) g and 1142.42 x 10(12) g,
   respectively. The analysis of SOC stocks according to land use showed
   that SOC stocks were higher in forestland and semi-natural areas than in
   agricultural soil by 40.71\% and 11.43\% at 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm,

Abstract = {{Aim: In this study, the effects of postnatal overfeeding on heart energy
   homoeostasis and cardiac haemodynamics in adult male Swiss mice were
   examined.
   Methods and Results: During the suckling period, the mice were divided
   into four groups of control or overfed pups in combination with baseline
   or ischaemia/reperfusion treatments (control group baseline, CGBL;
   overfed group baseline, OGBL; control group ischaemia/reperfusion, CGIR;
   and overfed group ischaemia/reperfusion, OGIR). End diastolic pressure
   (EDP), heart contraction speed (Max dP/dt), relaxation speed (Min
   dP/dt), isovolumetric relaxation time (Tau) and frequency by beats per
   minute (BPM) were measured. During baseline and ischaemia/reperfusion,
   key proteins such as AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, pAKT, adenosine
   monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), pAMPK, insulin receptor
   beta (IRb), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), insulin receptor
   substrate 1 (IRS1), fatty acid binding protein (FABP), CD36,
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1 alpha) were studied. The
   expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic
   peptide (BNP), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and uncoupling
   protein 3 (UCP3) was studied as a marker of cardiac hypertrophy and
   energetic metabolism. Cardiac fibrosis was analyzed by quantifying
   collagen deposition, which is increased in the OGBL and OGIR groups
   compared with the control groups.
   Conclusions: The OGBL group showed reduced EDP compared with the CGBL
   group and high Max dP/dt compared with the OGBL group.
   Ischaemia/reperfusion increased EDP and Min dP/dt in the intragroup
   comparison. By contrast, Tau and frequency were not significantly
   different among groups. The OGIR mice showed significant alterations in
   heart metabolism proteins, including AKT2, pAKT/AKT1, pAKT/AKT2, AMPK,
   pAMPK/AMPK, PTP1B, IRS1, FABP and CD36. Furthermore, alterations in ANP,
   BNP, CPT1 and UCP3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression indicated hypertrophy
   and reduction in their efficiency, such that exclusive overnutrition in
   childhood induces a long-term effect on haemodynamics, metabolism and
   heart remodelling. (C) 2015 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the

Abstract = {{Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a malignant hematopoietic neoplasia,
   which is rare in adults. Although ocular fundus alterations may be
   commonly observed in the course of the disease, such alterations are

   a patient with painless and progressive loss of visual acuity (right
   eye, 2/10; left eye, 3/10) developing over two weeks, accompanied by
   fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Fundus examination showed bilateral
   macular serous detachment, which was confirmed by optical coherence
   tomography. Fluorescein angiography revealed hyperfluorescent pinpoints
   in the posterior poles. The limits of the macular detachment were
   revealed in the late phase of the angiogram. The results of blood count
   analysis triggered a thorough, systematic patient examination. The
   diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia B (CD10+) was established, and
   intensive systemic chemotherapy was immediately initiated. One year
   after the diagnosis, the patient remains in complete remission without
   any ophthalmologic alterations.}},

Title = {{Monte Carlo simulation of the MoS2 sputtering process and the influence
   of the normalized momentum on residual stresses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},

Abstract = {{The film growth of sputtered MoS2 coatings is highly sensitive to the
   deposition conditions. Therefore, the effects of the deposition
   parameters on the resulting film structure have been studied excessively
   over recent decades. There is wide consensus in the literature that
   dense and hard MoS2 coatings show the best tribological behavior.
   Therefore, high-energy particle fluxes are typically favored due to
   momentum-induced film densification. Although particle flux phi and
   particle energy E are considered to be the most relevant for MoS2 film
   growth, the relationship between the process parameters and the
   resulting particle energetics has not yet been investigated. In this
   study, results from Monte Carlo simulations show the effect of cathode
   voltage and process pressure on the resulting particle energetics as a
   function of the target-substrate distance. Due to its relevance for the
   stress state, the normalized momentum according to Windischmann's
   intrinsic stress law has been investigated as a function of the
   deposition parameters. Based on the calculated results, it is assumed
   that the highest degree of particle induced densification and intrinsic
   stress formation can be expected at low process pressures, low
   target-substrate distances and high cathode voltages. However, the
   intensified densification effect of increased cathode voltages decreases
   with increasing distances to the target. In this study, the calculated
   results are compared with experimental residual stress data from
   literature. For this purpose, different phi E-1/2 -factors have been
   calculated for 13 parameter combinations according to a Box-Behnken
   design by varying the parameters cathode voltage, process pressure and
   target-substrate distance on three different levels. A strong
   correlation between these calculated data and experimentally determined
   stresses has been found, which confirms the approach of the simulation
   procedure. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, five different dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions,
   defined based on a size exclusion chromatography with simultaneous
   detection of organic carbon (OCD) and ultraviolet (UVD), were
   quantitatively tracked with a treatment train of
   coagulation/flocculation-sand filtration-ozonation-granular activated
   carbon (GAC) filtration in a full-scale advanced drinking water
   treatment plant (DWTP). Five DOM samples including raw water were taken
   after each treatment process in the DWTP every month over the period of
   three years. A higher abundance of biopolymer (BP) fraction was found in
   the raw water during spring and winter than in the other seasons,
   suggesting an influence of algal bloom and/or meltwater on DOM
   composition. The greater extent of removal was observed upon the
   coagulation/flocculation for high-molecular-weight fractions including
   BP and humic substances (HS) and aromatic moieties, while lower sized
   fractions were preferentially removed by the GAC filtration. Ozone
   treatment produced the fraction of low-molecular-weight neutrals
   probably resulting from the breakdown of double-bonded carbon structures
   by ozone oxidation. Coagulation/flocculation was the only process that
   revealed significant effects of influent DOM composition on the
   treatment efficiency, as revealed by a high correlation between the DOM
   removal rate and the relative abundance of HS for the raw water. Our
   study demonstrated that SEC-OCD-UVD was successful in monitoring
   size-based DOM composition for the advanced DWTP, providing an insight
   into optimizing the treatment options and the operational conditions for
   the removal of particular fractions within the bulk DOM.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To analyze growth and body composition of preemies at term gestational
   age and when they reach a weight of 3.0 to 3.5 kg.
   Methods
   This longitudinal study was conducted at Instituto Fernandes Figueira,
   Rio de Janeiro, and included 39 preemies with very low birth weight.
   Anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis were
   performed in 5 occasions: days 1 and 7 after birth; at birth weight
   recovery; at term-corrected gestational age; and at around three weeks
   of corrected gestational age (age needed to reach a weight of 3.0 to 3.5
   kg). A reference group comprising 32 term newborns, appropriate for
   gestational age, was evaluated at day 2 after birth. Growth restriction
   was defined as a Z-score below -2 for weight, length, and head
   circumference.
   Results
   At term age, 71.8\% of the preemies presented growth restriction for
   weight, 61.5\% for length, and 25.6\% for head circumference. When the
   preemies reached three weeks of corrected gestational age, triceps
   skinfold thickness and abdominal circumference were greater than those
   of the reference group, and length and percent of total body water were
   lower.
   Conclusion
   The anthropometric profile and total body water of preemies were
   different from those of term newborns, suggesting fat deposition. There
   was catch up growth between term age and three weeks of corrected
   gestational age, which was more evident for head circumference and
   weight.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Overuse of thromboprophylaxis is not an infrequent behavior
   in internal medicine. However, differently from underuse, overuse of
   thromboprophylaxis is rarely taken into account, and only few studies
   have addressed this issue. The purpose of our study was to try to
   understand the reasons behind this phenomenon.
   Methods. Using data from the TEVERE study, we evaluated 279 patients
   hospitalized in 21 hospitals of the Lazio Region in Italy. Only patients
   who were negative to major risk scores as established in the scientific
   literature were included. We assessed the frequency of
   thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients hospitalized in
   emergency and internal medicine wards, and we performed a comparative
   analysis for each risk factor among patients who received or not
   received thromboprophylaxis.
   Results. Forty-seven patients (16.5\%) with negative risk scores were
   given thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization. On backward stepwise
   logistic regression analysis, severe infection (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.31;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.25-4.35) and chronic venous
   insufficiency (OR 3.02; 95\% CI 1.96-4.67) were found to be the
   strongest predictors of the use of thromboprophylactic treatment with
   heparin. The subgroup of patients who did not exhibit risk factors was
   also analyzed, and age was found to be the main factor in the
   decision-making process regarding heparin administration in the absence
   of other risk factors (74.9 +/- 11.8 vs 63.7 +/- 18.1, p=0.002).
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that thromboprophylaxis is associated
   with considerable uncertainty, which results in its overuse. Further
   research is needed to better understand thromboembolic risk factors in
   hospitalized medical patients.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to synthesise new luminescent small molecular
   weight benzo- and naphthoquinoline derivatives (based on already known

   photoelectron spectroscopy in air (UPS), luminescence and absorption
   photospectrometry and to investigate the changes in these properties
   resulted by differences of molecular structure. Measured values of the
   HOMO, the LUMO energy levels and optical band gap (E-g\_opt) were in

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate use of a caudoventral-craniodorsal oblique
   radiographic view made at 45 degrees to the frontal plane (H view) for
   assessment of the pectoral (thoracic) girdle in raptors.
   Design-Retrospective cross-sectional analysis.
   Animals-24 raptors suspected to have a fracture of the thoracic girdle.
   Procedures-Standard ventrodorsal and H views were obtained for all
   birds. Radiographs were evaluated twice by a radiologist blinded to the
   final diagnosis, with each view first evaluated independently and views
   then evaluated in combination. Sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated, with
   results of surgery or necropsy used as the gold standard.
   Results-9 birds had thoracic girdle fractures; fractures were correctly
   identified in 8 of these 9 birds on the ventrodorsal view alone, 7 of
   these 9 birds on the H view alone, and all 9 birds on the 2 views in
   combination. Fifteen birds did not have thoracic girdle fractures;
   radiographs were correctly classified in 12 of these 15 birds when the
   ventrodorsal view was evaluated alone, all 15 birds when the H view was
   evaluated alone, and 14 of these 15 birds when the 2 views were
   evaluated in combination.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that the H view or
   the addition of the H view to the VD view could be useful in raptors
   suspected to have fractures of the thoracic girdle. Agreement with the
   gold standard (ie, fracture present or absent) was higher with the H
   view and combination of views than with the ventrodorsal view alone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the problem of degrammaticalization, that is, the
   exceptions to the unidirectionality of grammaticalization. After
   analyzing the criteria that allow us to distinguish between various
   instances of counter-directional change, two principles underlying
   degrammaticalization are identified; one is related to the type of
   language and the other to the type of target structures in which
   degrammaticalization occurs. Firstly, the targets of
   degrammaticalization are usually closed-class parts of speech with an
   abstract semantic component. Secondly, the languages in which
   counter-directional grammatical changes occur turn out to be deprived of
   an elaborate fusional morphology. These findings may also have an impact
   on the theoretical conception of grammaticalization, some of whose
   definitional properties are discussed. The paper ends with a discussion
   of a more controversial point, namely, counter-directional changes by
   folk etymology rather than by etymology proper.}},

Abstract = {{The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl-
   channel that is essential for electrolyte and fluid homeostasis.
   Preliminary evidence indicates that CFTR is a mechanosensitive channel.
   In lung epithelia, CFTR is exposed to different mechanical forces such
   as shear stress (Ss) and membrane distention. The present study
   questioned whether Ss and/or stretch influence CFTR activity (wild type,
   Delta F508, G551D). Human CFTR (hCFTR) was heterologously expressed in
   Xenopus oocytes and the response to the mechanical stimulus and
   forskolin/IBMX (FI) was measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp
   experiments. Ss had no influence on hCFTR activity. Injection of an
   intracellular analogous solution to increase cell volume alone did not
   affect hCFTR activity. However, hCFTR activity was augmented by
   injection after pre-stimulation with FI. The response to injection was
   similar in channels carrying the common mutations Delta F508 and G551D
   compared to wild type hCFTR. Stretch-induced CFTR activation was further
   assessed in Ussing chamber measurements using Xenopus lung preparations.
   Under control conditions increased hydrostatic pressure (HP) decreased
   the measured ion current including activation of a Cl- secretion that
   was unmasked by the CFTR inhibitor GlyH-101. These data demonstrate
   activation of CFTR in vitro and in a native pulmonary epithelium in
   response to mechanical stress. Mechanosensitive regulation of CFTR is
   highly relevant for pulmonary physiology that relies on ion transport
   processes facilitated by pulmonary epithelial cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PurposePsychosocial stress seems to serve as an important risk factor
   for the occurrence of pain. The present study aims to examine if early
   adversities, e.g. bullying, abuse and family conflict are risk factors
   for chronic pain in adolescents. The secondary aim of the present study
   was to describe the pain characteristics of chronic pain in adolescents
   in a community sample of Dutch adolescents.
   MethodsParticipants in the present study were 15,220 adolescents,
   attending schools (grade 7 and 8) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Chronic
   pain was measured with a newly developed questionnaire; the Pain
   Barometer. Early adversities were measured using single-item questions
   from the Rotterdam Youth Monitor, a longitudinal youth health
   surveillance system. Cross-sectional associations between early
   adversities and chronic pain were investigated using logistic multilevel
   analysis, adjusted for potential confounding.
   ResultsIn school year 2010-2011, 9.2\% of the 15,220 adolescents
   reported chronic pain. Physical abuse by others (OR=1.51, 95\% CI=
   1.07-2.14), sexual abuse (OR=1.46, 95\% CI=1.05-2.05), family conflict
   (OR=1.79, 95\% C=1.61-1.99) and being bullied (OR=1.23, 95\%
   CI=1.17-1.29) are more common in adolescents with chronic pain. Physical
   abuse (OR=1.28, 95\% CI=0.95-1.71) by parents and parental divorce
   (OR=1.07, 95\% CI=0.93-1.22) were not significantly related to chronic
   pain.
   ConclusionsThe results of the present study suggest that bullying, abuse
   and family conflict may be risk factors for chronic pain in adolescents.
   Early signalling these stressors might prevent chronic pain.
   Implications and contributionEarly adversities, i.e. physical and sexual
   abuse, being bullied and family conflict, might be risk factors for
   developing chronic pain. In addition, the present study suggests that
   chronic pain is common among Dutch adolescents and interferes with their
   daily activities. If future studies confirm our results, this knowledge
   can be used to improve the signalling and prevention of chronic pain in
   adolescents.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Documentation Speed Using Web-Based Medical Speech
   Recognition Technology: Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical documentation has undergone a change due to the
   usage of electronic health records. The core element is to capture
   clinical findings and document therapy electronically. Health care
   personnel spend a significant portion of their time on the computer.
   Alternatives to self-typing, such as speech recognition, are currently
   believed to increase documentation efficiency and quality, as well as
   satisfaction of health professionals while accomplishing clinical
   documentation, but few studies in this area have been published to date.
   Objective: This study describes the effects of using a Web-based medical
   speech recognition system for clinical documentation in a university
   hospital on (1) documentation speed, (2) document length, and (3)
   physician satisfaction.
   Methods: Reports of 28 physicians were randomized to be created with
   (intervention) or without (control) the assistance of a Web-based system
   of medical automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the German language.
   The documentation was entered into a browser's text area and the time to
   complete the documentation including all necessary corrections,
   correction effort, number of characters, and mood of participant were
   stored in a database. The underlying time comprised text entering, text
   correction, and finalization of the documentation event. Participants
   self-assessed their moods on a scale of 1-3 (1=good, 2=moderate, 3=bad).
   Statistical analysis was done using permutation tests.
   Results: The number of clinical reports eligible for further analysis
   stood at 1455. Out of 1455 reports, 718 (49.35\%) were assisted by ASR
   and 737 (50.65\%) were not assisted by ASR. Average documentation speed
   without ASR was 173 (SD 101) characters per minute, while it was 217 (SD
   120) characters per minute using ASR. The overall increase in
   documentation speed through Web-based ASR assistance was 26\% (P=.04).
   Participants documented an average of 356 (SD 388) characters per report
   when not assisted by ASR and 649 (SD 561) characters per report when
   assisted by ASR. Participants' average mood rating was 1.3 (SD 0.6)
   using ASR assistance compared to 1.6 (SD 0.7) without ASR assistance
   (P<.001).
   Conclusions: We conclude that medical documentation with the assistance
   of Web-based speech recognition leads to an increase in documentation
   speed, document length, and participant mood when compared to
   self-typing. Speech recognition is a meaningful and effective tool for
   the clinical documentation process.}},

Abstract = {{Infection rates in primary (first-time) major joint arthroplasty
   continue to be a significant issue. The effect of antibiotic and
   antiseptic prophylaxis on outcomes for this type of surgery has not been
   adequately reviewed. A systematic search of the main databases for
   randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating antibiotics and
   antiseptics was conducted to evaluate the predetermined endpoints of
   infection, adverse events, costs, quality of life, and concentration
   levels of antibiotics. A meta-analysis using pooled effect estimates and
   fixed-effect and random-effect models of risk ratios (RR), calculated
   with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), was utilized. Thirty (30) RCTs
   examined the effects of antibiotic and antiseptic prophylaxis on
   infections after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) (total of 11,597
   participants) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (total of 6,141
   participants). For THA, preoperative systemic intravenous (i.v.)
   antibiotic prophylaxis may be effective in reducing the incidence of
   infection after THA from 6 months to >= 5 years. For TKA, there is no
   RCT evidence that antibiotics and/or antiseptics have any effect on
   infection rate. Preoperative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in primary
   THA may be effective at reducing infection rate. There is no evidence
   that timing, route of administration, or concentration levels have an
   effect on reducing infections, adverse events, or costs in THA or TKA.
   Many of the trials included in this study were published in the 1980s
   and 1990s. Thus, it would be important to replicate a number of them
   based on current patient demographics and incidence of bacterial
   resistance.}},

Title = {{Molecular Mechanisms and Timing of Cortical Immune Activation in

Volume = {{172}},

Pages = {{1112-1121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Immune-related abnormalities are commonly reported in
   schizophrenia, including higher mRNA levels for the viral restriction
   factor interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) in the
   prefrontal cortex. The authors sought to clarify whether higher IFITM
   mRNA levels and other immune-related disturbances in the prefrontal
   cortex are the consequence of an ongoing molecular cascade contributing
   to immune activation or the reflection of a long-lasting maladaptive
   response to an in utero immune-related insult.
   Method: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure
   mRNA levels for immune-related cytokines and transcriptional regulators,
   including those reported to regulate IFITM expression, in the prefrontal
   cortex from 62 schizophrenia and 62 healthy subjects and from adult mice
   exposed prenatally to maternal immune activation or in adulthood to the
   immune stimulant poty(I:C).
   Results: Schizophrenia subjects had markedly higher mRNA levels for
   interleukin 6 (IL-6) (+379\%) and interferon-beta (+29\%), which induce
   IFITM expression; Lower mRNA levels for Schnurri-2 (-10\%), a
   transcriptional inhibitor that lowers IFITM expression; and higher mRNA
   levels for nuclear factor-kappa B (+86\%), a critical transcription
   factor that mediates cytokine regulation of immune-related gene
   expression. In adult mice that received daily poly(I:C) injections, but
   not in offspring with prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation,
   frontal cortex mRNA levels were also markedly elevated for IFITM
   (+304\%), multiple cytokines including IL-6 (+493\%), and nuclear
   factor-KB (+151\%).
   Conclusions:, These data suggest that higher prefrontal cortex IFITM
   mRNA levels in schizophrenia may be attributable to adult, but not
   prenatal, activation of multiple immune markers and encourage further
   investigation into the potential role of these and other immune markers
   as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of potential sibship is a common task in routine
   kinship analysis, but often the putative parents are not available for
   analysis anymore. Then, a sibling analysis has to be conducted
   investigating only the potential siblings, thus reducing the power of
   the conclusion. In an attempt to determine meaningfulness of
   biostatistical calculations, 346 dizygotic twin pairs, 30 confirmed half
   siblings, and 112 unrelated people (to generate 6216 pair comparisons)
   were studied, all genetically typed using at least the PowerplexA (R) 16
   STRs. From every pair, the probabilities for a full sibship (identical
   parents) and half sibship (different fathers) were calculated using a
   commercially available computer program. Additionally, we simulated
   marker data for one million pairs of full sibs, half sibs, and unrelated
   persons each. Ninety-five percent of full sibling pairs demonstrated a
   likelihood ratio (LR) > 9 (W-value > 90 \%) and less than 4 \% of these
   showed a LR < 3 (W-value < 75 \%) for full sibship after analysis of 15
   STRs. The results for half siblings are less unambiguous. Here, only 57
   \% achieved a LR > 9 and 23 \% a LR < 3. Regarding the unrelated pairs,
   more than 90 \% had a LR < 1/9 and only 2 \% reached a LR > 9. All in
   all, our results show that 15 to 20 STRs have sufficient power for
   analyses in kinship. Moreover, our data provide a statistical basis for
   the determination of the information content of a LR/W-value in a
   sibship case. Investigating an identical number of full siblings and
   unrelated pairs, it could be shown that 92 \% of pairs with a LR > 9 for
   full sibship probability really are full siblings. So, setting a cutoff
   level for full sibship at LR > 9, less than 10 \% of pairs will be
   wrongly assumed as full siblings even though they are unrelated.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive tests of learning and memory (L\&M) have been required by U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developmental neurotoxicity test
   (DNT) guidelines for more than two decades. To evaluate the utility of
   these guidelines, the EPA reviewed 69 pesticide DNT studies. This review
   found that the DNT provided or could provide the point-of-departure for
   risk assessment by showing the Lowest Observable Adverse Effect Level
   (LOAEL) in 28 of these studies in relation to other reported end points.
   Among the behavioral tests, locomotor activity and auditory/acoustic
   startle provided the most LOAELs, and tests of cognitive function and
   the Functional Observational Battery (FOB) the fewest. Two issues arose
   from the review: (1) what is the relative utility of cognitive tests
   versus tests of unconditioned behavior, and (2) how might cognitive
   tests be improved? The EPA sponsored a symposium to address this.
   Bushnell reviewed studies in which both screening (locomotor activity,
   FOB, reflex ontogeny, etc.) and complex tests (those requiring training)
   were used within the same study; he found relatively little evidence
   that complex tests provided a LOAEL lower than screening tests (with
   exceptions). Levin reviewed reasons for including cognitive tests in
   regulatory studies and methods and evidence for the radial arm maze and
   its place in developmental neurotoxicity assessments. Driscoll and
   Strupp reviewed the value of serial reaction time operant methods for
   assessing executive function in developmental neurotoxicity studies.
   Vorhees and Williams reviewed the value of allocentric (spatial) and
   egocentric cognitive tests and presented methods for using the Morris
   water maze for spatial and the Cincinnati water maze for egocentric
   cognitive assessment. They also reviewed the possible use of water
   radial mazes. The relatively lower impact of cognitive tests in previous
   DNT studies in the face of the frequency of human complaints of
   chemical-induced cognitive dysfunction indicates that animal cognitive
   tests need improvement. The contributors to this symposium suggest that
   if the guidelines are updated, they be made more specific by
   recommending preferred tests and providing greater detail on key
   characteristics of such tests. Additionally, it is recommended that
   guidance be developed to address important issues with cognitive tests
   and to provide the information needed to improve the design, conduct,
   and interpretation of tests of higher function within a regulatory
   context. These steps will maximize the value of cognitive tests for use
   in hazard evaluation and risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In this paper a universal reconfigurable computing architecture for
   hardware implementation of homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble
   classifiers composed from decision trees (DTs), artificial neural
   networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. The
   following types of ensemble classifiers have been implemented in FPGA
   using proposed architecture: homogeneous ensemble classifiers composed
   from two versions of DT (Functional DT and Axis-Parallel DT), two
   versions of SVM (with polynomial and radial kernel) and two versions of
   ANN (Multilayer Perceptron ANN and Radial Basis, ANN) machine learning
   predictive models, as well as a number of types of heterogeneous
   ensemble classifiers composed of a mixtures of DTs, SVMs and ANNs.
   Comparison of the FPGA implementation of REC architecture with standard
   WEKA software implementation suggests that proposed hardware
   architecture offers substantial speed-ups for all types of considered
   machine learning ensemble classifiers, ranging from 10(2) to 10(5)
   times. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Composite ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated by coating a thin
   film of self-assembling polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PS-b-PEO) block copolymers and poly(acrylic acid) homopolymers on top
   of a support membrane. Block copolymers self-assembled into a
   nanostructure where the minority component forms cylinders, whereas
   homopolymers reside in the core of the cylinders. Selective removal of
   the homopolymers led to the formation of pores. The morphology of the
   polymer layer was controlled by varying the content of homopolymers or
   polymer concentration of the coating solution, which led to membranes
   with different molecular weight cutoffs (MWCOs) and permeabilities.
   Uniform pores were obtained using low homopolymer contents, whereas high
   homopolymer contents caused macrophase separation and resulted in large
   polydisperse pores or craters at the surface. The thickness of the block
   copolymer film also influenced the structure and performance of the
   membranes, where a thicker film results in a strong decrease in
   permeability but a lower MWCO. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the study, a thermally activated sodium peroxydisulphate (PDS;
   Na2S2O8) was applied in order to disintegrate wastewater activated
   sludge (WAS). Chemical disintegration of WAS results in organic matter
   and polymer transfer from the solid phase to the liquid phase. Soluble
   chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) is often used to characterise the
   disintegration efficiency of WAS flocs and microorganisms cells. The
   present study was conducted in order to chemically disintegrate WAS
   using PDS in doses of 0.2 \%, 0.4 \%, 0.6 \%, 0.8 \% and 1.0 \%
   activated at temperatures of 50 degrees C, 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C
   for 30 min. The temperature rise induced the PDS to form free radicals,
   which resulted in an increase in SCOD, i.e. for the highest dose of PDS,
   the SCOD value attained 2140 mg dm(-3) (almost a 15-fold increase over
   the WAS value). A further positive effect from using this method was a
   decrease in the sludge volume index (SVI) from 89.8 cm(3) g(-1) to 30.6
   cm(3) g(-1). On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded
   that thermally activated PDS is suitable for disintegration and has a
   positive impact on WAS sedimentation properties. (C) 2015 Institute of

Abstract = {{Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is non-resectable in the majority of
   patients often due to intrahepatic extension along bile duct
   branches/segments, and even after complete resection (R0) recurrence can
   be as high as 70\%. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an established
   palliative local tumor ablative treatment for non-resectable hilar CC.
   We report the long-term outcome of curative resection (R0) performed
   after neoadjuvant PDT for downsizing of tumor margins in seven patients
   (median age 59 years) with initially non-resectable hilar CC.
   Photofrin((R)) was injected intravenously 24-48 h before laser light
   irradiation of the tumor stenoses and the adjacent bile duct segments.
   Major resective surgery was done with curative intention six weeks after
   PDT. All seven patients had been curatively (R0) resected and there were
   no undue early or late complications for the neoadjuvant PDT and
   surgery. Six of seven patients died from tumor recurrence at a median of
   3.2 years after resection, the five-year survival rate was 43\%. These
   results are comparable with published data for patients resected R0
   without pre-treatment, indicating that neoadjuvant PDT is feasible and
   could improve overall survival of patients considered non-curatively
   resectable because of initial tumor extension in bile duct
   branches/segmentshowever, this concept needs to be validated in a larger
   trial.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In the modern era, the demarcation of national boundaries has been a
   critical feature of the international system. Continent-based
   demarcations are often more complex than island-based demarcations due,
   in part, to the former's generally greater ethnic, religious and
   historical diversities. However, island-based demarcations, especially
   when involving archipelagos, can also be a challenging process. States
   with extensive archipelagos are often faced with geographical
   archipelagic ambiguities, whereby it is unclear to the archipelagic
   state and other states where the former's national boundaries begin and
   end. This paper explores the archipelagic ambiguities modern Japan was
   faced with and examines their origins and how they were resolved. By
   1868, Japanese leaders realized that Japan's lingering territorial
   uncertainties could no longer be left unaddressed if their country was
   to become a contemporary state. The modern demarcation of Japan was a
   process lasting more than a decade, until the country resolved the
   geographical ambiguities along its northern and southern peripheries.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To examine roles and responsibilities of Practice Nurses in the
   area of child health and development and in advising parents about child
   health issues.
   Background. As the focus of Australia's health care system shifts
   further towards the primary health care sector, governmental initiatives
   require that Practice Nurses are knowledgeable, confident and competent
   in providing care in the area of child health and development. Little is
   known about roles and responsibilities of Practice Nurses in this area.
   Design. Cross-sectional survey design.
   Methods. Practice Nurses completed a national online survey examining
   the roles and responsibilities in child health and development,
   professional development needs and role satisfaction. Data were
   collected from June 2010 April 2011.
   Results. Respondents (N = 159) reported having a significant role in
   well and sick child care and were interested in extending their role.
   Frequent activities included immunization, phone triage/advice, child
   health/development advice, wound care and Healthy Kids Checks. Hovvever,
   few had paediatric/child nursing backgrounds or postgraduate
   qualifications in paediatric nursing and they reported limited
   preparation for the role. Practice Nurses reported difficulties with
   keeping up-to-date with child health information and advising parents
   confidently. Satisfaction was relatively low regarding opportunities and
   encouragement to undertake professional development and expand scope of
   practice.
   Conclusion. Practice Nurses are largely unprepared to meet the demands
   of their child health role and need support to develop and maintain the
   skills and knowledge base necessary for high-quality, evidence-based
   practice. Both financial and time support is needed to enable Practice
   Nurses to access child health professional development.}},

   isolates, via time-kill kinetics (static and dynamic models;
   concentration range, 1-1024 mg/L), population analysis profiles (PAPs)
   and post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Two inocula (similar to 10(6) and
   similar to 10(8) cfu/mL) were included in static time-kill studies to
   examine the effect of inocula on bacterial killing.
   Results: MICs ranged from 1 to >512 mg/L, with 61\% of isolates
   considered fosfomycin susceptible (MIC <= 64 mg/L). The MIC
   distributions for MDR and non-MDR isolates were similar. Baseline PAPs
   indicated heteroresistance in all isolates tested. Time-kill studies
   showed moderate (maximum killing similar to 3 log(10) cfu/mL),
   time-dependent killing at the low inoculum with regrowth at 24 h. Most
   concentrations resulted in complete replacement of
   fosfomycin-susceptible colonies by fosfomycin-resistant colonies.
   Bacterial killing was virtually eliminated at the high inoculum. The PAE
   ranged from 0.3 to 5.5 h.
   Conclusions: These data suggest monotherapy with fosfomycin may be
   problematic for the treatment of infections caused by P. aeruginosa.
   Further investigation of fosfomycin combination therapy is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The present study explored the relationship between grandiose narcissism
   and Facebook use among college students. Participants completed a
   measure of grandiose narcissism and reported about their frequency and
   duration of Facebook use twice each day for four days. Consistent with
   previous work, narcissism was positively correlated with frequency of
   Facebook use. However, linear mixed model analyses revealed that
   Facebook use did not predict subsequent narcissism after controlling for
   previous level of narcissism. On the other hand, narcissism was a
   reliable predictor of subsequent Facebook use even after controlling for
   earlier Facebook use. These results converge with recent work in (a)
   observing a link between narcissism and Facebook use and (b) casting
   doubt on the popular notion that Facebook use leads to narcissism.
   Instead, the data suggest that narcissistic self-regard increases the
   frequency of Facebook use. Such findings are interpreted in light of the
   self-expressive opportunities that Facebook provides, and future
   research directions involving more recently developed social networking
   sites are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents modelling, control and realisation of a forward
   converter with resonant reset at the secondary side. The transformer
   reset occurs through the resonance between its magnetising inductance
   and the resonant capacitor during the switch off time. The mechanism is
   similar to a forward converter with resonant reset at the primary side.
   The only difference is that the transformer-stored energy can now be
   partially delivered to the load instead of being dissipated in the
   switch at turn-on. Another advantage compared with conventional forward
   converters is the lower switch voltage stress and transformer size,
   which are theoretically proved to be lower. Furthermore, this converter
   can be used as a step-up and step-down converter. To verify all the
   mentioned features, simulations were carried out and a 600 W prototype
   was implemented experimentally, reaching a maximum efficiency of 94.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of dietary lipid levels on the growth, whole
   body composition and fatty acid composition of juvenile gibel carp
   (Carassius auratus gibelio). Triplicate groups of 120 juvenile Carassius
   auratus gibelio (average weight: 2.05g) were fed four isonitrogenic
   diets formulated with lipid levels of 1.4\% (low), 6.1\% (control),
   11.6\% (medium) and 21.1\% (high) for 60days. Weight gain in the 11.6\%
   lipid group was significantly higher than that in the other groups
   (P<0.05). The feed conversion ratio decreased and protein efficiency
   ratio increased (P>0.05) as dietary lipid levels increased. N-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were not detected in faeces. The
   whole body lipid contents of 11.6\% and 21.1\% lipid level groups were
   significantly higher than that of the 1.4\% and 6.1\% lipid level groups
   (P<0.05). The content of whole body n-3 PUFA in the 21.1\% lipid level
   group enhanced significantly (P<0.05). The whole body contents of
   eicosapntemacnioc acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the
   21.1\% lipid level group were the highest (P<0.05). These results
   indicated that high dietary lipid levels (21.1\%) inhibit weight gain
   and promoted fat and n-3 PUFA deposition in juvenile Carassius auratus
   gibelio, which led to liver damage. A dietary lipid level of 11.6\% was
   determined to be optimal for growth performance of juvenile Carassius

Abstract = {{In order to investigate heat transfer behaviour at an individual
   particle scale, the particle cooling process in a rectangular spouted
   bed is simulated by the Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element
   Method (CFD-DEM). As the inlet gas velocity increases, the gas-particle
   convective heat transfer in the jet region is intensified, while the
   convective heat transfer in the annular region is weakened. The inlet
   gas velocity also has an influence on the particle-particle conductive
   heat transfer. Particle-particle conductive heat transfer in the jet and
   fountain regions can both be enhanced by increasing inlet gas velocity,
   but this variation trend is opposite in the annular region.
   Additionally, the temperature distributions of particle and gas phases
   in the bed are also analyzed in detail. Compared with the infrared
   thermography experiment, the particle cooling process in the simulation
   results agrees closely with that in the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Phenol is one of the most important chemicals in industry. One-step
   selective benzene hydroxylation is an attractive yet challenging method
   for phenol production, especially when such a reaction can be driven by
   solar energy. Herein, we reported that a highly selective benzene
   hydroxylation to phenol can be achieved over two Fe-based metal organic
   frameworks {[}MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-68(Fe)] under visible light
   irradiations using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant. An optimal
   benzene conversion of 30.6\% was achieved with a H2O2:benzene ratio of
   3:4 over MIL-100(Fe) after 24 h irradiations. ESR results and the
   kinetic studies suggested that a successful coupling of the
   photocatalysis of Fe-O clusters in Fe-based metal organic frameworks
   (MOFs) with a Fenton-like route is involved in this benzene
   hydroxylation process. The comparison of the reaction over MIL-100(Fe)
   and MIL-68(Fe) reveals that the structure of MOFs significantly
   influences the photocatalytic efficiency. Because the composition and
   the structure of MOFs are highly tunable, this study highlights the
   great potential of using Fe-based MOFs for photocatalytic benzene
   hydroxylation to form phenol, which may result in an economical,
   sustainable, and thus green process for phenol production.}},

Title = {{Central Glaucomatous Damage of the Macula Can Be Overlooked by
   Conventional OCT Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness Analyses}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the extent to which glaucomatous damage of the macula
   can be detected using the summary statistics of a commercial report
   based upon the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL)
   thickness obtained with frequency domain optical coherence tomography
   (fdOCT).
   Methods: One hundred forty-three eyes of 143 open-angle glaucoma
   patients and suspects (56.4 +/- 13.8 years) had 10-2 visual fields (VFs)
   and fdOCT macular and disc cube scans. RNFL and retinal ganglion cell
   plus inner plexiform layer thickness and probability maps were generated
   and combined with 10-2 VF information in a singlepage, custom report
   previously described. Three graders evaluated these reports and
   classified each eye as ``abnormal macula'' or ``normal macula.''
   Commercially available fdOCT reports for cpRNFL thickness were generated
   using the automatic segmentation algorithm and norms from the machine.
   The ability of the reports to detect macular damage was analyzed in
   three ways: temporal quadrant (TQ)< 5\%; TQ< 5\% or clock hour 7, 1\%
   (TQ + CH7); and clock hours 7 through 10 with two sectors, 5\% or one
   sector<1\% (CH7 - 10).
   Results: Sixty-one (43\%) eyes were classified ``abnormal macula'' and
   41 (29\%) as ``normal macula''; the 10-2 VFs and OCT probability maps
   did not agree in the remaining eyes. Of the 61 abnormal eyes, the TQ
   criterion missed 47 (77\%); TQ + CH7 missed 24 (39\%); and CH7-10 missed
   22 (36\%).
   Conclusions: Conventional cpRNFL analyses on commercial OCT reports can
   miss macular (central field) damage.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In common with other iron-based high-temperature superconductors, Fe Se
   exhibits a transition to a `nematic' phase below 90 K in which the
   crystal rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. However, the absence
   of strong low-frequency magnetic fluctuations near or above the
   transition has been interpreted as implying the primacy of orbital
   ordering. In contrast, we establish that quantum fluctuations of spin-1
   local moments with strongly frustrated exchange interactions can lead to
   a nematic quantum paramagnetic phase consistent with the observations in
   Fe Se. We show that this phase is a fundamental expression of the
   existence of a Berry's phase associated with the topological defects of
   a Neel antiferromagnet, in a manner analogous to that which gives rise
   to valence bond crystal order for spin-1/2 systems. We present an
   exactly solvable model realizing the nematic quantum paramagnetic phase,
   discuss its relation with the spin-1 J(1)-J(2) model, and construct a
   field theory of the Landau-forbidden transition between the Neel state
   and this nematic quantum paramagnet.}},

Abstract = {{For the universal phenomenon of the aero-engine connectors with the
   looseness fault, a single degree of freedom lumped mass model was
   established and a looseness fault model was introduced. The response of
   the system was obtained by numerical integration methods and the
   asynchronous response characteristics were analyzed. The experiments
   were conducted on the connectors with looseness clearance. It is found
   that the acceleration response of the mass block after noise reduction
   has up-down asymmetrical impact characteristics in the waveform, also
   the pseudo-critical subharmonic resonance and the pseudo-critical
   ultra-harmonic resonance appear in frequency spectrum. These
   characteristics are in agreement with the results of the numerical
   simulation, which can be identified as the characteristics of the
   looseness fault. The reason leading to the looseness characteristics is
   that the period of stiffness changes in the period of the rotating
   speed. When the changing period of stiffness is equivalent to the
   vibration period, frequency multiplication will appear and the natural
   frequency of the system will be excited at specific speeds. When the
   changing period of stiffness is equivalent to n times the vibration
   period, 1/n frequency division and frequency multiplication will appear
   and the natural frequency of the system will be excited at specific

   is realized by C-2C structure instead of the unit capacitor C. Compared

Abstract = {{Cr3C2 and VC are two typical grain growth inhibitors used in producing
   fine grain microstructure in WC-Co materials. In this investigation, the
   sintering processes of Cr3C2 and VC doped submicron WC-Co powders were
   studied by using dilatometry, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and evolved gas analysis (EGA)
   by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometry (FT-IR). The combination
   of these methods can provide a comprehensive understanding of sintering
   processes of Cr3C2 and VC doped WC-Co powders during heating. Results
   show that, below 900 degrees C, similar sintering behaviors were
   observed for both Cr3C2 and VC doped WC-Co powders, showing a wax
   vaporization process in the range of 200 degrees C to 400 degrees C, and
   tungsten oxide reduction by carbon occurring around 800 degrees C. Onset
   of densification begins around 900 degrees C. Differences in sintering
   reaction and densification were observed above 900 degrees C. First, VC
   doping shows an outgassing reaction and a clear shrinkage inflection,
   increase in shrinkage rate, in the dilatometer curve between 900 and
   1100 degrees C, while Cr3C2 doping shows only slight outgassing and no
   shrinkage inflection in the dilatometer response within the same
   temperature range. Second, Cr3C2 doping shows a strong outgassing
   reaction in the 1200-1400 degrees C range, which was not evident in the
   VC doped material. Third, Cr3C2 doping also shows a higher melting
   temperature than VC doping. Possible mechanisms for these different
   sintering reactions and resulting sintering behaviors have been
   discussed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CHIP (Carboxy terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein) is an E3 ubiquitin
   ligase that can induce ubiquitination and degradation of several
   oncogenic proteins. The expression of CHIP is frequently lower in human
   breast cancer than in normal breast tissue. However, the expression and
   role of CHIP in the canine mammary gland tumor (CMGT) remain unclear. We
   investigated the potential correlation between CHIP expression and
   mammary gland tumor prognosis in female dogs. CHIP expression was
   measured in 54 dogs by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR. CHIP
   protein expression was significantly correlated with the
   histopathological diagnosis, outcome of disease and tumor
   classification. The transcriptional level of CHIP was significantly
   higher in normal tissues (P=0.001) and benign tumors (P=0.009) than it
   in malignant tumors. CHIP protein expression was significantly
   correlated with the transcriptional level of CHIP (P=0.0102). The
   log-rank test survival curves indicated that patients with low
   expression of CHIP had shorter overall periods of survival than those
   with higher CHIP protein expression (P=0.050). Our data suggest that
   CHIP may play an important role in the formation and development of
   CMGTs and serve as a valuable prognostic marker and potential target for
   genetic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEDuring the operation, accurately identifying the
   boundary of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and discriminating
   between feeding arteries and draining veins is the key to successful
   surgical treatment of cerebral AVM. We evaluated the application of
   intraoperative ultrasonography (IOU) combined with intraoperative
   indocyanine green video-angiography (IOICGA) in the patients with
   cerebral AVM.
   METHODSThe effects of IOU combined with IOICGA on AVM surgery were
   observed in 12 patients with cerebral AVM.
   RESULTSThe lesions of cerebral AVM were completely removed in the 12
   patients. IOU could clearly visualize the boundary of AVM, so no
   patients had massive hemorrhage caused by rupture of malformed vessels.
   IOU also could detect the location of deep vessels and a total of 11
   deep vessels were identified in the 12 patients. IOICGA was performed 41
   times altogether in the 12 patients, and 31 feeding arteries and 10
   draining veins were identified, so there was no massive hemorrhage
   caused by misjudgment of feeding arteries or draining veins.
   CONCLUSIONSIOU combined with IOICGA can identify the boundary of AVM,
   detect deep vessels, and discriminate between feeding arteries and
   draining veins, reducing operation difficulty, decreasing mortality and
   disability rate, and increasing the rate of complete excision.}},

Abstract = {{Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) have been a prevalent vibration control device
   for suppressing excessive vibration because of environmental loadings in
   contemporary tall buildings since the mid-1970s. A TMD must be tuned to
   the natural frequency of the primary structure to be effective. In
   practice, a TMD may be assembled in situ, simultaneously with the
   building construction. In such a situation, the respective dynamic
   properties of the TMD device and building cannot be identified to
   determine the tuning status of the TMD. For this purpose, a methodology
   was developed to obtain the parameters of the TMD and primary building
   on the basis of the eigenparameters of any two complex modes of the
   combined building TMD system. The theory was derived in state-space to
   characterize the nonclassical damping feature of the system, and
   combined with a system identification technique to obtain the system
   eigenparameters using the acceleration measurements. The proposed
   procedure was first demonstrated using a numerical verification and then
   applied to real, experimental data of a large-scale building TMD system.
   The results showed that the procedure is capable of identifying the
   respective parameters of the TMD and primary structure and is applicable
   in real implementations by using only the acceleration response
   measurements of the TMD and its located floor.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal dietary Zn concentrations for a specific fish can vary
   greatly with different diets or life stages of fish. In the present
   study, we used the daily net Zn flux (i.e., the rate of flow of Zn per
   gram weight per day) to quantify the sufficiency of Zn to marine medaka
   at different Zn-supplement levels (i.e., 0-320 mg Zn/kg). A modified
   fractional model was also applied to estimate the essential daily net Zn
   flux in medaka. The feeding experiment results showed that retarded
   growth, increased mortality, enhanced Zn assimilation efficiency and
   anorexia appeared in medaka with a low daily net Zn flux (i.e., 0.64 and
   1.2 mu g/g/day). Once the daily net Zn flux reached the sufficient
   levels (i.e., 1.7-2.0 mu g/g/day), enhanced growth and digestion
   enzymatic activities were observed. Excess daily net Zn flux (>2.9 mu
   g/g/day) increased the body Zn concentration in fish, but had no
   beneficial effect on digestion enzymatic activities as well as Zn
   assimilation efficiency. The essential daily net Zn flux (1.8-2.0 mu
   g/g/day for juvenile medaka) estimated from the modified fractional
   model was essentially the same as the optimal daily net Zn flux
   determined from the feeding experiments. Application of such modified
   fractional model in other fish species can explicitly provide the
   essential daily net Zn flux for a specific fish at any life stage.
   Statement of relevance
   This study addressed the essential nutritional requirements of mineral
   in fish and proposed to use daily net flux to quantify the optimum
   requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral response of the moving hoisting conveyance in cable-guided
   hoisting system is investigated in this paper. The equations of motion
   are derived by Hamilton's principle while the equivalent mass and
   stiffness of the guide cables are formulated. Galerkin method is
   employed to transform the governing equation into a set of ordinary
   differential equations. Subsequently, an ADAMS simulation model based on
   multi-degree of freedom is established to validate the theoretical
   model. Meanwhile, a high-efficiency simulation approach is proposed, in
   which the contact force is replaced with fixed joints and distance
   sensors. The numerical solution for equations set is obtained using
   Newmark- method and the convergence of the solution is discussed, then
   the presented theoretical model is compared with the previous models
   describing the rigid rail-guided hoisting system. The results indicate
   that the numerical simulations are in reasonably good agreement with the
   ADAMS simulations and this presented model includes the previous models.
   The influence of parameters on the lateral response is analyzed, which
   reveals the maximum lateral displacement is linearly proportional to the
   excitation amplitude. Also, the appropriate preload can be determined by
   the theoretical model, which is beneficial for vibration control.}},

   inserts}},
Journal = {{FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{513-518}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Toroidal field ripple (TFR) amplitude of CFETR (China Fusion Engineering
   Test Reactor) was evaluated by ANSYS, and its profile at the plasma
   region was presented in MATLAB environment. The amplitude of the TFR is
   about 0.3\% at the edge of plasma region, while it will reach 0.5\% if
   the plasma radius is supposed to be larger. In order to investigate the
   effect of ferromagnetic materials on ripple reduction, ferromagnetic
   inserts with applicable material, various quantity and different
   toroidal angle in the shadow of each toroidal field coil were installed
   between the vacuum vessel shells by simulation and the results indicate
   ripple reduction is obtained when the angle was proper. By contrast, the
   ferromagnetic inserts were also installed on the inside of the inner
   shell and the outside of the outer shell. It shows that the effect on
   ripple reduction is better as the inserts are closer to plasma. Through
   the study we can conclude that it is feasible to install ferromagnetic
   inserts to reduce the TFR amplitude, but not necessary for CFETR at
   present parameters, while the method of installing ferromagnetic inserts
   could be developed if experiments with larger radius of plasma were to
   be done in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the coordination of multiple battery energy storage systems
   (BESSs) is proposed for voltage control in low-voltage distribution
   networks (LVDNs). The main objective of this method is to solve
   over-voltage problems with multiple suitably sized energy storage
   systems. The performance of coordinated control is compared with
   noncoordinated control using both a real-time digital simulator and a
   MATLAB model of a real U.K. LVDN with a high installed capacity of solar
   photovoltaics. This is used to show that coordinated control is robust
   and effective at preventing voltage rise problems in LVDNs. The proposed
   coordinated control scheme is able to use the BESSs more evenly, and
   therefore reduces the costs of battery replacement to the storage
   operator in terms of both number of batteries and maintenance visits.}},

Abstract = {{Navigating pedestrians to the expected location in an unfamiliar indoor
   space, like museum, shopping mall, and airport, is often time-consuming
   and grueling. Anchor position information or a radio map based
   navigation strategies are useful in some occasions, but such anchors or
   maps may not be always available for everyone when needed. In this work,
   We study the possibility of using hints extracted from off-the-shelf
   sensors on smartphone and widely deployed WLANs to provide a reliable
   grassroots solution for indoor navigation. The proposed simultaneous
   navigation and pathway mapping approach, EasyPop, overcomes these
   restrictions, i.e., neither placing assistant devices in advance nor the
   floor plan are needed. Based on Wi-Fi or cellular signals, site-specific
   calibration in radio-frequency fingerprinting is received by
   automatically path mapping. Mobile fingerprints are generated on
   wireless client by probing the neighbored Wi-Fi APs in predefined
   period, as well as the sensor hints with respect to spatial-temporal
   features. Pathways can be generated via incremental construction pattern
   while quickly reducing the expected distance of a randomly-chosen point
   from POIs. By leveraging a Bayesian probability model to pathway
   mapping, the optimal direction of motions is demonstrated step by step
   by crowdsourcing. EasyPop is evaluated in multiple indoor scenarios
   involving six volunteers with different data density. The experimental
   results show that the proposed method has comparable performance to
   the-state-of-arts without requiring any a priori.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Furfural (FF) is a valuable ring-containing organic compound in the
   decomposition of xylose and can be produced massively in hydrothermal
   condition. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) methods are
   employed to investigate the formation mechanism of FF from xylose and
   the solvent effects on FF formation. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses
   indicate that xylulose could be the intermediate that leads to the
   formation of FF in the gas phase and water. The formation of xylulose is
   initiated by a six-membered transition state with energy barriers of
   163.6 and 150.8 kJ mol(-1) in the gas phase and water, respectively. It
   is found that the strong stabilization of the reactants and transition
   states and the overall energy barriers of formation pathways of FF are
   reduced in water. The formation of FF is more thermodynamically favored
   in water compared with that in the gas phase. In addition, the inclusion
   of an explicit water molecule transforms four-membered transition states
   of ring-opening reaction, hydrogenation-cyclization, and dehydrations
   into less distorted six-membered transition states, which leads to the
   significant reduction of reaction barriers of FF formation.}},

Abstract = {{3D geometric features constitute rich details of polygonal meshes. Their
   analysis and editing can lead to vivid appearance of shapes and better
   understanding of the underlying geometry for shape processing and
   analysis. Traditional mesh smoothing techniques mainly focus on noise
   filtering and they cannot distinguish different scales of features well,
   even mixing them up. We present an efficient method to process different
   scale geometric features based on a novel rolling-guidance normal
   filter. Given a 3D mesh, our method iteratively applies a joint
   bilateral filter to face normals at a specified scale, which empirically
   smooths small-scale geometric features while preserving large-scale
   features. Our method recovers the mesh from the filtered face normals by
   a modified Poisson-based gradient deformation that yields better surface
   quality than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
   superiority of our method on a series of geometry processing tasks,
   including geometry texture removal and enhancement, coating transfer,
   mesh segmentation and level-of-detail meshing.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Porphyromonas gingivalis is a prominent periodontal, and emerging
   systemic, pathogen that redirects host cell signalling pathways and
   modulates innate immune responses. In this study, we show that
   P.gingivalis infection induces the dephosphorylation and activation of
   forkhead box-O (FOXO)1, 3 and 4 in gingival epithelial cells. In
   addition, immunofluorescence showed that FOXO1 accumulated in the
   nucleus of P.gingivalis-infected cells. Quantitative reverse
   transcription PCR demonstrated that transcription of genes involved in
   protection against oxidative stress (Cat, Sod2, Prdx3), inflammatory
   responses (IL1) and anti-apoptosis (Bcl-6) was induced by P.gingivalis,
   while small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of FOXO1
   suppressed the transcriptional activation of these genes.
   P.gingivalis-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 and inhibition of
   apoptosis were also impeded by FOXO1 knockdown. Neutralization of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) by N-acetyl-l-cysteine blocked the
   activation of FOXO1 by P.gingivalis and concomitantly suppressed the
   activation of oxidative stress responses, anti-apoptosis programmes and
   IL- production. Inhibition of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) either
   pharmacologically or by siRNA, reduced FOXO1 activation and downstream
   FOXO1-dependent gene regulation in response to P.gingivalis. The results
   indicate that P.gingivalis-induced ROS activate FOXO transcription
   factors through JNK signalling, and that FOXO1 controls oxidative stress
   responses, inflammatory cytokine production and cell survival. These
   data position FOXO as an important signalling node in the epithelial
   cell-P.gingivalis interaction, with particular relevance to cell fate
   and dysbiotic host responses.}},

Title = {{Integrated navigation method of a marine strapdown inertial navigation
   system using a star sensor}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated navigation method of the strapdown
   inertial navigation system (SINS) using a star sensor. According to the
   principle of SINS, its own navigation information contains an error that
   increases with time. Hence, the inertial attitude matrix from the star
   sensor is introduced as the reference information to correct the SINS
   increases error. For the integrated navigation method, the vehicle's
   attitude can be obtained in two ways: one is calculated from SINS; the
   other, which we have called star sensor attitude, is obtained as the
   product between the SINS position and the inertial attitude matrix from
   the star sensor. Therefore, the SINS position error is introduced in the
   star sensor attitude error. Based on the characteristics of star sensor
   attitude error and the mathematical derivation, the SINS navigation
   errors can be obtained by the coupling calculation between the SINS
   attitude and the star sensor attitude. Unlike several current
   techniques, the navigation process of this method is non-radiating and
   invulnerable to jamming. The effectiveness of this approach was
   demonstrated by simulation and experimental study. The results show that
   this integrated navigation method can estimate the attitude error and
   the position error of SINS. Therefore, the SINS navigation accuracy is
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical in the
   environment that exerts potential harm to plants. Phytohormones play
   important roles both in regulating multiple aspects of plant growth and
   in plants' responses to environmental stresses. But how BPA affects
   plant growth by regulating endogenous hormones remains poorly
   understood. Here, we found that treatment with 1.5 mg L-1 BPA improved
   the growth of soybean seedlings, companied by increases in the contents
   of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin (ZT), and decreases in the
   ratios of abscisic acid (ABA)/IAA, ABA/gibberellic acid (GA), ABA/ZT,
   ethylene (ETH)/GA, ETH/IAA, and ETH/ZT. Treatment with higher
   concentrations of BPA (from 3 to 96 mg L-1) inhibited the growth of
   soybean seedlings, meanwhile, decreased the contents of IAA, GA, ZT, and
   ETH, and increased the content of ABA and the ratios of ABA/IAA, ABA/GA,
   ABA/ZT, ETH/GA, ETH/IAA, and ETH/ZT. The increases in the ratios of
   growth and stress hormones were correlated with the increase in the BPA
   content of the roots. Thus, BPA could affect plant growth through
   changing the levels of single endogenous hormone and the ratios of
   growth and stress hormones in the roots because of BPA absorption by the
   roots.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of highly regular, semi-crystalline P3HT (poly
   3-hexylthiophene-2.5-diyl) after thermal nanoimprint is studied and
   compared to that of its amorphous counterpart. Differential scanning
   calorimetry measurements of both materials provide the glass transition
   temperature (below room temperature) as well as the melting temperature
   (T (m) a parts per thousand 235 A degrees C) and the crystallization
   temperature (T (c) a parts per thousand 200 A degrees C) of the
   semi-crystalline polymer. Imprint experiments are performed at
   temperatures below and above the melting temperature of the
   crystallites. The samples imprinted with line structures in the range of
   135-500 nm are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and
   transmission measurements. In agreement with T (m), the investigations
   indicate that the crystallites do not melt when semi-crystalline P3HT is
   imprinted below T (m). After imprint above T (m), no more indication of
   the crystallites is found. Furthermore, physical self-assembly only
   occurred after imprint beyond T (m) with semi-crystalline P3HT,
   indicating a fully amorphous state. The morphology observed-the
   roughness of the surface within partly filled cavities when crystallites
   are present-correlates well with the results from optical measurements.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Detecting communities is significant to understand the potential
   structures and functions of complex systems. In order to detect
   communities more accurately and reasonably, a novel algorithm is
   proposed based on cosine distance and core-node in this paper. Cosine
   distances between nodes are regarded as their similarity measure and
   network node vectors can be extracted directly from the similarity
   matrix without calculating eigenvectors. Core-nodes as the initial
   communities are found by cosine distance threshold and degree threshold.
   Furthermore, the initial communities are expanded by adding other nodes
   with the nearest cosine distance to core-nodes. Through changing degree
   and cosine distance thresholds constantly, the optimal community
   structure of complex networks can be obtained by optimizing modularity
   with high accuracy. Experimental results on both real-world and
   synthetic networks demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing has been an effective and efficient paradigm for providing

   human-machine interaction process. In this paper, we theoretically study
   the quality of labels inferred from crowd workers by majority voting and
   provide an analysis of label quality that shows that the label error
   rate decreases exponentially with the number of workers selected for
   each task. We also study the problem of eliminating low-quality workers
   from the crowd, and provide a conservative condition for eliminating
   low-quality workers without eliminating any non-low-quality worker with
   high probability. We also provide an aggressive condition for
   eliminating all low-quality workers with high probability.}},

Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{428-433}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Triclosan (TCS) is an important broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent
   widely utilized in a range of personal care products, and is therefore
   commonly found in the environment. A few studies have been conducted to
   investigate predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for TCS on
   terrestrial organisms. This could be due to lack of toxicity data
   especially chronic toxicity data for species on various taxonomic
   levels. In the present study, chronic toxicity of TCS on 6 terrestrial
   species (3 dicotyledonous plants, 2 monocotyledonous plants and 1
   terrestrial invertebrate) were tested. PNEC values of TCS based on
   toxicity data of 14 terrestrial species (5 dicotyledonous plants, 4
   monocotyledonous plants and 5 terrestrial invertebrates) from 4 Phyla
   and 11 Families were calculated using the log-logistic species
   sensitivity distribution (SSD) method. The result of our toxicity tests
   showed that the dicotyledonous plant Lactuca sativa was the most
   sensitive species to TCS exposure. The PNEC value for TCS was derived to
   be 0.04-0.21 mg kg(-1) when using the log-logistic SSD method. The use
   of toxicity data from various taxonomic levels is recommended in
   deriving the PNEC value in the terrestrial environment. (C) 2015

   CEOs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT \& ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{705-724}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Why are some newly appointed CEOs dismissed from their positions while
   others are not? Is it hard for newly appointed CEOs to survive in highly
   diversified firms? Drawing upon the concepts of executive job demands
   and information-processing theory, we argue that newly appointed CEOs
   face entirely different degrees of complexity and challenges in their
   role, and that firms' product diversification and international
   diversification predict dismissals of newly appointed CEOs after
   controlling for other possible explanatory variables. Additionally, we
   propose that appointment of a new outsider CEO makes newly appointed
   CEOs more vulnerable to dismissal and consequently strengthens the
   predicted relationships. The empirical results support our arguments.
   These results suggest that the demands faced by a high degree of
   (product or international) diversification are likely to present
   challenges that increase the likelihood of corporate disruption through
   the departures of newly appointed CEOs. Contributions to the CEO
   dismissal and succession literature are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The regional innovation systems (RISs) approach has become influential
   in analysis of innovation processes and the development of public
   policy. Much of the contemporary RIS literature, however, has adopted a
   structural, functional, effectiveness or triple helix analytical
   approach. This study enriches our understanding of RISs in East Asia by
   considering an alternative novel perspective at the RIS level: an
   exploration-exploitation approach. Though often used at the firm-level,
   we argue that it may also provide an alternative lens through which to
   understand the evolution of China's RISs. To this end we construct a
   provincial entropy index and use K-means to categorize provinces into
   explorative, exploitative and balanced RISs and their evolution between
   1986 and 2011. Our findings contribute to the literature on China's RISs
   by illustrating in greater detail the persistence of certain RISs across
   many of China's provinces, as well as the dramatic step changes towards
   exploitative systems in others. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{BK polyomavirus (BKV) is important pathogen for kidney transplant
   recipients, as it is frequently re-activated, leading to nephropathy.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic reconstruction
   and polymorphism of the VP2 gene in BKV isolated from Chinese kidney
   transplant recipients. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out in the VP2
   region from 135 BKV-positive samples and 28 reference strains retrieved
   from Gen Bank. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean
   (UPGMA) grouped all strains into subtypes, but failed to subdivide
   strains into subgroups. Among the plasma and urine samples, all plasma
   (23/23) and 82 urine samples (82/95) were identified to contain subtype
   I; the other 10 urine samples contained subtype IV. A 86-bp fragment was
   identified as a highly conserved sequence. Following alignment with 36
   published BKV sequences from China, 92 sites of polymorphism were
   identified, including 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   prevalent in Chinese individuals and 30 SNPs that were specific to the
   two predominant subtypes I and IV. The limitations of the VP2 gene
   segment in subgrouping were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The
   conserved sequence and polymorphism identified in this study may be
   helpful in the detection and genotyping of BKV.}},

   garment was designed. And a three-dimensional transient heat transfer
   computational fluid dynamics simulation of the test was achieved to gain
   the garment surface temperature. By means of three-dimensional body
   scanner, Geomagic and Gambit software, we developed a method of
   three-dimensional geometrical modeling of the full-scale close-fitting
   clothed manikin. The accuracy of the computational fluid dynamics
   simulation was validated by actual experiments. It was found that the
   average incident heat flux to the exterior of the Nomex (R) IIIA garment
   is not 84kW/m(2), the value measured in nude manikin tests, but the
   value is 11\% lower than it. This will help to set more accurate
   boundary conditions on garment surface in further simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Near-well ultrasonic processing technology is characterized by high
   adaptability, simple operation, low cost and zero pollution. The main
   plugs of oil production include paraffin deposition plug, polymer plug,
   and drilling fluid plug etc. Although some good results have been
   obtained through laboratory experiments and field tests, systematic and
   intensive studies are absent for certain major aspects, such as: effects
   of ultrasonic treatment for different kinds of plugs and whether effect
   of ultrasound-chemicals combination deplugging is better than that of
   ultrasonic deplugging. In this paper, the experiments of removing
   drilling fluid plug, paraffin deposition plug and polymer plug by
   ultrasonic wave, chemical deplugging agent and ultrasound-chemical
   combination deplugging respectively are carried out. Results show that
   the effect of ultrasound-chemical combination deplugging is clearly
   better than that of using ultrasonic wave and chemical deplugging agent
   separately, which indicates that ultrasonic deplugging and chemical
   deplugging can produce synergetic effects. On the one hand, ultrasonic
   treatment can boost the activity of chemical deplugging agent and turn
   chemical deplugging into dynamic chemical process, promoting chemical
   agent reaction speed and enhancing deplugging effect; on the other hand,
   chemical agent can reduce the adhesion strength of plugs so that
   ultrasonic deplugging effect can be improved significantly. Experimental
   results provide important reference for near-well ultrasonic processing
   technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Combined clopidogrel-aspirin treatment for high risk TIA or minor stroke
   does not increase cerebral microbleeds}},
Journal = {{NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To study whether Clopidogrel-Aspirin combined treatment for
   high risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke results in
   increased number of lesions associated with anti-thrombotic cerebral
   haemorrhage or cerebral micro-bleeds (CMB) than aspirin alone treatment.
   Methods: The patients recruited in CHANCE test in our hospital
   participated in this study. We made a comparison between treatments
   Aspirin-Clopidogrel combined group and the Aspirin alone group in the
   numbers of CMB and subsequent cerebral haemorrhages. In addition, we
   analysed the association between the increased numbers of CMB and
   subsequent intracerebral haemorrhages. All 129 patients with high risk
   TIA with microbleeds or minor stroke within 24 hours after the onset
   (average age 65.9 +/- 9.3, 48.7\% were male patients) were divided
   randomly into two groups: (1) 67 patients were given combination therapy
   with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg,
   then 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day
   for the first 21 days);(2) the rest patients were given aspirin
   treatment (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received
   open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75-300 mg on the
   first day.
   Results: The CMB were found in 52.7\% of all patients in both groups.
   There was no siginificant difference between the Aspirin group and the
   Aspirin-clopidogrel treated group, though the latter showed some slight
   increase in CMB (Odds ratios (OR) = 1.16, 95\% confidence intervals (CI)
   = 0.54-2.47, P=0.71). But the numbers of CMB were remarkably associated
   with the number of primary existing CMB (OR=6.46, 95\% CI 2.57-16.23,
   P<0.001), especially that of primary existing CMB >= 3. In addition, the
   increasing numbers of CMB associated with primary CMB lesions, which
   located in corticosubcortical area (CSC) (OR=4.69, 95\% CI 1.51-14.53,
   P=0.007).
   Conclusions: For the treatment of high-risk TIA or minor stroke
   patients, the clopidogrel-aspirin treatment did not increase the number
   of CMB than Aspirin alone. It appears that the extent of CMB was
   associated with the extent of existing CMB occurred in previous stroke,
   which was mostly located in cortical, subcortical zone.}},

Title = {{Trilateral constrained sparse representation for Kinect depth hole
   filling}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to measurement errors or interference noise, Kinect depth maps
   exhibit severe defects of holes and noise, which significantly affect
   their applicability to stereo visions. Filtering and inpainting
   techniques have been extensively applied to hole filling. However, they
   either fail to fill in large holes or introduce other artifacts near
   depth discontinuities, such as blurring, jagging, and ringing. The
   emerging reconstruction-based methods employ underlying regularized
   representation models to obtain relatively accurate combination
   coefficients, leading to improved depth recovery results. Sparse
   representation facilitates retaining the saliency features of natural
   images and is thus more favorite than other regression models in image
   restoration, e.g. ridge regression. However, its naive applicability to
   depth map recovery hardly affords satisfactory depth prediction.
   Motivated by locality learning and bilateral filtering, this paper
   advocates a trilateral constrained sparse representation for Kinect
   depth recovery, which considers the constraints of intensity similarity
   and spatial distance between reference patches and target one on
   sparsity penalty term, as well as position constraint of centroid pixel
   in the target patch on data-fidelity term. Learning from the accompanied
   color image, this method can produce optimal solution to hole-filling
   problem in terms of depth prediction accuracy. Various experimental
   results on real-world Kinect maps and public datasets show that the
   proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in filling effects
   of both flat and discontinuous regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The thermoelectromotive force due to the Seebeck effect is governed by
   the Seebeck coefficient of the thermoelectric circuit and the
   temperature gradient in the circuit. Thus for enhancing the
   thermoelectromotive force, not only selecting the materials but also
   inducing a large temperature gradient in a small space is very important
   in order to realize an efficient space-saving thermoelectric device.
   This paper describes a method by which the thermoelectric circuits can
   be fabricated by joining metallic microwires with Joule heat. Minor
   metal-free, Fe and Al microwires with diameters of 100 gm and various
   lengths were used in the circuits, and the effect of the wire length on
   the thermoelectromotive force developed in the circuit was investigated.
   We observed the Seebeck effect in the circuit by controlling the
   temperature gradient in the circuit. It was found that the temperature
   at each end of the microwire depended on the temperature at the high
   temperature end and the wire length. We describe this phenomenon with a
   heat conduction model and analyze the dependency of the temperature
   gradient on the wire length. Finally, we were able to estimate the
   suitable length of the microwires for getting the largest
   thermoelectromotive force in the smallest possible space. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, isolated involvement of
   the brainstem is rare. In addition, there have been a few reports
   describing a concomitant occurrence of stroke and a brainstem variant of
   posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. We here report a patient
   with isolated pontine involvement of posterior reversible encephalopathy
   syndrome accompanied by fresh ischemic cerebral infarction in the left
   corona radiata detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging. Follow-up
   brain magnetic resonance imaging on hospital day 14 showed a marked
   improvement of signal changes in the pons; however, cerebral infarction
   in the left corona radiata enlarged despite medical treatment. Although

Abstract = {{This article first outlines definitions and descriptions of key terms
   that will be used in the discussions that follow including osmolarity,
   osmolality, osmotic and oncotic pressure. The physicochemical properties
   of water, ions and organic molecules are discussed in terms of their
   biological roles. Similarly, the interactions of amphipathic molecules
   and their three-dimensional structures in aqueous and non-aqueous
   environments are then explored. The movement of solutes and solvents
   across semipermeable membranes is considered and an assessment is made
   of the contribution of such mechanisms to normal physiology. Firstly,
   simple diffusion is described, followed by comparisons with facilitated
   diffusion and energy-dependent active transport focusing on the
   differences in kinetics and rate-limiting factors arising as a result.
   The mechanisms underlying Gibbs-Donnan equilibria are discussed, with
   particular emphasis as to how they arise across a selectively permeable
   membrane by way of a worked example. The equilibrium of forces
   influencing fluid movements across the capillary endothelium, known as
   Starling forces, is then described. Comparisons are made between the
   classic model as first proposed by Starling in 1896 and the modified
   glycocalyx model, which has developed over the past 25 years. Finally,
   the impact of these differences on our understanding of trans-capillary
   fluid flux is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Palau, similar to other Pacific island countries, is currently highly
   burdened with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The WHO STEPS was
   launched in 2011 to comprehensively survey indicators for NCDs in the
   country. This paper aims to describe the prevalence of key NCD risk
   factors assessed by the survey. The WHO instrument, including
   behavioral, physical and biochemical measurements, was adopted to the
   nationwide survey for all residents aged 25 to 64 years. A cluster-based
   sampling method was performed to obtain a national representative data.
   Valid data from 2,184 individuals were selected for the analyses, of
   which 75\% were Palauans and 19\% were Filipinos. Prevalence of current
   cigarette smoking was 25\% in men and 10\% in women. Betel nut chewing
   with tobacco was prevalent particularly among Palauans (58\% in men,
   69\% in women) compared to the other ethnic groups. In terms of all
   types of tobacco use, 60\% of men and 58\% of women were current users.
   Overweight or obesity was very common among Palauans (84\% in men, 86\%
   in women) as well as Filipinos (52\% in men, 40\% in women).
   Hypertension was found in 55\% of men and 49\% of women, with the stage
   2 hypertension being 21\% and 19\%, respectively. The prevalence of
   diabetic level hyperglycemia was more than 20\%. Raised total
   cholesterol was detected in 16\% of men and 20\% of women. This survey
   revealed an alarmingly high prevalence of NCD risk factors, especially
   tobacco use, obesity, hypertension and raised blood glucose. The data
   would be useful baseline information to develop effective NCD strategies
   in Palau.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on early findings from a low-income energy
   efficiency programme, get bill smart (GBS). The project trials a
   community-partnership approach to supporting low-income households to
   pursue energy savings and comfort improvements in their home. In our
   discussion, we examine the role of community action in facilitating
   improvements to the indoor built environment. Here, we reflect on the
   challenges and opportunities that have arisen in seeking to build
   community-capacity in a disadvantaged community. We observe that: the
   project design was effective in facilitating local ownership; its
   objectives did align with local priorities; and there was some
   translation of energy saving messages. However, challenges were
   encountered with facilitating the emergence of leadership and an ongoing
   community network around affordable warmth and energy use. While a
   temporary network has emerged through the delivery of GBS, early
   insights from the project indicate that, on balance, there are more
   inhibitors rather than facilitators of this outcome within the
   neighbourhood. Tipping this balance may require further investment and
   support beyond the project parameters.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{123-134}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Global climate impact studies with crop models suggest that including
   nitrogen and water limitation causes greater negative climate change
   impacts on actual yields compared to water-limitation only. We simulated
   water limited and nitrogen water limited yields across the EU-27 to 2050
   for six key crops with the SIMPLACE<LINTUL5, DRUNIR, HEAT> model to
   assess how important consideration of nitrogen limitation is in climate
   impact studies for European cropping systems. We further investigated
   how crop nitrogen use may change under future climate change scenarios.
   Our results suggest that inclusion of nitrogen limitation hardly changed
   crop yield response to climate for the spring-sown crops considered
   (grain maize, potato, and sugar beet). However, for winter-sown crops
   (winter barley, winter rapeseed and winter wheat), simulated impacts to
   2050 were more negative when nitrogen limitation was considered,
   especially with high levels of water stress. Future nitrogen use rates
   are likely to decrease due to climate change for spring-sown crops,
   largely in parallel with their yields. These results imply that climate
   change impact studies for winter-sown crops should consider
   N-fertilization. Specification of future N fertilization rates is a
   methodological challenge that is likely to need integrated assessment
   models to address. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional modeling of ionized gas Spectral energy distributions
   of massive and very massive stars in stationary and time-dependent
   modeling of the ionization of metals in H II regions}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{583}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context, tiff regions play a crucial role in the measurement of the
   chemical composition of the interstellar medium and provide fundamental
   data about element abundances that constrain models of galactic chemical
   evolution. Discrepancies that still exist between observed emission line
   strengths and those predicted by nebular models can be partly attributed
   to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources of ionizing
   radiation used in the models as well as to simplifying assumptions made
   in nebular modeling.
   Aims. One of the main influences on the nebular spectra is the
   metallicity, both nebular and stellar, which shows large variations even
   among nearby galaxies. Although nebular modeling often involves testing
   of different nebular metallicities against their influence on the
   predicted spectra, adequate grids of stellar atmospheres and realistic
   SEDs for different metallicities are still lacking. This is unfortunate
   because the influence of stellar metallicity on nebular line strength
   ratios, via its effect on the SEDs, is of similar importance as
   variations in the nebular metallicity. To overcome this deficiency we
   have computed a grid of model atmosphere SEDs for massive and very
   massive O-type stars covering a range of metallicities from
   significantly subsolar (0.1 Z(circle dot)) to supersolar (2 Z(circle
   dot)).
   Methods. The SEDs have been computed using a state-of-the-art model
   atmosphere code that takes into account the attenuation of the ionizing
   flux by the spectral lines of all important elements and the
   hydrodynamics of the radiatively driven winds and their influence on the
   SEDs. For the assessment of the SEDs in nebular simulations we have
   developed a (heretofore not available) 3D radiative transfer code that
   includes a time-dependent treatment of the metal ionization.
   Results. Using the SEDs in both ID and 3D nebular models we explore the
   relative influence of stellar metallicity, gas metallicity, and
   inhomogeneity of the gas on the nebular ionization structure and
   emission line strengths. We find that stellar and gas metallicity are of
   similar importance for establishing the line strength ratios commonly
   used in nebular diagnostics, whereas inhomogeneity of the gas has only a
   subordinate influence on the global line emission.
   Conclusions. Nebular diagnostics as a quantitative tool for measuring
   the abundances in the interstellar gas can be used to its full potential
   only when the influence of SEDs, metallicity, and geometric structure of
   the nebula are taken into account. For these purposes, detailed stellar
   SEDs like those of our grid are an essential ingredient for the
   photoionization models used to predict nebular emission line spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Protein self-association or aggregation is a property of significant
   concern for biopharmaceutical products due to the potential ability of
   aggregates to cause adverse toxicological and immunological effects.
   Thus, during the development of a protein biopharmaceutical, it is
   important to detect and quantify the level and nature of aggregate
   species as early as possible in order to make well-informed decisions
   and to mitigate and control potential risks. Although a deeper
   understanding of the mechanism of aggregation (i.e., protein-protein
   interactions) is desirable, such detailed assessment is not always
   necessary from a biopharmaceutical process development point of view. In
   fact, the scope of characterization efforts is often focused on
   achieving a well-controlled process, which generates a product that
   reliably meets established acceptance criteria for safety and efficacy.
   In this brief note, we evaluated the utility of size-exclusion
   chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and analytical
   ultracentrifugation in their simplest forms, to effectively reveal and
   confirm the presence of concentration-dependent reversible
   self-association (RSA) in a monoclonal antibody in the early stages of
   formulation development. Using these techniques, we also initiated
   preliminary work aimed at reducing the occurrence of this RSA behavior
   by varying the pH of the formulation buffer. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of our study was to assess the clinical and obstetric
   outcomes of laparoscopic surgeries performed during advanced pregnancy
   compared to those performed in early pregnancy.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed all cases of patients who underwent
   laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy in our institution between 1996
   and 2013.
   Results We reviewed cases of 117 pregnant women who underwent
   laparoscopic surgery during the study period. There were no conversions
   to laparotomy. 71 surgeries were performed in the first trimester (group
   1, mean gestational age 7.7 +/- 1.9 weeks) and 46 were performed in the
   second and third trimesters (group 2, mean gestational age 18.1 +/- 4.3
   weeks). More patients in group 1 underwent surgery for suspected adnexal
   torsion (p < 0.001), while more patients in group 2 underwent surgery
   for presumptive cholecystitis (p = 0.014) and persistent ovarian mass (p
   = 0.011). The interval between admission and surgery differed
   significantly between the groups and was longer in group 2 compared to
   group 1 (18.2 +/- 24.0 vs. 6.8 +/- 10.6 h, p = 0.001). No difference was
   found between the two groups regarding surgical complications,
   histopathological findings and pregnancy outcomes.
   Conclusion In our experience, laparoscopic surgery in advanced pregnancy
   was found to be feasible and safe as in early pregnancy, without any
   adverse effects on pregnancy outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently
   identified specific lung cancer susceptibility regions. We evaluated the
   lung cancer-predictive performance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in these regions.
   Methods: Lung cancer cases (N = 778) and controls (N = 1166) were
   genotyped for 77 SNPs located in GWAS-identified lung cancer
   susceptibility regions. Variable selection and model development used
   stepwise logistic regression and decision-tree analyses. In a subset
   nested in the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study, change in area under the
   receiver operator characteristic curve and net reclassification
   improvement were used to compare predictions made by risk factor models
   with and without genetic variables.
   Results: Variable selection and model development kept two SNPs in each
   of three GWAS regions, rs2736100 and rs7727912 in 5p15.33, rs805297 and
   rs1802127 in 6p21.33, and rs8034191 and rs12440014 in 15q25.1. The ratio
   of cases to controls was three times higher among subjects with a
   high-risk genotype in every one as opposed to none of the three GWAS
   regions (odds ratio, 3.14; 95\% confidence interval, 2.02-4.88; adjusted
   for sex, age, and pack-years). Adding a three-level classified count of
   GWAS regions with high-risk genotypes to an age and smoking risk
   factor-only model improved lung cancer prediction by a small amount:
   area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.725 versus
   0.717 (p = 0.056); overall net reclassification improvement was 0.052
   across low-, intermediate-, and high- 6-year lung cancer risk categories
   (<3.0\%, 3.0\%-4.9\%, 5.0\%).
   Conclusion: Specifying genotypes for SNPs in three GWAS-identified
   susceptibility regions improved lung cancer prediction, but probably by
   an extent too small to affect disease control practice.}},

Title = {{An integrated optimisation approach to airport ground operations to
   foster sustainability in the aviation sector}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{With increasing air traffic, rising fuel costs and tighter environmental
   targets, efficient airport ground operations are one of the key aspects
   towards sustainable air transportation. This complex system includes
   elements such as ground movement, runway scheduling and ground services.
   Previously, these problems were treated in isolation since information,
   such as landing time, pushback time and aircraft ground position, are
   held by different stakeholders with sometimes conflicting interests and,
   normally, are not shared. However, as these problems are interconnected,
   solutions as a result of isolated optimisation may achieve the objective
   of one problem but fail in the objective of the other one, missing the
   global optimum eventually. Potentially more energy and economic costs
   are thus required. In order to apply a more systematic and holistic
   view, this paper introduces a multi-objective integrated optimisation
   problem incorporating the newly proposed Active Routing concept. Built
   with systematic perspectives, this new model combines several elements:
   scheduling and routing of aircraft, 4-Dimensional Trajectory (4DT)
   optimisation, runway scheduling and airport bus scheduling. A holistic
   economic optimisation framework is also included to support the decision
   maker to select the economically optimal solution from a Pareto front of
   technically optimal solutions. To solve this problem, a multi-objective
   genetic algorithm is adopted and tested on real data from an
   international hub airport. Preliminary results show that the proposed
   approach is able to provide a systematic framework so that airport
   efficiency, environmental assessment and economic analysis could all be
   explicitly optimised. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wood has better load-bearing capacity following the formation of a char

   The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of factors,
   including density, gas permeability, ring width, grain orientation, and
   heat flux, on the charring rate. The charring rates of six Chinese woods
   were tested with a cone calorimeter with densities of 0.35 to 0.69
   g/cm(3) and moisture contents of approximately 12\%. The results
   indicated that density, gas permeability, and heat flux, but not the
   grain orientation, significantly affected the charring rate. There was a
   positive, linear correlation between the heat flux and the charring
   rate. The density was nearly linearly related to the charring rate for
   either softwood or hardwood; the correlation was not found for all
   woods. The positive, linear correlation between the gas permeability and
   the charring rate was only found along the grain.}},

   metaled derivatives porphyrins Zn-TPyP and Zn-TMPP respectively, were
   studied in homogeneous and micro heterogeneous systems, comprising
   nanostructured Pluronic (R) copolymeric micellar systems, as a promising
   drug delivery systems for the porphyrins investigated. Physico-chemical
   properties such as, hydrophobicity degree, self-aggregation in solvents
   of different polarities and water/ethanol mixtures (monofasic binary),
   as well as kinetics profile and isotherm binding, molecular
   organization, Phi(Fl) and relative localization in neutral micellar
   systems. The hydrophobic character was the key to relative drug location
   in the micellar systems. In homogenous solvents systems the porphyrins
   presented relatively high values of molar absorptivity and low values of
   Phi(Fl). The K-b values obtained are modulated by the structure of
   porphyrins, state of aggregation, as well as, structure and macro
   molecular self-organization of copolymers. Fluorescence quenching
   studies have shown that porphyrins in F-127 are located in a less
   hydrophobic region than the porphyrins in P-123, which are located
   preferentially in a deeper micellar microenvironment. The zinc
   porphyrins showed high values of K-b. Thus, the association of the
   porphyrins with specific binding sites of micellar systems is strongly
   modulated by the presence of the metal coordinated to the porphyrinic
   ring.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial leakage effects are particularly confounding for seed-based
   investigations of brain networks using source-level
   electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Various
   methods designed to avoid this issue have been introduced but are
   limited to particular assumptions about its temporal characteristics.
   Here, we investigate the usefulness of a model-based geometric
   correction scheme (GCS) to suppress spatial leakage emanating from the
   seed location. We analyze its properties theoretically and then assess
   potential advantages and limitations with simulated and experimental MEG
   data (resting state and auditory-motor task). To do so, we apply Minimum
   Norm Estimation (MNE) for source reconstruction and use variation of
   error parameters, statistical gauging of spatial leakage correction and
   comparison with signal orthogonalization. Results show that the GCS has
   a local (i.e., near the seed) effect only, in line with the geometry of
   MNE spatial leakage, and is able to map spatially all types of brain
   interactions, including linear correlations eliminated after signal
   orthogonalization. Furthermore, it is robust against the introduction of
   forward model errors. On the other hand, the GCS can be affected by
   local overcorrection effects and seed mislocation. These issues arise
   with signal orthogonalization too, although significantly less
   extensively, so the two approaches complement each other. The GCS thus
   appears to be a valuable addition to the spatial leakage correction
   toolkits for seed-based FC analyses in source-projected MEG/EEG data.

Abstract = {{BackgroundActinic keratosis (AK) is a frequent health condition
   attributable to chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Several
   treatment options are available and evidence based guidelines are
   missing.
   ObjectivesThe goal of these evidence- and consensus-based guidelines was
   the development of treatment recommendations appropriate for different
   subgroups of patients presenting with AK. A secondary aim of these
   guidelines was the implementation of knowledge relating to the clinical
   background of AK, including consensus-based recommendations for the
   histopathological definition, diagnosis and the assessment of patients.
   MethodsThe guidelines development followed a pre-defined and structured
   process. For the underlying systematic literature review of
   interventions for AK, the methodology suggested by the Cochrane Handbook
   for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, the Preferred Reporting Items
   for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Grading
   of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
   methodology was adapted. All recommendations were consented during a
   consensus conference using a formal consensus methodology. Strength of
   recommendations was expressed based on the GRADE approach. If expert
   opinion without external evidence was incorporated into the reasoning
   for making a certain recommendation, the rationale was provided. The
   Guidelines underwent open public review and approval by the
   commissioning societies.
   ResultsVarious interventions for the treatment of AK have been assessed
   for their efficacy. The consenting procedure led to a treatment
   algorithm as shown in the guidelines document. Based on expert
   consensus, the present guidelines present recommendations on the
   classification of patients, diagnosis and histopathological definition
   of AK. Details on the methods and results of the systematic literature
   review and guideline development process have been published separately.
   ConclusionsInternational guidelines are intended to be adapted to
   national or regional circumstances (regulatory approval, availability
   and reimbursement of treatments).}},

Abstract = {{The search for traces of life is one of the principal objectives of Mars
   exploration. Central to this objective is the concept of habitability,
   the set of conditions that allows the appearance of life and successful
   establishment of microorganisms in any one location. While environmental
   conditions may have been conducive to the appearance of life early in
   martian history, habitable conditions were always heterogeneous on a
   spatial scale and in a geological time frame. This punctuated scenario
   of habitability would have had important consequences for the evolution
   of martian life, as well as for the presence and preservation of traces
   of life at a specific landing site. We hypothesize that, given the lack
   of long-term, continuous habitability, if martian life developed, it was
   (and may still be) chemotrophic and anaerobic. Obtaining nutrition from
   the same kinds of sources as early terrestrial chemotrophic life and
   living in the same kinds of environments, the fossilized traces of the
   latter serve as useful proxies for understanding the potential
   distribution of martian chemotrophs and their fossilized traces. Thus,
   comparison with analog, anaerobic, volcanic terrestrial environments
   (Early Archean >3.5-3.33Ga) shows that the fossil remains of chemotrophs
   in such environments were common, although sparsely distributed, except
   in the vicinity of hydrothermal activity where nutrients were readily
   available. Moreover, the traces of these kinds of microorganisms can be
   well preserved, provided that they are rapidly mineralized and that the
   sediments in which they occur are rapidly cemented. We evaluate the
   biogenicity of these signatures by comparing them to possible abiotic
   features. Finally, we discuss the implications of different scenarios
   for life on Mars for detection by in situ exploration, ranging from its
   non-appearance, through preserved traces of life, to the presence of
   living microorganisms. Key Words: MarsEarly EarthAnaerobic

Abstract = {{{[}Purpose] This research aimed to investigate the relationship between
   aerobic capacity (VO2,peak) and cardiovascular risk factors in
   normolipidemic and dyslipidemic Thai men and women. {[}Subjects and
   Methods] We recruited 104 dyslipidemic and 100 healthy participants.
   Fasting blood samples were analyzed for lipid and blood glucose levels.
   Anthropometry, blood pressure, and body composition were measured before
   exercise. Each subject underwent exercise testing to determine VO2,peak.
   Heart rate (HR) was recorded throughout the exercise test. {[}Results]
   Dyslipidemic participants had a lower VO2,peak than normolipidemic
   participants (p<0.01). In normolipidemic male participants, VO2,peak was
   positively correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
   levels and negatively correlated with low density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol
   (TG/HDL-C) ratios; in females, VO2,peak was negatively correlated with
   age, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. In dyslipidemic males, VO2,peak was
   positively correlated with HDL-C levels and negatively correlated with
   age, LDL-C and TG levels, and percent body fat; in females, VO2,peak was
   positively correlated with resting HR and heart rate recovery and
   negatively correlated with age, TG/HDL-C, and waist circumference.
   {[}Conclusion] There was a relationship between aerobic capacity and
   cardiovascular disease risk factors in both normolipidemic and
   dyslipidemic participants. This relationship was affected by gender.}},

   and sensitivity advantage of a low-power RF scheme using UFMAS and a
   small sample coil are summarized for CPMAS-based experiments. Our 1D
   C-13 CPMAS experiments for uniformly C-13- and 15N-labeled alanine
   demonstrated that the sensitivity per given sample amount obtained at
   viz of 100 kHz and a H-1 NMR frequency (vH) of 750.1 MHz is similar to
   10 fold higher than that of a traditional CPMAS experiment obtained at
   nu(R) of 20 kHz and nu(H) of 400.2 MHz. A comparison of different
   1H-decoupling schemes in CPMAS at nu(R) of 100 kHz for the same sample
   demonstrated that low-power WALTZ-16 decoupling unexpectedly displayed
   superior performance over traditional low-power schemes designed for
   SSNMR such as TPPM and XiX in a range of decoupling field strengths of
   5-20 kHz. Excellent 1H decoupling performance of WALTZ-16 was confirmed
   on a protein microcrystal sample of GB1 at viz of 80 kHz. We also
   discuss the feasibility of a SSNMR microanalysis of a GB1 protein sample
   in a scale of 1 nmol to 80 nmol by H-1-detected 2D N-15/H-1 SSNMR by a
   synergetic use of a high field, a low-power RF scheme, a
   paramagnetic-assisted condensed data collection (PACC), and UFMAS. (C)

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation into the mechanism of streamwise vorticity
   generation in an array of plasma streamwise vortex generators is
   presented. The array is flush mounted to a flat plate on which a
   nominally zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer develops
   upstream. The investigation is focused on characterization of the
   influence of freestream velocity, applied peak-to-peak voltage, length
   of the active electrode, and spanwise interelectrode spacing on
   streamwise vorticity generation. It is shown that the actuator creates
   wall-normal vorticity and reorients it into the streamwise direction. In
   addition, spanwise boundary-layer vorticity is reoriented into the
   streamwise direction. Scaling relations based on the vorticity transport
   equation are obtained and experimentally validated. These provide
   guidance for optimizing the actuators for particular flow control
   applications.}},

Title = {{Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates MGMT gene expression in cancer and
   inhibition of Wnt signalling prevents chemoresistance}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine- DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is
   commonly overexpressed in cancers and is implicated in the development
   of chemoresistance. The use of drugs inhibiting MGMT has been hindered
   by their haematologic toxicity and inefficiency. As a different strategy
   to inhibit MGMT we investigated cellular regulators of MGMT expression
   in multiple cancers. Here we show a significant correlation between Wnt
   signalling and MGMT expression in cancers with different origin and
   confirm the findings by bioinformatic analysis and immunofluorescence.
   We demonstrate Wnt-dependent MGMT gene expression and cellular
   co-localization between active beta-catenin and MGMT. Pharmacological or
   genetic inhibition of Wnt activity downregulates MGMT expression and
   restores chemosensitivity of DNA-alkylating drugs in mouse models. These
   findings have potential therapeutic implications for chemoresistant
   cancers, especially of brain tumours where the use of temozolomide is
   frequently used in treatment.}},

   accommodate the medical necessity for a legal term and uniform
   regulation of all hematopoietic stem cell products, given that the
   German Medicinal Products Act specifies different quality standards and
   import regulations for stem cells derived from blood as opposed to
   tissues, such as bonemarrow. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells
   derived from peripheral blood and cord blood are regulated by the German
   Transfusion Act while hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow are
   classified as tissues and are thus regulated by the German
   Transplantation Act. There is also an urgent need for implementation of

Abstract = {{Background: For severely obese patients, bariatric surgery has been
   recommended as an effective therapy.
   Objectives: The Bariataric Surgery and Education (BaSE) study aimed to
   assess the efficacy of a videoconferencing-based psychoeducational group
   intervention in patients after bariatric surgery.
   Setting: The BaSE study is a randomized, controlled multicenter clinical
   trial involving 117 patients undergoing bariatric surgery (mean
   preoperative body mass index {[}BMI] 49.9 kg/m(2), SD 6.4). Patients
   were enrolled between May 2009 and November 2012 and were randomly
   assigned to receive either conventional postsurgical visits or, in
   addition, a videoconferencing-based 1-year group program.
   Methods: Primary outcome measures were weight in kilograms,
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and general self-efficacy (GSE).
   Secondary outcome measures were depression symptoms and eating behavior.
   Results: 94\% of the patients completed the study. Mean weight loss for
   all patients was 45.9 kg (SD 16.4) 1 year after surgery (mean excess
   weight loss {[}EWL] 63\%). Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no
   differences in weight loss, EWL, HRQOL, or self-efficacy between study
   groups at 1 year after surgery. However, patients with clinically
   significant depression symptoms (CSD) at baseline assigned to the
   intervention group (n = 29) had a significantly better HRQOL (P = .03),
   lower depression scores (P = .02), and a trend for a better EWL (.06) 1
   year after surgery compared with the control group (n = 20).
   Conclusion: We could not prove the efficacy of the group program for the
   whole study sample. However, results indicate that the intervention is
   effective for the important subgroup of patients with CSD.}},

Abstract = {{The human aptitude for imitation and social learning underpins our
   advanced cultural practices. While social learning is a valuable
   evolutionary survival strategy, blind copying does not necessarily
   facilitate survival. Copying from the majority allows individuals to
   make rapid judgments on the value of a trait, based on its frequency.
   This is known as the majority bias: an individual's tendency to copy the
   behavior elicited by the largest number of individuals in a population.
   An alternative approach is to follow those who are the most proficient.
   While there is evidence that children do show both processes, no study
   has directly pitted them against each other. To do this, in the current

Abstract = {{Objective - To describe the effects of suspected synthetic cannabinoid
   (SC) toxicosis and the response to intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE)
   therapy in a dog.
   Case summary - A 2-year-8-month-old male Boxer dog was evaluated at an
   emergency hospital for progressive ataxia and inappropriate mentation.
   The initial physical examination identified marked hypothermia (32.7
   degrees C {[}90.9 degrees F]), intermittent sinus bradycardia (60/min),
   stuporous mentation with intermittent aggression, and severe ataxia.
   Neurologic status deteriorated to comatose mentation within 2 hours of
   presentation. The initial diagnostic evaluation (eg, CBC, serum
   biochemistry profile, venous blood gas, and electrolyte determination)
   revealed a respiratory acidosis and thrombocytopenia. The owner reported
   that the dog was exposed to an SC containing Damiana leaf, Marshmallow
   leaf, and Athaea leaves. Initial treatment included IV fluids and
   supplemental oxygen. Mechanical ventilation was provided due to
   hypoventilation and periods of apnea. Intravenous lipid emulsion therapy
   was administered as a bolus (1.5 mL/kg) and continued as a continuous
   rate infusion (0.5 mL/kg/h) for a total of 6 hours. The dog became
   rousable and was weaned from mechanical ventilation approximately 15
   hours following presentation. The dogwas eating andwalking with no
   ataxia, had a normal mentation at approximately 33 hours following
   presentation, and was discharged home at that time. Communication with
   the owners 5 days following discharge revealed that the dog was
   apparently normal.
   New or Unique Information Provided - Based on this case and other
   reports in the literature regarding human exposures, SC ingestion may
   result in more severe clinical signs than marijuana ingestion in dogs.
   Significant clinical intervention may be necessary. Intravenous lipid
   emulsion treatment may be beneficial due to the lipophilicity of SC.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature (30-200 degrees C) drift characteristics of mobile ions
   in PECVD SiNx films and solar cells were determined for the first time
   using a non-contact ion-drift spectrometry technique adopted from
   silicon integrated circuit (IC) metrology. The results demonstrate drift
   of Na+ ions in PECVD SiNx films that begin at temperatures as low as 50
   degrees C. This is a seemingly contrasting behavior as compared to SiNx
   films used in microelectronics where it provides excellent protection as
   a diffusion barrier. The present study was carried out on SiNx films and
   final solar cells intentionally contaminated with Na, K, and Cu. In
   non-contact ion-drift spectrometry an electric field across the
   dielectric is created by charge deposited on the dielectric surface with
   a corona discharge in air. Temperature stress is applied by ramping the
   temperature with time at a controlled rate. Ion drift decreases the
   dielectric voltage that is monitored with a vibrating Kelvin-probe.
   Voltage versus time, voltage versus temperature, and corresponding
   derivative characteristics are used to quantify drift velocity, ion
   concentration and drift activation energy. The latter produces
   characteristic ion peaks in the derivative spectra dV/dT versus
   temperature. The metrology version for mobile ion mapping is based on
   whole-wafer corona bias-temperature stress at selected temperatures
   corresponding to drift of different ions. The mapping is a powerful
   means for ion source identification, such as Na from cell encapsulation
   glass. It shall prove advantageous for further clarification of the role
   of Na in potential induced degradation (PID) effects i.e. the
   polarization effect and the potential induced shunting (PIS). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical
   efficacy of continuous low-dose temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy for
   recurrent and TMZ-refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and to study
   the relationship between its efficacy and microvessel density within the
   tumor.
   Methods : Thirty patients who had recurrent GBM following Stupp's
   regimen received TMZ daily at 50 mg/m(2)/day until tumor progression
   between 2007 and 2013. The median duration of continuous low-dose TMZ
   administration was 8 weeks (range, 2-64).
   Results : The median progression-free survival (PFS) of continuous
   low-dose TMZ therapy was 2 months (range, 0.5-16). At 6 months, PFS was
   20\%. The median overall survival (OS) from the start of this therapy to
   death was 6 months (95\% CI : 5.1-6.9). Microvessel density of recurrent
   tumor tissues obtained by reoperation of 17 patients was 22.7 +/-
   24.1/mm(2) (mean +/- standard deviation), and this was lower than that
   of the initial tumor (61.4 +/- 32.7/mm(2)) (p-value=0.001). It suggests
   that standard TMZ-chemoradiotherapy reduces the microvessel density
   within GBM and that recurrences develop in tumor cells with low
   metabolic burden. The efficacy of continuous low-dose TMZ could not be
   expected in recurrent GBM cells in poor angiogenic environments.
   Conclusion : The efficacy of continuous low-dose TMZ chemotherapy is
   marginal. This study suggests the need to develop further treatment
   strategies for recurrent and TMZ-refractory GBM.}},

   and antigens to provide a vital method for biomolecule detection at low
   concentrations. Developers and practitioners of immunoassays have long
   known that nonspecific binding often restricts immunoassay limits of
   quantification (LOQs). Aside from non-specific binding, most efforts by
   analytical chemists to reduce the LOQ for these techniques have focused
   on improving the signal amplification methods and minimizing the
   limitations of the detection system. However, with detection technology
   now capable of sensing single-fluorescence molecules, this approach is
   unlikely to lead to dramatic improvements in the future. Here,
   fundamental interactions based on the law of mass action are
   analytically connected to signal generation, replacing the four-and
   five-parameter fittings commercially used to approximate sigmoidal
   immunoassay curves and allowing quantitative consideration of
   nonspecific binding and statistical limitations in order to understand
   the ultimate detection capabilities of immunoassays. The restrictions
   imposed on limits of quantification by instrumental noise, non-specific
   binding, and counting statistics are discussed based on equilibrium
   relations for a sandwich immunoassay. Understanding the maximal
   capabilities of immunoassays for each of these regimes can greatly
   assist in the development and evaluation of immunoassay platforms. While
   many studies suggest that single molecule detection is possible through
   immunoassay techniques, here, it is demonstrated that the fundamental
   limit of quantification (precision of 10\% or better) for an immunoassay
   is approximately 131 molecules and this limit is based on fundamental
   and unavoidable statistical limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol is a common solvent used with mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells
   in protocols to test chemicals for evidence of developmental toxicity.
   In this study, dose-response relationships for ethanol toxicity in mES
   cells were examined. For cells maintained in an undifferentiated state,
   ethanol significantly reduced viable cell numbers with estimated half
   maximal inhibitory concentrations of 1.5\% and 0.8\% ethanol after 24
   and 48 h, respectively, observations which correlated with significantly
   increased expression of apoptotic markers. For cells cultured to induce
   cardiomyocyte formation, up to 0.5\% ethanol during the first two days
   failed to alter the outcome of differentiation, whereas 0.3\% ethanol
   for 11 days significantly reduced the fraction of cultures containing
   contracting areas, an observation that correlated with significantly
   reduced cell numbers. These results suggest that ethanol is not an inert
   solvent at concentrations that might be used for developmental toxicity
   testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We are describing best practices and assessment strategies for the
   atomic interpretation of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps.
   Multiscale numerical geometry strategies in the Situs package and in
   secondary structure detection software are currently evolving due to the
   recent increases in cryo-EM resolution. Criteria that aim to predict the
   accuracy of fitted atomic models at low (worse than 8 angstrom) and
   medium (4-8 angstrom) resolutions remain challenging. However, a high
   level of confidence in atomic models can be achieved by combining such
   criteria. The observed errors are due to map-model discrepancies and due
   to the effect of imperfect global docking strategies. Extending the
   earlier motion capture approach developed for flexible fitting, we use
   simulated fiducials (pseudoatoms) at varying levels of coarse-graining
   to track the local drift of structural features. We compare three
   tracking approaches: naive vector quantization, a smoothly deformable
   model, and a tessellation of the structure into rigid Voronoi cells,
   which are fitted using a multi-fragment refinement approach. The lowest
   error is an upper bound for the (small) discrepancy between the crystal
   structure and the EM map due to different conditions in their structure
   determination. When internal features such as secondary structures are
   visible in medium-resolution EM maps, it is possible to extend the idea
   of point-based fiducials to more complex geometric representations such
   as helical axes, strands, and skeletons. We propose quantitative
   strategies to assess map-model pairs when such secondary structure
   patterns are prominent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the cost-effectiveness of different screening intervals

   general clinical setting.A cost-effectiveness model was developed to

   with diabetes. Different DR screening programs were modeled to project
   economic outcomes. To develop the economic model, we calibrated the
   progression rates of DR that fit Chinese epidemiologic data derived from
   the published literature. Costs were estimated from the perspective of
   the Chinese healthcare system, and the analysis was run over a lifetime
   horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
   Total costs, vision outcomes, costs per quality-adjusted life year
   (QALY), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of screening
   strategies compared to no screening.DR screening is effective in Chinese
   patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, and screen strategies with 4-year
   intervals were cost-effective (ICER <\$7,485 per QALY) compared to no
   screening. Screening every 4 years produced the greatest increase in
   QALYs (11.066) among the cost-effective strategies. The screening
   intervals could be varied dramatically by age at T2DM diagnosis.
   Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the consistency and
   robustness of the cost-effectiveness of the 4-year interval screening
   strategy.The findings suggest that a 4-year interval screening strategy
   is likely to be more cost-effective than screening every 1 to 3 years in
   comparison with no screening in the Chinese setting. The screening
   intervals might be tailored according to the age at T2DM diagnosis.}},

   paper tends to extend the investigation of harmonic leakage inductance
   to polyphase PM machines, which have been receiving great attention in
   safety-critical applications. The impact of phase belt and winding layer
   on the winding distribution factor, which is usually neglected in
   previous work, has been investigated. The inductance index as well as a
   completed calculation flowchart has been introduced, in order to offer a
   full picture of harmonic leakage and its impact on winding inductance.
   Five-phase and six-phase schemes with different slot/pole combinations
   have been investigated as examples for odd and even phase number
   machines, respectively. Furthermore, several prototype machines,

Abstract = {{Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is one of the most common types of
   salivary gland malignancy in the head and neck, and its aggressive
   ability to invade and metastasize is an important reason for its poor
   survival rates. Our previous investigations confirmed that
   autophagy-associated gene expression is closely associated with the
   occurrence and development of ACC. On this basis, the present study
   further investigated hypoxia-induced autophagy and its role in tumor
   invasion. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) was used to mimic hypoxia. The results
   of the present study indicated that autophagosome formation and
   upregulation of autophagy-associated microtubule-associated protein 1
   light chain 3 and Beclin 1 were observed in ACC-M cells in response to
   CoCl2. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha/B cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus
   E1B 19K-interacting protein 3 signaling pathway was involved in
   hypoxia-induced autophagy in ACC. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy
   by chloroquine markedly attenuated the tumor invasion induced by mimetic
   hypoxia in ACC. These results suggested that hypoxia-induced autophagy
   may serve as a potential target for the future treatment of ACC.}},

   the optimal conditions, surface area was estimated to be 3441 m(2)/g
   with pore volume of 2.093 ml/g and the significant proportion of
   activated carbon was microporous (62.3\%). The results of Fourier

Abstract = {{Accumulation of extracellular matrix derived from glomerular mesangial
   cells is an early feature of diabetic nephropathy. Ca2+ signals mediated
   by store-operated Ca2+ channels regulate protein production in a variety
   of cell types. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
   store-operated Ca2+ channels in mesangial cells on extracellular matrix
   protein expression. In cultured human mesangial cells, activation of
   store-operated Ca2+ channels by thapsigargin significantly decreased
   fibronectin protein expression and collagen IV mRNA expression in a
   dose-dependent manner. Conversely, inhibition of the channels by
   2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate significantly increased the expression of
   fibronectin and collagen IV. Similarly, overexpression of stromal
   interacting molecule 1 reduced, but knockdown of calcium
   release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1) increased
   fibronectin protein expression. Furthermore, 2-aminoethyl
   diphenylborinate significantly augmented angiotensin II-induced
   fibronectin protein expression, whereas thapsigargin abrogated high
   glucose- and TGF-beta 1-stimulated matrix protein expression. In vivo
   knockdown of Orai1 in mesangial cells of mice using a targeted
   nanoparticle siRNA delivery system resulted in increased expression of
   glomerular fibronectin and collagen IV, and mice showed significant
   mesangial expansion compared with controls. Similarly, in vivo knockdown
   of stromal interacting molecule 1 in mesangial cells by recombinant
   adeno-associated virus-encoded shRNA markedly increased collagen IV
   protein expression in renal cortex and caused mesangial expansion in
   rats. These results suggest that store-operated Ca2+ channels in
   mesangial cells negatively regulate extracellular matrix protein
   expression in the kidney, which may serve as an endogenous
   renoprotective mechanism in diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{We derived the renormalized nonlinear sensitivity operator and the
   related inverse thin-slab propagator (ITSP) for nonlinear tomographic
   waveform inversion based on the theory of nonlinear partial derivative
   operator and its De Wolf approximation. The inverse propagator is based
   on a renormalization procedure to the forward and inverse transition
   matrix scattering series. The ITSP eliminates the divergence of the
   inverse Born series for strong perturbations by stepwise partial
   summation (renormalization). Numerical tests showed that the inverse
   Born T-series starts to diverge at moderate perturbation (20\% for the
   given model of Gaussian ball with a radius of 5 wavelength), while the
   ITSP has no divergence problem for any strong perturbations (up to 100\%
   perturbation for test model). In addition, the ITSP is a non-iterative,
   marching algorithm with only one sweep, and therefore very efficient in
   comparison with the iterative inversion based on the inverse-Born
   scattering series. This convergence and efficiency improvement has
   potential applications to the iterative procedure of waveform inversion.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Early diagnostics of colorectal cancer is complicated by the
   lack of reliable serum biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate if
   the serum level of activin A can be used for diagnostics of this
   disease.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study we measured the level of activin A
   in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, benign colorectal polyps, as
   well as in healthy subjects.
   RESULTS: We found that the level of activin A was significantly higher
   in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, as compared to patients with
   polyps and healthy controls. Furthermore, activin A levels correlated
   well with the stage of colorectal cancer. The level of activin A was
   substantially reduced in post-operative patients. Immunohistochemical
   staining demonstrated that high levels of activin A were present in the
   adenocarcinoma tissue samples but not in the non-cancerous samples.
   RT-PCR further confirmed that mRNA of beta A subunit of activin A is
   significantly over-expressed in the majority of cancerous samples.
   Western blotting results further demonstrated the elevated level of
   activin A in cancer samples.
   CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings suggest that colorectal
   adenocarcinomas directly secret activin A into the blood stream.
   Measuring the serum level of activin A might be used as a reliable
   diagnostic and screening tool in clinical practice.}},

Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cancer is a major killer of human health and predictions for the
   carcinogenicity of chemicals are of great importance. In this article,
   predictive models for the carcinogenicity of organic compounds using
   QSAR methods for rats and mice were developed based on the data from
   CPDB. The models was developed based on the data of specific target site
   liver and classified according to sex of rats and mice. Meanwhile,
   models were also classified according to whether there is a ring in the
   molecular structure in order to reduce the diversity of molecular
   structure. Therefore, eight local models were developed in the final.
   Taking into account the complexity of carcinogenesis and in order to
   obtain as much information, DRAGON descriptors were selected as the
   variables used to develop models. Fitting ability, robustness and
   predictive power of the models were assessed according to the OECD
   principles. The external predictive coefficients for validation sets of
   each model were in the range of 0.711-0.906, and for the whole data in
   each model were all greater than 0.8, which represents that all models
   have good predictivity. In order to study the mechanism of
   carcinogenesis, standardized regression coefficients were calculated for
   all predictor variables. In addition, the effect of animal sex on
   carcinogenesis was compared and a trend that female showed stronger
   tolerance for cancerogen than male in both species was appeared. (C)

Abstract = {{Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) with high tolerance to cadmium (Cd) may
   be used in the phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated fields. However, the
   mechanisms responsible for Cd accumulation and tolerance in oilseed rape
   are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the physiological and
   molecular processes involved in Cd tolerance of two oilseed rape
   cultivars with different Cd accumulation abilities. The total Cd
   accumulation in cultivar L351 was higher than cultivar L338,
   particularly with increasing concentrations of Cd exposure. L338 was a
   more pronounced Cd-sensitive cultivar than L351, while higher activities
   of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX, GR, DHAR) as well as higher contents
   of GSH and AsA were all observed in L351 under Cd treatments, especially
   at high levels. No differences were found in SOD activities between the
   two cultivars under the same Cd treatments, suggesting that SOD was not
   the key factor in relation to the differences of Cd tolerance and
   accumulation between them. Gene expression levels of BnFe-SOD, BnCAT,
   BnAPX, BcGR and BoDHAR in roots of L351 were relatively higher than that
   in L338 under Cd exposure as well as BnCAT and BcGR in leaves. It is
   concluded that antioxidant enzymes and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle
   play important roles in oilseed rape Cd accumulation and tolerance. 2015

Abstract = {{Exemplar-based sparse representation is a nonparametric framework for
   voice conversion. In this framework, a target spectrum is generated as a
   weighted linear combination of a set of basis spectra, namely exemplars,
   extracted from the training data. This framework adopts coupled
   source-target dictionaries consisting of acoustically aligned
   source-target exemplars, and assumes they can share the same activation
   matrix. At runtime, a source spectrogram is factorized as a product of
   the source dictionary and the common activation matrix, which is applied
   to the target dictionary to generate the target spectrogram. In
   practice, either low-resolution mel-scale filter bank energies or
   high-resolution spectra are adopted in the source dictionary.
   Low-resolution features are flexible in capturing the temporal
   information without increasing the computational cost and the memory
   occupation significantly, while high-resolution spectra contain
   significant spectral details. In this paper, we propose a joint
   nonnegative matrix factorization technique to find the common activation
   matrix using low- and high-resolution features at the same time. In this
   way, the common activation matrix is able to benefit from low- and
   high-resolution features directly. We conducted experiments on the
   VOICES database to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Both
   objective and subjective evaluations confirmed the effectiveness of the
   proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{The motivation of ``Islamic perpetrators to kill{''} in Europe results
   from a multitude of different reasons, related both to the particular

   elements relating to the emergence of terrorist movements that form a

   Nevertheless, the main sphere of activity by ``Islamic perpetrators{''}
   originating from Europe lies in the predominant conflict regions in
   Asia, Africa and the Middle East. This situation assessment illustrates
   the influences of Islamist propaganda in attracting potential activists
   for global terrorist violence and the interaction between different

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the content of selected
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urban soils fertilized with
   municipal sewage sludge. The factors in the experiment were three lawns
   along the main roads in Bialystok (in Popieluszki, Hetmanska and
   Raginisa Strs.), doses of sewage sludge (0 - control; 75 and 150 Mg/ha)
   and two years of study (2011 and 2012). The studied parameters were
   monitored at the end of the growing season (in October 2011 and 2012) by
   determining fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo{[}a] anthracene, chrysene, and
   benzo{[}a] pyrene in soil samples. Furthermore, the dehydrogenase
   activity, the pH and organic carbon content of the soil were determined.
   Obtained content of studied PAHs in the urban soil does not exceed those
   contained in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of
   September 9th, 2002 on soil quality standards and ground quality
   standards. The concentration of pyrene and chrysene differed
   significantly depending on the time of sampling and the localization. It
   has been shown that fertilization of soil sewage sludge revealed
   reduction of pyrene concentration in soil. Among 5 tested PAHs
   compounds, benzo{[}a] pyrene was the most dominant compound both in
   samples collected in 2011 and 2012 (28 and 27\% respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium ion-imprinted polymers (Cd-IIP) were synthesized by
   precipitation polymerization using a complex of dithizone and cadmium as
   a template. The saturation adsorption capacity of the Cd-IIP is two
   times that of the nonimprinted polymers (Cd-NIP). Homogeneous binding
   sites are confirmed by the Langmuir isotherm. The adsorption kinetics
   fit a pseudo-second-order model well; and the adsorption equilibrium
   time is only approximately 20 mm The effect of coexisting ions on the
   Cd(II)-IIP and NIP were investigated by competing with Pb(II), Co(II),
   and Cu(II), and the ratio of relative selectivity coefficients was
   greater than 1.68. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that Cd(II)
   adsorption over UP and NIP was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The
   enthalpy changes in different temperatures and adsorption energy are
   lower than -20.0 and 8 kJ/mol; respectively. These indicate that the
   adsorption process may be dominated by physisorption. The Cd-IIP was
   used for five cycles with a small decrease in adsorption capacity, which
   validated a significant potential of Cd-IIP in wastewater treatment.}},

Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},

Abstract = {{A 60-day feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of
   dietary carbohydrate level on growth performance, feed utilization,
   biochemical composition and glucose metabolism of juvenile sea cucumber.
   The sea cucumbers were fed five isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets
   containing graded levels of carbohydrate from 25.61\% to 66.09\%, to
   investigate the optimum dietary carbohydrate level. The results revealed
   that specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE)
   first significantly increased then declined as dietary carbohydrate
   level increased. The relatively higher protein efficiency ratios (PER)
   in diets with carbohydrate levels of 45.31\% and 55.82\% implied that
   carbohydrate supplied energy to gain the protein sparing effect.
   Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter, crude protein,
   carbohydrate and gross energy were all significantly affected by dietary
   carbohydrate level. The high dietary carbohydrate level resulted in the
   increased glycogen biosyntheses and lipid deposition, accelerated
   glycolysis and decelerated gluconeogenesis to maintain glucose
   homoeostasis. Glycolytic enzyme activities of hexokinase (HK), pyruvate
   kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and succinate dehydrogenase
   (SDH) showed an ascending trend as dietary carbohydrate level increased
   at the initial stage. However, PK, LDH, lipogenic enzyme activity of
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), gluconeogenic enzyme
   activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FDPase), amylase activity and
   cortisol level significantly decreased at the highest dietary
   carbohydrate level of 66.09\%, and glucose in coelomic fluid
   significantly increased, which demonstrated that excess dietary
   carbohydrate might lead to the inhibition of glucose metabolism. Based
   on the second-order polynomial regression models of SGR and FCE, it was
   concluded that 48.56\%-49.30\% dietary carbohydrate levels were optimal
   for Apostichopus japonicus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate gene expression at the
   post-transcriptional level and have been implicated in the development
   of various human diseases, including cancer. The regulatory networks of
   miRNAs play a vital role not only in normal physiology but also in
   pathology and may represent novel targets for drug discovery. Regulation
   of miRNAs and the elucidation of miRNA networks will advance
   miRNA-targeted research but are challenging due to a shortage of
   appropriate tools. Using different assay systems, diverse small
   molecules with unique miRNA regulatory activity have been identified.
   These bioactive small molecules not only showed regulation on different
   miRNAs but revealed previously unknown miRNA networks. Treatment of
   cancer both in vitro and in vivo with small-molecule regulators of
   miRNAs has demonstrated their therapeutic potential. In this review, we
   discuss assay systems for the identification of small-molecule
   regulators of miRNAs and reported small molecules, and discuss their
   applications as probes and candidate drug leads. Drug Dev Res 76 :

Abstract = {{Manganese-rich transition metal carbonate precursors
   (Ni0.15Co0.15Mn0.7CO3) have been synthesized by the carbonate
   precipitation in the presence of ethanol. The physical properties of the
   precursors with different concentration of ethanol have been examined by
   XRD and SEM. The XRD results show that the precursors prepared by this
   method are typical hexagonal structure. The SEM results show that the
   particles of the precursors with the presence of ethanol display more
   spherical and dispersed than those prepared without using ethanol.
   Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments demonstrate that the initial
   discharge capacity of the cathode material (Li1.2Ni0.12Co0.12Mn0.56O2)
   is improved by the addition of ethanol. In addition, the effects of
   reaction temperature, the molar ratio of precipitant/total-cations on
   the morphology of the resultant precursors and the electrochemical
   properties of the prepared powders are also investigated. Among the
   synthesized materials, the sample prepared with 10 vol\% ethanol and a
   fixed concentration ratio ({[}CO32 ]/{[}M2+] = 10) at 65 degrees C
   exhibits not only a relatively high discharge capacity of 272.1 mA h g
   (1), but also excellent rate performance and good cycling performance.

Abstract = {{The alpha-helical transmembrane proteins constitute 25\% of the entire
   human proteome space and are difficult targets in high-resolution wetlab
   structural studies, calling for accurate computational predictors. We
   present a novel sequence-based method called MemBrain-Rasa to predict
   relative solvent accessibility surface area (rASA) from primary
   sequences. MemBrain-Rasa features by an ensemble prediction protocol
   composed of a statistical machine-learning engine, which is trained in
   the sequential feature space, and a segment template similarity-based
   engine, which is constructed with solved structures and sequence
   alignment. We locally constructed a comprehensive database of residue
   relative solvent accessibility surface area from the solved protein 3D
   structures in the PDB database. It is searched against for segment
   templates that are expected to be structurally similar to the query
   sequence's segments. The segment template-based prediction is then fused
   with the support vector regression outputs using knowledge rules. Our
   experiments show that pure machine learning output cannot cover the
   entire rASA solution space and will have a serious prediction preference
   problem due to the relatively small size of membrane protein structures
   that can be used as the training samples. The template-based engine
   solves this problem very well, resulting in significant improvement of
   the pridiction performance. MemBrain-Rasa achieves a Pearson correlation
   coefficient of 0.733 and mean absolute error of 13.593 on the benchmark
   dataset, which are 26.4\% and 26.1\% better than existing predictors.
   MemBrain-Rasa represents a new progress in structure modeling of
   a-helical transmembrane proteins. MemBrain-Rasa is available at

Title = {{Wellness Coaching for People With Prediabetes: A Randomized
   Encouragement Trial to Evaluate Outreach Methods at Kaiser Permanente,
   Northern California, 2013}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Health coaching can improve lifestyle behaviors known to prevent or
   manage chronic conditions. Little is known about effective ways to
   encourage health and wellness coaching among people who might benefit.
   The purpose of this randomized encouragement trial was to assess the
   relative success of 3 outreach methods (secured email message, telephone
   message, and mailed letter) on the use of wellness coaching by people
   with prediabetes.
   Methods
   A total of 14,584 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) patients
   with diagnosed prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose, 110-125mg/dL) were
   randomly assigned to be contacted via 1 of 4 intervention arms from
   January through May 2013. The uptake rate (making an appointment at the
   Wellness Coaching Center {[}WCC]) was assessed, and the association
   between uptake rate and patient characteristics was examined via
   multivariable logistic regression.
   Results
   The overall uptake rate across intervention arms was 1.9\%. Secured
   email message had the highest uptake rate (3.0\%), followed by letters
   and telephone messages (P <.05 for all pairwise comparisons). No
   participants in the usual-care arm (ie, no outreach) made an appointment
   with the WCC. For each year of increased age, the estimated odds of the
   uptake increased by 1.02 (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.04).
   Women were nearly twice as likely to make an appointment at the WCC as
   men (OR = 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.51).
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that the WCC can recruit and encourage KPNC members
   with prediabetes to participate in the WCC. Future research should focus
   on increasing participation rates in health coaching among patients who
   may benefit.}},

Abstract = {{The development and evolution of tulip and distorted tulip flames in
   closed channels were simulated by solving the fully compressible
   reactive Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order numerical method and
   a single-step Arrhenius model for the reactions and energy release in a
   stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and air. Important features of the
   simulations include (1) the development and propagation of acoustic
   waves and their effects on flame evolution, (2) the formation and
   collapse of flame cusps, both at the flame front and near the sidewalls,
   and the effects of cusp collapse on flame propagation, and (3) the
   appearance of adverse pressure gradients at the onset of the tulip or a
   distorted tulip flame, which result in reverse flow in the unburned gas.
   The simulations highlight the coupling between pressure waves, adverse
   pressure gradients, boundary layers, and the propagating flame front.
   Whereas the formation of the tulip flame can be attributed to several
   effects (such as pressure waves, vortex motion and Landau-Darrieus
   instabilities), the onset of the distorted tulip flame is strongly
   influenced by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. (C) 2015 The Combustion

   method, where the precursor was the Li4Mn5O12 ultrafine powder
   synthesized in our laboratory, the binder was acrylamide, the
   cross-linker was N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), and the initiator
   was ammonium persulfate (APS). And then Li+ in the granulated material
   was exchanged with H+ in a 0.5 M HCl solution to obtain PAM-MnO2
   ion-sieve for Li+ adsorption. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms of
   Li+ on the granulated PAM-MnO2 ion-sieve were measured at 293, 298, 303,
   and 318 K, respectively. The Langmuir model was used to fit the
   experimental data, and the model parameters were estimated with the
   nonlinear regression method. The uptake curves of Li+ adsorption were
   measured. The film mass-transfer coefficient (k(f)) and Li+ pore
   diffusivity (D-p) in the granulated PAM-MnO2 ion-sieve were estimated
   using a mathematical model to fit the experimental data. Furthermore,
   the Li+ adsorption-desorption behaviors in the granulated PAM-MnO2
   ion-sieve packed column were investigated for three kinds of feedstock,
   namely brine, LiCl solution with and without impurities of Na+, K+,
   Ca2+, and Mg2+, respectively, and the regenerability of the granulated
   PAM-MnO2 ion-sieve for the multicyclic Li+ adsorption from brine and

   greater than the spacer content for the other two cases. It proves that
   the volume change of macropores during sintering decreases based on
   theory and practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study is intended to explore the role of human
   umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) in nerve
   end-to-side anastomosis, as well as in the induction and promotion of
   growth of nerve lateral bud. The chitosan nerve conduit was prepared
   based on the biological characteristics of chitosan, and the nerve
   conduit was filled with HUC-MSCs, and was used to bridge the nerve
   end-to-side anastomotic stoma. The experimental animals were randomly
   assigned into three groups (10 in each group), and the nerve end-to-side
   anastomosis was conducted: (1) group A (control group): traditional
   tibial nerve-common peroneal nerve end-to-side anastomosis; (2) group B
   (experimental group 1): tibial nerve-common peroneal nerve end-to-side
   anastomotic stoma bridged with chitosan nerve conduit; (3) group C
   (experimental group 2): tibial nerve-common peroneal nerve end-to-side
   anastomotic stoma bridged by chitosan nerve conduit filled with
   HUC-MSCs. General morphological observation, nerve electrophysiology,
   and anti-S-100 immunohistochemistry were performed. All experimental
   animals survived, and no infections were found at operative incisions.
   The nerve continuity was in good condition through visual observation
   when sampling, which is mild adhesion to the surrounding tissue and easy
   to be separated. 12 W HUC-MSCs chitosan composite nerve conduits were
   degraded completely after operation. Electrophysiological test showed
   that the nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in group C was significantly
   higher than that in group A or group B (p < 0.01). There were no
   significant differences between NCVs of group A and group B. Toluidine
   blue staining and transmission electron microscope showed that the
   number of the medullated fibers and the myelin sheath thickness in group
   C were larger than those in group A or B. There were no significant
   differences between the numbers of the medullated fibers and between the
   myelin sheath thicknesses of groups A and B. By means of anti-S-100
   immunohistochemistry, the arrangement of a large number of brown-red
   proliferating schwann cells around the regenerated nerve fibers in group
   C could be found, while fewer and sparse brown-red matters and very poor
   growth of schwann cells could be observed in groups A and B. Slightly
   more favorable situation could be observed in group B compared with
   group A. HUC-MSCs play obviously an important role in promoting nerve
   regeneration during the nerve end-to-side anastomosis, which induces the
   growth of axis bud, accelerates the growth velocity of regenerated
   fiber, and promotes the growth and maturity of schwann cells.}},

Title = {{Diagnostic accuracy of adenosine deaminase for tuberculous pericarditis:
   a meta-analysis}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Many studies suggest that adenosine deaminase is a marker for
   tuberculous pericarditis, while controversy exists as to its diagnostic
   utility. This study aims to summarize the overall diagnostic performance
   of adenosine deaminase for tuberculous pericarditis through a
   meta-analysis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literatures publ ished before May 2015 were
   searched in PubMed and EMBASE. The data were retrieved and the
   sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR),
   diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of adenosine deaminase for diagnosing
   tuberculous pericarditis were pooled, and the summary receiver operating
   characteristic (SROC) curves were used to examine the overall
   performance of adenosine deaminase.
   RESULTS: In total, 11 studies with 938 subjects were included in the
   meta-analysis. The summary estimates of adenosine deaminase for
   diagnosing tuberculous pericarditis were listed as follows: sensitivity
   of 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.86-0.93), specificity of 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.83-0.89),
   PLR of 5.90 (95\% CI: 4.46-7.82), NLR of 0.15 (95\% CI: 0.09-0.26), and
   DOR of 42.55 (95\% CI: 21.51-84.18). The area under the SROC curve was
   0.92, and the Q value was 0.85. No publication bias was identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine deaminase is a valuable marker with both high
   sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of tuberculous
   pericarditis. Nevertheless, the results of adenosine deaminase assays
   should be interpreted in combination with other test results and
   clinical characteristics of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Tandem MS (MS2) quantification using the series of N- and C-terminal
   fragment ion pairs generated from isobaric-labelled peptides was
   recently considered an accurate strategy in quantitative proteomics.
   However, the presence of multiplexed terminal fragment ion in MS2
   spectra may reduce the efficiency of peptide identification, resulting
   in lower identification scores or even incorrect assignments. To address
   this issue, we developed a quantitative software tool, denoted isobaric
   tandem MS quantification (ITMSQ), to improve N- and C-terminal fragment
   ion pairs based isobaric MS2 quantification. A spectrum splitting module
   was designed to separate the MS2 spectra from different samples,
   increasing the accuracy of both identification and quantification. ITMSQ
   offers a convenient interface through which parameters can be changed
   along with the labelling method, and the result files and all of the
   intermediate files can be exported. We performed an analysis of in vivo
   terminal amino acid labelling labelled HeLa samples and found that the
   numbers of quantified proteins and peptides increased by 13.64 and
   27.52\% after spectrum splitting, respectively. In conclusion, ITMSQ
   provides an accurate and reliable quantitative solutionfor N- and
   C-terminal fragment ion pairs based isobaric MS2 quantitative methods.}},

Abstract = {{Self-disclosure is popular on social network site (SNS). However,
   teenagers' self-disclosure behavior and their regret of posting, a

   examine how demographic variables, SNS use, different types of
   ``friends{''}, trust, and privacy control behavior relate to
   self-disclosure and regret of posting. We find that though teenagers
   reveal moderately high level of personal information on SNS, they do not
   disclose all types of personal information equally. Results also show
   that male and older teens disclose more personal information. Frequent
   SNS use, large SNS network size, and having strangers in SNS friend list
   increase both self-disclosure and posting regret. Setting SNS profile
   private is related to lower level of self-disclosure. Implications for
   privacy design of SNS are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An air-core pulsed alternator is extremely attractive for driving the
   electromagnetic launchers. The reason is that the machine can offer high
   voltage and current performance in a single-element energy storage
   device, a smooth pulse profile, and naturally cycled current zeros,
   which can allow for extremely low muzzle currents and simplifies
   switching requirements. But because of the short history of the air-core
   pulsed alternator in China, the relevant theoretical research is not
   enough and the experience in fabrication is absent. It is really
   necessary to summarize a preliminary design method in order to rapidly
   determine the size and approximately evaluate the electrical performance
   of the machine. The optimization will be based on this first-stage
   design scheme. In this paper, based on the requirements of the railgun,
   some important design considerations of a seven-phase and six-pole
   air-core pulsed alternator are presented in detail. In addition, it is
   significant to obtain the analytical formulas for the first-stage design
   requiring less costs; these formulas intuitively allow us to expedite
   the design process and optimize the design scheme. Finally, some basic
   output parameters of the machine are given for the preliminary design;
   the designed pulsed alternator will generate 1.4 kV and drive a train of
   1-MA pulses into a 5-m railgun, accelerating 200-g masses at 2 km/s.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment with curcumin attenuated modeled microgravity-induced bone
   loss, possibly through abating oxidative stress and activating vitamin D
   receptor. Curcumin might be an effective countermeasure for
   microgravity-induced bone loss but remains to be tested in humans.
   Introduction Bone loss is one of the most important complications for
   human crewmembers who are exposed to long-term microgravity in space and
   also for bedridden people. The aim of the current study was to elucidate
   whether treatment with curcumin attenuated bone loss induced by
   microgravity.
   Methods We used hind-limb suspension (HLS) and rotary wall vessel
   bioreactor (RWVB) to model microgravity in vivo and in vitro,
   respectively. We investigated the effects of curcumin consumption (40 mg
   kg(-1) body weight day(-1), via daily oral gavages) on Sprague-Dawley
   (SD) rats exposed to HLS for 6 weeks. Then, we investigated the effects
   of incubation with curcumin (4 mu M) on MC3T3-E1 and RAW264.7 cells
   cultured in RWVB.
   Results Curcumin alleviated HLS-induced reduction of bone mineral
   density in tibiae and preserved bone structure in tibiae and mechanical
   strength in femurs. Curcumin alleviated HLS-induced oxidative stress
   marked by reduced malondialdehyde content and increased total sulfhydryl
   content in femurs. In cultured MC3T3-E1 cells, curcumin inhibited
   modeled microgravity-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and
   enhanced osteoblastic differentiation. In cultured RAW264.7 cells,
   curcumin reduced modeled microgravity-induced ROS formation and
   attenuated osteoclastogenesis. In addition, curcumin upregulated vitamin
   D receptor (VDR) expression in femurs of rats exposed to HLS and
   MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to modeled microgravity.
   Conclusion Curcumin alleviated HLS-induced bone loss in rats, possibly
   via suppressing oxidative stress and upregulating VDR expression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of stabilization criteria for systems
   with two additive time-varying delays. First, the delay-dependent
   stability condition for the systems is established through computing the
   more general Lyapunov functional. The Lyapunov functional is constructed
   by making full use of the property and the information of the systems,
   and the condition has advantages over the existing ones in the skillful
   combination of the delay decomposition and the reciprocal convex
   approach. Second, considered to be more flexible for the controller
   design with the introduced positive scalar, a new controller method is
   presented. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the
   advantage of the results in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome instability usually leads to tumorigenesis. Bloom syndrome
   (BS) is a genetic disease associated with chromosome instability. The BS
   gene product, BLM, has been reported to function in the spindle assembly
   checkpoint (SAC) to prevent chromosome instability. BTR complex,
   composed of BLM, topoisomerase III (Topo III), RMI1 (RecQ-mediated
   genome instability protein 1, BLAP75) and RMI2 (RecQ-mediated genome
   instability protein 2, BLAP18), is crucial for maintaining genome
   stability. Recent work has demonstrated that RMI2 also plays critical
   role in SAC. However, little is know about RMI1 regulation during the
   cell cycle. Here we present that RMI1 protein level does not change
   through G1, S and G2 phases, but significantly increases in M phase.
   Moreover, phosphorylation of RMI1 occurs in mitosis. Upon
   microtubule-disturbing agent, RMI1 is phosphorylated primarily at the
   sites of Serine 284 and Serine 292, which does not interfere with the
   formation of BTR complex. Additionally, this phosphorylation is
   partially reversed by roscovitine treatment, implying cycling-dependent
   kinase 1 (CDK1) might be one of the upstream kinases.}},

Abstract = {{Blocking polyether silicone oil is prepared through a reaction between
   amino-terminated polyether and epoxide-terminated polyether silicones. A
   fabric finishing agent made with cationic waterborne polyurethane

   and tailor-made blocking polyether silicone oil as a chain extender for
   modification purposes. The finishing agent and the blocking polyether
   silicone oil are jointly used to treat cashmere knitted fabric. It is
   found that resistance to pilling of the treated cashmere knitted fabric
   is improved from a scale of 2-3 to 4 and its washing shrinkage rate is
   reduced from 11.2\% to 3.3\%. The treated cashmere knitted fabric has
   good hydrophilic ability, high water vapor and air permeabilities, and a
   soft handle. Moreover, the color of the fabric remains almost unchanged
   after finishing and the durability of the finishing properties is
   excellent.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We have numerically investigated the transmission and plasmon resonance
   properties of the metal strip tetramer. The results show that in the
   symmetric model there are three sharp transparent windows, the first and
   third peaks' transmittance are more than 75\%. When decreasing metal
   strips size or increasing gap distance, the transmission spectra bloc
   shift and intensities change. While introducing asymmetry, the
   transmission spectra and Plasmon resonance significantly change, whether
   to modify the size or the gap distance, a new dip exist on the second
   peak, and one or two new peaks exist on the third dip. Through analysis
   of the electric magnetic properties, we find that the new dip results
   from asymmetric second order magnetic resonance, while the peak is
   originated from the strong electric resonance It is also demonstrated
   that the sensor sensitivity in this proposed system can reach of 380
   nm/RIU. The resonator design strategy opens up a rich pathway for the
   implementation of optimized optical properties for specific
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The periodic layers and ordered nanochannels of covalent organic
   frameworks (COFs) make these materials viable open catalytic
   nanoreactors, but their low stability has precluded their practical
   implementation. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline porous COF
   that is stable against water, strong acids and strong bases, and we
   demonstrate its utility as a material platform for structural design and
   functional development. We endowed a crystalline and porous imine-based
   COF with stability by incorporating methoxy groups into its pore walls
   to reinforce interlayer interactions. We subsequently converted the
   resulting achiral material into two distinct chiral organocatalysts,
   with the high crystallinity and porosity retained, by appending chiral
   centres and catalytically active sites on its channel walls. The COFs
   thus prepared combine catalytic activity, enantioselectivity and
   recyclability, which are attractive in heterogeneous organocatalysis,
   and were shown to promote asymmetric C-C bond formation in water under
   ambient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Little attention was given to the climatic signals in wood properties,
   such as microfibril angle (MFA) and tracheid radial diameter (TRD). In
   this article, year-to-year variation in MFA and TRD was measured by
   SilviScan-3 on dated Picea crassifolia trees growing at three altitudes
   in the northeastern Tibetan plateau. Climatic signals registered in MFA
   and TRD were analyzed using dendroclimatology methods. The annual
   variation of MFA and TRD was strongly linked to high-frequency climatic
   signals. Both MFA and TRD were negatively correlated with temperature
   and positively correlated with precipitation. The temperature had a
   similar influence on MFA and TRD at three different altitudes, while the
   influence of precipitation decreased with the increasing altitudes. MFA
   was negatively correlated with TRD, and this MFA-TRD internal
   relationship (R (t)) varied with calendar year. Temperature and
   precipitation had a strong influence on R (t). Temperature was
   positively correlated with R (t), and precipitation was negatively
   correlated with R (t). The influence of temperature was stronger than
   that of precipitation. The influence of temperature increased with the
   increase in altitudes, while the influence of precipitation decreased
   with the increasing altitudes. Results of this study revealed that the
   trees could change their internal characteristics to adapt to the

Abstract = {{To investigate the expression of Sam68 in articular cartilage of knee
   osteoarthritis (OA) and the relationship between Sam68 and NF-kappa B
   activation and apoptosis signaling in OA articular chondrocytes.
   Sam68 expression in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR on both meniscal/ligamentous injury
   (MLI)-induced OA rat model and the clinical human OA cartilage tissues.
   Sam68 expression in chondrocytes under tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) stimuli was also assessed by immunoblot. Inhibiting Sam68 in
   chondrocytes under TNF-alpha stimuli was conducted using small
   interfering RNA (siRNA) and its influence on the expression of apoptotic
   marker and catabolic genes was examined by immunoblot. The mechanism of
   how Sam68 stimulates NF-kappa B activity was determined by
   co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of nuclear and
   cytoplasmic fractions of TNF-alpha-treated chondrocytes for p65 and
   Sam68.
   Sam68 expression was increased in OA cartilage tissues and chondrocytes
   under TNF-alpha stimuli. Inhibition of Sam68 by siRNA significantly
   decreased the expression of apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3 and
   cleaved PARP) in chondrocytes following TNF-alpha-stimulation. Sam68
   knockdown suppressed I kappa-B degradation and p65 nuclear
   transportation in TNF-alpha-treated chondrocytes, indicating a
   suppressed NF-kappa B activation. Upon TNF-alpha exposure, the nuclear
   transportation of Sam68 and its interaction with p65 was detected in
   chondrocytes. Furthermore, Sam68 knockdown also alleviated the
   TNF-alpha-induced catabolic marker (MMP13, ADAMTS5, iNOS and IL-6)
   expression.
   The highly expressed Sam68 promotes NF-kappa B signaling activation,
   catabolic gene expression and cellular apoptosis in TNF-alpha-treated
   chondrocytes, which may provide better insights into the pathophysiology
   of OA and a potential target for its treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses optimal constrained state estimation problem for
   finite and infinite-dimensional chemical process systems. We consider
   cases when the prior information, in addition to the model parameters
   and the measurements, is available in the form of an inequality
   constraint with respect to the system's state. In the latest
   developments of the optimal state estimation theory, considerations of
   the state constraints have been often neglected since constraints do not
   fit easily in the structure of the optimal state estimator. Therefore,
   the issue of the state constraints being present needs to be addressed
   adequately, in particular, nonnegativity of concentration. Motivated by
   this, we developed a sequential, algorithmic optimal constrained state
   estimator for both finite and infinite-dimensional process systems
   commonly found in chemical process engineering (CSTR, tubular reactor).
   In this paper, we also designed an optimal constrained state estimator
   for a large class of dissipative infinite-dimensional systems which
   involve boundary actuation and point observation. Finally, illustrative
   examples of chemical process systems and proposed optimal state
   constrained estimation are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The desilication effects of aluminium sulphate and sodium aluminate on
   kraft bamboo pulp during the cooking process were investigated in this
   study. Furthermore, the residual aluminium ion concentration in the
   resulting black liquor was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic
   emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) to evaluate the scaling properties of
   black liquor during the evaporation process. Atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis showed that aluminium salts could react
   with silica to form a silica-alumina compound, which can adhere to the
   fibre surface during the cooking process. As a result, the silicon
   content in the black liquor could be effectively decreased by the
   addition of aluminium sulphate and sodium aluminate. A silica removal
   ratio of 74\% could be achieved when the loadings of aluminium sulphate
   and sodium aluminate were 2.0 wt.\% and 1.5 wt.\%, respectively.
   Finally, the concentration of aluminium ions was 7.31 ppm under
   optimised conditions. Based on these considerations, any amounts of
   aluminum ion passing into the black liquor are unlikely to contribute to
   scaling problems.}},

   concentrations at 15-minute intervals for two 1-year periods: from
   August 2008 to July 2009 and from August 2013 to July 2014. In addition,
   they recorded water levels over the same periods and collected water
   samples for nutrient analysis. The authors analyzed the high-time
   resolution DO records, compared the diel DO trends between the two

Abstract = {{Inflammation plays a critical role in tumor metastasis. However, few
   inflammation-related biomarkers are currently available to predict the
   risk of metastasis for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using
   huge tumors (diameter > 10 cm) as a model, we evaluated the potential
   risk of pre- and post-treatment inflammatory responses in the
   development of metastasis of HCC patients undergoing transarterial
   chemoembolization (TACE). A logistic regression model was used to
   analyze the risk factors. One hundred and sixty-five patients with huge
   HCC were enrolled in the study. Metastases were identified in 25.5 \%
   (42/165) patients by imaging evaluation post-TACE. Neutrophils
   increased, whereas lymphocytes decreased significantly post-TACE.
   Univariate analysis showed that high post-treatment
   neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; p = 0.003), low post-treatment
   lymphocyte count (p = 0.047), and high baseline NLR (p = 0.100) were
   potential risk factors for metastasis. Further, multivariate analysis
   showed that high post-treatment NLR, but not pre-treatment NLR, was an
   independent risk factor for metastasis; this was confirmed by receiver
   operating characteristic curve analysis. Post-treatment NLR, however,
   had no correlation to tumor response and overall survival of patients.
   In conclusion, post-treatment NLR but not pre-treatment NLR
   independently increases the risk of metastasis in huge HCC. Our findings
   suggest the potential contribution of treatment-related inflammation to
   metastasis in advanced HCC.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical exposure levels in printing and coating workers with
   cholangiocarcinoma (third report): Kenichi YAMADA, et al. Occupational
   Health Research and Development Center, Japan Industrial Safety and
   Health Association Objective: This study aimed to identify the chemicals
   used by five printing workers and one coating worker who developed
   cholangiocarcinoma and estimate the workers' levels of chemical
   exposure. Methods: We obtained information on chemicals from the
   Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan, and estimated working
   environment concentrations of the chemicals in printing and coating
   rooms and exposure concentrations during the ink and dirt removal
   processes. We also calculated shift timeweighted averages of exposure
   concentrations. Results: All five printing workers were exposed to both
   1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) and dichloromethane (DCM). The estimated
   maximum exposure concentrations for each of the five workers were 190 to
   560 ppm for 1,2-DCP and 300 to 980 ppnn for DCM, and the estimated shift
   average exposure concentrations were 0 to 230 ppm for 1,2-DCP and 20 to
   470 ppm for DCM. The coating worker was exposed to 1,2-DCP, but not DCM.
   He did not use ink, and thus was subjected to different conditions than
   the printing workers. The estimated maximum exposure concentration of
   1,2-DCP was 150 ppm, and the estimated shift time-weighted average
   exposure concentration was 5 to 19 ppm. Conclusions: Our findings
   support the notion that 1,2DCP contributes to the development of
   cholangiocarcinoma in humans and the notion that DCM may also be a
   contributing factor. The finding that the coating worker was exposed to
   1,2-DCP at a lower exposure concentration is important for determining
   the occupational exposure limit. Furthermore, the subject did not use
   ink, which suggests that ink did not contribute to the development of
   cholangiocarcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab is
   effective in treating colorectal cancer, the occurrence of severe skin
   disorders often discontinues therapy. Herein, we investigated by a
   retrospective chart review the effect of prophylactic oral minocycline
   in combination with skin treatment using moisturizer on the incidence of
   skin disorders and tumor response in metastatic colorectal cancer
   patients who received panitumumab. Patients and Methods: In a total of
   55 patients, 38 patients were eligible, consisting the pre-emptive group
   (N=25) and reactive group (N=13). Acneiform rash and other adverse
   events were graded according to the CTCAE v4.0. Results: The occurrence
   of acneiform rash (grade =2) was significantly lower in pre-emptive
   group than in reactive group (44.0\% vs. 84.6\%, p=0.04). No significant
   differences in the occurrence of other adverse events were observed
   between the two groups. Tumor response was not significantly different
   between the two groups (36.0\% vs. 7.7\%, OR, 6.75; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI)=0.75-60.76, p=0.12). Mean time to treatment failure was
   149.7 days and 110.2 days in the pre-emptive group and reactive
   treatment group, respectively (HR=0.58; 95\% CI=0.26-1.28, p=0.18).
   Conclusion: Prophylactic oral minocycline combined with skin care
   reduced panitumumab-induced acneiform rash without a significant
   influence on tumor response.}},

Abstract = {{Human parechovirus (HPeV) infects humans early in life and typically
   causes asymptomatic or mild diseases such as gastrointestinal and
   respiratory illness but sometimes leads to more serious consequences in
   neonates and young infants. In 2014, we detected HPeV from 38 patients
   by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in Osaka City, Japan, and 33 HPeV
   strains were genotyped based on their VP1 sequences. HPeV genotype 3
   (HPeV-3) was the most prevalent and accounted for 22 cases (66.7 \%)
   followed by nine HPeV-1 (27.3 \%), one HPeV-2 (3.0 \%) and one HPeV-4
   (3.0 \%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that detected HPeV-3 strains
   were divided into three genetically distinct groups. One was
   characterized by a novel single amino acid deletion mutation at the N
   terminus of the 2A protein as well as the VP1 sequence, whereas the
   others were closely related to HPeV-3 strains detected in Japan in
   either 2008 or 2011. These HPeV-3 groups were detected from patients
   with various symptoms including three myositis cases. Recent papers have
   demonstrated that HPeV-3 was the aetiological agent for epidemic myalgia
   exclusively among adults from Yamagata Prefecture in Japan. Here, we
   provide clinical details and episodes of three myositis patients
   including an adult and two children in Osaka City, Japan. Our results
   suggest that HPeV-3 is a causative agent of myositis not only in adults
   but also in children.}},

Abstract = {{Radiography using a synchrotron radiation X-ray source was performed to
   examine solidification and melting behaviors in hypereutectic cast iron
   specimens containing 0.002 and 0.05mass pctMg. The solidification
   sequence in the alloy containing 0.002mass pctMg was (1) nucleation and
   growth of graphite particles of which transformed to a flake-like shape,
   (2) growth of gamma-Fe dendrites, (3) nucleation of graphite particles
   ahead of the interface just prior to the eutectic solidification, and
   (4) the eutectic solidification. In contrast, (1) and (2) occurred
   nearly at the same time in the specimen containing 0.05 mass pct Mg. The
   addition of 0.05mass pctMg significantly reduced the temperature range
   in which the graphite particles grew as the primary phase. Image-based
   analysis of melting behavior showed that even 0.05 mass pct addition was
   sufficient to modify the phase equilibrium of the liquid, gamma-Fe, and
   graphite phases. Thus, the observed influence of Mg on the
   solidification sequence was attributed to the modification of the phase
   equilibrium. The influence was consistently explained by considering the
   shift of the eutectic composition to the carbon side in the
   pseudo-ternary system. It was also suggested that supersaturation of
   carbon in the melt increased as the temperature decreased even though
   the primary graphite particles existed. The supersaturation may cause
   the nucleation of the graphite particles just before the eutectic
   solidification. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic surgery for life-threatening
   large brain hemorrhage, we reviewed our empirical cases of comatose
   patients with large supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage. Among 35
   patients with putaminal or subcortical hemorrhage that was evacuated
   endoscopically, 14 cases (40\%) presented both findings of neurological
   grade IV for severity and hematoma volume exceeding 70 mL in the recent
   3 years (endoscope group), whereas 8 cases with the same conditions were
   treated by conventional craniotomy for the preceding 3-year period
   (craniotomy group). Between these two groups, mean age was higher and
   duration of surgery was shorter in the endoscope group, but no
   significant differences in hematoma size or evacuation rate were
   recognized. In the 10 cases that presented with signs of cerebral
   herniation (neurological grade IVb) and required emergent decompression,
   the preparation time for surgery tended to be shorter in the endoscope
   group, although the difference was not significant. Additional
   ventricular drainage was performed in 7 cases and showed a supplemental
   effect of reducing intracranial pressure (ICP). Consequently, all
   patients in the endoscope group were rescued without decompressive large
   craniectomy, even with symptoms of cerebral herniation. In conclusion,
   endoscopic surgery has the potential to offer an effective therapeutic
   option for comatose patients with large supratentorial intracerebral
   hemorrhages, matching conventional craniotomy for emergent treatment in
   terms of mortality and management of ICP.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is prevalent and unavoidable in business operations. This
   paper presents a mathematical model for the optimal routing of shipping
   raw materials to customers that requires simultaneous pickup and
   delivery with soft time windows for travel time in a fuzzy random
   environment. It minimizes total traveling time while maximizing customer
   satisfaction and meeting constraints characterized by fuzziness and
   randomness in pickup and travel time. The model is strong NP-hard.
   Through embedding of customer satisfaction as a constraint and
   converting fuzzy random variables into deterministic ones using expected
   values, a viable algorithm is developed using the Global-Local-Neighbor
   Particle Swarm Optimization (GLNPSO) technique, and tested by solving a
   real routing problem faced by a large construction project in China.
   Results are encouraging, both in solution quality and potential savings,

Abstract = {{We have witnessed the proliferation of the Internet over the past few
   decades. A large amount of textual information is generated on the Web.
   It is impossible to locate and digest all the latest updates available
   on the Web for individuals. Text summarization would provide an
   efficient way to generate short, concise abstracts from the massive
   documents. These massive documents involve many events which are hard to
   be identified by the summarization procedure directly. We propose a
   novel methodology that identifies events from these text corpora and
   creates summarization for each event. We employ a probabilistic, topic
   model to learn the potential topics from the massive documents and
   further discover events in terms of the topic distributions of
   documents. To target the summarization, we define the word set coverage
   problem (WSCP) to capture the most representative sentences to summarize
   an event. For getting solution of the WSCP, we propose an approximate
   algorithm to solve the optimization problem. We conduct a set of
   experiments to evaluate our proposed approach on two real datasets: Sina
   news and Johnson \& Johnson medical news. On both datasets, our proposed
   method outperforms competitive baselines by considering the harmonic
   mean of coverage and conciseness.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel and simple method is developed for the green
   synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by carboxymethylated curdlan
   (CMC), which served as both reducing and stabilizing agent in an aqueous
   medium. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy,
   HR-TEM, DLS, XRD and FT-IR measurements. Results indicate that the
   particle size decreases with increase in reaction time and CMC
   concentration. The as-synthesized AuNPs were spherical and monodispersed
   with a mean particle size of similar to 16 nm. FT-IR spectra indicated
   that the as-synthesized AuNPs could readily bind covalently with the
   carboxylate groups of CMC molecules in the reaction medium. During the
   synthesis process, the heat treatment of the CMC and HAuCl4 suspension
   could induce the conformation transition from the triple helix to single
   flexible chains. In addition, the as-prepared AuNPs exhibit almost
   negligible cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States of America.
   On April 14, 1865, shortly after his re-election and the conclusion of
   the Civil War, Lincoln was shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth.
   Although numerous physicians tended to the President shortly after his
   injury, he passed away the next morning. Today, we recognize Lincoln as
   one of the greatest Presidents in American history. His assassination
   profoundly influenced the future of the United States, especially as the
   country was coming back together again following the Civil War.
   Testaments to his lasting legacy can be seen in many places, from the
   stone carving of him on Mount Rushmore to his image gracing the \$5
   bill.
   What if the President had survived his injury? Would he have had a
   different outcome utilizing current critical care treatment? Neurotrauma
   care in 1865 was not yet developed, and head wounds such as the one
   Lincoln sustained were almost always fatal. The medical attention he
   received is considered by historians and physicians today to be
   excellent for that time. We look at the evolution of neurotrauma care
   during the last 150 years in the US. Particular focus is paid to the
   advancement of care for penetrating brain injuries in modern trauma
   centers.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between SDS and the swollen lamellar phase of an A-B-A
   type nonionic siloxane surfactant IM-22 in 60 \% glycerol has been
   investigated with macroscopic phase observation, FF-TEM, SAXS,
   conductivity, and rheology experiments. Without addition of SDS, 20 \%
   IM-22 forms highly swollen planar lamellar phase stabilized by strong
   thermal undulations. Upon addition of 1 mM SDS, the lamellae were
   transformed into giant multilamellar vesicles. The size of the vesicles
   decreases with increasing the amount of SDS below 5 mM whereas the
   number density of the vesicles increases. Further increasing the
   concentration of SDS leads to break of the vesicles. In this
   self-assembly transition process, the viscosity of the system exhibits
   maximum at 5 mM SDS, where the system owns property of gels.
   Conductivity measurements suggest that SDS starts to bind IM-22 at a
   concentration below 2 mM, but SAXS results reveal that the interlamellar
   spacings were not affected up to 5 mM. This was explained by the special
   interactions in this system. On the one hand, the ionization degree of
   SDS in 60 \% glycerol is very low due to the low dielectric constant,
   which results in lower charge density in the lamellae. Therefore,
   thermal undulations dominate the electrostatic forces at SDS
   concentration below 5 mM. On the other hand, the mutual phobic nature of
   SDS with IM-22 allows break of the lamellae at higher SDS
   concentrations.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a perturbation estimation based coordinated adaptive
   passive control (PECAPC) of generators excitation system and
   thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) devices for complex,
   uncertain and interconnected multimachine power systems. Discussion
   begins with the PECAPC design, in which the combinatorial effect of
   system uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances is
   aggregated into a perturbation term, and estimated online by a
   perturbation observer (PO). PECAPC aims to achieve a coordinated
   adaptive control between the excitation controller (EC) and TCSC
   controller based on the nonlinearly functional estimate of the
   perturbation. In this control scheme an explicit control Lyapunov
   function (CLF) and the strict assumption of linearly parametric
   uncertainties made on system structures can be avoided. A decentralized
   stabilizing EC for each generator is firstly designed. Then a
   coordinated TCSC controller is developed to passivize the whole system,
   which improves system damping through reshaping the distributed energies
   in power systems. Case studies are carried out on a single machine
   infinite bus (SMIB) and a three-machine system, respectively. Simulation
   results show that the PECAPC-based EC and TCSC controller can coordinate
   each other to improve the power system stability, finally a
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is carried out to verify its
   implementation feasibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a pH-dependent thermo-responsive polymer (poly
   (N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid-co-ethyl methacrylate,
   P(NIPAAm-co-MAA-co-EMA)), which was used as a masking functional module
   was designed and prepared. Its LCST was pH-dependent, leading to a
   sensitive isothermal phase transition between the blood and the
   extracellular environment of solid tumours. This masking polymer had a
   LCST of 36.4 degrees C at pH 6.5, and remained hydrophilic at pH 7.4
   even when the temperature was increased to 50 degrees C. The
   liver-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) were then obtained by co-grafting the
   masking functional module and the targeting ligands glycyrrhetinic acid
   (GA) onto the gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). Their surface properties and
   targeting ability could be switched based on the expanding or shrinking
   behaviour of the polymers. The shielding/deshielding effect of GA was
   confirmed by the bovine serum albumin adsorption and cellular uptake.
   The results indicated that GA could be shielded by the hydrophilic
   P(NIPAAm-co-MAA-co-EMA) in the normal physiological environment (pH 7.4,
   37 degrees C) and deshielded in the tumour microenvironment of pH 6.5,
   40 degrees C, leading to an increase in cellular uptake as high as
   2.3-fold compared with that observed at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C. More
   importantly, the ultrasensitive phase transition of the polymer was
   reversible, which means that the targeting ability of the deshielded Au
   NPs could be reshielded if they come back to the blood circulation. (c)

   Grade 6 (ages 9-12years) for 1,171 children from multiple sources.
   Shyness-sensitivity positively contributed to social, school, and
   psychological difficulties over time, with the most consistent effects
   on peer preference and loneliness. Social and school adjustment
   negatively contributed to the development of shyness-sensitivity. The
   initial levels of shyness-sensitivity and social and school adjustment
   moderated the growth of each other, mainly as a resource-potentiating
   factor. The results indicate the significance of shyness-sensitivity for
   adjustment and the role of adjustment in the development of
   shyness-sensitivity in today's urban Chinese society.}},

Abstract = {{The potent and broad activity of Canis interferon a (CaIFN alpha) makes
   it an attractive candidate for the treatment of many viral diseases of
   dogs. Here, we fused CaIFN alpha to three different protein tags:
   thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and NusA (Nus), to
   facilitate its expression and purification in Escherichia coli. The
   Trx-CaIFN alpha and GST-CaIFN alpha fusion proteins formed inclusion
   bodies, while the Nus-CaIFN alpha, protein was soluble when expressed at
   low temperatures. Trx-CaIFN alpha was purified from inclusion bodies and
   refolded, while Nus-CaIFN alpha was purified under native conditions.
   The purity of Trx-CaIFN alpha and Nus-CaIFN alpha was greater than 90\%,
   and their yields were 74.8\% and 6.5\%, respectively. Both Trx-CaIFN
   alpha and Nus-CaIFN alpha had antiviral activity in vitro. Their
   anti-viral activity was 1.09 +/- 0.47 x 10(14) and 2.25 +/- 0.87 x
   10(12) U/mol, respectively, on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Both
   purification methods had advantages and disadvantages. A greater amount
   of Trx-CaIFN alpha was obtained, but refolding was required to obtain
   active protein. In contrast, soluble Nus-CaIFN alpha did not require
   refolding, which saved time and materials. However, Nus-CaIFN alpha,
   which contained a larger tag, had lower activity than Trx-CaIFN alpha.
   In general, we provided two protocols to obtain large amounts of CaIFN
   alpha with high antiviral activity. These protocols may promote the
   clinical development of CaIFN alpha in treating viral diseases in dog.

Abstract = {{To understand the ``elastic softening{''} of Li-Si alloys for the
   development of Li-ion batteries, the effect of stress-induced change of
   entropy on the mechanical properties of lithiated materials is examined
   within the theories of thermodynamics and linear elasticity. An approach
   is presented whereby the change of Gibbs free energy is governed by the
   change of the mixture entropy due to stress-induced migration of mobile
   atoms, from which the contribution of the change of the mixture entropy
   to the apparent elastic modulus of lithiated materials is determined.
   The reciprocal of the apparent elastic modulus of a lithiated material
   is a linear function of the concentration of mobile Li-atoms at a
   stress-free state and the square of the mismatch strain per unit mole
   fraction of mobile Li-atoms. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{Based on charge-discharge cycle tests for commercial nickel-metal
   hydride (Ni-MH) batteries, a nonlinear relationship is found between the
   discharging capacity (C-discharge, Ah) and the voltage changes in 1 s
   occurring at the start of the charging process (V-charge, mV). This
   nonlinear relationship between C-discharge and V-charge is described
   with a curve equation, which can be determined using a nonlinear
   least-squares method. Based on the curve equation, a curve model for the
   state-of-health (SOH) prediction is constructed without battery models
   and cycle numbers. The validity of the curve model is verified using
   (C-discharge, V-charge) data groups obtained from the charge-discharge
   cycle tests at different rates. The results indicate that the curve
   model can be effectively applied to predict the SOH of the Ni-MH
   batteries and the best prediction root-mean-square error (RMSE) can
   reach upto 1.2\%. Further research is needed to confirm the application
   of this empirical curve model in practical fields.}},

Abstract = {{How to effectively implement environmental management practices and

   has become crucial in both research and practice. Based on
   resource-based view (RBV) theory, a theoretical model to determine the
   relationship between environmental management practices, supply chain
   integration, supply chain knowledge sharing, and technological
   innovation performance was proposed. Based on data collected from one
   hundred and twelve Chinese manufacturing enterprises, the empirical
   results show that environmental management practices have a
   significantly positive influence on technological innovation
   performance, and supply chain integration plays a moderating role on the
   relationship. In addition, the results indicate that supply chain
   integration is also a predictive variable of technological innovation
   performance and supply chain knowledge sharing. Our findings suggest
   that practitioners should couple environmental management practices with
   supply chain integration to improve technological innovation performance
   in addition to environmental performance, which has been substantiated

Abstract = {{Given a graph and a set of service center nodes, a Capacity Constrained
   Network-Voronoi Diagram (CCNVD) partitions the graph into a set of
   contiguous service areas that meet service center capacities and
   minimize the sum of the shortest distances from graph-nodes to allotted
   service centers. The CCNVD problem is important for critical societal
   applications such as assigning evacuees to shelters and assigning
   patients to hospitals. This problem is NP-hard; it is computationally
   challenging because of the large size of the transportation network and
   the constraint that service areas must be contiguous in the graph to
   simplify communication of allotments. Previous work has focused on
   honoring either service area contiguity (e.g., Network Voronoi Diagrams)
   or service center capacity constraints (e.g., min-cost flow), but not
   both. Our preliminary work introduced a novel Pressure Equalizer (PE)
   approach for CCNVD to meet the capacity constraints of service centers
   while maintaining the contiguity of service areas. However, we find that
   the main bottleneck of the PE algorithm is testing whether service areas
   are contiguous. In this paper, we extend our previous work and propose
   novel algorithms that reduce the computational cost. Experiments using
   road maps from five different regions demonstrate that the proposed
   approaches significantly reduce computational cost for the PE approach.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Impaired left atrial (LA) deformation is noted in patients
   with severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR), but its prognostic value
   is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic
   significance of LA deformation parameters in patients with chronic
   severe primary MR.
   Methods: A total of 104 patients with asymptomatic chronic severe
   primary MR (Carpentier type II) and preserved left ventricular systolic
   function were prospectively recruited. Global peak positive strain of
   the left atrium (LASp) and strain rate in the LA filling phase (LASRr)
   as well as strain rate in the LA conduit phase were identified using
   two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography.
   Results: During a mean follow-up period of 13.2 +/- 9.5 months, 22
   patients reached a composite end point of death and mitral valve repair
   or replacement prompted by heart failure development. Among the clinical
   and echocardiographic parameters, LV end-systolic volume index (19.5 +/-
   9.5 vs 15.7 +/- 6.3 mL/m(2), P = .028), LASp (22.7 +/- 10.4\% vs 27.2
   +/- 9.1\%, P = .049), and LASRr (1.97 +/- 0.6 vs 2.33 +/- 0.6 1/sec, P =
   .013) varied between the two groups in terms of end points but not age,
   LA volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure, and presence of atrial fibrillation. After
   multivariate analysis, low LASp (odds ratio, 3.606; 95\% CI,
   1.294-10.052; P = .014) and low LASRr (odds ratio, 2.857; 95\% CI,
   1.078-7.572; P = .035) remained powerful outcome indicators.
   Conclusions: In patients with asymptomatic severe primary MR, reduced
   LASp and LASRr predicted a worse prognosis. These findings may offer
   additional information to guide early surgery.}},

Abstract = {{By extending the pseudo-Stroh formalism to multilayered one-dimensional
   orthorhombic quasicrystal plates, we derive an exact closed-form
   solution for simply supported plates under surface loadings. The
   propagator matrix method is introduced to efficiently and accurately
   treat the multilayered cases. As a numerical example, a sandwich plate
   made of quasicrystals and crystals with two different stacking sequences
   is investigated. The displacement and stress fields for these two
   stacking sequences are presented, which clearly demonstrate the
   importance of the stacking sequences on the induced physical quantities.
   Our exact closed-form solution should be of particular interest to the
   design of one-dimensional quasicrystal laminated plates. The numerical
   results can be further used as benchmarks to various numerical methods,
   such as the finite element and finite difference methods, on the
   analysis of laminated composites made of one-dimensional quasicrystals.}},

   with a quantum yield of 55\% and an enlarged Stokes of 56 nm in CHCl3
   due to the formation of dimers and the desymmetrization of the molecule,
   which can be used to image living cells by fluorescence microscopy. Cell

Abstract = {{SnO2-C fibers containing NiO (SnO2-NiO-C fibers) were synthesized by an
   electrospinning technique with subsequent calcination in an inert
   atmosphere using tin(II)2-ethylhexanoate and nickel acetate as starting
   materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy
   (EDS), and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) were employed to
   characterize the as-obtained composite fibers, and electrochemical
   tests, including galvanostatic charge discharge and cyclic voltammetry
   (CV), were conducted to measure their electrochemical performance. The
   SnO2-NiO-C fibers were comprised of ultrafine particles of 1-2 nm size
   with poor crystallinity encapsulated in an amorphous carbon matrix, and
   a low-density of distribution nano-particles with a size of similar to
   50 nm were observed on the fibers surfaces. The SnO2-NiO-C fibers retain
   their capacity very well, and their reversible specific capacity is
   60-110 mA h g(-1), which is higher than that of SnO2-C fibers, at a
   current density of 50 mA g(-1) with a voltage range of 0.01-3.00 V.
   Their excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to their one
   dimensional (1D) structure with metal oxide particles embedded in a
   carbon matrix, and the synergistic effects of SnO2 and NiO. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, Pseudomonas R0-14, which was isolated from Arctic soil
   samples, showed a clear halo when grown on M9 medium agarose plates
   containing olive oil-rhodamine B as substrate, suggesting that it
   expressed putative lipase(s). A putative lipase gene, lipR, was cloned
   from R0-14 by genome walking and Touchdown PCR. lipR encodes a
   562-amino-acid polypeptide showing a typical alpha/beta hydrolase
   structure with a catalytic triad consisting of
   Ser(153)-Asp(202)-His(260) and one alpha-helical lid (residues 103-113).
   A phylogenetic analysis revealed that LipR belongs to the lipase
   subfamily I.3. LipR was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli,
   purified, and biochemically characterized. Recombinant LipR exhibited
   its maximum activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate at pH 8.5 and 60
   degrees C with a K-m of 0.37 mM and a k(cat) of 6.42 s(-1). It retained
   over 90\% of its original activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for
   12 h. In addition, LipR was activated by Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+,
   while strongly inhibited by Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Moreover, it showed a certain tolerance
   to organic solvents, including acetonitrile, isopropanol, acetone,

   h, there was an enrichment of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
   acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (1.22\%, 1.65-fold),
   docosapentaenoic acid (21.24\%, 2.04-fold), and docosahexaenoic acid

   unreachable from nodes outside the closed cluster. Based on closed
   clusters, there is a Brouwerian structure under the run-time memory. We
   present the Brouwerian model and discuss its properties,
   transformations, and applications. We also propose a two-counter

Title = {{Impact of shear stress and simulated microgravity on osteocytes using a
   new rotation cell culture device}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{286-298}},

Abstract = {{Osteocytes sense the mechanical loading and weightlessness, and
   orchestrate bone remodeling by directing both osteoblast and osteoclast
   functions. Previous studies mostly focused on the impact of mechanical
   loading or microgravity on the osteocyte changes in themselves. However
   as the mechanosensors, it is more meaningful to make clear whether and
   how the mechanosensitivity of osteocytes affected by weightlessness,
   since the alteration of mechanosensitivity may further affect the
   mechanotransduction process in osteocytes, and finally altered the bone
   remodeling process. Whereas until now, this aspect had long been
   overlooked and was still not clear yet.
   To investigate how osteocytes respond to shear stress under
   weightlessness, a novel custom-made device was designed to simulate
   microgravity and load fluid flow on cells in vitro at the same time. The
   osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 was loaded by this novel device at 15
   dyn/cm(2) shear stress with 15 rpm rotating speed. There were two
   loading durations for different determinations; 30 min of loading for
   the detection of nitric oxide and Prostaglandin E2, and 6 h of loading
   for the detection of three bone formation biomarkers (alkaline
   phosphatase, osteocalcin and procollagen type I N propeptide). In order
   to preliminarily explore the mechanism of this altered response to
   mechanical loading with different gravity in osteocytes, an observation
   of cytoskeleton and the determination of the elements in the
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway were also performed after 6 h of
   loading. The results showed that (1) the mechanical response of both NO
   and PGE2 were increased higher during 15-30 min of shear stress under
   simulated microgravity than that under normal gravity; (2) the
   mechanical response of ALP activity was decreased, while that of OC and
   PINP content were increased by simulated microgravity. Moreover, the ALP
   activity and the OC content were related to the activity of Wnt
   signaling pathway, which plays a key role in regulating the bone
   formation; (3) the exploration for the mechanism of altered mechanical
   bio-response in osteocytes showed that F-actin filaments enhanced by
   shear stress under simulated microgravity were not so robust as that
   showed under normal gravity, and some short dendritic processes at cell
   periphery were only observed within the simulated microgravity groups;
   (4) further, the simulated microgravity significantly inhibited the
   mechanosensitivity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway on protein
   level in the osteocytes.
   These results suggested that the mechanosensitivity of osteocytes was
   altered by simulated microgravity, and this may be an adverse effect on
   the osteoblastic bone formation whereas be good for osteoclastogenesis.
   The findings in this study may provide an important clue for searching
   an efficient approach to prevent osteocytes from changing the
   orchestration for bone remodeling under microgravity, and further this
   prevention may finally make the physical exercises capable against bone
   loss under microgravity. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising technology for energy
   harvesting from biomass; however, previously reported MFCs with
   wild-type or biologically modified exoelectrogenic bacteria such as
   Shewanella oneidensis have often exhibited poor performance in
   generating electricity from sugars. Herein, a synthetic
   fermenter-exoelectrogen (Escherichia coli-S. oneidensis) microbial
   consortium was developed to expand the spectrum of carbon sources for
   MFC through establishing a highly electroactive anodic biofilm by
   rationally tuning its microbial community profile to favor efficient
   electron transfer. Specifically, a synthetic riboflavin pathway from
   Bacillus subtilis was incorporated into E. coli to overproduce flavins
   to facilitate flavin-mediated electron transfer, and a highly
   hydrophobic S. oneidensis strain CP2-1-S1 was adopted as the
   exoelectrogen to increase its adhesion to the carbon electrode. The
   highly hydrophobic interactions between S. oneidensis and the anode
   along with the overproduced flavins (increased from 3.3 mu M to 115.2 mu
   M) by the recombinant E. coli provided a definite advantage for S.
   oneidensis over E. coli in the attachment to the anode surface. Compared
   with the structure of the wild-type community immobilized on the anode,
   the cell number of S. oneidensis increased by similar to 3 times,
   whereas the cell number of E. coli decreased by 93.3\% in the engineered
   electrode-attached community. Such rationally engineered anodic biofilm
   with the tuned microbial community profile (the percentage of S.
   oneidensis cells in the anodic biofilm increased from 48.2\% to 98.2\%)
   showed a much higher catalytic current (from 0.19 to 1.84 A/m(2) at 0 V
   vs SHE). The xylose-fed MFC inoculated with our engineered microbial
   consortium generated a maximum power density of 728.6 mW/m(2), which was
   6.8 times higher than that inoculated with wildtype coculture (92.8
   mW/m(2)).}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures due to chloride
   penetration followed by reinforcement corrosion has been a serious
   problem in civil engineering for many years. The numerical simulation
   methods at present are mainly finite element method (FEM) and finite
   difference method (FDM), which are based on mesh. Mesh generation in
   engineering takes a long time. In the present article, the numerical
   solution of chloride transport in concrete is analyzed using radial
   point interpolation method (RPIM) and element-free Galerkin (EFG). They
   are all meshless methods. RPIM utilizes radial polynomial basis, whereas
   EFG uses the moving least-square approximation. A Galerkin weak form on
   global is used to attain the discrete equation, and four different
   numerical examples are presented. MQ function and appropriate parameters
   have been proposed in RPIM. Numerical simulation results are compared
   with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM) and analytical
   solutions. Two case of chloride transport in full saturated and
   unsaturated concrete are analyzed to test the practical applicability
   and performance of the RPIM and EFG. A good agreement is obtained among
   RPIM, EFG, and the experimental data. It indicates that RPIM and EFG are
   reliable meshless methods for prediction of chloride concentration in
   concrete structures.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
   combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) on vasculogenic mimicry (VM) channel
   formation in vitro and in vivo after a single-dose treatment and the
   underlying mechanism involved in supporting VM. In vitro model of
   three-dimensional cultures was used to test the effect of CA4P on the
   tube formation of Walker 256 cells. Western blot analysis was conducted
   to assess the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and
   VM-associated markers. W256 tumor-bearing rat model was established to
   demonstrate the effect of CA4P on VM formation and tumor hypoxia by
   double staining and a hypoxic marker pimonidazole. Anti-tumor efficacy
   of CA4P treatment was evaluated by tumor growth curve. Under hypoxic
   conditions for 48 h in vitro, W256 cells formed VM network associated
   with increased expression of VM markers. Pretreatment with CA4P did not
   influence the amount of VM in 3-D culture as well as the expression of
   these key molecules. In vivo, W256 tumors showed marked intratumoral
   hypoxia after CA4P treatment, accompanied by increased VM formation.
   CA4P exhibited only a delay in tumor growth within 2 days but rapid
   tumor regrowth afterward. VM density was positively related to tumor
   volume and tumor weight at day 8. CA4P causes hypoxia which induces VM
   formation in W256 tumors through HIF-1 alpha/EphA2/PI3K/matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP) signaling pathway, resulting in the consequent
   regrowth of the damaged tumor.}},

Abstract = {{Amplified PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is common in metastatic breast cancer
   (MBC). The mTOR inhibitor everolimus improves progression-free survival
   (PFS) when added to steroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy. This
   randomized phase II trial compares the efficacy of
   paclitaxel/bevacizumab/everolimus and paclitaxel/bevacizumab/placebo as
   first-line treatment for MBC. Patients with untreated HER2-negative MBC
   were randomized (1:1) to receive 28-day cycles of paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2)
   IV (days 1, 8, and 15) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV (days 1, 15) with
   either everolimus 10 mg (Arm 1) or placebo (Arm 2) daily. Treatment
   continued (evaluation every 8 weeks) until progression or unacceptable
   toxicity. Treatment of 110 patients allowed detection of an improvement
   in median PFS from 11 to 16 months (70 \% power, alpha = 0.10). Between
   August 2009 and June 2011, 113 patients (median age 58 years; 88 \% ER
   or PR positive) were randomized (Arm 1, 56; Arm 2, 57). Patients in both
   arms received a median of six treatment cycles. Median PFS (95 \% CI)
   was 9.1 months (6.8-18.8) for Arm 1, and 7.1 months (5.6-10.8) for Arm 2
   (p = 0.89). Comparisons of other efficacy endpoints were also similar in
   the two treatment arms. Patients receiving everolimus had more anemia,
   stomatitis, diarrhea, rash, and arthralgia/myalgia, although the overall
   incidence of severe (grade 3/4) toxicity was similar. The addition of
   everolimus did not improve the efficacy of weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab
   as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative MBC. These
   results contrast with the demonstrated efficacy of adding everolimus to
   either hormonal or HER2-targeted therapy in previously treated patients.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a gold electrode (GE) was modified by coating with two
   dimensional silica network/citrate capped gold
   nanoparticles-poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (GE-TDSN-CGNP-PDDA)
   for ultra-sensitive determination of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). After
   covalently binding of a silica network (in two-dimensional form) on the
   surface of a gold electrode, via twice in situ hydrolysis of
   3-mercaptopropyl-tri-ethoxysilane, citrate capped gold nanoparticles
   (CGNP) were chemically adsorbed on the silica cage. Subsequently, PDDA
   was bonded to CGNP via electrostatic interaction of positively charged
   polymer and negatively charged stabilizer of CGNP. Analytical properties
   of GE-TDSN-CGNP-PDDA were studied by Electrochemical Impedance
   Spectroscopy (EIS). The detection limit for measured BSA was found to be
   8.4 x 10(-13) mol L-1 and the measuring linear concentration range of
   the proposed sensor was 9.9 x 10(-12)-1.6 x 10(-10) mol L-1 of BSA. In
   addition, GE-TDSN-CGNP-PDDA exhibited good stability with high
   selectivity and was applied for determination of BSA in some samples
   with satisfactory results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A spontaneous fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant (STM1) was isolated from
   its parent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) clinical
   isolate. Unlike its parent isolate, this mutant has selective resistance
   to fluoroquinolones without any change in its sensitivity to various
   other antibiotics. DNA gyrase assays revealed that the fluoroquinolone
   resistance phenotype of the STM1 mutant did not result from alteration
   of the fluoroquinolone sensitivity of the DNA gyrase isolated from it.
   To study the mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance, a genomic library
   from the STM1 mutant was constructed in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and
   two recombinant plasmids were obtained. Only one of these plasmids
   (STM1-A) conferred the selective fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype to
   E. coli DH5 alpha. The chromosomal insert from STM1-A, digested with
   EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonucleases, produced two DNA fragments
   and these were cloned separately into pUC19 thereby generating two new
   plasmids, STM1-A1 and STM1-A2. Only STM1-A1 conferred the selective
   fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype to E. coli DH5a. Sequence and
   subcloning analyses of STM1-A1 showed the presence of an intact RecA
   open reading frame. Unlike that of the wild-type E. coli DH5 alpha,
   protein analysis of a crude STM1-A1 extract showed overexpression of a
   40 kDa protein. Western blotting confirmed the 40 kDa protein band to be
   RecA. When a RecA PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T and introduced into

Title = {{Why do male and female cane toads, Rhinella marina, respond differently
   to advertisement calls?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{141-147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The main function of male sexual advertisement calls is to attract
   females, and therefore, most studies of responses to calls focus on
   females. Males may, however, respond to the calls of other males in some
   species, for one of two reasons: (1) to parasitize the calling of an
   attractive male by sitting close by and mating with attracted females,
   or (2) to locate breeding aggregations. We hypothesized that if males
   were parasitizing the calls of other males, they would select calls with
   characteristics that attracted females. On the other hand, if they
   showed no preferences for call characteristics it would suggest that
   they used calls to locate breeding aggregations or other resources. We
   used as our model organism invasive cane toads, Rhinella marina, a
   species in which males and females both respond to conspecific
   vocalizations with phonotaxis. To determine preferences in call choice
   experiments, we used the natural calls of five males, with extreme and
   median call characteristics (dominant frequency and pulse rate). Female
   cane toads tended to prefer calls with low pulse rate and dominant
   frequency, which are indicative of large body size in males, compared to
   a call with median characteristics. Overall, females preferred the calls
   of larger males, and selected calls of the largest male that was smaller
   than themselves, possibly because mating between similar- sized
   individuals facilitates fertilization in anurans. Male cane toads
   exhibited strong and rapid phonotaxis, but showed no preferences for
   specific calls. We therefore concluded that male toads probably use
   acoustic signals as an indicator of the location of water, or of
   breeding sites, and thus potentially of females. Sexual differences in
   call preferences apparently reflect differences in the use of
   advertisement calls between the sexes in cane toads. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Current treatment options for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have side
   effects because of invasive application and topical application does not
   generally result in therapeutic levels in the target tissue. Therefore,
   improving the drug delivery to retina, following topical administration,
   might be a solution to DR treatment problems. The purpose of this study
   was to investigate the complexation effects of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)
   dendrimers on ocular absorption of dexamethasone (DEX). Using different
   PAMAM generations, complex formulations were prepared and characterized.
   Formulations were evaluated in terms of cytotoxicity and cell
   permeability, as well as ex vivo transport across ocular tissues. The
   ocular pharmacokinetic properties of DEX formulations were studied in
   Sprague-Dawley rats following topical and subconjunctival applications,
   to evaluate the effect of PAMAM on retinal delivery of DEX.
   Methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay indicated that all groups
   resulted in cell viability comparable to DEX solution (87.5\%), with the
   cell viability being the lowest for G3 complex at 73.5\%. Transport
   study results showed that dendrimer complexation increases DEX transport
   across both cornea and sclera tissues. The results of in vivo studies
   were also indicated that especially anionic DEX-PAMAM complex
   formulations have reached higher DEX concentrations in ocular tissues
   compared with plain DEX suspension. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and

Title = {{Intelligent Pump Operation and River Diversion Systems for Urban Storm
   Management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale networks of sewer pipes, control gates, and pump stations
   are the primary facilities of urban drainage systems for mitigating
   flood risks. During flooding periods, cooperation of pumps and control
   gates plays a major role in efficiently reducing flood inundation. In
   this study, a real-time optimization approach is developed to find
   optimal policies for collaborative operation of drainage facilities,
   including detention storage and control gates, and multiple pump
   stations. The online approach is a predictive control scheme based on a
   harmony search algorithm that provides actively optimal operational
   policies according to real-time rainfall information. Operational models
   are applied to a prototype network in a portion of the Seoul urban
   drainage system, and results are compared with those of traditional
   operating rules. A high efficiency for the operational model of both the
   river diversion system and pump stations in terms of flood mitigation is
   demonstrated. For the river diversion system, considering several
   rainfall events, active control of the gates provides in average 48\%
   peak discharge reduction in target points against 26\% reduction
   obtained by a passive one. The active control can provide mostly 47\%
   improvement compared with the passive policy just by delaying and
   controlling the release of storm water into detention storages. In
   parallel, the optimal online pump station operation decreases the
   collected storm water peaks by an average of 33 and 21\% in two studied
   pump stations compared with the conventional approach even when a
   smaller number of pump switches (15\% in average) is used, an advantage
   related to maintenance costs. More specifically, for the six separate
   rainfall events considered, the optimal policies mostly eliminate the
   storm water depth violations in pump stations, whereas there is a
   considerable violation for all events when the traditional operating
   rules are used. These results show that optimizing pumping operations is
   a practical and highly effective way to reduce flood volumes and urban
   inundation without making changes to the existing system infrastructure.

Abstract = {{Corrosion of metals causes tremendous financial loss and disasters every
   year. Graphene is a promising candidate for anti-corrosion coating, due
   to its unique properties, e.g. chemical inertness, impermeability and
   high conductivity. Despite being a commercially important material, it
   is difficult to grow graphene on carbon steels and is therefore
   prominently grown on copper or nickel substrates. Here, we report a
   unique approach to grow graphene on carbon steel and explore its
   anti-corrosion application. By introducing Ni element into carbon steel
   through a laser alloying process to form a Ni/Fe alloy catalyst, we make
   it feasible to grow graphene on carbon steel. The corrosion rate of
   graphene covered carbon steel is only 0.05 mm/year, much lesser than
   that of the stainless steel (0.09 mm/year). The corrosion resistance is
   up to similar to 1900 Omega cm(2), which is almost 7 times that of
   original steel (270.7 Omega cm(2)). These results indicate that the in
   situ grown graphene coatings perform very well in resisting harsh
   environments, much better than stainless steel itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While bacteria have been primarily studied for phosphorus (P) removal in

   intracellular polyphosphate are less investigated. P-accumulating fungal
   strains were screened from soybean plants and surrounding soil by flask

   circinelloides was selected for its high efficiency in P removal
   efficiency and high cellular P content. Neisser staining and
   growth-curve analysis confirmed that M. circinelloides stored
   polyphosphate intracellularly by luxury phosphate uptake. The effect of
   culture medium compositions on P removal efficiency and cellular P
   content was also investigated. Monosaccharides (such as glucose and
   fructose) and organic nitrogen (N, such as urea, and peptone) promoted
   fungi growth and P accumulation. M. circinelloides also preferred
   organic phosphates. When glucose, urea, and phytic acid sodium salt were
   used as the carbon, N, and P source, respectively, the maximum
   utilization efficiency was 40.1 \% for P and 7.08 \% for cellular P
   content. In addition, the potential of M. circinelloides for P removal
   from waste streams was investigated. Compared with the non-inoculated
   control culture, inoculation with M. circinelloides improved the soluble
   P removal in treating wastewater centrate, screened manure, and digested

Abstract = {{Under maternal inheritance, mitochondrial genomes are prone to
   accumulate mutations that exhibit male-biased effects. Such mutations
   should, however, place selection on the nuclear genome for modifier
   adaptations that mitigate mitochondrial-incurred male harm. One gene
   region that might harbor such modifiers is the Y-chromosome, given the
   abundance of Y-linked variation for male fertility, and because Y-linked
   modifiers would not exert antagonistic effects in females because they
   would be found only in males. Recent studies in Drosophila revealed a
   set of nuclear genes whose expression is sensitive to allelic variation
   among mtDNA-and Y-haplotypes, suggesting these genes might be entwined
   in evolutionary conflict between mtDNA and Y. Here, we test whether
   genetic variation across mtDNA and Y haplotypes, sourced from three
   disjunct populations, interacts to affect male mating patterns and
   fertility across 10 days of early life in D. melanogaster. We also
   investigate whether coevolved mito-Y combinations outperform their
   evolutionarily novel counterparts, as predicted if the interacting
   Y-linked variance is comprised of modifier adaptations. Although we
   found no evidence that coevolved mito-Y combinations outperformed their
   novel counterparts, interactions between mtDNA and Y-chromosomes
   affected male mating patterns. These interactions were dependent on male
   age; thus male reproductive success was shaped by G x G x E
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although metabolic syndrome was suggested to be a risk factor for
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of metabolic stress in the initiation
   of AD pathology remains unclear. In this study, metabolic stress was
   induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose injection of streptozotocin
   (HFSTZ) before the appearance of senile plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic
   mice. We found that, HFSTZ treatment exacerbated amyloid beta burden and
   astrocyte activation in the vicinity of plaques. Moreover, we observed
   an upregulation of astrocytic S100B expression in the brain parenchyma
   of HFSTZ-treated APP/PS1 mice concurrent with increased interleukin-6
   expression in cerebral microvascular cells. To determine the impact of
   HFSTZ treatment on brain function, we performed {[}F-18]
   fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and analyzed nesting
   behavior. HFSTZ treatment impaired nest construction and cerebral
   glucose metabolism in several brain regions of APP/PS1 mice during the
   early stage of AD. These results suggest that HFSTZ-induced peripheral
   metabolic stress may contribute to vascular inflammation and astrocyte
   reactivity in the parenchyma and may impair activity of daily living
   skill and cerebral glucose metabolism in APP/PS1 mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is effective in the treatment of neuropathic
   pain in clinical practice. Its application to sites proximal to nerve
   injury can inhibit the activity of extra-cellular signal-regulated
   kinase (ERK) for up to 28 days. The spared nerve injury (SNI)+ immPRF
   group (immediate exposure to PRF for 6 min after SNI) exhibited a
   greater anti-allodynic effect compared with the control group (SNI
   alone) or the SNI + postPRF group (application of PRF for 6 min on the
   14th day after SNI). Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was selected
   using microarray assays and according to web-based gene ontology
   annotations in the SNI + immPRF group. An increase in IGF2 and
   activation of ERK1/2 were attenuated by the immPRF treatment compared
   with an SNI control group. Using immunofluorescent staining, we detected
   co-localized phosphorylated ERK1/2 and IGF2 in the dorsal horn regions
   of rats from the SNI group, where the IGF2 protein predominantly arose
   in CD11b- or NeuN-positive cells, whereas IGF2 immunoreactivity was not
   detected in the SNI + immPRF group. Taken together, these results
   suggest that PRF treatment immediately after nerve injury significantly
   inhibited the development of neuropathic pain with a lasting effect,
   most likely through IGF2 down-regulation and the inhibition of ERK1/2
   activity primarily in microglial cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of a selfless overlay system is considered for
   a frequency-selective bandlimited linear time-invariant channel already
   occupied by a legacy system. It is assumed that the transmitted signal
   by the legacy system is well modeled by a zero-mean second-order
   cyclostationary (SOCS) Gaussian random process. It is also assumed that
   the legacy receiver employs a linear-conjugate linear (LCL) filter to
   capture possible impropriety of the signal. Our objective is to maximize
   the throughput of the overlay system under the constraint that no
   interfering signal component is observed at the output of the legacy LCL
   filter sampled at a uniform rate. A relevant problem of deriving the
   constrained capacity of a discrete-time vector Gaussian noise channel is
   first examined. Then, it is shown that the optimal input to the overlay
   channel must be a zero-mean SOCS Gaussian random process. Using these
   results, the optimization problem is formulated in the frequency domain,
   and the procedure named orthogonal cyclic water filling (O-CWF) is
   derived to find the optimal channel input distribution. Numerical
   results are provided to show that the proposed selfless overlay scheme
   enables reliable communication even over a channel fully occupied by a
   legacy system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with main types of operational-territorial units used
   in the spatial analysis of slope erosion development. The analysis of
   the entire system of operational-territorial units used in the study of
   slope erosion processes in the plains of the temperate zone of the
   Earth, shows that a drainage (river) basin is an operational and
   territorial unit most suitable for this purpose. This is because of the
   fact that the basins are a geosystemic formation and reflect the
   specific nature of surface slope runoff, due to which a range of
   erosional processes occurs. An important feature of the basin approach
   is the simplicity in defining these units in the geographical space and
   the reasonable transition to other scale levels due to hierarchy feature
   of river basins. Their limited use is associated with the landscape
   specifics of the terrain: such as ice and arid zones of the Earth. We
   have electronically mapped the territory of lowland and upland
   landscapes of the eastern part of the Russian Plain with total area of
   150,000 km(2) by defining the boundaries of 3,331 basins used in the
   analysis of soil and gully natural-artificial erosion. Other types of
   operational-territorial units such as the regular geometric grids, the
   political-administrative division, and sample characteristics can be
   used for collection of data geobank but poorly suited for identification
   of erosion patterns. Landscape territorial units allow performing a
   stiffly accurate spatial analysis of erosion and its determining
   factors. The factor limiting their use is the complexity of landscapes
   defining, lack of their internationally standardized taxonomy and poor
   cartographic exploration of the territory at regional and local
   generalization levels.}},

Abstract = {{Hibernia is Canada's largest offshore oil platform. Produced water is
   the major waste byproduct discharged into the ocean. In order to
   evaluate different potential disposal methods, a comprehensive study was
   performed to determine the impact from the discharge. Microorganisms are
   typically the first organisms to respond to changes in their
   environment. The objectives were to characterize the microbial
   communities and the chemical composition in the produced water and to
   characterize changes in the seawater bacterial community around the
   platform. The results from chemical, physicochemical, and microbial
   analyses revealed that the discharge did not have a detectable effect on
   the surrounding seawater. The seawater bacterial community was

   Thermoanaerobacter were found in the produced water.
   Thermoanaerobacter-specific q-PCR and nested-PCR primers were designed,

   track the dispersion of produced water into the surrounding ocean.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main aims of early phase clinical trials is to identify a
   safe dose with an indication of therapeutic benefit to administer to
   subjects in further studies. Ideally therefore, dose-limiting events
   (DLEs) and responses indicative of efficacy should be considered in the
   dose-escalation procedure. Several methods have been suggested for
   incorporating both DLEs and efficacy responses in early phase
   dose-escalation trials. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a
   Bayesian adaptive approach based on one binary response (occurrence of a
   DLE) and one continuous response (a measure of potential efficacy) per
   subject. A logistic regression and a linear log-log relationship are
   used respectively to model the binary DLEs and the continuous efficacy
   responses. A gain function concerning both the DLEs and efficacy
   responses is used to determine the dose to administer to the next cohort
   of subjects. Stopping rules are proposed to enable efficient decision
   making. Simulation results shows that our approach performs better than
   taking account of DLE responses alone. To assess the robustness of the
   approach, scenarios where the efficacy responses of subjects are
   generated from an E-max model, but modelled by the linear log-log model
   are also considered. This evaluation shows that the simpler log-log
   model leads to robust recommendations even under this model showing that
   it is a useful approximation to the difficulty in estimating E-max
   model. Additionally, we find comparable performance to alternative
   approaches using efficacy and safety for dose-finding. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The most well-known ailment affecting the neck muscles is neck
   stiffness, caused by sharp changes in temperature, chilling of the
   muscles by air conditioning or drafts, and consequent painful muscle
   contractions. A stiff neck is typically characterized by soreness and
   difficulty in moving the neck especially when trying to turn the head to
   the side. A stiff neck may also be accompanied by a headache, neck pain,
   shoulder pain and/or arm pain. Reduced cervical range of motion (ROM) is
   a common finding in people with neck pain. Musculoskeletal disorders
   continue to represent a major source of pain and discomfort as well as a
   significant source of workday loss and workers' compensation costs.
   In this study, the effects of parameters in air conditioning such as
   temperature, humidity and air velocity on cervical ROM have been
   investigated experimentally. In this investigation, each of the three
   parameters was used as a variable while the others were kept constant in
   a controlled laboratory room, and the effects of the parameter
   variations were investigated. Based on the observation that individuals
   often enter the air conditioned room perspiring in summer conditions,
   both dry and sweaty conditions were examined. Finally, experimental data
   were assessed with ANOVA analyses, and cervical rotation was found to be
   influenced by temperature and air velocity, but not humidity. It was
   also determined that parameters (temperature, air velocity and humidity)
   are not effective factors on cervical motion limitation provided that
   indoor air conditions remain within comfort limits which are prescribed
   in current standards of ASHRAE Standard 55 - 2004 and ISO 7730. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Reconfigurable antennas (RA) offer an emerging technology that allows
   wireless devices to alter their antenna states determined by different
   radiation patterns to maximize received signal strength. In this paper,
   we consider multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
   cognitive heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and we study the potential
   benefits of employing RA in terms of improving the overall network
   capacity. In cognitive HetNets, a secondary network is allowed to share
   the spectrum with the primary network under the condition that the
   interference level experienced by the primary network is below a
   predetermined threshold. To satisfy this interference constraint, a
   secondary user (SU) employs a power control mechanism, which typically
   limits its transmission power and thus reduces substantially its
   performance. Moreover, the large number of users expected for
   next-generation networks brings dense interference to the secondary
   network and, as such, even efficient interference mitigation and
   resource allocation techniques can fail in maintaining an acceptable
   performance level for the network. In this work, we consider utilizing
   RA technology at SUs to act as an additional resource in terms of
   selecting antenna radiation patterns that improve received signal
   strength among SUs. This also limits the mutual interference between the
   secondary and primary networks. We propose a game theoretical framework
   for jointly selecting the subcarriers as well as the RA antenna state at
   each SU that maximizes the overall capacity of the network while meeting
   the interference target in the primary network. Using potential games
   that guarantee the existence of a Nash equilibrium, our results show
   that, by selecting the best RA state and subcarriers for each SU, the
   capacity of the secondary network increases substantially compared to a
   scenario with conventional omnidirectional antennas.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe, idiopathic, immuno-mediated,
   inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. We
   examined the clinical features between male and female NMO patients, for
   which not much data exist. One hundred and eight Chinese Han patients
   with NMO were analysed retrospectively, all had been detected for the
   aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody using a cell-based assay. Of 108 NMO
   patients, 92 were female and 16 were male (female/male = 5.75).
   Ninety-four (87\%) were positive for the AQP4 antibody in their serum
   and/or cerebral spinal fluid. Aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMO patients
   had a higher female/male ratio than the negative group (P = 0.001).
   Female NMO patients had a higher positive rate of the AQP4 antibody than
   male NMO patients (92.4 vs 56.3\%, P = 0.001). All NMO male patients
   were divided according to their AQP4 antibody status. 77.8\% (7/9) of
   patients in the seropositive group had initial optic neuritis, while
   only one patient (14.3\%, 1/7) in the negative group had optic neuritis
   (P = 0.041). Limb paraesthesia was reported in only one patient in the
   negative group (11.1\%), but it was reported in all patients in the
   positive group (100\%) (P = 0.001). The mean length of vertebral
   segments of the spinal cord lesions was 3.6 +/- 1.3 in the positive
   group, while it was 6.6 +/- 2.6 in the negative group (P < 0.0001). The
   involvement of the cervical spinal cord was found in 88.9\% (8/9) of the
   positive members, but only 11.1\% in the negative group (P = 0.009).
   However, the involvement of the thoracic spinal cord was found in 22.2\%
   of patients in the positive group and 85.7\% of patients in the negative
   members (P = 0.041). In conclusion, male NMO is rare and has a low
   positive rate of AQP4 antibody.}},

Abstract = {{In order to probe the effects of substituents (F and CN) attached to
   benzo{[}1,2-b:3,4-b':5,6-b `'] tristhianaphthene (BTTP) on their charge
   carrier transport properties, we investigated the characteristics of
   molecular structures and charge transport properties of BTTP and its
   derivatives (BTTP1, BTTP2, BTTP3, BTTP4, and BTTP5). Six crystal
   structures were predicted by the Monte Carlo-simulated annealing method
   with the embedded electrostatic potential charges method. Even a subtle
   change of geometrical structures may result in a great change of the
   reorganization energy. With increasing numbers of substituted fluorine
   atoms, the reorganization energy of the BTTP derivative increases, which
   is disadvantageous to the electron transport. In contrast, the
   attachment of the electron-withdrawing cyano groups to BTTP decreases
   the reorganization energy and raises the electron affinity, which is
   beneficial to electron injection and charge carrier stabilization. The
   introduction of cyano groups also results in an enhancement of pi-pi
   interaction and leads to an increase in the transfer integrals. Among
   the six compounds, the novel compound BTTP4 has the largest electron
   mobility (1.154 cm(2).V-1.s(-1)) on account of its larger transfer
   integral and smaller reorganization energy, indicating that BTTP4 is a
   promising high-performance n-type organic semiconductor and worth to
   synthesize. The analysis of angular-resolution anisotropic mobilities
   for the BTTP and BTTP4 shows that it is helpful to control the
   orientations of the conducting channels for a better charge transport
   efficiency. This work provides a rational strategy for the design of
   high-performance n-type organic semiconductors from molecule to crystal
   structure.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The precuneus is 1 of the major cortical hubs and plays an
   important role in normal aging and verbal fluency processing. The main
   aim of present study was to investigate how intrinsic brain activity in
   the precuneus at rest predicts individual differences in verbal fluency
   ability among elderly adults. Method: Regional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis and a correlation-based
   functional connectivity (FC) approach were used to analyze data acquired
   from 101 cognitively normal elderly. Results: ALFF in the precuneus
   declined with normal aging and was significantly correlated with
   individual differences in performance on the verbal fluency test (VFT).
   Specifically, ALFF in the precuneus was reduced in elderly with high
   fluency (HF) ability compared with those with low fluency (LF) ability.
   In addition, the HF individuals displayed increased functional
   connectivity of the precuneus with the lateral temporal area and
   prefrontal lobe, including the inferior frontal, medial frontal,
   superior temporal, middle temporal, and superior frontal gyri.
   Conclusion: Spontaneous activity in the precuneus could predict
   individual differences in verbal fluency processing. Our results suggest
   that spontaneous activity in the precuneus is an indicator of
   aging-related changes in semantic verbal fluency processing, or even a
   potential biomarker for the early detection of semantic verbal fluency
   deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to explore the relationship between anemia in children
   and levels of five minerals in blood. A sample consisted of 242 normal
   and 304 anemic children paired by sex and age. Hematological parameters
   were assessed using the Sysmex xs-800i hematology analyzer. Levels of
   zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) were
   measured by polarographic analysis. Differences in these elements
   between the anemic and normal groups were compared by ANOVA.
   Relationships between Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mg, and Hb levels were tested by
   Pearson's correlation analysis. The Mg level (1.51 +/- 0.30 mmol/L) of
   the moderately anemic group (a parts per thousand currency sign90 g/L)
   was significantly higher than that (1.36 +/- 0.30 mmol/L) of the mildly
   anemic (90 g/L a parts per thousand currency signHb < 110 g/L) and
   normal groups (1.31 +/- 0.30 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). The rate of moderate
   anemia (13.7 \%) in the higher Mg group (Mg > 1.57 mmol/L) was higher
   than that (5.3 \%) of the lower Mg group (Mg a parts per thousand
   currency sign1.57 mmol/L) (p < 0.01). The rate of moderate anemia (12.8

   umol/L) was higher than that (6.2 \%) of the higher Fe group (> 78.4
   umol/L) (p < 0.05). Hemoglobin was inversely correlated with Mg levels
   in the anemic group (p < 0.05). These results indicate that blood levels
   of Mg and Fe were correlated with anemic children aged 6 months to 3
   years. To prevent and treat anemia better, a combination of the levels
   of Hb, Mg, and Fe in whole blood is required.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHenoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is less common in adults and
   has been linked with a more severe clinical syndrome as well as a higher
   frequency of renal disease and internal malignancy. Renal involvement in
   adult HSP has been significantly associated with antecedent infections,
   pyrexia at time of first presentation, and purpura above the waist. We
   aim to evaluate the frequency of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous features
   and identify the predictive factors for renal involvement in Asian
   adults with HSP.
   MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of 48 adult Asian patients
   diagnosed with HSP based on the European League Against Rheumatism
   (EULAR) criteria at a tertiary hospital in Singapore between January
   2000 and December 2011.
   ResultsThe most common cutaneous manifestations were palpable purpura
   (73\%), papules (31\%), and petechiae (27\%). Forty-percent had
   cutaneous lesions extending above the waist. Fifteen patients (31\%) had
   gastrointestinal symptoms, 21 (44\%) had joint involvement, and 27
   (56\%) had renal disease. Seventy-percent of patients with pyrexia at
   presentation experienced renal disease, whereas only 30\% without
   pyrexia had renal involvement (P=0.018). Sixty-six percent of patients
   with purpura had renal involvement as compared to 31\% in those without
   purpura (P=0.049). The frequency of renal involvement in patients with
   purpura above the waist (52\%) was similar to those with purpura below
   the waist (55\%).
   ConclusionsOur study confirms that HSP in adults tends to be more severe
   with a high incidence of extracutaneous manifestations, especially renal
   disease. Pyrexia at presentation and the presence of purpura were
   significant predictive factors for renal involvement.}},

Abstract = {{We use template stripping to integrate metallic nanostructures onto
   flexible, stretchable, and rollable substrates. Using this approach,
   high-quality patterned metals that are replicated from reusable silicon
   templates can be directly transferred to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   substrates. First we produce stretchable gold nanohole arrays and show
   that their optical transmission spectra can be modulated by mechanical
   stretching. Next we fabricate stretchable arrays of gold pyramids and
   demonstrate a modulation of the wavelength of light resonantly scattered
   from the tip of the pyramid by stretching the underlying PDMS film. The
   use of a flexible transfer layer also enables template stripping using a
   cylindrical roller as a substrate. As an example, we demonstrate roller
   template stripping of metallic nanoholes, nanodisks, wires, and pyramids
   onto the cylindrical surface of a glass rod lens. These nonplanar
   metallic structures produced via template stripping with flexible and
   stretchable films can facilitate many applications in sensing, display,
   plasmonics, metasurfaces, and roll-to-roll fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated as field-emission sources
   owing to their high electrical conductivity and high aspect ratio.
   However, practical applications demand that the emission lifetime of
   CNTs be further improved. Since ZnO demonstrates impressive electrical
   and thermal conductivity, when coated on the surface of CNTs, it can
   allow the CNT field emitters to endure high electrical stress and high
   temperature. Moreover, ZnO nanostructures protect the CNT emitters from
   being bombarded by high-energy ions, which are accelerated by the high
   electric field. From the result of emission lifetime measurements at the
   emission current density of 100 mA/cm(2), we found that the emission
   lifetime was increased by more than a factor of 2 when ZnO had been
   coated onto the CNT emitters. The observation registers as an important
   contribution to the practical application of CNT emitters with long-term
   emission stability, as well as with high emission currents. In this
   work, we elucidate the detailed mechanism of long-term stability that
   can be achieved by coating ZnO nanostructures on the surface of CNTs.}},

Abstract = {{KIOST-HYU joint acoustics experiment was performed on the western
   shallow water off the Taean peninsula in the Yellow Sea in May 2013. In
   this paper, mid-frequency ( 6 similar to 16 kHz) bottom loss data
   measured in a grazing angle range of 17 similar to 60 degrees are
   presented and compared to the predictions obtained using a Rayleigh
   reflection model. The sediment structure of the experimental site was
   characterized by multi-layered sediment and the components of the
   surficial sediment consisted of various types of particles with a mean
   grain size of 5.9.. The model predictions obtained using the mean grain
   size were not in agreement with the measured bottom loss, and those
   obtained using the grain size of 4., which was estimated by an inversion
   process, showed a best fit to the measurements. It would be because the
   standard deviation of the gain-size distribution of surficial sediment
   is 4.3., which is much larger than those of other areas around the
   experimental site. Finally, the model predictions obtained using the
   geoacoustic parameters estimated from the inversion process for the
   surficial sediment layer and those corresponding to the mean grain size
   of 1.3. for lower layer are reasonably agreement with the measured
   bottom loss data.}},

Abstract = {{Although interferon-free antiviral treatment is expected to improve
   treatment of hepatitis C, it is unclear to what extent pre-existing
   drug-resistant amino acid substitutions influence response to therapy.
   The impact of pre-existing drug-resistant substitutions on virological
   response to daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy was studied
   in genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. Thirty-one
   patients were treated with daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 24 weeks.
   Twenty-six patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR), three
   patients experienced viral breakthrough, and two patients relapsed.
   Direct sequencing analysis of HCV showed the existence of
   daclatasvir-resistant NS5A-L31M or -Y93H/F variants in nine out of 30
   patients (30\%) prior to treatment, while asunaprevir-resistant NS3-D168
   mutations were not detected in any patient. All 21 patients with
   wild-type NS5A-L31 and -Y93 achieved SVR, whereas only four out of nine
   patients (44\%) with L31M or Y93F/H substitutions achieved SVR
   (P=0.001). Ultra-deep sequencing analysis showed that treatment failure
   was associated with the emergence of both NS5A-L31/Y93 and NS3-D168
   variants. NS5A-L31/Y93 variants remained at high frequency through
   post-treatment weeks 103 through 170, while NS3-D168 variants were
   replaced by wild-type in all patients. In conclusion, pre-existence of
   NS5A inhibitor-resistant substitutions compromised the response to
   daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy, and treatment failure
   was associated with the emergence of both NS5A-L31/Y93 and NS3-D168
   variants. While asunaprevir-resistant variants that emerged during
   therapy returned to wild-type, daclatasvir-resistant variants tended to
   persist in the absence of the drug. J. Med. Virol. 87:1913-1920, 2015.

Abstract = {{Maternal food intake has a significant effect on the fetal environment,
   and an inadequate maternal diet may result in intrauterine growth
   restriction. Intrauterine growth restriction newborn rat pups nursed by
   normal diet-fed dams exhibited rapid catch-up growth, which plays a
   critical role in the risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease in
   later life. Specifically, one-carbon metabolism in the liver plays a
   critical role in placental and fetal growth. Impaired functioning of
   one-carbon metabolism is associated with increased homocysteine levels.
   In this study, we applied a comprehensive proteomic approach to identify
   differential expression of proteins related to one-carbon metabolism in
   the livers of rat offspring as an effect of maternal food restriction
   during gestation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier
   PXD002578. We determined that betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase
   1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, and ATP synthase subunit
   beta mitochondrial (ATP5B) expression levels were significantly reduced
   in the livers of rat offspring exposed to maternal food restriction
   during gestation compared with in the offspring of rats fed a normal
   diet (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of betaine-homocysteine
   S-methyltransferase 1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, and
   ATP synthase subunit beta mitochondrial were negatively correlated with
   serum homocysteine concentration in male offspring exposed to maternal
   food restriction during gestation and normal diet during lactation.
   However, in female offspring only expression levels of
   methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 were negatively correlated
   with homocysteine concentration. This study shows that maternal food
   restriction during late gestation and normal diet during lactation lead
   to increased homocysteine concentration through disturbance of
   one-carbon metabolism in the livers of male offspring. This suggests
   that male offspring have an increased gender-specific susceptibility to
   disease in later life through fetal programming.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The main goal in radiotherapy is to deliver the absorbed dose
   within the target organs in highest possible amount, while the absorbed
   dose of the other organs, especially the critical organs, should be kept
   as low as possible. In this work, the absorbed dose to human organs for
   a new Sm-153 bone-seeking agent was investigated.
   Methods: Sm-153-(4-\{{[}(bis(phosphonomethyl)) carbamoyl]
   methyl\}-7,10-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododec- 1-yl)
   acetic acid (Sm-153-BPAMD) complex was successfully prepared. The
   biodistribution of the complex was investigated in male Syrian mice up
   to 48 h post injection. The human absorbed dose of the complex was
   estimated based on the biodistribution data of the mice by radiation
   absorbed dose assessment resource (RADAR) method. The target to
   non-target absorbed dose ratios for Sm-153-BPAMD were compared with
   these ratios for Sm-153-EDTMP.
   Results: The highest absorbed dose for Sm-153-BPAMD was observed in bone
   surface with 5.828 mGy/MBq. The dose ratios of the bone surface to the
   red marrow and to the total body for Sm-153-BPAMD were 5.3 and 20.0,
   respectively, while these ratios for Sm-153-EDTMP were 4.4 and 18.3,
   respectively. This means, for a given dose to the bone surface as the
   target organ, the red marrow (as the main critical organ) and the total
   body would receive lesser absorbed dose in the case of Sm-153-BPAMD.
   Conclusions: Generally, the human absorbed dose estimation of
   Sm-153-BPAMD indicated that all other tissues approximately received
   insignificant absorbed dose in comparison with bone surface and
   therefore can be regarded as a new potential agent for bone pain
   palliation therapy. (C) 2015 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.

Abstract = {{Photoperiod and/or temperature-sensitive male sterility is an
   economically effective pollination control system for hybrid crops
   production. This study reports some characteristics of a
   temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) in Brassica napus line,
   SP2S, which is a spontaneous mutation found in 2007. The fertility
   alteration in response to temperature was investigated under controlled
   environment conditions. The pollen abortion was observed under light and
   electron microscopes to investigate structural and cellular changes
   associated with male sterility. The results showed that the fertility of
   SP2S line was greatly influenced by temperature change 12-14 days prior
   to flowering while photoperiod had no obvious effect on it. The SP2S
   line became male sterile when daily maximum temperature was above 20 A
   degrees C and nearly fertile when lower than 15 A degrees C. The size of
   petal and stamen reduced while the pistil and nectary was normal with
   good seed set after open-pollination. Microscopic observation in this
   study revealed the extremely vacuolated and enlarged tapetal cells of
   PMC during meiosis, which was associated with pollen abortion. The
   microspores were bonded together and hardly released from tetrads due to
   the persistence of callose layer covering them. The cytoplasm of
   degenerated microspores was accompanied by early degraded tapetum. The
   fertility of SP2S was controlled by at least two recessive nuclear genes
   and all cultivars could restore the fertility of SP2S. Commercially
   valuable traits such as seed yield, seed quality,
   sclerotinia-resistance, lodging, and other agronomical traits of four
   F-1 hybrids of SP2S were as good as their counterparts from near
   isogenic line, SP2F. The recessive TGMS genes showed no adverse effect
   on the performance of F-1 hybrids. Thus, SP2S line is a promising TGMS
   for hybrid production in rapeseed and canola. This characterization
   study helped understanding the process of male sterility and producing
   super hybrids through this two-line pollination control system.}},

Abstract = {{The perforator method is a widely accepted standard method for
   evaluating formaldehyde contents in medium-density fiber board (MDF) and
   particle board in most countries in the world. However, the test
   consumes considerable amounts of toluene, which belongs to a category of
   poisonous organic solutions. This study was conducted to determine the
   formaldehyde content of MDF accurately by high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC), a method that uses significantly less amounts of
   organic solvents for extraction than other methods. Five extraction
   solvents, namely, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, methyl alcohol,
   dichloromethane, and petroleum ether, were used in the experiment.
   2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatization and HPLC analysis
   coupled with UV detection were conducted. Optimum micro-extraction was
   obtained by using acetonitrile, especially formaldehyde contents below 6
   mg/100 g. Three parallel tests demonstrated good average recoveries
   ranging from 95.4 to 97.9 \% and low relative standard deviations
   ranging from 1.1 to 2.9 \%, which is indicative of very high accuracy. A
   0.02 mg/100 g limit of detection was also obtained. The
   formaldehyde-DNPH derivatives remained stable for at least 48 h under
   ambient conditions, which indicates the applicability of the proposed
   method in the laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of vibration noise of propulsion motor, which is the main
   excitation source of ships, is of great significance for improving the
   acoustic stealth performance of ships. An established motor feet
   vibration transfer path analysis (TPA) model is used to determine the
   primary excitation source and transfer path. Hammering method is used to
   test the transfer function of the path and collect the response of
   reference and target points in the operation conditions. The TPA is
   carried out based on the experiment to identify the equivalent exciting
   force and to calculate the path contribution amount. The results show
   that in the frequency range of 1-1000 Hz, the vibration
   acceleration-level error of the synthetic response and the measured
   response is <3 dB, and hence the model is accurate and reliable.
   Recognized equivalent excitation force can be used for the simulation of
   excitation load. Contribution analysis results indicate the direction

Abstract = {{Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key signaling molecule
   downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and is a master
   regulator of multiple kinases in cells of epithelial and hematopoietic
   lineages. The physiological role of PDK1 in regulating skin and immune
   homeostasis is not known. Here we developed a mouse model in which PDK1
   is conditionally ablated in activated CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells,
   and mature keratinocytes through OX40-Cre recombinase expression. The
   resultant mice (PDK1-CK0) spontaneously developed severe dermatitis,
   skin fibrosis, and systemic T helper type 2 immunity, succumbing by 11
   weeks of age. Through a series of T-cell transfers, bone marrow
   reconstitutions, and crossing to lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, we
   demonstrate that ablation of PDK1 in keratinocytes is the major driver
   of disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic
   defects in the expression of key structural proteins including
   cytokeratin-10 and loricrin, resulting in increased keratinocyte
   turnover, which in turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, and
   immune-mediated destruction. Our results reveal PDK1 as a central
   regulator of keratinocyte homeostasis that prevents skin immune
   infiltration and inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) is involved in the development and
   progressions of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer; therefore,
   signaling pathways that regulate CCR7 expression may represent novel
   molecular therapeutic targets. Previous studies by our group revealed
   that CCR7 is important in colon cancer progression and a is linked with
   cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived prostaglandin (PG)E2. Induction of COX-2
   and membrane-associated PGE synthase 1 (mPGES-1), which are
   overexpressed in numerous cancer types, cooperatively enhance PGE2
   expression, which contributes to carcinogenesis and cancer progression.
   The present study investigated whether CCR7 expression is associated
   with the levels of mPGES-1-derived PGE2. The results showed that
   mPGES-1-dependent release of PGE2 was markedly induced in colon cancer
   cells after transient transfection with mPGES-1 overexpression vector,
   accompanied by elevated CCR7 expression. PGE2 levels and CCR7 expression
   were markedly attenuated in colon cancer cells in which mPGES-1 was
   blocked, which identified mPGES-1 as a potential therapeutic target for
   the regulation of CCR7 expression. Finally, overexpression of CCR7 was
   partly mediated through the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 313 signaling
   pathway dependent on the binding of mPGES-1-derived PGE2 to the
   prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Thus, in addition to inhibitors of mPGES-1
   expression, EP4 antagonists and AKT/GSK-3 beta inhibitors may emerge as
   potential therapeutics to reduce CCR7 expression in colon cancer.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{363-371}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The presence of sulfonamides (SAs) in aquatic environments has drawn
   increasing concern in recent years, but their environmental behaviors
   still remain unclear. This study investigated pH (1.0-11.0) effect on
   sulfadimethoxine (SDM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfathiazole (ST)
   adsorption by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with various surface
   oxygen contents (C-o, 2.88-7.65\%). The results showed that the
   adsorption was significantly affected by pH due to the change of SAs
   species. The calculated adsorption coefficients (K-d(+), K-d(0), and
   K-d(-)) for different SAs species (SA(+), SA(0), and SA(-)) followed the
   order of K-d(0) >> K-d(+) > K-d(-). The octanol-water partition
   coefficients (K-ow(pH)) of SAs at various pHs were calculated, and
   changed with pH significantly. A good linear relationship between the
   normalized adsorption coefficient (logK(oc)(pH)) and logK(ow)(pH) was
   observed (logK(oc)(pH) = a logK(ow)(pH) + b) for SDM (n = 54, R-2 =
   0.970), SMX (n = 48, R-2 = 0.973) and ST (n = 48, R-2 = 0.968)
   adsorption by CNTs. Moreover, both a and b decreased linearly with
   increasing Co. The relationship can be validated externally using
   adsorption data of SMX in the literature (n = 46, R-2 = 0.935). The
   results clearly reveal that the hydrophobic interactions are the main
   mechanism responsible for the pH-dependent SAs adsorption. (C) 2015

Title = {{A Novel Characteristic Frequency Bands Extraction Method for Automatic
   Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Hilbert Huang Transform}},

Abstract = {{Because roller element bearings (REBs) failures cause unexpected
   machinery breakdowns, their fault diagnosis has attracted considerable
   research attention. Established fault feature extraction methods focus
   on statistical characteristics of the vibration signal, which is an
   approach that loses sight of the continuous waveform features.
   Considering this weakness, this article proposes a novel feature
   extraction method for frequency bands, named Window Marginal Spectrum
   Clustering (WMSC) to select salient features from the marginal spectrum
   of vibration signals by Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). In WMSC, a
   sliding window is used to divide an entire HHT marginal spectrum (HMS)
   into window spectrums, following which Rand Index (RI) criterion of
   clustering method is used to evaluate each window. The windows returning
   higher RI values are selected to construct characteristic frequency
   bands (CFBs). Next, a hybrid REBs fault diagnosis is constructed, termed
   by its elements, HHT-WMSC-SVM (support vector machines). The
   effectiveness of HHT-WMSC-SVM is validated by running series of
   experiments on REBs defect datasets from the Bearing Data Center of Case
   Western Reserve University (CWRU). The said test results evidence three
   major advantages of the novel method. First, the fault classification
   accuracy of the HHT-WMSC-SVM model is higher than that of HHT-SVM and
   ST-SVM, which is a method that combines statistical characteristics with
   SVM. Second, with Gauss white noise added to the original REBs defect
   dataset, the HHT-WMSC-SVM model maintains high classification accuracy,
   while the classification accuracy of ST-SVM and HHT-SVM models are
   significantly reduced. Third, fault classification accuracy by
   HHT-WMSC-SVM can exceed 95\% under a Pmin range of 500-800 and a m range
   of 50-300 for REBs defect dataset, adding Gauss white noise at Signal
   Noise Ratio (SNR) = 5. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
   WMSC method yields a high REBs fault classification accuracy and a good
   performance in Gauss white noise reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: This animal study aimed to define the underlying
   cellular mechanisms of intestinal barrier dysfunction. Methods: Rats
   were fed 4\% with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce experimental
   colitis. We analyzed the sugars in 24-hour urine output by high pressure
   liquid chromatography. The expression of claudins, mannan-binding lectin
   (MBL), and MBL-associated serine proteases 2 (MASP-2) were detected in
   the colonic mucosa by immunohistochemistry; and apoptotic cells in the
   colonic epithelium were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling method
   assay. Results: The lactulose and sucralose excretion levels in the
   urine of rats with DSS-induced colitis were significantly higher than
   those in the control rats. Mannitol excretion was lower and
   lactulose/mannitol ratios and sucralose/mannitol ratios were
   significantly increased compared with those in the control group
   (p<0.05). Compared with the controls, the expression of sealing claudins
   (claudin 3, claudin 5, and claudin 8) was significantly decreased, but
   that of claudin 1 was increased. The expression of pore-forming claudin
   2 was upregulated and claudin 7 was downregulated in DSS-induced
   colitis. The epithelial apoptotic ratio was 2.8\% 1.2\% in controls and
   was significantly increased to 7.2\% 1.2\% in DSS-induced colitis. The
   expression of MBL and MASP-2 in the intestinal mucosa showed intense
   staining in controls, whereas there was weak staining in the rats with
   colitis. Conclusions: There was increased intestinal permeability in
   DSS-induced colitis. Changes in the expression and distribution of
   claudins, increased epithelial apoptosis, and the MASP-2-induced immune
   response impaired the intestinal epithelium and contributed to high
   intestinal permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Class action lawsuits can be detrimental to debtholders because they
   deteriorate defendant firms' financial position and lower these firms'
   value. This study examines whether banks price their borrowers'
   litigation risk in debt contracting. We find that banks charge 19\%
   higher interest spreads on loans to lawsuit firms after litigation. In
   addition, banks monitor lawsuit firms more closely by using tighter
   non-price terms. The results are robust after correcting for possible
   endogeneity issues using the propensity score matching approach. We
   further find that the effects of lawsuit filing are more pronounced for
   firms with weaker corporate governance. Following a lawsuit in the
   industry, banks also perceive an increased likelihood of litigation for
   industry peer firms and adjust price and non-price terms accordingly.
   Finally, we find that the magnitude of the lawsuit filing effect is
   greater for firms with lower ex-ante litigation risk. Taken as a whole,
   our findings suggest that banks, as informed stakeholders, perceive
   litigation risk to be detrimental and price this risk in debt
   contracting.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of water and soil resources has attracted the attention
   of governments and scientists world-wide. The loss of these resources is
   a serious problem in the Taihang Mountains, and the emerging issue with
   water has threatened the livelihoods of local residents and the
   sustainability of this region. A simple distributed soil erosion and
   sediment yield model (DSESYM) has been developed based on WetSpa
   extension. The effect of land-use change on surface runoff and sediment
   yield was then analyzed through applying the model in the Chongling
   watershed. Taking the land-use distribution of the watershed in 2000 as
   the baseline, fourteen scenarios were performed to characterize the
   effect of land-use change on surface runoff and sediment load relative
   to the baseline condition. These scenarios involved converting the mixed
   land-use to 93.89\% of the area being forestland (scenario 1), shrubland
   (scenario 2), grassland (scenario 3), cropland (scenario 4), mixed
   crop/forest land (scenarios 5 and 6), mixed crop/shrub land (scenarios 7
   and 8), mixed crop/grass land (scenarios 9 and 10), mixed
   crop/shrub/forest land (scenarios 11 and 12), and mixed
   crop/grass/forest land (scenarios 13 and 14). The scenario analysis
   revealed that when land-use was changed to 93.89\% of the respective
   land-use in scenarios 4, 5, 7 and 9, an increase in runoff and sediment
   yield for single rain events compared to the baseline whereas a change
   to forest and shrubland caused a decrease (scenarios 1 and 2). Slope is
   an important factor in soil erosion, but in the study area, when the
   slope is more than 10 degrees, the difference of stream flow and
   sediment between forest, shrub and grass was not obvious (scenarios 5, 7
   and 9). The model can be used to predict surface runoff, erosion,
   deposition and sediment yield of each grid cell and the whole watershed
   in response to land-use scenarios for single rain events in the Taihang
   Mountains. It is easy to execute if the precipitation process data, the
   relationships of water and sediment for different land-use, and GIS maps
   of the study area are available, which makes it suitable for widespread
   application. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Primary aluminum production has increased rapidly in China since the
   year 2000, gaining a 46.0\% share of global production in 2014. Primary
   aluminum production is a process high in energy and materials
   consumption that also generates much waste. Investigating resource and
   energy savings and emission reductions in the Chinese aluminum industry
   is an important and urgent task. Holistic thinking is applied in
   deriving and analyzing the equations for energy consumption (E),
   materials consumption (M), and waste emissions (W). Aluminum production
   per unit GDP (T) is an important parameter influencing E, M, and W; and
   the historical value of T (including two decomposition factors of T) in
   China is reviewed first. Based on the equations obtained, the extent of
   the factors influencing E, M, and Wafter the year 2000 is analyzed. Then
   two scenarios (original scheme and recommended scheme) analysis are
   presented and their respective indices were forecast. From comparisons
   with USA and Japan, it is found that the recommended scheme can meet
   aluminum requirements in China if some progress is made. A macroscopic
   regulation and control network diagram of the aluminum industry is
   proposed and some parameters are derived from this diagram. From the
   equations based on these parameters, several ratios among these
   parameters are identified as the key points that need to be controlled
   currently in the aluminum industry. Finally, some suggestions are put
   forward to provide reference points for policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of coaching on nontechnical skills
   and performance during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a simulated
   operating room (OR).
   BACKGROUND: Non-technical skills (situation awareness, decision making,
   teamwork, and leadership) underpin technical ability and are critical to
   the success of operations and the safety of patients in the OR. The rate
   of developing assessment tools in this area has outpaced development of
   workable interventions to improve non-technical skills in surgical
   training and beyond.
   METHOD: A randomized trial was conducted with senior surgical residents
   (n = 16). Participants were randomized to receive either non-technical
   skills coaching (intervention) or to self-reflect (control) after each
   of 5 simulated operations. Coaching was based on the Non-Technical
   Skills For Surgeons (NOTSS) behavior observation system. Surgeon-coaches
   trained in this method coached participants in the intervention group
   for 10 minutes after each simulation. Primary outcome measure was
   non-technical skills, assessed from video by a surgeon using the NOTSS
   system. Secondary outcomes were time to call for help during bleeding,
   operative time, and path length of laparoscopic instruments.
   RESULTS: Non-technical skills improved in the intervention group from
   scenario 1 to scenario 5 compared with those in the control group (p =
   0.04). The intervention group was faster to call for help when faced
   with unstoppable bleeding in the final scenario (no. 5; p = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Coaching improved residents' non-technical skills in the
   simulated OR compared with those in the control group. Important next
   steps are to implement nontechnical skills coaching in the real OR and
   assess effect on clinically important process measures and patient
   outcomes. ((C) 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {{To accomplish secure communication in vehicular networks, public key
   infrastructure (PKI) can be employed. However, traditional PKI systems
   are not suitable because a unique certificate is assigned to each
   vehicle and thus no anonymity is guaranteed. In the combinatorial
   certificate schemes, each vehicle is assigned multiple certificates from
   a shared certificate pool and each certificate in the pool is assigned
   to multiple vehicles to achieve a level of anonymity. When a certificate
   assigned to a misbehaving vehicle is revoked, a certificate replacement
   procedure is executed to all vehicles sharing the certificate. To
   replace the revoked certificate, a randomized certificate replacement
   scheme probabilistically assigns different certificates to different
   vehicles, which can reduce collateral damage caused by repeatedly
   misusing a certificate and its replacement certificates. Unfortunately,
   previous randomized certificate replacement schemes allow unbounded
   collateral damage; a finite number of certificate replacements cannot
   detect the misbehaving vehicle with certainty. To address this problem,
   we propose a new randomized certificate replacement scheme with bounded
   collateral damage.}},

Abstract = {{An unusual form of the time-dependence of the number N(t, T-n) of
   nucleated at a temperature T-n crystals was obtained for a
   soda-lime-silica glass of the composition 22.4Na(2)O-28.0CaO center dot
   49.6SiO(2) (mol.\%). The crystals are solid solutions based on the Na2O
   center dot 2CaO center dot 3SiO(2) compound. The analysis of the
   nucleation kinetics was performed for a nucleation temperature T-n
   located well below the temperature of the maximum of the steady-state
   crystal nucleation rate. Following to the development method,
   supercritical clusters formed at the temperature T-n have been developed
   at a temperature T-d > T-n in order to reach measurable sizes. A large
   number of crystals, N(t, T-n, T-d) = N-o, was detected by this method
   already at t = 0. With an increasing nucleation time, the number of
   developed crystals gradually increases with a temporary tendency towards
   saturation. After this transient stage, the crystal number gradually
   increases again and a linear N(t, T-n, T-d)-dependence corresponding to
   the steady state nucleation rate is established. These uncommon features
   are the consequence of the growth at the nucleation temperature of the
   nuclei preformed in the course of glass preparation with sizes between
   critical sizes corresponding to the nucleation T-n and development T-d
   temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 30 years, laboratory testing has been conducted to
   investigate the geotechnical properties of Clearwater clay shales from
   the Clearwater formation in northeast Alberta, Canada. These properties
   are important for characterization of the overburden zones above in-situ
   oil-sands mines and for assessment of caprock integrity in
   steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) projects. In general,
   caprock-integrity assessments include caprock geological studies,
   in-situ stress determination, constitutive-property characterization,
   and numerical simulations, which allow operators to ensure that
   steam-injection pressure does not cause any risk to the confinement of
   steam chambers. The aim of this study is to identify and provide the
   representative parameters that can enhance understanding of the
   geotechnical behaviour of the Alberta Clearwater formation clay shale.
   Moreover, it illustrates how the results can be used to extract
   constitutive model parameters for modelling the behaviour of this class
   of material. The parameters are also used for complex
   reservoir-geomechanical simulation for caprock integrity. These
   parameters are also compared with other Cretaceous clay-shale
   counterparts in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon (SP) modes possesses an intriguing feature of confining
   light beyond diffraction limit, which makes it very attractive for
   sensing applications. Here, we theoretically investigated an ultra
   compact SP sensor using metal-insulatormetal (MIM) waveguide geometry.
   MIM waveguide is coupled to a pair of stub resonators and both the stub
   resonators are loaded with a metallic nanoslit of silver. The stubs and
   the MIM waveguide are filled with liquid/gaseous material which is to be
   sensed. The Fano resonance, which is very sensitive to any change in
   refractive index of the material, is excited in the structure by
   breaking marginal symmetry. The structure is numerically simulated by
   the finite difference time-domain method (FDTD), and the result shows
   that the resonance wavelength has a linear relation with refractive
   index of the material under sensing. In the optimum design of the
   proposed sensor, the maximum sensitivity is obtained as high as S = 1060
   nm/refractive index unit with a large value of figure of merit (FOM =
   176.7) and an ultra narrow linewidth Delta lambda = 6 nm. Thus, the
   device is well suited for designing on-chip optical sensors.}},

   shown that for both mouse strains after sperm incubation in a solution
   containing Au nanoparticles, at 23, 37 and 60 degrees C for 30 min
   followed by 1 h treatment in dithiothreitol solution, a decrease in the
   number of nuclei with fully decondensed chromatin was observed compared
   with the control. Though, the manifestation of this effect in the
   population of 129/IMG mice mature sperm, was weaker. Also we have
   demonstrated that sperm of both strains that were incubated in a sol of
   Au nanoparticles at 60 degrees C behave differently under the action of
   dithiothreitol. A considerable part (similar to 80\%) of sperm of CBA x
   C57BL/6 hybrid mice treated with Au nanoparticles showed high resistance
   to the action of dithiothreitol, whereas in the case of 129/IMG mice
   only similar to 30\% did, and a partial or complete chromatin
   decondensation takes place in the remaining sperm. In general, using the
   method of nuclear chromatin decondensation in vitro for the native
   sperm, the patterns that we have identified in earlier studies on
   previously demembranized sperm are confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Today, mass presence of distributed energy resources (DERs) connected to
   the grid is often seen as having adverse effects on grid reliability and
   robustness. The apprehension is that it complicates or even compromises
   network management by distribution system operators (DSOs).
   The central aim of the Open System for Energy Services (OS4ES) project
   is to provide a solution that closes the current information,
   communication and cooperation gap between DERs and energy market actors.
   To this end, the OS4ES project delivers an innovative Open Service
   System that enables dynamic cooperation between these two parties. A
   Distributed Registry for DERs offers to involved actors the opportunity
   to reserve the aggregated flexibility of DERs as a grid management
   service in order to improve Smart Grid robustness and reliability. OS4ES
   will be based on standardized and interoperable communication
   interfaces, as well as generic interfaces among components producing,
   consuming or storing electrical energy. The OS4ES Open Service System
   includes laboratory and field tests under different service scenarios
   such as congestion management, energy trading, imbalance risk reduction
   and Volt/VAR optimization. An OS4ES User Group has been established to
   allow interested parties to gain a broader insight in the project and to
   actively contribute to the work packages of interest. Besides,
   standardization proposals will be prepared and submitted to the
   respective standardization committees.}},

Abstract = {{To implement management plans, the salt content across affected fields
   and with depth needs mapping. In this study, we developed a method to
   map the distribution of normal, uniformly saline, and inverted salinity
   profiles. We did this by establishing a linear regression (LR) between
   calculated true electrical conductivity (sigma) and electrical
   conductivity of the saturated soil-paste extract (ECe). We estimated s
   by inverting the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) collected from a
   DUALEM-421. The ECa values were collected along 13 parallel transects
   spaced 50 m apart. The inversion was performed using a
   quasi-three-dimensional model available in the EM4Soil software, where
   we chose the full solution and S1 inversion algorithm with a damping
   factor (lambda) of 0.3. Using cross-validation, the
   quasi-three-dimensional model yielded a high accuracy (RMSE = 5.28 dS
   m(-1)), small bias (mean error {[} ME] = -0.03 dS m-1), and large R-2

   achieved using individual LRs established at each depth increment

   Lin's concordance = 0.96) and with the DUALEM-421 ECa, the inversion
   approach requires the development of a single LR (i.e., ECe = 4.1253 +
   0.0167 sigma), which enables efficiencies in estimating salinity and
   allows ECe to be estimated at any depth where s was estimated within a
   three-dimensional electromagnetic conductivity image. This can improve
   understanding of the cause and best management of salinity. Improvements
   in accuracy and bias can be achieved by collection of ECa on more
   closely spaced transects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design, simulation and fabrication of a
   micromechanical square shape resonators fabricated in single crystal
   silicon using a silicon on isolator wafer. Two different types of
   excitation for square shape resonators were used to stimulate Lame mode
   and square mode of resonance. The fabricated devices were studied under
   different bias voltage and in air at room temperature. The highest
   quality factor measured for the Lame mode resonator was 11,121 and for
   the square mode was 9,120 for square mode at 3.17 and 4.01 MHz, under
   the 80 V DC bias voltage across 1.5 mu m actuation gap. It has been
   shown that by adding raggedy edge, the coupling capacitor has increased.
   Mass detection capabilities of these resonators were also investigated
   by adding an extra layer of gold. Frequency and quality factor variation
   was observed for each of the fabricated resonators. Adding a mass of 76
   pgr leads to resonance frequency shift of 3.1 kHz in Lame mode
   structure. In this experiment quality factor drop was observed because
   of continues film layer of gold metal, with a thickness of 100 nm.}},

Abstract = {{A recombinant protein, ATCTA, consisting of three domains, a-helix (A),

   via the self-association of its flanking a-helices into tetrameric
   bundles, which act as cross-links for the hydrogel network In the
   presence of thrombin, the hydrogel degrades due to the thrombin cleavage
   sites. To better understand the proteolysis reaction in ATCTA, we
   performed a series of kinetic experiments on the proteins ATC, CTA,
   CTATC, and ATCTA. The K-M and k(cat) of ATC and CTA were determined to
   be 88 +/- 5 mu M and 6.4 +/- 0.1 s(-1) and 91 +/- 9 mu M and 6.1 +/- 0.1
   s(-1), respectively. Using these kinetic parameters, a model based on a
   two-site internally cooperative mechanism was developed to describe the
   kinetics of proteins containing two cleavage sites. This model was then
   validated by comparing predicted results with kinetic data from the

Abstract = {{High strength steel pipes have found increasing applications in deep
   high pressure offshore oil/gas lines. Damages in the form of dent are
   among common causes of pipeline failure. Indentation, plastic buckling
   and residual strength of dented normal grade steel pipes under bending,
   axial and combined loading have previously been addressed by a number of
   researchers. The plastic buckling and collapse of dented high grades
   steel line pipes, however, have received less previous attentions.
   In the current study an experimental model testing was used to evaluate
   the residual strength of dented X80 steel pipes under monotonic axial
   compression. The tubular specimens were first laterally dented by an
   indentor while resting on a saddle shape support. The specimens were
   then examined under axial compression to study the dent effects on their
   collapse behaviour. Numerical simulations were also used to analyse the
   effect of the indentor ratio, shape and alignment on the residual
   strength of dented steel tubes under monotonic axial compression. The
   results from the current study on high strength steels were also
   compared with semi-empirical equations available in the literature for
   low strength steels. It was found that these equations provide
   reasonable predictions for the axial residual capacity of the high
   strength steel pipes when the dent depths are small. With deep dents,
   however, they considerably underestimate the axial residual capacity of
   the high strength steel pipes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of preparation methods on mechanical and
   tribological properties of sisal fiber cellulose microcrystalline
   (SFCM)/unsaturated polyester (UP) composites were studied. Compared with
   the pure UP composites, the SFCM/UP composites prepared by in-situ
   polymerization had greatly improved the mechanical and tribological
   properties. The impact strength, flexural strength, and flexural modulus
   of SFCM/UP composites with 2wt\% SFCM were 6.8KJ/M-2, 105.53MPa, and
   14.29GPa, increased by 74.81\%, 33.38\%, and 7.36\% in comparison with
   pure UP composites, respectively. Meanwhile, the volume wear rate of
   SFCM/UP composites at 100, 150, and 200 degrees C decreased 50.40\%,
   52.39\%, and 50.06\%, respectively. These results suggested that the

Abstract = {{The ability of bacteria to metabolize glucosamine (GlcN) and
   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) is considered important for persistent
   colonization of the oral cavity. In the dental caries pathogen
   Streptococcus mutans, the NagR protein regulates the expression of glmS,
   which encodes a GlcN-6-P synthetase, and nagA (GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase)
   and nagB (GlcN-6-P deaminase), which are required for the catabolism of
   GlcNAc and GlcN. Two NagR-binding sites (dre) were identified in each of
   the promoter regions for nagB and glmS. Using promoter-reporter gene
   fusions, the role of each dre site was examined in the regulation of
   glmS and nagB promoter activities in cells grown with glucose, GlcNAc,
   or GlcN. A synergistic relationship between the two dre sites in the
   glmS promoter that required proper spacing was observed, but that was
   not the case for nagB. Binding of purified NagR to DNA fragments from
   both promoter regions, as well as to dre sites alone, was strongly
   influenced by particular sugar phosphates. Using a random mutagenesis
   approach that targeted the effector-binding domain of NagR, mutants that
   displayed aberrant regulation of both the glmS and nagAB genes were
   identified. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that NagR is
   essential for regulation of genes for both the synthesis and catabolism
   of GlcN and GlcNAc in S. mutans, and that NagR engages differently with
   the target promoter regions in response to specific metabolites
   interacting with the effector-binding domain of NagR.
   IMPORTANCE
   Glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine are among the most abundant
   naturally occurring sugars on the planet, and they are catabolized by
   many bacterial species as sources of carbon and nitrogen. Representing a
   group called lactic acid bacteria (LAB), the human dental caries
   pathogen Streptococcus mutans is shown to differ from known paradigm
   organisms in that it possesses a GntR/HutC-type regulator, NagR, that is
   required for the regulation of both catabolism of GlcN and biosynthesis.
   Results reported here reveal a simple and elegant mechanism whereby NagR
   differentially regulates two opposing biological processes by surveying
   metabolic intermediates. This study provides insights that may
   contribute to the development of novel therapeutic tools to combat
   dental caries and other infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated gender differences in cognition in schizophrenia
   with and without diabetes. Cognition was assessed in 263 individuals
   with schizophrenia with age range (40-68): 67 males and 34 females with
   schizophrenia with diabetes; and 125 males and 37 females with
   schizophrenia without diabetes according to the Repeatable Battery for
   the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Fasting glucose,
   hemoglobin Ale (HbA1c) and lipid levels were measured. Results showed
   that male individuals performed worse on most cognitive tasks,
   especially attention, in schizophrenia with than without diabetes. This
   result was not observed in female individuals. Also, individuals of both
   genders showed higher fasting glucose and HbA1c in schizophrenia with
   than without diabetes. In schizophrenia with diabetes, males had
   significantly worse cognition than females in all cognitive domains.
   Higher HbA1c, lower high-density lipoprotein, and an earlier age of
   onset of schizophrenia were found in males compared with female
   individuals. HbA1c was negatively associated with attention and the
   RBANS total score for males but not for females. In schizophrenia
   without diabetes, males showed worse performance in immediate and
   delayed memory than females. This study support cognition was worse for
   males with schizophrenia irrespective of whether they have diabetes.
   However, diabetes exemplified the gender differences, especially in
   attention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the polysaccharides (anionic alginate and cationic
   chitosan) coating on the physicochemical properties and bioaccessibility
   of carotenoids-loaded emulsions in vitro digestion was investigated. The
   stability of carotenoids-loaded emulsions was characterized by droplet
   size, surface charge, and carotenoids degradation during the storage.
   Compared with emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolate (SPI) alone,
   the emulsions stabilized by alginate-SP1 had better stability from pH 3
   to 7. However, the emulsions stabilized by chitosan-SPI had droplets
   aggregation at near neutral pH or at high salt concentration (NaCl >=
   300 mM). The polysaccharide coating can slightly inhibit the degradation
   of carotenoids. After in vitro digestion, chitosan coating was capable
   of reducing the lipids digestibility (87.9\%) and bioaccessibility of
   carotenoids in emulsions. However, alginate has no significant effect on
   the lipid digestion. These results have important implications for
   protein and polysaccharide-stabilized emulsions using in protection and
   delivery of bioactive compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Development of subliminal persuasion system to improve the upper limb
   posture in laparoscopic training: a preliminary study}},

Abstract = {{Current training for laparoscopy focuses only on the enhancement of
   manual skill and does not give advice on improving trainees' posture.
   However, a poor posture can result in increased static muscle loading,
   faster fatigue, and impaired psychomotor task performance. In this
   paper, the authors propose a method, named subliminal persuasion, which
   gives the trainee real-time advice for correcting the upper limb posture
   during laparoscopic training like the expert but leads to a lower
   increment in the workload.
   A 9-axis inertial measurement unit was used to compute the upper limb
   posture, and a Detection Reaction Time device was developed and used to
   measure the workload. A monitor displayed not only images from
   laparoscope, but also a visual stimulus, a transparent red cross
   superimposed to the laparoscopic images, when the trainee had incorrect
   upper limb posture. One group was exposed, when their posture was not
   correct during training, to a short (about 33 ms) subliminal visual
   stimulus. The control group instead was exposed to longer (about 660 ms)
   supraliminal visual stimuli.
   We found that subliminal visual stimulation is a valid method to improve
   trainees' upper limb posture during laparoscopic training. Moreover, the
   additional workload required for subconscious processing of subliminal
   visual stimuli is less than the one required for supraliminal visual
   stimuli, which is processed instead at the conscious level.
   We propose subliminal persuasion as a method to give subconscious
   real-time stimuli to improve upper limb posture during laparoscopic
   training. Its effectiveness and efficiency were confirmed against
   supraliminal stimuli transmitted at the conscious level: Subliminal
   persuasion improved upper limb posture of trainees, with a smaller
   increase on the overall workload.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminated sediment tends to consolidate in response to the loading
   imposed by an overlying cap layer. The form of transient solute
   advection through sediments and caps is consequently changed. Therefore,
   the contaminant discharge into the overlying water is expected to
   increase and the effectiveness of the in situ capping system will be
   strongly affected. In this study, a one-dimensional sediment cap model
   coupling consolidation and advection dispersion equation was
   established. A simplified model was proposed through the sensitivity
   analysis, and then a parametric study was conducted. Numerical examples
   concluded that the absorption, degree of sediment saturation, cap
   thickness, and sediment depth significantly affect the contaminant
   discharge from the top of the cap. Therefore, these parameters should be
   considered carefully during cap design.}},

Title = {{Divergence of Gradient Convolution: Deformable Segmentation With

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a unified approach to deformable model-based
   segmentation. The fundamental force field of the proposed method is
   based on computing the divergence of a gradient convolution field (GCF),
   which makes the full use of directional information of the image
   gradient vectors and their interactions across image domain. However,
   instead of directly using such a vector field for deformable
   segmentation as in the conventional approaches, we derive a more salient
   representation for contour evolution, and very importantly, we
   demonstrate that this representation of image force field not only leads
   to global minimum through convex relaxation but also can achieve the
   same result using the conventional gradient descent with an intrinsic
   regularization. Thus, the proposed method can handle arbitrary
   initializations. The proposed external force field for deformable
   segmentation has both edge-based properties in that the GCF is computed
   from image gradients, and the region-based attributes since its
   divergence can be treated as a region indication function. Moreover,
   nonlinear diffusion can be conveniently applied to GCF to improve its
   performance in dealing with noise interference. We also show the
   extension of GCF from 2D to 3D. In comparison to the state-of-the-art
   deformable segmentation techniques, the proposed method shows greater
   flexibility in model initialization and optimization realization, as
   well as better performance toward noise interference and appearance
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{The flax and equivalent proportion of poly(l-lactic acid)/poly(d-lactic
   acid) (PLLA/PDLA) were melt compounded and injection molded to prepare
   flax-reinforced polylactide stereocomplex (sc-PLA) bio-composite, and
   the effect of alkali treatment on the structure and properties of flax
   as well as the flax/sc-PLA composite was investigated. SEM and FTIR
   results showed hemicellulose in flax was almost completely removed after
   alkali treatment and the treated flax (ALK-flax) bundles were more
   separated with a cleaner surface than untreated flax (UN-flax). DSC
   results showed homo-crystallites (hc, T-m=160-170 degrees C) and
   stereocomplex crystallites (sc, T-m approximate to 210 degrees C)
   coexisted in sc-PLA and flax/sc-PLA composites. Compared with sc-PLA,
   the total crystallinity and sc-crystallinity of flax/sc-PLA composite
   increased regardless of whether the flax were treated with alkali,
   whereas ALK-flax/sc-PLA composite showed a little higher crystallinity
   than UN-flax/sc-PLA composite. TGA results confirmed ALK-flax/sc-PLA
   composite had a higher thermal degradation temperature than
   UN-flax/sc-PLA composite. The mechanical tests indicated although the
   mechanical properties of sc-PLA increased significantly by reinforcing
   with flax, the ALK-flax/sc-PLA composite showed little lower mechanical
   properties than UN-flax/sc-PLA composite. The alkali treatment of flax
   had no obvious influence on the Vicat softening temperature (VST) of
   flax/sc-PLA composites, a higher heat resistance with VST at approximate
   to 155 degrees C could be obtained for flax/sc-PLA composite. POLYM.

Title = {{Instantaneous and controllable integer ambiguity resolution: review and
   an alternative approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODESY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the high-precision application of Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS), integer ambiguity resolution is the key step to realize precise
   positioning and attitude determination. As the necessary part of quality
   control, integer aperture (IA) ambiguity resolution provides the
   theoretical and practical foundation for ambiguity validation. It is
   mainly realized by acceptance testing. Due to the constraint of
   correlation between ambiguities, it is impossible to realize the
   controlling of failure rate according to analytical formula. Hence, the
   fixed failure rate approach is implemented by Monte Carlo sampling.
   However, due to the characteristics of Monte Carlo sampling and look-up
   table, we have to face the problem of a large amount of time consumption
   if sufficient GNSS scenarios are included in the creation of look-up
   table. This restricts the fixed failure rate approach to be a post
   process approach if a look-up table is not available. Furthermore, if
   not enough GNSS scenarios are considered, the table may only be valid
   for a specific scenario or application. Besides this, the method of
   creating look-up table or look-up function still needs to be designed
   for each specific acceptance test. To overcome these problems in
   determination of critical values, this contribution will propose an
   instantaneous and CONtrollable (iCON) IA ambiguity resolution approach
   for the first time. The iCON approach has the following advantages: (a)
   critical value of acceptance test is independently determined based on
   the required failure rate and GNSS model without resorting to external
   information such as look-up table; (b) it can be realized
   instantaneously for most of IA estimators which have analytical
   probability formulas. The stronger GNSS model, the less time
   consumption; (c) it provides a new viewpoint to improve the research
   about IA estimation. To verify these conclusions, multi-frequency and
   multi-GNSS simulation experiments are implemented. Those results show
   that IA estimators based on iCON approach can realize controllable
   ambiguity resolution. Besides this, compared with ratio test IA based on
   look-up table, difference test IA and IA least square based on the iCON
   approach most of times have higher success rates and better
   controllability to failure rates.}},

Abstract = {{The function of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in regulating neuropathic
   pain has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, the
   precise mechanism of miRNAs in neuropathic pain remains largely unknown.
   In the present study, an important role of miR-141 and its putative
   target gene, high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), was demonstrated in a
   rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury
   (CCI). The expression of miR-141 was significantly downregulated in the
   dorsal root ganglion of rats following CCI surgery. Overexpression of
   miR-141 by intrathecal injection of miR-141 precursor mediated by a
   lentivirus-derived gene transfer significantly inhibited mechanical
   allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and proinflammatory cytokine release in
   CCI rats. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, a direct interaction
   between miR-141 and the 3'-untranslated region of HMGB1 was verified.
   Overexpression of miR-141 significantly suppressed the expression of
   HMGB1 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of HMGB1
   apparently abrogated the beneficial effect of miR-141 on inhibiting
   neuropathic pain. Taken together, the data suggest that overexpression
   of miR-141 alleviates neuropathic pain development via targeting and
   inhibiting HMGB1, implying that blocking HMGB1 by miR-141 could be a
   useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain.}},

Abstract = {{Tooth modification technique is widely used in gear industry to improve
   the meshing performance of gearings. However, few of the present studies
   on tooth modification considers the influence of inevitable random
   errors on gear modification effects. In order to investigate the
   uncertainties of tooth modification amount variations on system's
   dynamic behaviors of a helical planetary gears, an analytical dynamic
   model including tooth modification parameters is proposed to carry out a
   deterministic analysis on the dynamics of a helical planetary gear. The
   dynamic meshing forces as well as the dynamic transmission errors of the
   sun-planet 1 gear pair with and without tooth modifications are computed
   and compared to show the effectiveness of tooth modifications on gear
   dynamics enhancement. By using response surface method, a fitted
   regression model for the dynamic transmission error(DTE) fluctuations is
   established to quantify the relationship between modification amounts
   and DTE fluctuations. By shifting the inevitable random errors arousing
   from manufacturing and installing process to tooth modification amount
   variations, a statistical tooth modification model is developed and a
   methodology combining Monte Carlo simulation and response surface method
   is presented for uncertainty analysis of tooth modifications. The
   uncertainly analysis reveals that the system's dynamic behaviors do not
   obey the normal distribution rule even though the design variables are
   normally distributed. In addition, a deterministic modification amount
   will not definitely achieve an optimal result for both static and
   dynamic transmission error fluctuation reduction simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin, high aspect ratio silver nanowires synthesized in solution
   has attracted significant attention for fabricating optoelectronic
   devices with good properties and relatively low cost, and has been the
   most promising material to replace ITO. In this paper, a novel method is
   proposed to synthesis ultrathin nanowires through facile one-pot polyol
   method using KBr as a co-nucleant to NaCl. The effect of three common
   nucleants NaCl, FeCl3 and KBr on nucleation rate and product size were
   well studied. KBr is found to be beneficial for decreasing product size
   but unable to generate nanowires effectively alone. By adjusting the
   exact concentration of KBr, silver nanowires with an average length of
   21 mu m and average diameter of 26 nm could be synthesized conveniently.
   Conductive film prepared using these nanowires had transmittance over
   90\% and sheet resistance about 10 Omega/square, which is better than
   the average level of common ITO-glass and highly potential to be applied

   diver proximity in different combinations were shown to the respondents
   for assessing acceptability. Between the two variables, the ``number of
   divers{''} was the most influential factor to divers' perceived
   crowding. Divers' begin to feel unacceptably crowded if 7 similar to 8
   divers are visible to them at one time. Based on this, it is likely that
   the usage of Hong Kong diving sites has already exceeded its social
   carrying capacity. Implications for future research and diving tourism
   management for Hong Kong diving sites are also discussed in the paper.

Abstract = {{In this paper, by using polymer network different morphologies of
   hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was synthesized. Boric acid (H3BO3) and
   borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O) mix was used as a source of boron,
   and urea (CO(NH2)(2)) was used as a nitrogen source, for the preparation
   of high crystallinity globular h-BN. The experiment ensured the
   synthesis mechanism and the optimum synthesis process. The research
   showed that the synthesis mechanism of h-BN was that borax and boric
   acid were heated to decomposed into sodium oxide (Na2O) and boron oxide
   (B2O3). In flowing ammonia (NH3) atmosphere B2O3 transformed into h-BN
   again; with the increase of the synthesis temperature, h-BN
   crystallinity increased gradually. The optimum synthesis temperature of
   high crystallinity spherical h-BN was 800 A degrees C. Graphitization
   index was 3.87 which was < 5 and h-BN was in good crystallization range.}},

Abstract = {{The most widely used support design damage criterion for rockburst-prone
   mines is based upon kinetic energy, which is proportional to the square
   of the ejection velocity and is commonly expressed in terms of peak
   particle velocity (PPV). Field monitoring and back-analyses have shown
   that ejection velocities of the order of 10 m/s and higher can result
   from seismic events of moderate magnitude. Such velocities are much
   higher than those predicted using PPV obtained from scaling laws. It has
   also been found that the peak ground motion (i.e. PPV) on the surface of
   an excavation is preferentially amplified (by four-to tenfold) compared
   to the motion in solid rock at a similar distance from the source.
   However, the wave propagation and interaction processes involved within
   the fractured rock in generating high ground motion are very complex and
   are not well understood at this time.
   In this paper, velocity amplification was investigated by modelling the
   dynamic interaction between fractured rock and a free surface using a 2D
   discontinuum-based numerical program, UDEC (Universal Distinct Element
   Code). A 1D model with a fractured zone was used to represent the
   fractured rock. Velocity amplification, quantified by PPV, predicted at
   the free end of the model was 2.0-3.6 times higher than the input
   velocity. It was found that the wave frequency, fracture stiffness,
   fracture spacing, and thickness of fractured zone are the main factors
   that affect the velocity amplification. The results have proved that the
   interaction of the seismic wave and multiple fractures near the free
   surface strongly influences the ground motion.}},

Abstract = {{A size-dependent evolution of phonon confinement is revealed in Si
   nanoparticles (NPs) via Raman spectroscopy. By introducing a variable
   confinement factor, alpha, into a well-known phenomenological phonon
   confinement model (PCM) developed by Richter et al., acceptable fits are
   achieved to downshifted and asymmetrically broadened Raman spectra of Si
   NPs with different diameters, d, from 2.4 nm to 6.3 nm. A comparative
   study using Raman spectra of colloidal Si NPs, for the first time, shows
   an apparent positive linear correlation between alpha and the Si NP
   size. Based on the PCM, the amplitude of the atomic vibration (phonon)
   at the real physical boundary of NPs is proportional to e(-alpha/2),
   which indicates that the amplitude of the first order optical phonon is
   relatively larger at the edges for smaller Si nanostructures despite of
   their stronger phonon confinement weighed by alpha/d(2). Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{We describe a preparation of sulfur-doped mesoporous amorphous carbon
   (SMAC) from a commercially available alkyl surfactant sulfonate
   anion-intercalated NiAl-layered double hydroxide precursor via thermal
   decomposition and subsequent acid leaching. The resultant amorphous
   carbon is endowed with the integrated advantage of featuring high
   reversible capacity and long cycling stability: intrinsic doping of
   sulfur, large specific area, and broad mesopore size distribution.
   Electrochemical evaluation shows that the SMAC electrode exhibits highly
   enhanced electrochemical performances, compared with the electrode of
   non-doped mesoporous and amorphous carbon prepared by using a different
   surfactant (sodium laurate). A high reversible capacity of 958 mA h
   g(-1) is achieved for the SMAC electrode after 110 cycles at 200 mA
   g(-1), and especially a superlong cycle life with a reversible capacity
   of 579 mA h g(-1) after 970 cycles at 500 mA g(-1). Moreover, the SMAC
   electrode can facilitate the reversible insertion/extraction of Na ion,
   owing to the proper specific area and mesopore size distribution, as
   well as the improved electronic conductivity resulted from doping of
   sulfur. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to overcome the nonlinearity of Mises criterion, a new linear
   yield criterion with a dodecagon shape of the same perimeter as Mises
   criterion was derived by means of geometrical analysis. Its specific
   plastic work rate expressed as a linear function of the yield stress,
   the maximum and minimum strains was also deduced and compared with that
   of Mises criterion. The physical meaning of the proposed yield criterion
   is that yielding of materials begins when the shear yield stress tau (s)
   reaches the magnitude of 0.594 sigma (s). By introducing the Lode
   parameter, validation of evolution expressions of the proposed yield
   criterion with those based on Tresca, Mises and TSS criteria as well as
   available classical yield experimental results of various metals shows
   that the present results intersect with Mises results and coincide well
   with experimental data. Moreover, further application to the limit
   analysis of circle plate as an example is performed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed yield criterion, and the subsequent
   comparison of limit loads with the Tresca analytical solutions and Mises
   numerical results shows that the present results are higher than the
   Tresca analytical results, and are in good agreement with the Mises

Abstract = {{Global warming driven by ``greenhouse gas{''} emissions is an
   increasingly serious concern of both the public and legislators. A
   potentially potent way to reduce these emissions and conserve fossil
   fuel resources is to use n-butanol, iso-butanol or octanol
   (2-ethylhexanol) from renewable sources as alternative fuels in diesel
   engines. The effects of adding these substances to diesel fuel were
   therefore tested in a single-cylinder heavy duty diesel engine operated
   using factory settings. These alcohols have better calorific values,
   flash points, lubricity, cetane numbers and solubility in diesel than
   shorter-chain alcohols. However, they have lower cetane numbers than
   diesel, so either hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or Di-tertiary-butyl
   peroxide (DTBP) was added to the diesel-alcohol mixtures to generate
   blends with the same Cetane Number (CN) as diesel. Blends containing 10
   and 20\% of n-butanol or iso-butanol, or 30 \% octanol were tested at
   four operating points from the European Stationary Cycle. The same
   engine settings were used in all cases.
   The average engine performance in tests with the blends was similar to
   that achieved with pure diesel but the blends generated less
   cycle-to-cycle variation. The brake thermal efficiency was similar for
   all the fuels but the brake specific fuel consumption was slightly
   higher for the blends due to their lower calorific value. Because of
   their oxygen content, the blends produced much lower emissions of soot
   and carbon monoxide than were achieved with diesel. Blends yielded
   slightly higher NOx emissions than pure diesel and all the fuels
   produced similar hydrocarbon emissions. Possibly because of its branched
   molecular structure, the iso-butanol blends yielded slightly higher soot
   emissions than the n-butanol blends. Because HVO contains no aromatics,
   its addition to fuel blends reduced soot emissions. Overall, these
   results confirm the substantial potential of renewable longer-chain
   alcohols as components of blended diesel fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Non-growing season soil CO2 emissions are very important part of the
   annual C balance in the Arctic tundra ecosystems, but very limited
   information is available for the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau, which hold great quantities of C. We conducted a full year
   measurement of soil CO2 flux in an alpine meadow and swamp meadow to
   quantify seasonal dynamics of non-growing season (include winter and
   initial thaw and freeze period (TFP)) soil CO2 flux and its contribution
   to annual soil CO2 emissions. Mean soil CO2 flux was higher in TFP
   (0.38-0.54 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than in winter (0.11-0.23 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1)), with significant higher in swamp meadow than alpine meadow in
   the nongrowing season. Soil temperature explained 76-85\% of the yearly
   variation in the soil CO2 flux, with higher temperature sensitivity
   (Q(10)) in the TFP (5.67-9.43) than in other seasons (2.65-2.99). The
   cumulative non-growing season soil CO2 emission was 228-358 g CO2 m(-2),
   accounted for 25-26\% of annual emissions. The integrated contribution
   of non-growing season to annual emission based on season-specific,
   annual and growing season Q(10) model were 26-27\%, 32-34\% and 44-45\%,
   respectively, season-specific model may improve the accuracy of
   estimating the soil CO2 emissions. Our results indicate that non-growing
   season contributes a large portion of the annual soil CO2 emission in
   the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Hence, estimating of
   annual C balance must consider the non-growing season soil CO2 emission,
   and should not neglect the soil CO2 emission of swamp meadow. (C) 2015

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High-temperature mechanical and thermal properties of h-BN/30
   vol\%Y2SiO5 composite were systematically investigated in this study.
   The composite exhibits an improved elastic modulus and strength at high
   temperatures. The elastic modulus reaches a maximum of 98 GPa at 1478 K,
   and the flexural strength increases from 119 +/- 3 to 188 +/- 12 MPa in
   the range from room temperature to 1473K. These improvements in the
   mechanical properties of the material are primarily attributed to the
   closing of microcracks in both the h-BN matrix and the h-BN/Y2SiO5
   interphase. Particularly, the strengthening effect at 1473 K results
   from the healing of surface defects by borosilicate glass formed during
   testing in air. The linear coefficients of thermal expansion in the
   temperature range of 373 to 1573 K in the perpendicular and parallel
   directions are determined to be 4.4-5.0 x 10(-6) and 7.9-9.2 x 10(-6)
   K-1, respectively. The room-temperature thermal conductivities in the
   perpendicular and parallel directions are determined to be 42 and
   28W.m(-1).K-1; these values subsequently decrease to 18 and
   12W.m(-1).K-1 at 1473 K, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna

Title = {{Impact of terrain complexity on the accuracy of calculations of river
   channel storage volume derived from measurements of underwater
   topography}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the approximate errors that accrue in the
   approximation of continuous riverbed surfaces using data from discrete
   topographic surveying points, by evaluating the accuracy of the river
   channel storage volume calculated from underwater topographic surveying
   data without acknowledging the measurement errors inherent in data
   acquisition. Two types of theoretical surfaces with different complexity
   levels were generated from mathematical expressions and fractal Brownian
   motion. The reference value of the volume between a theoretical surface
   and a horizontal reference plane was calculated. Regularly distributed
   elevation spots were sampled from the theoretical surface to match those
   sampled in the topographic surveying of the river channel. The volume
   corresponding to the scale of terrain survey and the relative error of
   the reference value were computed using the scattered data points. The
   complexity of the theoretical surface was characterized and quantified
   using the fractal dimension. Regression analysis showed that there was
   an apparent positive correlation between the fractal dimension and the
   relative error, and the correlation coefficient (R (2)) was greater than
   0.794 for the three case studies of smooth surfaces and nearly 1.0 for
   the two case studies of rough surfaces. It indicates that the data
   representativeness of scattered points with the same point density in a
   flat surface is better than that in a complicated surface. From this
   study, we can conclude that the topographic fluctuation of the riverbed
   has an effect on the calculation error of the river channel storage
   volume derived from measurements of underwater topography, and its
   degree of influence depends on the complexity level of the terrain.
   Moreover, this paper provide a distinct approach for analyzing the
   measurement representation in a terrain survey and more work will
   involve surface modeling techniques combined with realistic topographic
   feature to produce more vivid landform.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of lumbar disc degeneration is extremely complex, and
   the expression and role of telomerase in degenerative lumbar disc
   tissues remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to detect
   telomerase expression in nucleus pulposus tissues of degenerative lumbar
   discs and to explore the correlation between telomerase expression and
   other factors typical of disc degeneration. A total of 8 patients with
   degenerative nucleus pulposus were included as the experimental group
   and compared with 8 control patients without evident lumbar disc
   degeneration. The expression of telomerase in nucleus pulposus tissues
   was detected by immunohistochemical staining. ELISA was performed to
   determine the differential expression of telomerase, type II collagen
   and chondroitin sulfate between the two groups. In addition, a
   correlation analysis was performed to form associations between these
   factors. Finally, 5 cases in the experimental group and 5 in the control
   group were involved in the analysis. Immunohistochemistry results showed
   that telomerase expression in the experimental group was significantly
   lower compared to the control group and the percentage in the unit field
   of view showed significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05).
   Similarly, the ELISA test results showed lower expression levels of
   telomerase, type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate in the experimental
   group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). The correlation
   analysis revealed that telomerase was positively correlated with type II
   collagen and chondroitin sulfate (correlation coefficients, 0.673 and
   0.528, respectively; P<0.01). In conclusion, telomerase is involved in
   the degeneration process of nucleus pulposus tissue in lumbar discs and
   has a positive correlation with other factors typically associated with
   degeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The information of fluorophore concentration variation (FCV) has the
   potential for drug development and tumor studies, but the reconstruction
   of FCV is time-consuming in dynamic fluorescence molecular tomography

   presented. The system equation of this method is derived from the
   derivation of the diffusion equation, and its size does not change with
   the number of frames. The computational time can be significantly
   reduced by using this method because the images of different frames are
   reconstructed separately. Simulations and phantom experiments are
   performed to validate the performance of the proposed method. The
   results show that compared with the previous method, the proposed method
   can obtain better results and consumes less computational time with the
   same number of iterations. In addition, the time consumption in a single
   iteration of the proposed method increases much slower with the number

   required for the two internal cycloadditions of bis(azidoazolyl)
   diazenes were predicted at the B3LYP/6-311++G{*}{*}(128.8-138.5 and
   130.2-144.7 kJ/mol), B3PW91/6-311++G{*}{*} (124.9-133.0 and 125.5-138.1
   kJ/mol) and B3LYP/Aug-cc-pvdz (119.0-128.0 and 120.5-133.0 kJ/mol)
   levels of DFT. The bend of the azido group starts the 1,3-dipolar
   cycloadditions. Two 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions are independent. The IR,
   UV, and NMR spectra were simulated for characterization. The frontier
   orbitals cover the whole structure leading to small energy gaps
   (2.99-4.02 eV). The predicted impact sensitivities (17.3-22.1 J) show
   the acceptable stability of title compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{The crystallization behavior of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk amorphous alloy
   during laser solid forming (LSF) was analyzed. Since laser surface
   remelting (LSM) is a key process for the LSF, the crystallization
   behavior of as-cast Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) during
   LSM was also investigated. It was found that the amorphous state of the
   as-cast BMGs was maintained when they were repeatedly remelted four
   times in a single-trace LSM, and as for the LSF of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk
   amorphous alloy, the crystallization primarily occurred in the HAZ
   between the adjacent traces and layers after the two layers were
   deposited. The as-deposited microstructure exhibited a series of phase
   evolutions from the molten pool to the HAZ as follows: the amorphous >
   NiZr2 type nanocrystal + amorphous > NiZr2 type equiaxed dendrite
   amorphous > Cu10Zr7 type dendrite + NiZr2 type nanocrystal. Among these
   microstructural patterns, the NiZr2 type nanocrystals and equiaxed
   dendrites primarily formed from the rapid solidification of the remelted
   liquid in the laser processing process, and the CunZr7 type dendrites in
   the HAZ primarily formed by the crystallization of pre-existed nuclei in
   the already-deposited amorphous substrate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The genera Erwinia and Pantoea contain species that are devastating
   plant pathogens, non-pathogen epiphytes, and opportunistic human
   pathogens. However, some controversies persist in the taxonomic
   classification of these two closely related genera. The phylogenomic
   analysis of these two genera was investigated via a comprehensive
   analysis of 25 Erwinia genomes and 23 Pantoea genomes. Single-copy
   orthologs could be extracted from the Erwinia/Pantoea core-genome to
   reconstruct the Erwinia/Pantoea phylogeny. This tree has strong
   bootstrap support for almost all branches. We also estimated the in
   silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) and the average nucleotide identity
   (ANI) values between each genome; strains from the same species showed
   ANI values a parts per thousand yen96 \% and isDDH values > 70 \%. These
   data confirm that whole genome sequence data provides a powerful tool to
   resolve the complex taxonomic questions of Erwinia/Pantoea, e.g. Pantoea
   agglomerans 299R was not clustered into a single group with other P.
   agglomerans strains, and the ANI values and isDDH values between them
   were < 91 \% and around 43.8 \%, respectively. These data indicate P.
   agglomerans 299R should not be classified into the P. agglomerans
   species. In addition, another strain (Pantoea sp. At\_9b) was identified
   that may represent a novel Pantoea species. We also evaluated the
   performance of six commonly used housekeeping genes (atpD, carA, gyrB,
   infB, recA, and rpoB) in phylogenetic inference. A single gene was not
   enough to obtain a reliable species tree, and it was necessary to use
   the multilocus sequence analysis of the six marker genes to recover the
   Erwinia/Pantoea phylogeny.}},

Abstract = {{Tribological behaviors of 30 vol\% carbon fiber-reinforced

   fiber/PTFE/graphite-reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK-2) sliding
   against AISI630 steel under seawater lubrication were investigated
   comparatively with a ring-on-ring contact test apparatus. The results
   revealed that PEEK-2 had a lower friction coefficient and much better
   wear resistance than PEEK-1, especially under a relatively heavy load.
   Furthermore, PEEK-2 exhibited much better friction and wear properties
   under seawater lubrication than under dry friction, and it was slightly
   inferior to that under pure water lubrication due to the corrosive
   effect of seawater on the surface of AISI630 steel. Additionally, the
   worn surface morphology of PEEK composites and AISI630 steel were
   obtained through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical
   microscopy, respectively. The main tribological mechanisms of the
   friction pair under seawater lubrication were abrasive wear and indirect
   corrosive wear. The corrosion of the AISI630 surface caused by Cl- and
   SO4- of seawater performed more dramatically than the lubricating effect
   of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the contacted surface and deteriorated the
   tribological behaviors of the matched material to some extent. This
   research will provide guidance for materials screening of key friction

Abstract = {{Accurate performance model of solar cells is very crucial for embedded
   power applications. At low irradiance levels, the two-diode model for PV
   model is well known for its excellent accuracy. Using the two-diode
   model, we provide the generic expression of the optimum load Rim, which
   holds for both the single-diode and two-diode model. Also, we obtain an
   explicit solution based on elementary analytical functions to seek the
   optimum diode-voltage V-mD using dichotomy method. Furthermore, the
   values of I-m, and R-mL, can be calculated based on the explicit
   expression of I-m, and R-mL in terms of V-mD. However, the computation
   for R-mL, is difficult, so we create a user-friendly program by
   Matlab/GUI to make it easier. As predicted, the results computed by the
   proposed method agree well with the experimental data of four real solar
   cells. Finally, the impacts of the series and shunt resistance on the
   optimum load are studied. It turns out that the results of the
   single-diode model in literature have the same tendency as that of the
   two-diode model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Proposing a new friend recommendation method, FRUTAI, to enhance social
   media providers' performance}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{46-54}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, have grown rapidly in recent
   years. Friend recommendation systems, as an important emerging component
   of social media, may efficiently expand social media networks by
   proactively recommending new and potentially high-quality friends to
   users. Literature review has shown that prior research work on friend
   recommendation mainly focuses on the linking relation between users in
   social media but largely neglects the influence of users' attributes. In
   this study, we have systematically reviewed and evaluated the existing
   state-of-the-art friend recommendation algorithms. We introduce a new
   Friend Recommendation system using a User's Total Attributes Information
   (FRUTAI) based on the law of total probability. The proposed method can
   be easily extended according to the increasing number of a user's
   attributes with low computation cost. Furthermore, the FRUTAI is a
   universal friend recommendation method and can be applied in different
   types of social media because it does not distinguish the structure of
   the network. We have collected 7 million users' public information and
   their friend relationships from RenRen, commonly regarded as the
   Facebook of China. Using the real-world data from a dominant social
   media provider, we extensively evaluate the proposed method with other
   existing friend recommendation algorithms. Our experimental results have
   demonstrated the comparatively better performance of FRUTAI. In our
   empirical studies, we have observed that the performance of FRUTAI is
   related to the number of a user's friends. In particular, when a user
   has a small number of friends, the proposed FRUTAI algorithm performs
   better than other algorithms; when a user has a large number of friends,
   the overall performance of FRUTAI becomes less competitive but is still
   comparable to those of other providers, and its precision rate is quite
   outstanding. Our findings may provide some important practical
   implications to social media design and performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Hydrologic and water-quality rehabilitation of environments for suitable
   fish habitat}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{530}},
Pages = {{799-814}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aquatic ecological rehabilitation is attracting increasing public and
   research attention, but without knowledge of the responses of aquatic
   species to their habitats the success of habitat restoration is
   uncertain. Thus efficient study of species response to habitat, through
   which to prioritize the habitat factors influencing aquatic ecosystems,
   is highly important. However many current models have too high
   requirement for assemblage information and have great bias in results
   due to consideration of only the species' attribute of presence/absence,
   abundance or biomass, thus hindering the wider utility of these models.
   This paper, using fish as a case, presents a framework for
   identification of high-priority habitat factors based on the responses
   of aquatic species to their habitats, using presence/absence, abundance
   and biomass data. This framework consists of four newly developed
   sub-models aiming to determine weightings for the evaluation of species'
   contributions to their communities, to quantitatively calculate an
   integrated habitat suitability index for multi-species based on habitat
   factors, to assess the suitable probability of habitat factors and to
   assess the rehabilitation priority of habitat factors. The framework
   closely links hydrologic, physical and chemical habitat factors to fish
   assemblage attributes drawn from monitoring datasets on hydrology, water
   quality and fish assemblages at a total of 144 sites, where 5084 fish
   were sampled and tested. Breakpoint identification techniques based on
   curvature in cumulated dominance along with a newly developed weighting
   calculation model based on theory of mass systems were used to help
   identify the dominant fish, based on which the presence and abundance of
   multiple fish were normalized to estimate the integrated habitat
   suitability index along gradients of various factors, based on their
   variation with principal habitat factors. Then, the appropriate
   probability of every principal habitat factor was estimated and graded,
   and the priority of habitat factors for rehabilitation was determined.
   Application of the model to Jinan City, a pilot city for the
   construction of a civilized and ecological city in China, proved
   effective, revealing that carbonate is the poorest habitat factor and
   has the highest priority for ecological rehabilitation. This was tested
   using two methods: alternative priority models and a dataset of all
   habitat factors in place of only the principal habitat factors. We also
   found that hydrological factors have higher priority than the water
   quality factors at the levels of both the whole city and its subordinate
   eco-regions and therefore that hydrological factors deserve special
   attention in the future ecosystem rehabilitation. Further, the current
   habitat state makes nearly half of the habitats in Jinan City
   undesirable for fish communities, largely due to long-term agricultural
   practices. Spatially, rivers in the mountainous region south of Jinan
   city and adjacent to the urban area and rivers in the agricultural
   region north of the city should be emphasized in future habitat
   rehabilitation. All of these findings have substantial ramifications for
   the rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems in Jinan City as a reference
   for river ecological remediation in rivers with scarce ecological data
   worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Landslide susceptibility maps are vital for planning development
   activities in the mountainous areas in China. The main goal of this
   study was to produce landslide susceptibility mapping by statistical
   index (SI) and certainty factor (CF) models for the Shangzhou District
   of Shangluo City, China. For this purpose, a landslide inventory map
   with a total of 145 landslide locations was compiled from various
   sources such as aerial photographs and field surveys, out of which 101
   (70 \%) were randomly selected for training the models, while the
   remaining 44 (30 \%) were used for validating the models. In this case
   study, the following landslide conditioning factors were evaluated:
   slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, lithology, distance to
   faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, precipitation, and peak
   ground acceleration were considered in this study. The validation of
   landslide susceptibility maps were carried out using areas under the
   curve (AUC). From the analysis, it is seen that the CF model with a
   training accuracy of 70.48 \% and predictive accuracy of 68.86 \%
   performs slightly better than SI model (training accuracy, 70.19 \%;
   predictive accuracy, 68.67 \%). Overall, both of these two models showed
   almost similar results. The resultant susceptibility maps can be useful
   for general land use planning for the study area and other similar areas
   in the world.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cosmopolitanism is commonly understood as a universal norm-moral and
   political-in the light of enduring differences, and for that reason it
   has historically embodied a seemingly inevitable dilemma of
   universality/particularity. Since its inception, cosmopolitan thinkers
   have struggled with the dilemma and have attempted ways to address the
   question of difference so that the universal norm and obligation can be
   justified and defended. One of the most common strategies is to give
   primacy to universal humanity and override difference; another recent
   strategy is to give up universalism to take difference seriously and
   frame difference in agonistic terms. I argue in this article that both
   strategies are inadequate and unsatisfactory in conceptualising and
   dealing with difference. Briefly tracing some of the major cosmopolitan
   approaches, I argue that the conceptualisation of difference and human
   subjectivity is at the core of the problem as well as the solution.
   Drawing on Levinas and his emphasis on the primacy of difference in the
   constitution of human subjectivity and community, I propose a new
   understanding of the self and the Other for the success of the
   cosmopolitan project.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three donor-pi-acceptor (D-pi-A) type unsymmetrical
   porphyrin-based dyes have been designed and synthesized for
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The photophysical, electrochemical
   and photovoltaic properties of the dyes were successfully adjusted by
   using functionalized arylamines (triphenylamine or N,

   conjugated pi bridge, ethynyl-thiophene or ethynyl-thiophthene as pi
   spacer and carboxylic acid as anchor group. Compared with the dye
   containing ethynyl-thiophene as pi spacer, the dyes containing
   2-ethynyl-6-methylthieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene as pi spacer between the
   porphyrin macrocycle and the carboxylic acid anchoring group show
   broadened absorption spectra on TiO2 films and red-shifted absorption
   spectra in solution. The dye based on triphenylamine and
   2-ethynyl-6-methylthieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene exhibited a power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) of 4.53\% under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight.
   These results indicate that the introduction of

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to compare effects of dietary administration of
   iron dextran and bacterial-iron on growth performance, fecal microbial
   flora, and blood profiles in sows and their litters. A total of 20
   multiparous sows (LandracexYorkshire) were randomly allotted into two
   treatments: (i) ID (basal diet, piglets were injected with iron
   dextran); (ii) BR (basal diet+bacterial-iron; bacterial-iron was given
   to sows, piglets were not injected with iron dextran). There were five
   replicates per treatment with two sows per replicate. No differences
   were observed on sow and piglet growth performance, fecal microbial
   flora as well as sow blood profiles between ID and BR treatments. In
   piglets, blood iron, red blood cell and hemoglobin concentrations in ID
   treatment were higher (P<0.05) on days 12 and 24. Furthermore,
   concentration of white blood cells in BR treatment was lower (P<0.05) on
   day 12. However, the percentage of lymphocytes on day 12 was increased
   (P<0.05) in BR treatment. In conclusion, effect of iron dextran and
   bacterial-iron has no difference on growth performance in lactating sows
   and piglets, but iron dextran injection has higher blood iron, white
   blood cell, red blood cell and hemoglobin concentrations in piglets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel dual-rotor, axial field, fault-tolerant
   flux-switching permanent magnet machine (FSPMM) with high-torque
   performance for direct-drive applications, in which the phase-group
   concentrated-coil windings and the unaligned arrangement of the two
   rotors are used. The adoption of the phase-group concentrated-coil
   windings is made to obtain a unity displacement winding factor, and to
   enhance the flux-focusing effects together with the use of a spoke-type
   PM configuration. The unaligned arrangement of the two rotors will help
   to achieve increased flux magnification and also to suppress the cogging
   torque and the torque ripple. In particular, the proposed configuration
   for FSPMMs exhibits the advantage of fault tolerance, benefiting from
   the electromagnetic isolation of phases and a dual three-phase channel
   of supply. The operating principle and the design criteria of the
   proposed FSPMM are discussed in detail. To highlight the advantages of
   the proposed FSPMM, two conventional FSPMMs are adopted for comparison
   under the same operating conditions based on a 3-D finite-element
   method. As a result, it is demonstrated that the proposed FSPMM exhibits
   significantly improved performance with not only higher torque (power)
   density but also lower cogging torque and torque ripple, compared with
   the conventional FSPMMs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A local feature descriptor, the local gradient binary count pattern
   (LGBCP), is proposed for face recognition. Unlike some current methods
   that extract features directly from a face image in the spatial domain,
   LGBCP encodes the local gradient information of the face's texture in an
   effective way and provides a more discriminative code than other
   methods. We compute the gradient information of a face image through
   convolutions with compass masks. The gradient information is encoded
   using the local binary count operator. We divide a face into several
   subregions and extract the distribution of the LGBCP codes from each
   subregion. Then all the histograms are concatenated into a vector, which
   is used for face description. For recognition, the chi-square statistic
   is used to measure the similarity of different feature vectors. Besides
   directly calculating the similarity of two feature vectors, we provide a
   weighted matching scheme in which different weights are assigned to
   different subregions. The nearest-neighborhood classifier is exploited
   for classification. Experiments are conducted on the FERET, CAS-PEAL,
   and AR face databases. LGBCP achieves 96.15\% on the Fb set of FERET.
   For CAS-PEAL, LGBCP gets 96.97\%, 98.91\%, and 90.89\% on the aging,
   distance, and expression sets, respectively. (C) 2015 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Multidrug resistance (MDR) to doxorubicin (DOX) limits its effectiveness
   against tumor cells. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been reported to
   reduce MDR in various types of cancer, but the mechanisms involving Ras
   and p-glycoprotein (P-gp) remain to be fully elucidated. The objectives
   of the present study were to evaluate As2O3 in reversing MDR to DOX, and
   to identify the association in antitumor activities between the
   effectiveness of DOX and Ras/phosphorylated (p-) extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling in SGC7901/ADM and SGC7901/S
   human gastric cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity and sensitivity towards
   As2O3 were assessed using non-toxic and mildly-toxic concentrations (0.1
   and 0.5 mu M, respectively). The reversing effect of As2O3 on MDR was
   investigated prior to and following treatment with a cytokine activation
   of the recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor ERK
   pathway. The SGC7901/ADM and SGC7901/S cells had the same sensitivity to
   As2O3. The SGC7901/ADM cells were resistant to DOX and As2O3 treatment
   reduced the level of resistance to DOX (P<0.01). The expression of
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the SGC7901/ADM cells was higher than in the
   SGC7901/S cells (P<0.001). As,03 treatment decreased the levels of P-gp
   in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). The expression of Ras was
   higher in the SGC7901/ADM cells than in the SGC7901/S cells, while the
   expression of p-ERK1/2 remained the same. As2O3 decreased the levels of
   Ras and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.01). Following pretreatment with rhG-CSF, the
   levels of Ras and p-ERK1/2 were further decreased (P<0.01).
   Drug-resistant gastric cancer cells had higher expression levels of P-gp
   and Ras, but not of p-ERK1/2. Non- and mildly-toxic doses of As2O3
   reduced MDR to DOX through Ras/p-ERK1/2 signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Painleve's paradox is a well-known problem in rigid-body dynamics, of
   which the forward dynamics equations could have no solution. To handle
   this situation, an assumption of tangential impact is often introduced.
   Although the assumption seems to provide a good fix, it still needs to
   be mathematically examined via analyzing the asymptotic property of a
   compliance-based model at the limit of rigidity. In this paper, we
   revisit the paradox using the typical Painleve's example of a rod
   sliding on a rough surface. For convenience, the interaction at the
   contact point of the rod is represented by a linear spring to scale the
   local normal compliance, coupled with Coulomb's law to reflect friction.
   We perform an asymptotic analysis using the spring stiffness as a
   perturbation parameter. The rod dynamics in the Painlev,'s paradox,
   accompanying the variation of friction status, consists of three
   distinct phases as follows: An initial period of sliding which allows
   contact force to diverge with the increase of the spring stiffness, a
   period of sticking which ends at the occurrence of a reverse slip
   motion, and a reverse slip phase which causes the rod to be detached
   from the contact surface. As the stiffness goes to infinity, all the
   time intervals of the three phases converge to zero. This analysis
   theoretically confirms the assumption of the tangential impact in the
   paradox of sliding rod dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{It is well recognized that the wind power plays a crucial role in
   achieving sustainable development. However, this emerging industry is
   facing a number of challenges that can be dealt with by improving
   flexibility and strengthening the environmental adaptability. Therefore,
   it is imperative to explore the dynamics of environmental turbulence and
   flexibility within the wind power industry chain. This study identified
   critical factors related to the environmental turbulence and flexibility
   based on an extensive literature review. The measurement models were
   then developed using the comprehensive evaluation method. Subsequently,
   based on the calculation method of Euclidean distances, a matching model
   between environmental turbulence and flexibility was established. The
   proposed method was applied to the Chinese context. Results revealed
   that the wind power industry was not flexible enough to deal with the
   high level of environmental turbulence. Government and enterprises
   should pay more attention to the resources flexibility, capabilities
   flexibility and culture flexibility. Moreover, a long-term matching
   mechanism shall be established with an aim to maintain a healthy level
   wind power industry chain in terms of the overall flexibility. This
   study provides an effective tool to measure the matching degree between
   environmental turbulence and flexibility within the wind power industry

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Current epidemiological data suggest that the incidence
   of gastric polyps (GP) is rare, and its etiology and pathogenesis are
   still not clear. This study analyzed and compared the occurrence and
   pathological types of GPs in southeast Chinese patients according to
   gender and age.
   Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients
   diagnosed with GP (n=2125) in Wenzhou People's Hospital (China) between
   January 2004 and December 2013. The relationships between the detection
   rate, the characteristics of GP, and the patients' demographic data were
   analyzed.
   Results: The detection rate of GP was 2.3\% and 3.9\% in males and
   females, respectively (p<0.01). The detection rate increased with
   increasing age in both genders. Polyps in the gastric antrum and gastric
   body were the most prevalent in both genders. Similarly, inflammatory
   polyps and hyperplastic polyps were the most prevalent in both genders.
   Hyperplastic polyps were more common in females than in males (28.6\%
   vs. 24.2\%, p<0.05), while there was no difference for inflammatory
   polyps, fundic GP, and adenoma (p>0.05). Age had no impact on the
   pathology of GP (p>0.05).
   Conclusions: The incidence of GPs was associated with gender and age.}},

Abstract = {{The authors demonstrate a small molecule 17 beta-estradiol (E2) sensor
   based on aptamer functionalized carbon nanotube network film field
   effect transistors (CNT FETs). The real time current response for the
   35-mer E2 aptamer functionalized CNT FET shows a clear increase in
   current over the range of 50nM to 1.6 mu M of E2. The E2 response using
   a longer 75-mer version of the aptamer functionalized CNT FETs, where
   the aptamer/E2 binding occurs beyond the Debye length, shows no obvious
   evidence of sensing. The CNT FET sensing platform has been fabricated
   via a simple surfactant free solution processing route, compatible with
   further carbon nanotube functionalization to develop a versatile sensing
   platform. The CNT FET aptasensors are able to perform real time
   monitoring of E2 levels for selective and quantitative detection of E2

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the severity and the
   natural course of masticatory muscles weakness that developed after
   CT-guided percutaneous trigeminal radiofrequency thermocoagulation
   (PT-RFT) for the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN).
   MethodsTwenty-seven patients with ITN were treated by CT-guided
   percutaneous trigeminal radiofrequency thermocoagulation. Each patients'
   occlusal function and surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of the
   ipsilateral anterior temporalis (TA) and masseter muscles (MM) at
   mandibular postural position (MPP), and during a fast maximum voluntary
   clenching (MVC) from MPP to intercuspal position (ICP), were
   simultaneously recorded by the T-Scan III system and Bio-pak sEMG III
   system before (baseline), 3days, 3months, and 12months after procedure.
   The incidence, degree, and prognosis of masticatory muscles dysfunction
   related to trigeminal nerve motor-branch injury were analyzed.
   ResultsThree days and 3months after procedure, both the occlusal
   symmetry and the sEMG activity of ipsilateral TA and MM became
   significantly decreased compared to the baseline (P<0.05). However, they
   demonstrated a gradual improvement toward preoperative values in
   follow-up, returning to complete in 23 patients at 12months after
   procedure. None reported permanent masticatory paralysis. Pain relief
   was most significant on the third day after procedure. At the final
   clinical visit, a pain-free status was observed in 25 patients (92.6\%).
   Meanwhile, the intensity of facial dysesthesia was mildest, whereas
   there were statistic differences compared with baseline.
   ConclusionCT-guided PT-RFT for ITN remains an effective and safe
   surgical procedure, but there is a high rate of temporary masticatory
   dysfunction during a short time after procedure, appearing to be
   reversible in a period of 12months.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies suggest that political ties help firms survive or
   perform but do not examine the boundary conditions concerning which
   types of firms and which type of ties help firms. We draw from resource
   dependence and resource-based theories to argue that political ties can
   improve both firm survival (labeled buffering) and performance (labeled
   enabling), with weaker firms gaining more from buffering and stronger
   firms gaining more from enabling. We further examine the relative impact
   of local and central ties. We test our hypotheses on the television
   manufacturing industry in China between 1993 and 2003. Results
   demonstrate the buffering roles of political ties, and under narrower
   conditions, their enabling roles. Local ties account for these outcomes,
   while central ties do not provide buffering or enabling benefits.

Title = {{Semi-analytic benchmark for multi-group free-gas Legendre moments and

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{As high-fidelity simulations become routine and computational modelers
   begin to ask questions about uncertainty in calculations, the
   understanding of uncertainties in nuclear data, including multigroup
   cross-sections to high scattering orders, is also becoming important. In
   this paper we look at how a widely-used data processing code, NJOY,
   processes thermal cross-section data. Using an alternative integration
   scheme, Gauss quadrature, for angular integration to generate thermal
   scattering cross sections from the thermal scattering laws for graphite
   and ZrHx, we observed discrepancies between these results and NJOY's
   results using equal-probable cosines on high order Legendre moments. In
   order to find a reliable comparison between the methods in NJOY and
   alternatives, we derived novel analytical expressions for high order
   Legendre moments of the free gas scattering model. Such expressions are
   analytically tractable but complicated. Using these expressions we
   construct a semi-analytic benchmark for multigroup Legendre moments. By
   comparing the results among the benchmark, Gauss quadrature and NJOY, we
   found that Gauss quadrature can preserve comparable accuracy as NJOY for
   lower order Legendre moments for free gas scattering and outperforms
   NJOY in generating high order moments. Our findings indicate that for
   high-scattering moments, multigroup data could be an source of
   uncertainty in thermal reactor calculations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: E-cadherin plays an important regulatory role in
   implantation, embryo development and placentation. This study aimed to
   determine the effect of mifepristone on E-cadherin expression in human
   villi in early pregnancy.
   Study design: Forty healthy women seeking elective pregnancy termination
   at 5-7 weeks of gestation were recruited. Of these, 22 women chose
   medical termination (mifepristone-treated group) and took 25 mg
   mifepristone every 12 h for 3 days and 600 mu g buccal misoprostol on
   the morning of the fourth day. The other 18 women underwent vacuum
   aspiration (control group). Following collection of villi, E-cadherin
   protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, and
   E-cadherin mRNA expression was assessed by reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: E-cadherin protein expression was significantly higher (p <
   0.05) in villous cytotrophoblast cells in the mifepristone-treated group
   compared with the control group. E-cadherin mRNA expression was also
   significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the mifepristone-treated group
   compared with the control group.
   Conclusion: E-cadherin expression in villi may be involved in
   mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{By angle- and spin-resolved photoemission we have studied electronic
   structure and spin-orbit splitting in graphene/Ni(111) intercalated with
   alloy of high spin-orbit materials Bi and Au. Results are compared to
   ultimate cases of (i) graphene/Ni intercalated only with Au which shows
   giant Rashba splitting (similar to 100 meV) and (ii) graphene/Ni
   intercalated only with Bi for which spin splitting of the Dirac cone is
   nearly zero (<= 10 meV). Our results demonstrate that partial
   substitution of intercalated Au with Bi reduces spin splitting of the
   Dirac cone in graphene and even allows for its systematic adjustment
   through concentration of Bi. Observed effects are ascribed to peculiar
   electronic structure of Bi which has in the valence band no d electronic
   states responsible for the onset of giant Rashba effect through
   electronic hybridization with pi band of graphene. We also report in
   details electronic properties of graphene/Ni(111) intercalated only with
   Bi in various concentrations. Such graphene reveals undistorted band
   structure characteristic to quasifreestanding graphene with small
   n-doping and a minor band gap at the Dirac point (similar to 200 meV)
   which depends weakly on the concentration of Bi. It has been shown that
   this gap is related to the symmetry breaking rather than to the
   topological phase formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Soil aggregates as the basic units of soil structure greatly affect soil
   properties and fertilizer. They have an important theoretical and
   practical significance in studying the change in solute transport with
   different aggregate-size soil on the Loess Plateau. Based on a soil
   column experiment in the laboratory, breakthrough curves (BTCs) of
   chloride displaced through columns of different aggregate sizes of a
   clay soil were measured under water-saturated steady-flow conditions.
   The data were fitted with a convection and dispersion equation (CDE), a
   mobile-immobile model, and a two-flow-region model. In the CDE, all soil
   water was assumed to be mobile with a physical equilibrium existing in
   the system. For the mobile-immobile model, soil water was partitioned
   into mobile and immobile regions and convective diffusive solute
   transport was limited to the mobile water region; however, chloride
   transfer between the two regions was assumed to occur at a rate
   proportional to the difference in tracer concentration between them. In
   the two-flow-region model, soil water was divided into two regions based
   on flow velocities, but neither region had a nonzero flow rate. All
   three models could fit the solute transport curves in columns packed
   with all aggregate sizes at a small pore water velocity (0.68 cm/h), but
   the values of the fitted parameters varied greatly. The Peclet number
   derived from the mobile-immobile model and the two-flow-region model
   showed the same changing tendency with aggregate size, increasing as
   aggregate size increased. The Peclet values derived from the CDE were
   approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by the
   mobile-immobile model and the two-flow-region model. The mobile water
   fraction obtained with the two-flow-region model decreased as aggregate
   sizes increased whereas the mass transfer coefficient. decreased as pore
   water velocity increased because of the short resident time of chloride
   transport through the soil columns. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Title = {{A modified strategy of fuzzy clustering algorithm for image segmentation}},
Journal = {{SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3261-3272}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy clustering algorithm is a frequently used method for image
   segmentation, which allows pixel to be classified into one or more
   clusters with respect to its membership level. However, its segmentation
   performance often suffered from the factors associated with the drift of
   cluster centers and the sensitiveness to the intensity overlap of
   distribution between classes. In this paper, we solve these drawbacks
   and present a modified strategy of fuzzy clustering algorithm for image
   segmentation. This strategy generally consists of two-pass processes.
   The first process is to directly calculate the cluster centers from the
   segmented image and then take the higher value of cluster centers as an
   alternative threshold to prevent the pixels with lower intensity from
   clustering. The second process thereby makes use of the fuzzy clustering
   algorithm with a bias field for partitioning pixels with spatial
   proximity, ensuring that our method is less sensitive to the drawbacks
   inherent in the fuzzy clustering algorithm and thus obtaining promising
   results. Experiments on synthetic and some representative infrared
   images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms fuzzy c-means
   methods and its existing variants in terms of segmentation performance,
   and is less sensitive to the intensity overlap of the distribution
   between classes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of dynamic changes of
   the metabolic syndrome (MS) on the development of type 2 diabetes
   (T2DM). Subjects (3461) were recruited from a cohort study of Prevention
   of Multiple Metabolic disorders and MS in Jiangsu of China (PMMJS) with
   a follow-up of 3.8 years. The associations between the relative risk
   (RR) of T2DM and the dynamic changes (difference, the value at first
   follow-up subtract the value at baseline) of MS component numbers and
   each MS component were analyzed by using Cox regression model. The total
   incidence standardized rate of T2DM was 4.67 \%. The incidence
   standardized rates of T2DM in the group of baseline MS-/first follow-up
   MS-, baseline MS+/first follow-up MS-, baseline MS-/first follow-up MS+,
   and baseline MS+/first follow-up MS+ were 2.16, 2.88, 9.56, and 10.75 \%
   separately. MS subject numbers in four groups was significantly
   associated with risk of T2DM (aRR, 1.85; 95\%CI, 1.62-2.09). Individuals
   with highest quartile of difference of MS component number (DMSCN) were
   approximately 3.92 times to develop T2DM than individuals with lowest
   quartile of DMSCN. After adjustment for the confounding factors,
   difference of systolic blood pressure (SBP), waist circumference (WC),
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and
   fasting plasma glucose (FPG) showed significant associations with the
   incidence of T2DM. The dynamic changes of MS component numbers and four
   groups on the basis of baseline and first follow-up MS and/or non-MS had
   the prediction ability of T2DM. In Chinese, the dynamic change of MS was
   a useful prediction factor for T2DM.}},

   controllers for stabilizing switched systems with average dwell-time
   switching and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. The switching
   signals of the switched system and the controller can be either
   synchronous or asynchronous. In terms of linear matrix inequalities, a
   sufficient condition is presented, which ensures the closed-loop system
   to be robustly exponentially stable. Explicit expressions of the desired
   controller gain matrices can be constructed through the numerical
   solutions of linear matrix inequalities. An iterative algorithm is
   proposed for estimating the lower bound of the average dwell time. The
   effectiveness of the proposed design method is illustrated by two

Abstract = {{Treponema pallidum, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV)-1, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major causes of sexually
   transmitted diseases passed through blood contact. The development of a
   sensitive and efficient method for detection is critical for early
   diagnosis and for large-scale screening of blood specimens in China.
   This study aims to establish an assay to detect these pathogens in
   clinical serum specimens. We established a TaqMan-locked nucleic acid
   (LNA) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid,
   sensitive, specific, quantitative, and simultaneous detection and
   identification. The copy numbers of standards of these 4 pathogens were
   quantified. Standard curves were generated by determining the mean cycle
   threshold values versus 10-fold serial dilutions of standards over a
   range of 10(6) to 10(1) copies/mu L, with the lowest detection limit of
   the assay being 10(1) copies/mu L. The assay was applied to 328 clinical
   specimens and compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   and commercial nucleic acid testing (NAT) methods. The assay identified
   39 T. pallidum-, 96 HCV-, 13 HIV-1-, 123 HBV-, 5 HBV/HCV-, 1 T.
   pallidum/HBV-, 1 HIV-1/HCV-, and 1 HIV-1/T. pallidum-positive specimens.
   The high sensitivity of the assay confers strong potential for its use
   as a highly reliable, cost-effective, and useful molecular diagnostic
   tool for large-scale screening of clinical specimens. This assay will
   assist in the study of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of sexually
   transmitted blood diseases.}},

   self-determination motivation orientations affect students' academic
   performance. The hypotheses were empirically tested using
   cross-sectional data collected from 249 primary school students in
   China. The correlation analysis found that self-determined motivation
   and four of the five personality traits (not emotional instability) were
   significantly positively related to academic performance in English. The
   hierarchical regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for
   gender, openness to new experience and conscientiousness both positively
   predicted English performance. Significant interaction effects were
   found between agreeableness and self-determined motivation, and between
   conscientiousness and self-determined motivation. However,
   conscientiousness and agreeableness only positively predicted academic
   performance when the student's self-determined motivation was low. (C)

Abstract = {{Wind loads on wind turbine towers (WTTs) and fan blades are transferred
   to the reinforced-concrete (RC) foundations by embedded steel anchor
   bolts or circular steel tubes (CSTs). Understandably, the stability and
   bearing capacity of the RC foundations are important to the safety of
   WTTs. The design principle and operation of RC WTT foundations are
   analysed and discussed in this paper. The load-carrying capacity of the
   RC foundations is studied based on the mechanical behaviour of embedded
   CSTs in concrete. The study shows that the concrete over the lower steel
   flange plate of the CST in RC foundations can be easily fractured and
   crushed under extreme typhoon loads. This mode of failure is frequently
   neglected in the design of RC foundations for WTTs. As a result, failure
   of WTTs occurs relatively easily when they are subjected to extreme
   typhoon loads. The failure case study also indicates that serious
   failures are associated with such a design defect. Based on the analysis
   and the case study, some recommendations are put forward in order to
   improve the design of RC foundations for WTTs.}},

Abstract = {{Short rigid large-diameter monopiles have been widely used for offshore
   wind turbines. The rotation of the piles is strictly controlled to
   render safe operation of the wind turbines. Consequently, the
   determination of the bearing capacity within an allowable angular
   rotation of the monopiles is an important issue. In this study, six
   lateral loading tests (at 1 g) were conducted on a rigid model pile in
   low liquid limit silt (ML) soil (with two relative densities). The tests
   reveal a rotational center at a depth of (0.75-0.85) L (L = embedded
   length of the pile) and work-hardening load-displacement curves (a
   continual increase in soil pressures even at a very large rotational
   angle). The test results were used to establish new p-y curves using a
   coefficient of subgrade reaction n(h) that is correlated to the local
   pile displacement. In particular, an analytical expression is developed
   to estimate the net lateral soil resistance p on a circular pile using
   peak-on-pile radial stress. The new p-y curves and analytical solutions
   capture the measured p-y curves and the load-displacement relationship
   of the monopiles in cohesionless soils. (C) 2015 American Society of

   ferric passivated GQDs (Fe-GQDs) are successfully prepared. Due to the
   strong negative inductive effect of Fe, the band gap of the Fe-GQDs was
   broadened, and the photoluminescence emission wavelength is 275 nm for
   an excitation at 224 nm with a very high fluorescent quantum yield (phi
   = 0.63). This is the shortest emission wavelength reported for
   solution-based inorganic and organic quantum dots. The high efficient

Abstract = {{Well TS1 reveals many uncemented pores and vugs at depths of more than
   8000m in a deep Cambrian dolomite reservoir in the Tarim Basin,
   northwestern China. The fluid environment and mechanism required for the
   preservation of reservoir spaces have yet not been well constrained.
   Carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotope compositions and fluid inclusion
   data suggest two types of fluids, meteoric water and hydrothermal fluid,
   affecting the Lower Paleozoic carbonate reservoirs in the Tarim Basin.
   Based on simulation using a thermodynamic model for H2O-CO2-NaCl-CaCO3
   system, meteoric water has the ability to continuously dissolve
   carbonate minerals during downward migration from the surface to deep
   strata until it reaches a transition depth, below which it will begin to
   precipitate carbonate minerals to fill preexisting pore spaces. In
   contrast, hydrothermal fluid has the ability to dissolve carbonate in
   deep strata and precipitate carbonate in shallow strata during upward
   migration. Based on the dissolution-precipitation characteristics of the
   two types of fluids, the ideal fluid environment for the preservation of
   preexisting reservoir spaces occurs when carbonate reservoir is neither
   in the CaCO3 precipitation domain of meteoric water nor in the CaCO3
   precipitation domain of hydrothermal fluid. Taking the Lower Paleozoic
   carbonate reservoirs in the north uplift area as an example, the spaces
   in the deep Cambrian dolomite reservoir near well TS1 were seldom filled
   because thick Ordovician deposits blocked meteoric water from migrating
   downward into the Cambrian dolomite reservoir and because the Cambrian
   dolomite reservoir has been in the domain of hydrothermal dissolution
   since the Permian. The deep carbonate layers in basins elsewhere with a
   similar fluid environment may have high uncemented porosity and
   consequently have good hydrocarbon exploration potential.}},

Abstract = {{Algorithms for locating the neutron source by neutron time-of-flight
   (TOF) measurement are established and discussed for monoenergetic and
   multienergetic neutrons in this paper. For the monoenergetic neutron
   source, the location of the source could be estimated by locating the
   position where the variance between the actual TOF and the calculation
   gains its minimum. For multienergetic neutrons the maximum likelihood
   (ML) method has been applied to process the time-correlation
   measurement. The efficiencies of location estimations are studies with
   simulations. In the simulations, the TOFs are acquired by
   time-correlation measurement of three neutron detectors surrounding the
   suspected area of the neutron source. The results indicate that the
   location of mono energetic neutron sources could be estimated by the
   neutron TOF acquired by three detectors, while for multienergetic
   neutron sources, the likelihood method could be used to locate the most
   probable location, as well as its possible distribution of location. As
   the result of large-scale simulation and comparison, the ML estimation
   method is more effective than traditional methods, especially in
   conditions of low count rates or low resolution.}},

   The resistivity of CH3NH3PbI3-coated LSMO is more than five orders
   larger than that of LSMO. The MR effect from LSMO bulk can be safely
   excluded. The MR curves can be separated into two parts: 1) low-field MR
   (LFMR) and 2) high-field MR (HFMR). LFMR can be attributed to the spin
   retaining transport in CH3NH3PbI3 and spin-dependent scattering at the
   LSMO particle surface, and the HFMR can be explained by the
   field-dependent carrier injection at the interface of LSMO and
   CH3NH3PbI3. The observation of MR in CH3NH3PbI3-coated LSMO granular

Title = {{Fault-Tolerant Scheduling for Real-Time Tasks on Multiple
   Earth-Observation Satellites}},

Abstract = {{Fault-tolerance plays an important role in improving the reliability of
   multiple earth-observing satellites, especially in emergent scenarios
   such as obtaining photographs on battlefields or earthquake areas. Fault
   tolerance can be implemented through scheduling approaches.
   Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to fault-tolerant
   scheduling on satellites. To address this issue, we propose a novel
   dynamic fault-tolerant scheduling model for real-time tasks running on
   multiple observation satellites. In this model, the primary-backup
   policy is employed to tolerate one satellite's permanent failure at one
   time instant. In the light of the fault-tolerant model, we develop a
   novel fault-tolerant satellite scheduling algorithm named FTSS. To
   improve the resource utilization, we apply the overlapping technology
   that includes primary-backup copy overlapping (i.e., PB overlapping) and
   backup-backup copy overlapping (i.e., BB overlapping). According to the
   satellites characterized with time windows for observations, we
   extensively analyze the overlapping mechanism on satellites. We
   integrate the overlapping mechanism with FTSS, which employs the task
   merging strategies including primary-backup copy merging (i.e., PB
   merging), backup-backup copy merging (i.e., BB merging) and
   primary-primary copy merging (i.e., PP merging). These merging
   strategies are used to decrease the number of tasks required to be
   executed, thereby enhancing system schedulability. To demonstrate the
   superiority of our FTSS, we conduct extensive experiments using the
   real-world satellite parameters supplied from the satellite tool kit or
   STK; we compare FTSS with the three baseline algorithms, namely, NMFTSS,
   NOFTSS, and NMNOFTSS. The experimental results indicate that FTSS
   efficiently improves the scheduling quality of others and is suitable
   for fault-tolerant satellite scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{The pathophysiology of COX-2 expression in endometriosis is a matter of
   debate. The aim was to investigate the role of DNA methylation of the
   NF-IL6 site within the promoter of COX-2 gene in the pathogenesis of
   endometriosis. The endometrial tissues (ectopic and eutopic) were
   collected from 60 women with endometriosis and 30 women without
   endometriosis (control group). The methylation status of COX-2 was
   examined by methylation-specific PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR
   (RT-PCR) was performed to measure COX-2 mRNA levels in endometrial
   tissues. We found significantly higher levels of COX-2 in ectopic
   endometriotic tissue compared with eutopic tissue. Also, we found that
   the frequencies of methylation status of the NF-IL6 site within the
   COX-2 promoter in the eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues of
   endometriosis groups were significantly decreased in comparison to
   controls (P=0.002, P=0.000 respectively). Our study demonstrated that
   DNA hypomethylation of the NF-IL6 site within the promoter of COX-2 gene
   could be a key mechanism for its elevated expression in the eutopic and
   ectopic tissues of endometriosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background. Hereditary factors play an important etiologic role in
   thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD), with a number of genes
   proven to predispose to this condition. We initiated a clinical program
   for routine genetic testing of individuals for TAAD by whole exome
   sequencing (WES). Here we present our initial results.
   Methods. The WES was performed in 102 patients (mean age 56.8 years;
   range 13 to 83; 70 males {[}68.6\%]) with TAAD. The following 21-gene
   panel was tested by WES: ACTA2, ADAMTS10, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1,
   COL5A1, COL5A2, ELN, FBLN4, FLNA, FBN1, FBN2, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1,
   PRKG1, SLC2A10, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1, TGFBR2.
   Results. Seventy-four patients (72.5\%) had no medically important
   genetic alterations. Four patients (3.9\%) had a deleterious mutation
   identified in the FBN1, COL5A1, MYLK, and FLNA genes. Twenty-two
   (21.6\%) previously unreported suspicious variants of unknown
   significance were identified in 1 or more of the following genes: FBN1
   (n = 5); MYH11 (n = 4); ACTA2 (n = 2); COL1A1 (n = 2); TGFBR1 (n = 2);
   COL3A1 (n = 1); COL5A1 (n = 1); COL5A2 (n = 1); FLNA (n = 1); NOTCH1 (n
   = 1); PRKG1 (n = 1); and TGFBR3 (n = 1). Identified mutations had
   implications for clinical management.
   Conclusions. Routine genetic screening of patients with TAAD provides
   information that enables genetically personalized care and permits
   identification of novel mutations responsible for aortic pathology.
   Analysis of large data sets of variants of unknown significance that
   include associated clinical features will help define the mutational
   spectrum of known genes underlying this phenotype and potential identify
   new candidate loci. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Transactional associations of emotional sensitivity and coping with peer
   rejection were tested, whereby coping was expected to be a manifestation
   of sensitivity but also a player in the development of sensitivity.
   Early adolescents (N = 711, grades 5-7) completed three repeated
   questionnaires over 14 months. Using structural equation modeling,
   emotional sensitivity was indicated by depressive symptoms, social
   anxiety symptoms, and rejection sensitivity. Transactional associations
   between sensitivity and coping were found, with adolescents higher in
   baseline sensitivity reporting more social avoidance and rumination over
   time and, conversely, adolescents higher in avoidance and rumination
   increasing in sensitivity over time. Participants histories of peer
   victimization and exclusion were associated with greater emotional
   sensitivity and more use of most coping responses, but did not have
   temporal associations with sensitivity or coping and were not a
   moderator of associations. Sex differences in sensitivity and coping
   were found, but there was no moderation by participant sex. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETwo definitions of T1 hypointense (T1H) lesions
   can be derived from pre-contrast images: those that may or may not have
   a corresponding gadolinium-enhancing correlate on post-contrast images
   (T1H total), and those that are simultaneously non-gadolinium-enhancing
   on post-contrast scans (T1H non-enhancing). To determine the differences
   in lesion evolution between these two T1H definitions, we examined the
   effect of glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL three times weekly subcutaneous
   injection (GA40) on the number of new or enlarging T1H total and T1H
   non-enhancing lesions in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple
   sclerosis (RRMS).
   METHODSThe Phase III GALA study randomized 1404 RRMS subjects 2:1 to
   receive GA40 or placebo for 12 months. MRI scans were obtained at
   baseline and at months 6 and 12. Cumulative numbers of T1H total and of
   T1H non-enhancing lesions were analyzed using an adjusted negative
   binomial regression model. A total of 1,357 patients had MRI data
   collected at either the month 6 or month 12 visit.
   RESULTSAmong the 1,357 patients with MRI scans performed at either the
   month 6 or month 12 visit, 883 treated with GA40 developed an adjusted
   cumulative mean of 1.72 T1H total lesions versus 2.62 in 440 placebo
   controls (risk ratio, .66; 95\% CI, .54-.80; P < .0001). On T1H
   non-enhanced scans, GA40-treated patients developed an adjusted
   cumulative mean of 1.35 T1H non-enhancing lesions versus 1.91 in placebo
   controls (risk ratio, .71; CI, .58-.87; P = .0009).
   CONCLUSIONSGA40 significantly reduced the number of new or enlarging T1H
   total lesions and T1H non-enhancing lesions compared with placebo.
   Although the treatment effect magnitude was comparable with both
   definitions, the use of T1H non-enhancing lesions may be more relevant
   for more uniform standardization in future clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic study of the oxidation of n-propyl mercaptan (PrSH) with
   chloridotetraphenylporphyrinatocobalt(III) in the absence of oxygen has

   found to be close to those of the oxidation step of the Co(II) complex,
   and the structure of the transition state has been hypothesized. A
   stepwise mechanism of PrSH oxidation in the presence of Co complexes is
   proposed, comprising the sequential oxidation of PrSH with cobalt(III)
   tetraphenylporphyrinate and the oxidation of the resulting Co(II)
   complex with oxygen. The adequacy of the proposed scheme has been
   kinetically substantiated using the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Scope: Elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor associated
   with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Tomato lycopene has
   been found to have a hypocholesterolemic effect, and the effect was
   considered to be related to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis.
   However, since plasma cholesterol levels are also influenced by the
   absorption of cholesterol in the gut, the present study is to
   investigate whether lycopene affects cholesterol absorption in the
   intestinal Caco-2 cells.
   Methods and results: The Caco-2 cells were pretreated with lycopene at
   different concentrations for 24 h and then incubated with radioactive
   micellar cholesterol for 2 h. The absorption of radioactive cholesterol
   was quantified by liquid scintillation. The expression of Niemann-Pick
   C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) was analyzed
   by Western blot and qPCR. We found that lycopene dose dependently
   inhibited cholesterol absorption and the expression of NPC1L1 protein
   and NPC1L1 mRNA. The inhibitory effects of lycopene on cholesterol
   absorption and NPC1L1 expression could be prevented by blockade of the
   LXR alpha pathway.
   Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that lycopene
   inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestinal cells and this
   inhibitory effect of lycopene is mediated, at least in part, by LXR
   alpha-NPC1L1 signaling pathway.}},

   This paper reviews the instances when Whites' efforts to acknowledge,

   people of color's group identity uncomfortably salient (minority
   spotlight effect), make people of color feel that certain attributes are
   being imposed onto their group identity (positive stereotyping), or make
   people of color feel precluded from another group identity (identity
   denial). Each of these situations introduces a hurtful discrepancy
   between how people of color are seen by others and how they wish to be
   seen. Suggestions for how to ``do{''} multiculturalism in ways that

Abstract = {{Autophagy is a tightly-regulated catabolic pathway involving degradation
   of cellular proteins, cytoplasm and organelles. Recent evidence suggests
   that autophagy plays a potential role in cell death as a tumor
   suppressor and that its induction especially in combination with
   apoptosis could be beneficial. It remains unclear if all cancer cells
   behave the same mechanism when autophagy is induced. Although mammalian
   target of rapamycin (mTOR) is well known as a negative regulator of
   autophagy, the relationship between signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 (STAT3) and autophagy has not yet been investigated.
   Oroxylin A, a natural mono-flavonoid extracted from Scutellariae radix,
   is a promising therapeutic agent for treating multiple cancers. Here we
   investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of oroxylin A on
   malignant glioma cells. We showed that oroxylin A inhibited the
   proliferation of malignant glioma cells by inducing autophagy in a dose-
   and time-dependent manner. Oroxylin A treatment inhibits the AKT and ERK
   activation and the downstream phosphorylation level of mTOR and STAT3.
   In addition, oroxylin A treatment decreases the expression of Notch-1
   and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) but upregulates Beclin 1, the key
   autophagy-related protein. 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) or knockdown of
   Beclin 1 partially can rescue cells from oroxylin A-induced autophagic
   cell death. In contrast, knockdown of STAT3 aggravates oroxylin
   A-induced autophagic cell death. Our data reveal an important role of
   autophagy in enhancing cell death induced by oroxylin A and conclude
   that oroxylin A exerts anti-malignant glioma proficiency by inducing
   autophagy via the ERK/AKT-mTOR-STAT3-Notch signaling cascade. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Separation and purification of the Si crystal during solidification
   process of hypereutectic Al-30Si melt under traveling magnetic field
   (TMF) were investigated in the present study. The results showed that
   under a proper condition the Si-rich layer can be formed in the
   periphery of the ingot while the inner microstructure is mainly the
   Al-Si eutectic structure. The intense melt flow carries the bulk liquid
   with higher Si content to promote the growth of the primary Si phase
   which is first precipitated close to the inner wall of the crucible with
   a relatively lower temperature, which resulting in the remarkable
   segregation of the primary Si phase. The impurity contents of the
   refined Si can be reduced to a very low level. The typical metallic
   impurities have removal fraction higher than 99.5\%. In addition, there
   is a significant difference in the P contents between the primary and
   eutectic Si phases, which might be ascribed to the formation of AlP
   phase that acts as the heterogeneous nucleation sites. Furthermore, a
   considerable amount of Fe-containing particles with a size about 100-300
   nm is found inside the eutectic Si phase, indicating an unintended
   entrapment of Fe in Si. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Genesis 38 is a troubling text. On the face of it, Tamar, a local
   Canaanite woman, becomes in short order the widow of Judah's two eldest
   sons. Judah's response is to leave Tamar as a widow, and not allow his
   third son to marry her. When Tamar, in order to become pregnant, ignores
   established sexual taboos, Judah thinks that his problem has been
   solved; he calls for her execution. When the true facts come to light,
   including his part in this incestuous affair, he admits that she is more
   in the right than he for his failure to resolve the matter. In the late
   Second Temple period and beyond, the authors of the Pseudepigrapha feel
   compelled to right the perception of the characters involved by
   rewriting this disconcerting narrative. In so doing, depending on the
   source, they exonerate Judah of the worst aspects of his perfidy, seek
   to shift the blame to Tamar herself, or praise Tamar as a virtuous

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of
   dopaminergic neurons and consequent dopamine (DA) deficit, and current
   treatment still remains a challenge. Although neural stem cells (NSCs)
   have been evaluated as appealing graft sources, mechanisms underlying
   the beneficial phenomena are not well understood. Here, we investigate
   whether human NSCs (hNSCs) transplantation could provide neuroprotection
   against DA depletion by recruiting endogenous cells to establish a
   favorable niche. Adult mice subjected to
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were transplanted
   with hNSCs or vehicle into the striatum. Behavioral and histological
   analyses demonstrated significant neurorescue response observed in
   hNSCs-treated animals compared with the control mice. In transplanted
   animals, grafted cells survived, proliferated, and migrated within the
   astrocytic scaffold. Notably, more local astrocytes underwent
   de-differentiation, acquiring the properties of NSCs or neural precursor
   cells (NPCs) in mice given hNSCs. Additionally, we also detected
   significantly higher expression of host-derived growth factors in
   hNSCs-transplanted mice compared with the control animals, together with
   inhibition of local microglia and proinflammatory cytokines. Overall,
   our results indicate that hNSCs transplantation exerts neuroprotection
   in MPTP-insulted mice via regulating the host niche. Harnessing
   synergistic interaction between the grafts and host cells may help
   optimize cell-based therapies for PD.}},

   1979-2014 are studied using monthly mean data from ERA-Interim

   satellite data. We estimated how TO variations, averaged over different
   latitudinal belts and globally, are modulated by Arctic and Antarctic
   oscillations, quasi-biennial oscillations of zonal wind in the
   equatorial stratosphere, El Nino - Southern Oscillation, zonal average
   meridional heat flux in the lower stratosphere, solar activity (SA),
   stratospheric content of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and volcanic
   aerosol particles. Variations in global TO can be described well using
   regression dependence on ODS and SA; and certain of the above-mentioned
   factors should be additionally taken into consideration for a more
   accurate quantitative description of TO time behavior in certain
   latitudinal belts.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel prototype high-efficiency miniature pump that
   uses magnetic properties of a ferrofluid in both pumping and valving
   mechanisms is presented. The minichannel consisting of a cylindrical
   pumping chamber, a check valve, an inlet and an outlet, comprises six
   bonded layers of PMMA. A cylindrical permanent magnet that is placed
   inside the chamber and is externally actuated by a motorized off-center
   permanent magnet, functions as a revolving piston which sweeps the
   perimeter of the cylinder. Ferrofluid is used to cover the gaps between
   the magnetic piston and the channel walls, also serves as a separating
   plug between the inlet and the outlet of the chamber preventing
   recirculation of the pumped fluid inside the chamber. This novel
   revolving piston design eliminates the need for an inlet valve. Pressure
   head is maintained using one ball check valve at the outlet of the pump.
   Water has been successfully pumped at flow rates of up to 934 mu L/min,
   backpressures of up to 994 Pa, and maximum achieved volumetric
   efficiency of 79 percent while working at 80, 52, and 9 rpm rates,

Title = {{Childhood injury after a parental cancer diagnosis}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{A parental cancer diagnosis is psychologically straining for the whole
   family. We investigated whether a parental cancer diagnosis is
   associated with a higher-than-expected risk of injury among children by
   using a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study. Compared to
   children without parental cancer, children with parental cancer had a
   higher rate of hospital contact for injury during the first year after
   parental cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.27, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.22-1.33), especially when the parent had a comorbid
   psychiatric disorder after cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.41, 95\% CI =
   1.08-1.85). The rate increment declined during the second and third year
   after parental cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.10, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.14) and
   became null afterwards (HR = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.99-1.03). Children with
   parental cancer also had a higher rate of repeated injuries than the
   other children (HR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.12-1.15). Given the high rate of
   injury among children in the general population, our findings may have
   important public health implications.}},

Abstract = {{WebView is a vital component in smartphone platforms like Android,
   Windows and iOS that enables smartphone applications (apps) to embed a
   simple yet powerful web browser inside them. WebView not only provides
   the same functionalities as web browser, it, more importantly, enables a
   rich interaction between apps and webpages loaded inside the WebView.
   However, the design and the features of WebView lays path to tamper the
   sandbox protection mechanism implemented by browsers. As a consequence,
   malicious attacks can be launched either against the apps or by the apps
   through the exploitation of WebView APIs. This paper presents a critical
   attack called Supplementary Event-Listener Injection (SEI) attack which
   adds auxiliary event listeners, for executing malicious activities, on
   the HTML elements in the webpage loaded by the WebView via JavaScript
   Injection. This paper also proposes an automated static analysis system
   for analyzing WebView embedded apps to classify the kind of
   vulnerability possessed by them and a solution for the mitigation of the
   attack.}},

   Using the method of matrix geometric solution, we derive the performance
   measures in terms of interference rate of PU packets, average delay and
   throughput of SU packets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of the
   number of the reserved (resp. licensed) channels on the system
   performance with numerical experiments. Finally, to optimize the

Title = {{Hypothesis: NDL proteins function in stress responses by regulating
   microtubule organization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE proteins (NDL), members of the alpha/beta
   hydrolase superfamily were recently rediscovered as interactors of
   G-protein signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the precise
   molecular function of NDL proteins is still elusive, in animals these
   proteins play protective role in hypoxia and expression is induced by
   hypoxia and nickel, indicating role in stress. Homology of NDL1 with
   animal counterpart N-MYC DOWNREGULATED GENE (NDRG) suggests similar
   functions in animals and plants. It is well established that stress
   responses leads to the microtubule depolymerization and reorganization
   which is crucial for stress tolerance. NDRG is a microtubule-associated
   protein which mediates the microtubule organization in animals by
   causing acetylation and increases the stability of ci-tubulin. As NDL1
   is highly homologous to NDRG, involvement of NDL1 in the microtubule
   organization during plant stress can also be expected. Discovery of
   interaction of NDL with protein kinesin light chain- related 1,
   enodomembrane family protein 70, syntaxin-23, tubulin alpha-2 chain, as
   a part of G protein interactome initiative encourages us to postulate
   microtubule stabilizing functions for NDL family in plants. Our search
   for NDL interactors in G protein interactome also predicts the role of
   NDL proteins in abiotic stress tolerance management. Based on published
   report in animals and predicted interacting partners for NDL in G
   protein interactome lead us to hypothesize involvement of NDL in the
   microtubule organization during abiotic stress management in plants.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the anti-inflammatory compound NPC-14686 on intracellular
   Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+) and viability in OC2 human oral cancer
   cells was investigated. The Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fura-2 was
   used to examine {[}Ca2+](i). NPC-14686 induced {[}Ca2+]; rises in a
   concentration-dependent fashion. The effect was reduced approximately by
   10\% by removing extracellular Ca2+. NPC-14686-elicited Ca2+ signal was
   decreased by nifedipine, econazole, SKF96365, and GF109203X. In
   Ca2+-free medium, incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump
   inhibitor thapsigargin or 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished
   NPC-14686-induced {[}Ca2+]; rises. Conversely, pretreatment with
   NPC-14686 abolished thapsigargin or BHQ-induced {[}Ca2+]; rises.
   Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 abolished NPC-14686-induced
   {[}Ca2+]; rises. At 20-100 mu M, NPC-14686 inhibited cell viability,
   which was not reversed by chelating cytosolic Ca2+ with
   1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl
   ester (BAPTA/AM). NPC-14686 between 20 mu M and 40 mu M also induced
   apoptosis. Collectively, in OC2 cells, NPC-14686 induced {[}Ca2+](i)
   rises by evoking phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ release from the
   endoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ entry via protein kinase C-regulated
   store-operated Ca2+ channels. NPC-14686 also caused Ca2+-independent
   apoptosis.}},

Title = {{Decoding brain state transitions in the pedunculopontine nucleus:
   cooperative phasic and tonic mechanisms}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) are most
   active during the waking state. Their activation is deemed to cause a
   switch in the global brain activity from sleep to wakefulness, while
   their sustained discharge may contribute to upholding the waking state
   and enhancing arousal. Similarly, non-cholinergic PPN neurons are
   responsive to brain state transitions and their activation may influence
   some of the same targets of cholinergic neurons, suggesting that they
   operate in coordination. Yet, it is not clear how the discharge of
   distinct classes of PPN neurons organize during brain states. Here, we
   monitored the in vivo network activity of PPN neurons in the
   anesthetized rat across two distinct levels of cortical dynamics and
   their transitions. We identified a highly structured configuration in
   PPN network activity during slow-wave activity that was replaced by
   decorrelated activity during the activated state (AS). During the
   transition, neurons were predominantly excited (phasically or
   tonically), but some were inhibited. Identified cholinergic neurons
   displayed phasic and short latency responses to sensory stimulation,
   whereas the majority of non-cholinergic showed tonic responses and
   remained at high discharge rates beyond the state transition. In vitro
   recordings demonstrate that cholinergic neurons exhibit fast adaptation
   that prevents them from discharging at high rates over prolonged time
   periods. Our data shows that PPN neurons have distinct but complementary
   roles during brain state transitions, where cholinergic neurons provide
   a fast and transient response to sensory events that drive state
   transitions, whereas non-cholinergic neurons maintain an elevated firing
   rate during global activation.}},

Title = {{3-phase dual-energy CT scan as a feasible salvage imaging modality for
   the identification of non-localizing parathyroid adenomas: a prospective
   study}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Accurate pre-operative imaging of parathyroid adenomas (PAs)
   is essential for successful minimally invasive surgery; however, rates
   of non-localizing PAs can be as high as 18\%. Multiphasic dual-energy CT
   (DECT) has the potential to increase accuracy of PA detection by
   enabling creation of paired material maps and spectral tissue
   characterization. This study prospectively evaluated the utility of
   3-phase DECT for PA identification in patients with failed localizatio n
   via standard imaging.
   Methods: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and non-localizing
   PAs underwent a 3 phase post-contrast DECT scan acquired at 25, 55, and
   85 s. The scans were prospectively evaluated by two head and neck
   radiologists. Pre-operative localization was compared to intraoperative
   localization and final histopathology. A post-hoc DECT spectral density
   characterization was performed on pathologically-proven PAs.
   Results: Out of 29 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and
   non-localized PAs, DECT identified candidates in 26. Of the 23 patients
   who underwent parathyroidectomy, DECT provided precise anatomic
   localization in 20 patients (PPV = 87.0 \%), one with multi-gland
   disease. The virtual unenhanced images were not found to be useful for
   diagnosis but successful diagnosis was made without an unenhanced phase
   regardless. Spectral analysis demonstrated a distinct spectral
   Hounsfield attenuation curve for PAs compared to lymph nodes on arterial
   phase images.
   Conclusion: 3-phase DECT without an unenhanced phase is a feasible
   salvage imaging modality for previously non-localizing parathyroid
   adenomas. Optimal interpretation is achieved based on a combination of
   perfusion characteristics and other morphologic features. Advanced
   spectral DECT analysis has the potential for further increasing accuracy
   of PA identification in the future.}},

Title = {{Stress analysis of parallel oil and gas steel pipelines in inclined
   tunnels}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Geological conditions along long distance pipelines are complex. In
   consideration of differences in elevation and terrain obstacles, long
   distance pipelines are commonly laid through tunnels. Oil and gas
   pipelines are often laid side by side to reduce construction costs and
   minimize geological impact. The layout and construction of parallel oil
   and gas pipelines are more complex than those of single pipelines. In
   order to reduce safety hazards, it is necessary to carry out stress
   analysis of the oil and gas pipelines that run through tunnels. In this
   study, a stress analysis model of pipelines running through a tunnel was
   developed. On the basis of the finite element method, CAESAR II software
   was used to analyze the stress and displacement of a section of parallel
   oil and gas pipelines that run through tunnels and stress and
   displacement distribution laws were drawn from the analyses. A study of
   the factors influencing stress recommended that: (1) The buttress
   interval of the parallel oil and gas pipelines in a tunnel should be 12
   m; (2) The angle of inclined pipelines should be no greater than 25
   degrees; (3) The stress of oil pipelines enhances more obviously than
   that of gas pipelines under earthquake action; (4) The average stress
   can be reduced by adopting `` ladder{''} laying; and (5) Guide bend can
   be set at the tunnel entrance and exit in order to reduce the stress.}},

   This paper introduces an efficient chaosbased stream cipher, composing
   two chaotic maps (Logistic map and Standard map) and a large enough
   external secret key for image encryption. The external secret key is
   used to derive the initial conditions for the chaotic maps, and is
   employed with the two chaotic maps to confuse the relationship between
   the cipher image and the plain image. The proposed chaotic system shows
   excellent chaotic behaviours encryption performance, high sensitivity to

Abstract = {{Background: Gut-derived bacterial endotoxin is an important cofactor in
   the pathogenesis of IBD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for
   maintenance of peripheral tolerance and can prevent and alleviate IBD.
   To determine the immune modulatory effect of anti-LPS enriched
   hyperimmune colostrum, its ability to induce Tregs and alleviate immune
   mediated colitis.
   Methods: Immune-mediated colitis was induced in mice by intra-colonic
   instillation of Trinitrobenzene Sulfonate (TNBS). Four groups of mice
   were orally administered with two dosages of IgG-enriched colostrum
   fractions. The fractions were harvested from cows immunized against LPS
   derived from intestinal Escherichia coli bacteria (Imm124E). Control
   mice received non-immunized colostrum or vehicle (PBS). Treatment was
   administered one day following sensitization and four additional days
   following the administration of TNBS. The following parameters in the
   mice were tracked: body weight, bowel histology, serum cytokine levels
   and regulatory T cells.
   Results: Oral administration of Imm124E hyperimmune colostrum
   ameliorated immune-mediated colitis. Significant amelioration of weight
   reduction was noted in treated mice. Oral administration of Imm124E
   improved bowel histology. Both the extent of the disease, inflammation
   score, and colitis damage and regeneration scores decreased in Imm-124E
   treated animals. These effects were associated with an increase in serum
   IL10 anti inflammatory cytokine levels, and an increase in CD4+CD25+ and
   CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs.
   Conclusions: Oral administration of Imm124E promoted Tregs and
   alleviated bowel inflammation in immune mediated colitis. The present
   data suggests that the microbiome may serve as a target for Tregs-based
   immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory batch reactors were maintained for 32 weeks to test the
   potential for an in situ remedy that combines chemical oxidation,
   stabilization, and anaerobic bioremediation in a single application to
   treat soil from a manufactured gas plant, contaminated with polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
   xylenes (BTEX). Portland cement and slaked lime were used to activate
   the persulfate and to stabilize/encapsulate the contaminants that were
   not chemically oxidized. Native sulfate-reducing bacteria degraded
   residual contaminants using the sulfate left after persulfate
   activation. The ability of the combined remedy to reduce contaminant
   mass and leachability was compared with NaOH-activated persulfate,
   stabilization, and sulfate-reducing bioremediation as stand-alone
   technologies. The stabilization amendments increased pH and temperature
   sufficiently to activate the persulfate within I week. Activation with
   both stabilization amendments and NaOH removed between 55\% and 70\% of
   PAH and BTEX. However, combined persulfate and stabilization
   significantly reduced the leachability of residual BTEX and PAH compared
   with NaOH activation. Sulfide, 2-naphthoic acid, and the abundance of
   subunit A of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene (dsrA) were used
   to monitor native sulfate-reducing bacteria, which were negatively
   impacted by activated persulfate, but recovered completely within weeks.

Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Four small-scale gravel-based integrated vertical-flow constructed
   wetlands (IVCWs) were established to treat domestic and secondary
   wastewater (SW) in parallel under two loading rates (LRs) for an
   operational period of about two years and the total phosphorus (TP)
   removal performances were investigated and compared. Highly effective TP
   elimination sustained for about 10d, with remarkable declines followed
   to relatively stable efficiencies for both types of wastewater.
   Significant difference of TP removal performance for the two types of
   wastewater was observed. In period 1, under high LR, the IVCWs performed
   better when treating domestic wastewater (DW), achieving average removal
   efficiency and rate of 51.6\% and 0.389gm(-2)d(-1), respectively,
   compared to those of 30.1\% and 0.233gm(-2)d(-1) for SW. However, in the
   operational period 2 fed with a low LR, better TP removal performance
   was achieved for SW, with reduction efficiency and rate of 41.5\% and
   0.057gm(-2)d(-1) on average, while the corresponding value for the
   treatment of DW was just 12.5\% and 0.023gm(-2)d(-1). Significant
   correlations between TP removal efficiency and plant growth detected
   during this period and better developed vegetation in systems fed with
   SW might suggest the considerable role of plant growth, which could be
   influenced by inlet properties, on P retention and lifespan extending of
   constructed wetland. Gravel-based IVCW could be employed to remove low
   load of phosphorus and wastewater properties, and plant growth cycle
   should be taken intoconsideration in future IVCW design and application.}},

   friction-reducing and anti-wear capacities of rapeseed oil. The
   prominent tribological performances of SA/CeBO3 in rapeseed oil were
   attributed to the formation of a composite boundary lubrication film
   mainly composed of lubricous tribochemical species of B2O3, CeO2 and
   Fe2O3, and the adsorbates of SA/CeBO3 and rapeseed oil, on the
   tribo-surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Messages conveyed by media act as a major drive in shaping attitudes and
   inducing opinion shift. On the other hand, individuals are strongly
   affected by peer pressure while forming their own judgment. We solve a
   general model of opinion dynamics where individuals either hold one of
   two alternative opinions or are undecided and interact pairwise while
   exposed to an external influence. As media pressure increases, the
   system moves from pluralism to global consensus; four distinct classes
   of collective behavior emerge, crucially depending on the outcome of
   direct interactions among individuals holding opposite opinions.
   Observed nontrivial behaviors include hysteretic phenomena and
   resilience of minority opinions. Notably, consensus could be
   unachievable even when media and microscopic interactions are biased in
   favor of the same opinion: The unfavored opinion might even gain the
   support of the majority.}},

Abstract = {{A new spiral tube assembly was designed to improve the column capacity
   and partition efficiency for protein separation. This spiral tube
   assembly has greater column capacity than the original tubing because of
   an increase in radial grooves from 4 to 12 to accommodate more spiral
   layers and 12 narrow spots instead of 4 in each circular loop to
   interrupt the laminar flow that causes sample band broadening. Standard
   PTFE tubing (1.6 mm ID) and the modified flat-twisted tubing were used
   as the separation column. The performances of both assemblies were
   compared for separating three stable test proteins including cytochrome
   c, myoglobin, and lysozyme using a two phase aqueous aqueous solvent
   system composed of polyethylene glycol 1000 (12.5\% w/w) and dibasic
   potassium phosphate (12.5\% w/w). All samples were run at 1, 2, 3, and 5
   mL/min at both 800 rpm and 1000 rpm. The separation of these three
   protein samples produced high stationary phase retentions at 1, 2, and 3
   mL/min, yet separated efficiently at 5 mL/min in 40 min. After comparing
   the separation efficiency in terms of the peak resolutions, theoretical
   plate numbers, and separation times, it was determined that the
   flat-twisted tubing was more effective in separating these protein
   samples. In order to validate the efficacy of this novel assembly, a
   mixture of five protein samples (cytochrome c, myoglobin, ovalbumin,
   lysozyme, and hemoglobin) were separated, under the optimal conditions
   established with these three protein samples, at I mL/min with a
   revolution speed of 1000 rpm. There were high stationary phase
   retentions of around 60\%, with effective separations, demonstrating the
   efficiency of the flat-twisted spiral tube assembly. The separation time
   of 6 h was a limitation but can potentially be shortened by improving
   the strength of the column that will permit an increase in revolution
   speed and flow rate. This novel spiral separation column will allow
   rapid and efficient separation of mixtures with high yield of the
   constituent components. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Immunological disturbances are hypothesised to play a role in recurrent
   miscarriage (RM) and therefore intravenous immunoglubulins (IVIg) have
   been tested in RM patients.
   Objectives
   The objectives were to investigate the benefits and harms of IVIg versus
   placebo, no intervention, or treatment as usual in women with RM.
   Search Strategy
   We searched the published literature in all relevant databases.
   Selection Criteria
   Randomised trials investigating IVIg versus placebo, no intervention, or
   treatment as usual in women with RM.
   Data Collection and Analysis
   We undertook meta-analyses of aggregated data and individual patient
   data using a two-step approach, and we conducted bias domain assessments
   and trial sequential analyses to assess the risks of systematic and
   random errors.
   Main Results
   We identified 11 randomised clinical trials. No significant difference
   in the frequency of no live birth was found when IVIg was compared with
   placebo or treatment as usual (RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.75-1.12, p = 0.42).
   Trial sequential analysis showed that the required information size of
   1,008 participants was not obtained. IVIg compared with placebo seems to
   increase the risk of adverse events. Subgroup analysis suggests that
   women with RM after a birth (secondary RM) seemed most likely to obtain
   a potential beneficial effect of IVIg (RR for no live birth 0.77, 95\%
   CI 0.58-1.02, p = 0.06), however, trial sequential analysis showed that
   insufficient information is presently accrued.
   Conclusion
   We cannot recommend or refute IVIg in women with RM. IVIg should
   therefore be assessed in further randomised clinical trials with
   positive outcomes before any clinical use is considered.}},

Abstract = {{An Online post-column solvent-assisted ionization (OPSAI) method was
   developed for enhancing the ionization of the beta-blocker propranolol
   utilizing normal phase LC-MS/MS. Solvent-assisted electrospray
   ionization (SAESI) was studied by the introduction of the assistant
   solvents A: 0.5\% Formic acid in Isopropanolol, B: 0.5\% Formic acid in
   lsopropanolol-Water (1:1), and C: 0.5\% Formic acid in water into the
   electrospray ionization chamber using a spray needle. Analyte molecules
   can be directly ionized by the aid of the assistant solvent spray. Both
   methods were applied to the chiral separation of propranolol enantiomers
   using normal phase analysis on cellulose-based chiral column.
   Interestingly, both methods are easy to handle and offer a wide range of
   assistant solvents that can be used in order to gain the optimum
   ionization of the analyte molecules. The both methods considerably
   improved the analyte signal and the peak area greatly increased. The
   propranolol average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was enhanced from 26 +/-
   1 and 42 +/- 1 to 2341 +/- 61 and 1725 +/- 29 for R-propranolol and
   S-propranolol, respectively, when the post-column solvent method (OPSAI)
   was used with isopropanol-assistant solvent (A). While in case of
   solvent-assisted electrospray ionization method (SAESI) signal was
   enhanced from 26 +/- 1 and 42 +/- 1 to 2223 +/- 72 and 2155 +/- 58 for
   R-propranolol and S-propranolol, respectively, with water as an
   assistant solvent. The limit of detection was 10 ng/mL and the method
   was linear in the range 50-2000 ng/mL. The NPLC-MS method was applied
   for the determination of propranolol enantiomers in human plasma after
   microextraction by packed C18 sorbent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Recent discoveries regarding the importance of isomiRs have increased
   our understanding of the regulatory complexities of the miRNAome.
   Observed changes in the miRNA profiles in mosquitoes infected with
   flaviviruses have implicated small RNAs in the interactions between
   viruses and their vectors. Here we analysed the isomiR profiles of both
   uninfected and infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the major human
   pathogen dengue virus (DENV). We found that several specific isomiRs
   were significantly altered in their abundance patterns in response to
   DENV infection potentially affecting their target repertoire. Notable
   among these were isomiR variants which displayed arm-switching. We also
   demonstrate that modifications to the 3p end of miRNAs are vastly more
   prevalent than those at the 5p ends. We also observed that in only 45\%
   of Ae. aegypti miRNAs the most abundant read matches the exact sequence
   reported in miRBase. Further, we found positive correlations between the
   number of mature miRNA reads, pre-miRNA length, GC content and secondary
   structure minimum free energy with the number of isomiRs. The findings
   presented here provide some evidence that isomiR production is not a
   random phenomenon and may be important in DENV replication in its
   vector.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the influence of different oxidation methods on the chemical
   passivation quality of silicon oxide-nanolayers on crystalline silicon
   wafers with surface photo voltage and quasi-steady-state photo
   conductance measurements. We present a simple method by means of rapid
   thermal oxidation (RTO) and subsequent annealing in forming gas, which
   requires no complex surface pre-treatment or surface pre-conditioning
   after cleaning. This technique allows a reproducible preparation of
   high-quality ultrathin oxide-nanolayers (1.3-1.6 nm) with a nearly
   intrinsic energetic distribution of interface states and a defect
   density of states of only 1 x 10(12) cm(-2) eV(-1) at the minimum of the
   distribution. These results are compared with silicon oxide-nanolayers
   prepared by wet chemical oxidation and plasma oxidation where only a
   slight reduction of the interface defect density is achieved by
   subsequent anneal in forming gas environment. Furthermore, it is shown
   that applying the RTO oxide-nanolayer as an intermediate layer between
   Si and an a-SiNx:H layer, leads to a significant improvement of the
   surface passivation quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A small-scale experimental study was conducted using liquid nitrogen to
   investigate the convective heat transfer behavior of cryogenic liquids
   released on water. The experiment was performed by spilling five
   different amounts of liquid nitrogen at different release rates and
   initial water temperatures. The vaporization mass fluxes of liquid
   nitrogen were determined directly from the mass loss measured during the
   experiment. A variation of initial vaporization fluxes and a subsequent
   shift in heat transfer mechanism were observed with changes in initial
   water temperature. The initial vaporization fluxes were directly
   dependent on the liquid nitrogen spill rate. The heat flux from water to
   liquid nitrogen determined from experimental data was validated with two
   theoretical correlations for convective boiling. It was also observed
   from validation with correlations that liquid nitrogen was found to be
   predominantly in the film boiling regime. The substantial results
   provide a suitable procedure for predicting the heat flux from water to
   cryogenic liquids that is required for source term modeling. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Ovarian cancer remains the dominant cause of death due to malignancies
   of the female reproductive system. The capability to identify and remove
   all tumors during intraoperative procedures may ultimately reduce cancer
   recurrence, and lead to increased patient survival. The objective of
   this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an optical
   nano-structured system for targeted near infrared (NIR) imaging of
   ovarian cancer cells that over-express the human epidermal growth factor
   receptor 2 (HER2), an important biomarker associated with ovarian
   cancer. The nano-structured system is comprised of genome-depleted
   plant-infecting brome mosaic virus doped with NIR chromophore,
   indocyanine green, and functionalized at the surface by covalent
   attachment of monoclonal antibodies against the HER2 receptor. We use
   absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering
   to characterize the physical properties of the constructs. Using
   fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of these nano-structures for targeted NIR imaging of HER2
   receptors in vitro. These functionalized nano-materials may provide a
   platform for NIR imaging of ovarian cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The quantum diffraction and plasma screening effects on the occurrence
   time for the collision process are investigated in two-component
   non-ideal plasmas. The micropotential model taking into account the
   quantum diffraction and screening with the eikonal analysis is employed
   to derive the occurrence time as functions of the collision energy,
   density parameter, Debye length, de Broglie wavelength, and scattering
   angle. It is shown that the occurrence time for forward scattering
   directions decreases the tendency of time-advance with increasing
   scattering angle and de Broglie wavelength. However, it is found that
   the occurrence time shows the oscillatory time-advance and time-retarded
   behaviors with increasing scattering angle. It is found that the plasma
   screening effect enhances the tendency of time-advance on the occurrence
   time for forward scattering regions. It is also shown the quantum
   diffraction effect suppresses the occurrence time advance for forward
   scattering angles. In addition, it is shown that the occurrence time
   advance decreases with an increase of the collision energy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to establish a feasible treatment process for
   the solidification and stabilization (S/S) of soil contaminated by
   leaching of Cr(VI) from Chromite ore processing residue (COPR).
   Reduction of the highly mobile Cr(VI) was performed using calcium
   polysulfide (CaS5) with a dosage of 3 times the molar stoichiometric
   ratio for the initial concentration of Cr(VI) present in the chromium
   contaminated soil (CCS). The CCS was solidified and stabilized (S/S)
   using fly ash (FA) in various proportions i.e., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 (FA: CCS)
   with and without using reducing agent i.e., CaS5. Leachability tests
   such as Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and
   semi-dynamic long term leachability tests indicated that the CaS5 was
   effective in reduction of Cr(VI) followed by the S/S process.
   Leachability Index was derived from the results of the semi-dynamic long
   term leachability tests and was between 8 and 9, indicating that FA is
   an effective treatment for disposal into secured landfills for CCS. The
   characteristic compressive strength of the CaS5 treated CCS with FA
   mortar blocks were between 24.47 and 40.49 kg/cm(2). Considering the
   cost of CaS5 and FA, a total expenditure of Rs. 7826 i.e., US \$ 130.4
   would be required for remediation of one tonne of CCS. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As widely known in silicon-based solar cells, the intrinsic parameters
   are decisive factors for internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and solar
   cells performances. Particularly, the front surface recombination
   velocity is one of the most important electrical parameters used to
   quantify the optoelectronic quality of the solar cells. In this study,
   the impact of the front surface recombination velocities (Sir) and
   antireflection coating are examined. Theoretical analysis shows that a
   decrease in Sir enhances the IQE for photons with shorter wavelengths
   (400-700 nm). Cells with front porous silicon treatment (PS) was made
   and studied under ambient condition to improve performance of solar
   cells. In fact, internal quantum efficiency of mc-Si solar cells with PS
   was enhanced in shorter wavelengths, while the reflectivity was reduced
   to about 7\% after PS treatment and conversion efficiency was improved
   by about 5\% compared with conventional mc-Si solar cells. Furthermore,
   the laser-beam-induced current (LBIC) mapping shows that the PS
   treatment improves their quantum response. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Derris elliptica (Fabaceae) is one of the most important sources of the
   insecticide rotenone. This plant was first introduced from different
   Southeast Asian countries to China in the early decades of last century.
   The purpose of this study is to assess genetic diversity of D. elliptica
   in China for the conservation of its germplasm resources and for future
   breeding programs. Genetic diversity and population structure of 14
   cultivated populations of D. elliptica in China were detected using 25
   microsatellite markers. A moderate level of genetic diversity was found
   across the whole sample (expected heterozygosity, H-e = 0.529),
   indicating a history of multiple sources of introduction and a broad
   genetic base for the crop cultivated by cuttings. The genetic diversity
   at the population level (Mean H-e = 0.31) was relatively lower. Repeated
   bottlenecks or founder effects in its short cultivated history and also
   its vegetative reproduction mode may explain the results. F-ST (Wright
   F-statistic) values and AMOVA (analysis of the molecular variance)
   indicated large genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.461;
   44.1\%, AMOVA), while the cluster analysis showed that the collections
   belong to two major groups of genotypes. The initial difference in the
   introduced germplasm from the primary center of origin and the limited
   gene flows among populations may have played important roles in shaping
   the genetic variation pattern in D. elliptica of China. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{High quality strain-relaxed In0.3Ga0.7As layers with threading
   dislocation density about 2 x 10(6) cm(-2) and root-mean-square surface
   roughness below 8.0 nm were obtained on GaAs substrates using
   compositionally undulating step-graded Ga-1 (-) xInxP (x = 0.48-0.78)
   buffers. The transmission electron microscopy results reveal that the
   conventional step-graded GaInP buffers produce high density dislocation
   pile-ups, which are induced by the blocking effect of the nonuniform
   misfit dislocation strain field and crosshatched surface on the gliding
   of threading dislocations. In contrast, due to strain compensation,
   insertion of the tensile GaInP layers decreases the surface roughness
   and promotes dislocation annihilation in the interfaces, and eventually
   reduces the threading dislocation density. This provides a promising way
   to achieve a virtual substrate with the desired lattice parameter for
   metamorphic device applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) over twenty years ago,
   their potential applications have been extensively explored in
   nanocomposite fields owing to their excellent mechanical properties.
   Unfortunately, researches on CNTs reinforced polymers with liquid
   crystal properties are scare, especially on multi-scale interphase
   understanding of the newly combined system. In this work, a combination
   of functionalized nanometer-scale aramid structures and multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was prepared based on synergetic effects. After
   the re-proton reaction and filtration process, a nanocomposite membrane
   material was prepared. The mechanical properties of nanacomposite
   membrane were significantly enhanced and positively related to the
   weight fraction of carbon nanotubes below 2\%. A network structure was
   formed by the interweaving of MWNTs which carried on applied tensile
   stress together with aramid matrix, reaching the highest tensile
   strength of 327 MPa, with a 54.2\% increase compared with the matrix
   material. The interfacial stress transfer effect from substrate to
   surface of carbon nanotubes was improved through inducing
   crystallization of aramids around the network properly, and that was
   confirmed by the in-situ Raman test. The relation between Young's
   modulus of the nanocomposites and volume fraction of nanotubes can be
   accurately predicted by Halphin-Tsai equation under a certain range of
   CNT content. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition temperature of
   nanocomposites was enhanced compared to the base material, resulting in
   a better thermal stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A range of highly efficient nanoheterojunction structured Ag-AgBr/TiO2
   photocatalysts have been synthesized by CTAB-assisted method and
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), focused ion beam scanning
   electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and
   photoluminescence (PL). The results demonstrated that Ag-AgBr
   nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of anatase TiO2
   hierarchical spheres. The remarkable adsorptive removal of methyl orange
   (MO) by the uncalcined samples was investigated before evaluating its
   photocatalytic ability. All the calcined three-component catalysts
   possessed excellent photocatalytic activities for degrading MO under
   visible light, in which, 162.4\% Ag-AgBr/TiO2 exhibited highest
   efficiency. The greatly enhanced activity can be attributed to the well
   combination of surface plasmons photocatalyst Ag-AgBr and TiO2, which
   can simultaneously inhibit the photo-generated electrons and holes
   recombination. The nanoheterojunctions architecture catalyst also showed
   high stability even after five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, the
   possible mechanism and interpretation of the photocatalytic process were
   also proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relative contributions of potential source populations
   to fishery catches is vital for proper management of harvested fish
   stocks. Little is known about the temporal variation in commercially
   important brown trout (Salmo trutta) catch in large boreal lakes. We
   estimated contributions of 34 putative source populations to the brown
   trout catch in two lakes, Inarijarvi and adjacent Paadarjarvi (northern
   Finland) during 2006-2011. Genetic stock identification indicated that
   there is considerable temporal variation in the catch proportions in
   Inarijarvi and they are mainly associated with different contributions
   of the tributaries of the Ivalojoki and Juutuanjoki. In Paadarjarvi,
   catch proportions were relatively constant during the sampling period.
   Our study demonstrated the importance of temporal sampling when
   estimating catch proportions for management purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Among the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
   impulsiveness has been observed in patients with high levels of
   hyperarousal. Recent literature reveals the importance of investigating
   the role of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor
   (BDNF), in several psychiatric disorders. Specifically, contrasting
   findings have been reported on the levels of serum BDNF in subjects with
   PTSD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation
   between BDNF serum levels and impulsiveness in PTSD. To this end, we
   measured BDNF serum levels in 23 PTSD patients and a control group of 19
   trauma-exposed non-PTSD subjects. Results indicate a positive
   correlation in the PTSD group; that is, the higher the BDNF levels the
   higher the impulsiveness score, as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness
   Scale (BIS-11), suggesting that impulsiveness could be associated with
   greater BDNF production. Alternatively, it is also possible that high
   impulsiveness acts as a psychological mechanism that counteracts the
   negative effects exerted by the traumatic experience and the associated
   obsessive thoughts. The present paper discusses both hypotheses. (C)

Title = {{Characterization of the IGF2 Imprinted Gene Methylation Status in Bovine
   Oocytes during Folliculogenesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation reprogramming occurs during mammalian gametogenesis and
   embryogenesis. Sex-specific DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG
   islands controlling imprinted genes are acquired during this window of
   development. Characterization of the DNA methylation dynamics of
   imprinted genes acquired by oocytes during folliculogenesis is essential
   for understanding the physiological and genetic aspects of female
   gametogenesis and to determine the parameters for oocyte competence.
   This knowledge can be used to improve in vitro embryo production (IVP),
   specifically because oocyte competence is one of the most important
   aspects determining the success of IVP. Imprinted genes, such as IGF2,
   play important roles in embryo development, placentation and fetal
   growth. The aim of this study was to characterize the DNA methylation
   profile of the CpG island located in IGF2 exon 10 in oocytes during
   bovine folliculogenesis. The methylation percentages in oocytes from
   primordial follicles, final secondary follicles, small antral follicles,
   large antral follicles, MII oocytes and spermatozoa were 73.74 +/-
   2.88\%, 58.70 +/- 7.46\%, 56.00 +/- 5.58\%, 65.77 +/- 5.10\%, 56.35 +/-
   7.45\% and 96.04 +/- 0.78\%, respectively. Oocytes from primordial
   follicles showed fewer hypomethylated alleles (15.5\%) than MII oocytes
   (34.6\%) (p = 0.039); spermatozoa showed only hypermethylated alleles.
   Moreover, MII oocytes were less methylated than spermatozoa (p<0.001).
   Our results showed that the methylation pattern of this region behaves
   differently between mature oocytes and spermatozoa. However, while this
   region has a classical imprinted pattern in spermatozoa that is fully
   methylated, it was variable in mature oocytes, showing hypermethylated
   and hypomethylated alleles. Furthermore, our results suggest that this
   CpG island may have received precocious reprogramming, considering that
   the hypermethylated pattern was already found in growing oocytes from
   primordial follicles. These results may contribute to our understanding
   of the reprogramming of imprinted genes during bovine oogenesis.}},

Title = {{Reasons for encounter in young people consulting a family doctor in the

Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Knowledge of patient's reasons for encounter is useful to
   inform health service planning and health professional education. Our
   aim was to describe reasons for encounter as stated by an unselected
   group of young people attending primary care practices in the
   French-speaking part of Switzerland.
   Methods: Consecutive patients aged between 15 and 24 years were
   recruited as part of the PRISM-Ado trial (n = 594). They completed an
   anonymous questionnaire in the waiting room, including their main reason
   for encounter (free text). Reasons for encounter were coded using ICPC-2
   classification and analyzed according to sex, age and living in a rural
   or urban area.
   Results: 95 \% of questionnaires contained valid data about reasons for
   encounter (n = 567). General and unspecific (A) reasons were the most
   common in boys (44 \%) and girls (42 \%), followed by respiratory,
   musculoskeletal, dermatological and psychological reasons. Psychological
   reasons were more frequent in girls attending urban practices;
   musculoskeletal and dermatological reasons were more frequent in rural
   areas. Sexually transmitted infections or substance use were very rarely
   stated as a reason for encounter.
   Conclusions: This is the first study describing reasons for encounter as
   stated by young people themselves in primary care in Switzerland. These
   findings provide useful guidance for family doctors training and health
   service planning in Europe.}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{The distribution of relative velocities between particles provides
   invaluable information on the rates and characteristics of particle
   collisions. We show that the theoretical model of Gustavsson and Mehlig
   {[}K. Gustavsson and B. Mehlig, J. Turbul. 15, 34 (2014)], within its
   anticipated limits of validity, can predict the joint probability
   density function of relative velocities and separations of identical
   inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flows with remarkable
   accuracy. We also quantify the validity range of the model. The model
   matches two limits (or two types) of relative motion between particles:
   one where pair diffusion dominates (i.e., large coherence between
   particle motion) and one where caustics dominate (i.e., large velocity
   differences between particles at small separations). By using direct
   numerical simulation combined with Lagrangian particle tracking, we
   assess the model prediction in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We
   demonstrate that, when sufficient caustics are present at a given
   separation and the particle response time is significantly smaller than
   the integral time scales of the flow, the distribution exhibits the same
   universal power-law form dictated by the correlation dimension as
   predicted by the model of Gustavsson and Mehlig. In agreement with the
   model, no strong dependency on the Taylor-based Reynolds number is
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{Species substitution is a form of seafood fraud for the purpose of
   economic gain. DNA barcoding utilizes species-specific DNA sequence
   information for specimen identification. Previous work has established
   the usability of short DNA sequences-mini-barcodes-for identification of
   specimens harboring degraded DNA. This study aims at establishing a DNA
   mini-barcoding system for all fish species commonly used in processed
   fish products in North America. Six mini-barcode primer pairs targeting
   short (127-314 bp) fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) DNA
   barcode region were developed by examining over 8,000 DNA barcodes from
   species in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Seafood List. The
   mini-barcode primer pairs were then tested against 44 processed fish
   products representing a range of species and product types. Of the 44
   products, 41 (93.2\%) could be identified at the species or genus level.
   The greatest mini-barcoding success rate found with an individual primer
   pair was 88.6\% compared to 20.5\% success rate achieved by the
   full-length DNA barcode primers. Overall, this study presents a
   mini-barcoding system that can be used to identify a wide range of fish
   species in commercial products and may be utilized in high throughput
   DNA sequencing for authentication of heavily processed fish products.}},

   Virus demonstrates lipid-specific viroporin-like activity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Viroporins are virally encoded, membrane-active proteins, which enhance
   viral replication and assist in egress of viruses from host cells. The
   2B proteins in the picornaviridae family are known to have
   viroporin-like properties, and play critical roles during virus
   replication. The 2B protein of Hepatitis A Virus (2B), an unusual
   picornavirus, is somewhat dissimilar from its analogues in several
   respects. HAV 2B is approximately 2.5 times the length of other 2B
   proteins, and does not disrupt calcium homeostasis or glycoprotein
   trafficking. Additionally, its membrane penetrating properties are not
   yet clearly established. Here we show that the membrane interacting
   activity of HAV 2B is localized in its C-terminal region, which contains
   an alpha-helical hairpin motif. We show that this region is capable of
   forming small pores in membranes and demonstrates lipid specific
   activity, which partially rationalizes the intracellular localization of
   full-length 2B. Using a combination of biochemical assays and molecular
   dynamics simulation studies, we also show that HAV 2B demonstrates a
   marked propensity to dimerize in a crowded environment, and probably
   interacts with membranes in a multimeric form, a hallmark of other
   picornavirus viroporins. In sum, our study clearly establishes HAV 2B as

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{We present phonon properties of plutonium metal obtained from a
   combination of density-functional-theory (DFT) electronic structure and
   the recently developed compressive sensing lattice dynamics (CSLD). The
   CSLD model is here trained on DFT total energies of several hundreds of
   quasi-random atomic configurations for best possible accuracy of the
   phonon properties. The calculated phonon dispersions compare better with
   experiment than earlier results obtained from dynamical mean-field
   theory. The density-functional model of the electronic structure
   consists of disordered magnetic moments with all relativistic effects
   and explicit orbital-orbital correlations. The magnetic disorder is
   approximated in two ways: (i) a special quasi-random structure and (ii)
   the disordered-local-moment method within the coherent potential
   approximation. Magnetism in plutonium has been debated intensely, but
   the present magnetic approach for plutonium is validated by the close
   agreement between the predicted magnetic form factor and that of recent
   neutron-scattering experiments.}},

Title = {{Quantum recurrences in a one-dimensional gas of impenetrable bosons}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that a dilute one-dimensional (1D) gas of bosons with
   infinitely strong repulsive interactions behaves like a gas of free
   fermions. Just as with conduction electrons in metals, we consider a
   single-particle picture of the resulting dynamics, when the gas is
   isolated by enclosing it into a box with hard walls and preparing it in
   a special initial state. We show, by solving the nonstationary problem
   of a free particle in a 1D hard-wall box, that the single-particle state
   recurs in time, signaling the intuitively expected back-and-forth motion
   of a free particle moving in a confined space. Under suitable
   conditions, the state of the whole gas can then be made to recur if all
   the particles are put in the same initial momentum superposition. We
   introduce this problem here as a modern instance of the discussions
   giving rise to the famous recurrence paradox in statistical mechanics:
   on one hand, our results may be used to develop a poor man's
   interpretation of the recurrence of the initial state observed {[}T.
   Kinoshita et al., Nature 440, 900 (2006)] in trapped 1D Bose gases of
   cold atoms, for which our estimated recurrence time is in fair agreement
   with the period of the oscillations observed; but this experiment, on
   the other hand, has been substantially influential on the belief that an
   isolated quantum many-body system can equilibrate as a consequence of
   its own unitary nonequilibrium dynamics. Some ideas regarding the latter
   are discussed.}},

   present a theoretical study of dc transport in doped graphene in the

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{353}},

Abstract = {{Tungsten-titanium (W-Ti) mixed oxide thin films were fabricated using
   reactive sputtering of W-Ti alloy targets with Ti content ranging from 0
   to 30 wt\%. The effect of target composition on film structure,
   surface/interface chemistry and chemical valence state of the W and Ti
   cations was investigated in detail. All films were amorphous in nature
   as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses. For growth times of 1 h, the
   thicknesses of the W-Ti-O films decreased significantly from 150 to 35
   nm with increasing Ti content in the target, confirming that the oxide
   film growth behavior is dependent on the sputter-target composition. The
   chemistry and composition of the films probed using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the existence of W and Ti in their highest
   oxidation states of 6+ and 4+, respectively. Quantification of binding
   energy shifts for W and Ti core-level transitions confirms the formation
   of WO3-TiO2 composite oxide films. Depth profiles confirm and validate
   film uniformity, as well as film thickness differences and variable
   oxidation behavior of W and Ti in the films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The omega gene is encoded in broad-host range and low-copy plasmids. It
   is genetically linked to antibiotic resistance genes of the major human
   pathogens of phylum Firmicutes. The homodimeric forms of omega
   (omega(2)) coordinate the plasmid copy number control, faithful
   partition (omega(2) and delta(2)) and better-than-random segregation
   (zeta epsilon(2)zeta) systems. The promoter (P) of the omega epsilon
   zeta operon (P-omega) transiently interacts with omega(2). Adding
   delta(2) facilitates the formation of stable omega(2)center dot P-omega
   complexes. Here we show that limiting omega(2) interacts with the
   N-terminal domain of the beta' subunit of the Bacillus sub-tilis RNA
   polymerase (RNAP-sigma(A)) vegetative holoenzyme. In this way omega(2)
   recruits RNAP-sigma(A) onto P-omega DNA. Partial P-omega occupancy by
   omega(2) increases the rate at which RNAP-sigma(A) complex shifts from
   its closed (RPC) to open (RPO) form. This shift increases transcription
   activation. Adding delta(2) further increases the rate of P-omega
   transcription initiation, perhaps by stabilizing the omega(2)center dot
   P-omega complex. In contrast, full operator occupancy by omega(2)
   facilitates RPC formation, but it blocks RPO isomerization and represses
   P-omega utilization. The stimulation and inhibition of RPO formation is
   the mechanism whereby omega(2) mediates copy number fluctuation and
   stable plasmid segregation. By this mechanism, omega(2) also indirectly
   influences the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes.}},

Abstract = {{Water level regulation related to hydroelectric power production and
   flood prevention is an important hydro-morphological pressure on many
   watercourses around the world. Fouling of fishing nets in autumn during
   the open water period and in winter under the ice is a common phenomenon
   in large Finnish lakes where the water level is regulated. This fouling
   of fishing nets can sometimes be so extensive that fishing has to be
   stopped. Based on the practical experiences of fishermen, the main cause
   for the under-ice fouling has been proposed to be the winter draw-down
   of water causing low water level and stronger currents in lakes, but no
   conclusive relationship between fouling and water level regulation has
   yet been demonstrated. Here we show, using long-term winter data from a
   boreal lake and short-term netting experiments, that fouling of fishing
   nets results from increased water draw-down during winter (January
   March). Our results also show that fouling of fishing nets takes place
   only if the high water flow rates are accompanied by an intensive
   lowering of the water level. We also discuss the relevance of our
   results to other regulated lakes with ice cover.}},

Abstract = {{Few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted much attention due to its
   high mobility and suitable band gap for potential applic5ations in
   optoelectronics and flexible devices. However, its instability under
   ambient conditions limits its practical applications. Our investigations
   indicate that by passivation of the mechanically exfoliated BP flakes
   with a SiO2 layer, the fabricated BP field-effect transistors (FETs)
   exhibit greatly enhanced environmental stability. Compared to the
   unpassivated BP devices, which show a fast drop of on/off current ratio
   by a factor of 10 after one week of ambient exposure, the
   SiO2-passivated BP devices display a high retained on/off current ratio
   of over 600 after one week of exposure, just a little lower than the
   initial value of 810. Our investigations provide an effective route to
   passivate the few-layer BPs for enhancement of their environmental
   stability.}},

   Solvent consumption and sorbent productivity related to material
   properties and design parameters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1418}},

Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Size-exclusion simulated moving beds (SEC-SMB) have been used for
   large-scale separations of linear alkanes from branched alkanes. While
   SEC-SMBs are orders of magnitude more efficient than batch
   chromatography, they are not widely used. One key barrier is the
   complexity in design and optimization. A four-zone SEC-SMB for a binary
   separation has seven material properties and 14 design parameters (two
   yields, five operating parameters, and seven equipment parameters).
   Previous optimization studies using numerical methods do not guarantee
   global optima or explicitly express solvent consumption (D/F) or sorbent
   productivity (P-R) as functions of the material properties and design
   parameters.
   The standing wave concept is used to develop analytical expressions for
   D/F and P-R as functions of 14 dimensionless groups, which consist of 21
   material and design parameters. The resulting speedy standing wave
   design (SSWD) solutions are simplified for two limiting cases: diffusion
   or dispersion controlled. An example of SEC-SMB for insulin purification
   is used to illustrate how DIP and P-R change with the dimensionless
   groups. The results show that maximum P-R for both diffusion and
   dispersion controlled systems is mainly determined by yields, equipment
   parameters, material properties, and two key dimensionless groups: (1)
   the ratio of step time to diffusion time and (2) the ratio of diffusion
   time to pressure-limited convection time. A sharp trade off of D/F and
   P-R occurs when the yield is greater than 99\%. The column configuration
   for maximum P-R is analytically related to the diffusivity ratio and the
   selectivity. To achieve maximum sorbent productivity, one should match
   step time, diffusion time, and pressure-limited convection time for
   diffusion controlled systems. For dispersion controlled systems, the
   axial dispersion time should be about 10 times the step time and about
   50 times the pressure-limited convection time. Its value can be
   estimated from given yields, material properties, and column
   configuration. Among the material properties, selectivity and particle
   size have the largest impact on D/F and P-R. Particle size and 14 design
   parameters can be optimized for minimum D/F, maximum P-R, or minimum
   cost on a laptop computer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{353}},
Pages = {{200-208}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan scaffolds, combined with bioactive glass 46S6, were prepared to
   serve as gentamicin sulfate delivery in situ systems for bone
   biomaterials. This work presents a study about the effect of the ratio
   chitosan/bioactive glass (CH/BG) on the release of gentamicin sulfate
   and on the bioactivity during in vitro experiments.
   SEM observations allowed understanding the bond between the glass grains
   and the chitosan matrix. In vitro results showed that scaffolds form a
   hydroxyapatite (HA) Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2) after 15 days of immersion in a
   simulated body fluid (SBF).The interest of this study is to see that the
   increase of the content of bioactive glass in the chitosan matrix slows
   the release of gentamicin sulfate in the liquid medium. Starting
   concentration of gentamicin sulfate has an influence on the relaxation
   time of the scaffolds. Indeed, an increasing concentration delays the
   return to a new equilibrium. Contents of chitosan and bioactive glass do
   not affect the relaxation time. Synthesized scaffolds could be adapted
   to a clinical situation: severity and type of infection, weight and age
   of the patient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrous cyano-modified mesoporous SiO2 microspheres with specific
   surface area of ca. 300 m(2) g(-1) have been successfully fabricated
   respectively by in-situ synthesis and post-modification methods, based
   on the hydrolysis of ethyl silicate in the presence of
   (2-cyanoethyl)triethoxysilane at a certain condition. TEM observations
   show that the average diameters of the prepared fibrous cyano-modified
   SiO2 microspheres by these two methods are 68 and 211 nm, respectively.
   The Ny adsorption-desorption isotherms analysis on the fibrous 5'02
   microspheres show sharp peaks in the 10-20nm range. After the cyano
   groups transformed to amidoxime groups, the adsorption behavior of the
   fibrous amidoxime-functionalized mesoporous SiO2 microspheres for Fe3+,
   Cu2+, and Pb2+ was investigated. The results show that the prepared SiO2
   microspheres can selectively adsorb Pb2+. The maximum equilibrium
   adsorption capacity for Pb2+ could reach 284 mg/g. The desorption of
   Pb2+ in 2 M HNO3 completes within 60 min. The efficiency of the
   desorption is as high as 96.2\%. This work provides the methods to
   prepare amidoxime-functionalized SiO2 microsphere with high specific
   surface area and total pore volume, which has the potential to be
   applied as an efficient adsorbent for specific heavy metal ions. (C)

Abstract = {{In general, ultrathin disordered FePt film exhibits in-plane magnetic
   anisotropy due to large demagnetization fields and negligible volume

   is sandwiched by amorphous SiO2 layers and annealed at 350 degrees C.
   Based on the interfacial and structural analysis from X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy, the reorientation originates from the electronic structural
   changes because of strong bonding between Fe and O atoms at the top
   FePt/SiO2 interface. This interface anisotropy plays a crucial role in
   the magnetic behaviour, resulting in magnetization reorientation of
   ultrathin disordered FePt film. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Members of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily have roles in many
   biological events and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS)
   diseases. A relatively recently found member of this family, TNF-related
   weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) have importance both in development of
   pathological CNS processes and as a target for the treatment of these
   diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TWEAK's
   plasma levels are different in patients with schizophrenia. For this
   purpose plasma TWEAK levels of 44 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia
   and control group of 40 healthy individuals were compared. Although
   numerical difference was found between TWEAK levels of patients and
   controls it was not statistically significant. When we tested for female
   and male patients and controls seperately, TWEAK levels of male patients
   were significantly lower than male controls. As far as we know this is
   the first study that investigates levels of TWEAK in patients with
   schizophrenia. Although we did not find statistically significant
   results in our study, we believe that difference could be found in
   future studies with higher number of subjects. Researches with
   non-studied TNF superfamily members like TWEAK and TNF-related
   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) could contribute to the understanding
   of immune-cytokine related hypotheses of schizophrenia. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{As an efficient non-precious metal catalyst for oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER) in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water
   splitting, NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/reduced graphene oxide
   (NiFe/RGO) composite is synthesized by a simple solvothermal method in
   one-pot. NiFe LDHs are uniformly deposited on RGO layers of high
   electrical conductivity and large surface area. In electrochemical water
   splitting, NiFe/RGO shows superior OER performance compared to bare NiFe
   and reference IrO2 with a lower benchmark rho value (required
   overpotential to drive 10 mA cm(-2)) of 0.245 V. Furthermore, NiFe/RGO
   substantially increases the performance of a hematite photoanode in
   photoelectrochemical water oxidation, demonstrating its potential as an
   OER co-catalyst for photoelectrodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The type and severity of faults occurring in gas-insulated switchgear
   (GIS) can be assessed by detecting SF6 decomposed gases, which is
   significant for fault diagnosis and online condition monitoring of GIS.
   Characteristic decomposition components of SF6 under partial discharge
   or overheating faults and first-principle density functional theory
   calculations are adopted to analyze the adsorption of SO2, SOF2, and
   SO2F2 on Pt-modified anatase (1 0 1) surface and to examine further the
   sensing mechanism of Pt-modified anatase-based gas sensor used to detect
   SO2, SOF2, and SO2F2. Results show that SO2F2 molecule more easily
   decomposes upon adsorption on the active Pt nanoparticle than SOF2
   molecule. Meanwhile, SO2 molecule does not decompose. This finding
   explains the phenomenon in the sensing experiment of Pt-modified TiO2
   nanotube array gas sensor, wherein the response of SO2F2 is higher than
   that of SOF2 at the optimal temperature of the sensor. Moreover, the
   responses of SO2F2 and SOF2 significantly change at the optimal
   temperature, whereas the response of SO2 is nearly unchanged. C) 2015

   ring. We observe a new neutral structure near the (D{*}(D) over
   bar{*})(0) mass threshold in the pi(0) recoil mass spectrum, which we
   denote as Z(c)(4025)(0). Assuming a Breit-Wigner line shape, its pole
   mass and pole width are determined to be (4025.5(-4.7)(+2.0) +/- 3.1)
   MeV/c(2) and (23.0 +/- 6.0 +/- 1.0) MeV, respectively. The Born cross

Abstract = {{The ability to maintain and manipulate information across temporal
   delays is a fundamental requirement to bridge the gap between perception
   and action. In the case of higher order behavior, the maintenance of
   rules and strategies is particularly helpful in bridging this gap. The
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been considered critical for such
   processes, and research has focused on different subdivisions of PFC to
   gain an insight into their diverse contributions to these mechanisms.
   Substantial evidence indicates that dorsolateral PFC (dIPFC) is an
   important structure for maintaining information across delays, with
   cells actively firing across delays and lesions to this region causing
   deficits in tasks involving delayed responses and maintenance of rules
   online. Frontopolar cortex (FP), on the other hand, appears to show the
   opposite pattern of results, with cells not firing across delays and
   lesions to this region not affecting the same rule-based, delayed
   response tasks that are impaired following dIPFC lesions. The body of
   evidence therefore suggests that dIPFC and FP's contributions to working
   memory differ. In this article, we will provide a perspective on how
   these regions might implement distinct but complementary and interactive
   functions that contribute to more general temporallyextended processes
   and support flexible, dynamic behavior.}},

Title = {{Frequency-specific alternations in the amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations in chronic tinnitus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Tinnitus, a phantom ringing, buzzing, or hissing sensation with
   potentially debilitating consequences, is thought to arise from aberrant
   spontaneous neural activity at one or more sites within the central
   nervous system; however, the location and specific features of these
   oscillations are poorly understood with respect to specific tinnitus
   features. Recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies suggest that aberrant fluctuations in spontaneous low
   frequency oscillations (LFO) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   signal may be an important factor in chronic tinnitus; however, the role
   that frequency-specific components of LFO play in subjective tinnitus
   remains unclear. A total of 39 chronic tinnitus patients and 41
   well-matched healthy controls participated in the resting state fMRI
   scans. The LFO amplitudes were investigated using the amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in two
   different frequency bands (slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz and slow-5: 0010027
   Hz). We observed significant differences between tinnitus patients and
   normal controls in ALFF/fALFF in the two bands (slow-4 and slow-5) in
   several brain regions including the superior frontal gyrus (SFG),
   inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus,
   supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. Across the entire
   subject pool, significant differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two
   bands were found in the midbrain, basal ganglia, hippocampus and
   cerebellum (Slow 4 Slow 5), and in the middle frontal gyrus,
   supramarginal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (Slow 5 >
   Slow 4). We also observed significant interaction between frequency
   bands and patient groups in the orbitofrontal gyms. Furthermore,
   tinnitus distress was positively correlated with the magnitude of ALFF
   in right SFG and the magnitude of fALFF slow-4 band in left SFG, whereas
   tinnitus duration was positively correlated with the magnitude of ALFF
   in right SFG and the magnitude of fALFF slow-5 band in left SFG. Resting
   state fMRI provides an unbiased method for identifying aberrant
   spontaneous LFO occurring throughout the central nervous system. Chronic
   tinnitus patients have widespread abnormalities in ALFF and fALFF slow-4
   and slow-5 band which are correlated with tinnitus distress and
   duration. These results provide new insights on the neuropathophysiology
   of chronic tinnitus; therapies capable of reversing these aberrant
   patterns may reduce tinnitus distress.}},

Title = {{Pharmacologically-induced mitotic synchrony in airway epithelial cells
   as a mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mitotic synchrony is the synchronous progression of a
   population of cells through the cell cycle and is characteristic of
   non-diseased airway epithelial cells. However, we previously showed that
   asthmatic airway epithelial cells are characterized by mitotic
   asynchrony and are pro-inflammatory as a result. Glucocorticoids can
   induce mitotic synchrony that in turn suppresses the pro-inflammatory
   state of diseased cells, suggesting a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism
   of action. Herein, we benchmarked traditional glucocorticoids against
   the ability of a new clinical-stage dissociative steroidal drug, VBP15,
   for mitotic resynchronization and associated anti-inflammatory activity
   in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.
   Methods: Primary airway epithelial cells differentiated at air-liquid
   interface were exposed to VBP15, dexamethasone or vehicle following in
   vitro mechanical injury. Basolateral cytokine secretions (TGF-beta 1,
   IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-1 beta) were analyzed at different time
   points using cytometric bead assays and mitosis was examined by flow
   cytometry.
   Results: VBP15 improved mitotic synchrony of proliferating asthmatic
   cells in air-liquid interface cultures compared to vehicle-exposed
   cultures. VBP15 also significantly reduced the basolateral secretion of
   pro-inflammatory (i.e. IL-1 beta) and pro-fibrogenic cytokines (i.e.
   TGF-beta 1) in air-liquid interface-differentiated asthmatic epithelial
   cultures following mechanical injury.
   Conclusion: VBP15 improves mitotic asynchrony and injury-induced
   pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic responses in asthmatic airway epithelial
   cultures with efficacy comparable to traditional glucocorticoids. As it
   is predicted to show superior side effect profiles compared to
   traditional glucocorticoids, VBP15 holds potential for treatment of
   asthma and other respiratory conditions.}},

Title = {{Insights into the Immunological Properties of Intrinsically Disordered
   Malaria Proteins Using Proteome Scale Predictions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Malaria remains a significant global health burden. The development of
   an effective malaria vaccine remains as a major challenge with the
   potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. While
   Plasmodium spp. have been shown to contain a large number of
   intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or disordered protein regions,
   the relationship of protein structure to subcellular localisation and
   adaptive immune responses remains unclear. In this study, we employed
   several computational prediction algorithms to identify IDPs at the
   proteome level of six Plasmodium spp. and to investigate the potential
   impact of protein disorder on adaptive immunity against P. falciparum
   parasites. IDPs were shown to be particularly enriched within nuclear
   proteins, apical proteins, exported proteins and proteins localised to
   the parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, several leading vaccine
   candidates, and proteins with known roles in host-cell invasion, have
   extensive regions of disorder. Presentation of peptides by MHC molecules
   plays an important role in adaptive immune responses, and we show that
   IDP regions are predicted to contain relatively few MHC class I and II
   binding peptides owing to inherent differences in amino acid composition
   compared to structured domains. In contrast, linear B-cell epitopes were
   predicted to be enriched in IDPs. Tandem repeat regions and
   non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be strongly
   associated with regions of disorder. In summary, immune responses
   against IDPs appear to have characteristics distinct from those against
   structured protein domains, with increased antibody recognition of
   linear epitopes but some constraints for MHC presentation and issues of
   polymorphisms. These findings have major implications for vaccine
   design, and understanding immunity to malaria.}},

Title = {{B cell epitopes on infliximab identified by oligopeptide microarray with
   unprocessed patient sera}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and
   inflammatory bowel disease are treated with TNF-alpha- blocking
   antibodies such as infliximab and adalimumab. A common side effect of
   therapeutic antibodies is the induction of anti-drug antibodies, which
   may reduce therapeutic efficacy.
   Methods: In order to reveal immunogenic epitopes on infliximab which are
   responsible for the adverse effects, sera from patients treated with
   infliximab were screened by ELISA for anti-infliximab antibodies. Sera
   containing high levels of anti-drug-antibodies (>1.25 mu g/ml) were
   analyzed in an oligopeptide microarray system containing immobilized
   15-meric oligopeptides from the infliximab amino acid sequence.
   Immunogenic infliximab IgG-epitopes were identified by infrared
   fluorescence scanning and comparison of infliximab-treated patients
   versus untreated controls.
   Results: Six relevant epitopes on infliximab were recognized by the
   majority of all patient sera: 4 in the variable and 2 in the constant
   region. Three of the epitopes in the variable region are located in the
   TNF-alpha binding region of infliximab. The fourth epitope of the
   variable part of infliximab is located close to the TNF-alpha binding
   region and contains an N-glycosylation sequon. The sera positive for
   anti-infliximab antibodies do not contain antibodies against adalimumab
   as determined by ELISA. Thus, there is no infliximab-adalimumab
   cross-reactivity as determined by these systems.
   Conclusions: Our data shall contribute to a knowledge-based
   recommendation for a potentially necessary therapy switch from
   infliximab to another type of TNF-alpha-blocker. The characterization of
   immunogenic epitopes on therapeutic monoclonal antibodies using
   unprocessed patient sera shall lead to direct translational aspects for
   the development of less immunogenic therapeutic antibodies. Patients
   benefit from less adverse events and longer lasting drug effects.}},

Title = {{The effects of a novel aliphatic-chain hydroxamate derivative WMJ-S-001
   in HCT116 colorectal cancer cell death}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Hydroxamate derivatives have attracted considerable attention due to
   their broad pharmacological properties and have been extensively
   investigated. We recently demonstrated that WMJ-S-001, a novel aliphatic
   hydroxamate derivative, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic
   activities. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms by
   which WMJ-S-001 induces HCT116 colorectal cancer cell death. WMJ-S-001
   inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in HCT116 cells.
   These actions were associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
   and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, p53
   phosphorylation and acetylation, as well as the modulation of
   p21(cip/Waf1), cyclin D1, survivin and Bax. AMPK-p38MAPK signaling
   blockade reduced WMJ-S-001-induced p53 phosphorylation. Transfection
   with AMPK dominant negative mutant (DN) reduced WMJ-S- 001's effects on
   p53 and Sp1 binding to the survivn promoter region. Transfection with
   HDAC3-Flag or HDAC4-Flag also abrogated WMJ-S-001's enhancing effect on
   p53 acetylation. WMJ-S-001's actions on p21(cip/Waf1), cyclin D1,
   survivin, Bax were reduced in p53-null HCT116 cells. Furthermore,
   WMJ-S-001 was shown to suppress the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of
   HCT116 cells in vivo. In summary, the death of HCT116 colorectal cancer
   cells exposed to WMJ-S-001 may involve AMPK-p38MAPK-p53- survivin
   cascade. These results support the role of WMJ-S-001 as a potential drug
   candidate and warrant the clinical development in the treatment of
   cancer.}},

Title = {{Overexpression of IFITM3 predicts the high risk of lymphatic metastatic
   recurrence in pN0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after Ivor-Lewis
   esophagectomy}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background. Recent studies have shown that the aberrant expression of
   IFITM3 is implicated in the lymph node metastasis of many malignancies.
   Our research aimed to investigate the expression of IFITM3 in
   pathological N0 (pN0) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its
   relationship with lymph node metastatic recurrence.
   Methods. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the expression
   profile of IFITM3 in 104 pairs of samples. Each pair consisted of ESCC
   tissue and its adjacent normal mucosa (ANM). This aberrant expression
   was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
   with 20 tumor specimens with strong immunostaining and their mucosal
   tissues. In addition, 20 samples of low expression tissues and their
   ANMs were evaluated. Moreover, the correlations between the IFITM3
   expression level and the clinicopathological variables, recurrence risk
   and overall survival (OS) of patients were analyzed.
   Results. Both IHC and RT-PCR demonstrated that the IFITM3 expression
   level was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in ANM. Statistical
   analysis showed a significant correlation of IFITM3 expression with the
   T status of esophageal cancer (p = 0.015). In addition, IFITM3
   overexpression was demonstrated to be not only an important risk factor
   of lymphatic metastatic recurrence but a significant prognostic factor
   in pN0 ESCC (p < 0.005).
   Conclusions. Even pN0 ESCC patients will still experience lymphatic
   metastatic recurrence. The IFITM3 gene could be a predictor of lymphatic
   metastatic recurrence in pN0 ESCC after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a systematic approach to design smooth switching
   linear parameter-varying (LPV) controllers for hypersonic vehicles
   (HVs). Considering the switched LPV model of HVs, the smooth switching
   controllers are designed by means of dividing the scheduling parameter
   set into subsets with overlaps and the controllers in the overlapped
   subsets are smoothly scheduled between controllers in adjacent subsets.
   A switching law without constraint on average dwell time is obtained
   which makes the conclusion less conservative. To divide the parameter
   set automatically, a novel set partition method, in which the selecting
   of datum vertex and the handling of unpartitioned subset are innovative,
   is proposed. The switching LPV controllers that achieve a desired
   performance are constructed efficiently by solving a convex optimisation
   problem. Simulation results for HVs demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed smooth switching LPV controllers and parameter set division
   method.}},

Title = {{Thyroid dysfunction and dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease patients}},
Journal = {{BMC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming a serious health
   problem; the number of people with impaired renal function is rapidly
   rising. Progression of CKD is associated with having a number of
   complications, including thyroid dysfunction, dyslipidemia and
   cardiovascular diseases. This study was conducted to investigate thyroid
   function and lipid profile in CKD patients.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 360 chronic kidney
   disease patients at B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan,
   Nepal. Demographic features (age and sex) and medical history of
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases of each
   patient were noted, and blood samples (5 ml) were analyzed for serum
   urea, creatinine, glucose, free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine
   (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total cholesterol, high density
   lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
   and triglyceride.
   Results: Thyroid dysfunction was found in 38.6 \% CKD patients, the most
   common being subclinical hypothyroidism (27.2 \%), followed by overt
   hypothyroidism (8.1 \%) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (3.3 \%).
   Hypercholesterolemia, low HDL cholesterol, undesirable LDL cholesterol
   and hypertriglyceridemia were observed in 34.4, 34.1, 35 and 36.6 \%
   patients respectively. Stage 4 and 5 CKD patients had significantly
   higher risk of having thyroid dysfunction as compared to stage 3
   patients. Significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease in CKD
   patients included presence of diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia,
   undesirable LDL cholesterol and being in stage 4 and 5 (as compared to
   stage 3).
   Conclusions: Thyroid dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL
   cholesterol, undesirable LDL cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia are
   common in CKD patients. Progression of CKD is accompanied by rise in
   hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{A new hybrid-model fitting program for methylamine-like molecules has
   been developed, on the basis of an effective Hamiltonian in which the
   ammonia-like inversion motion is treated using a tunneling formalism,
   whereas the internal-rotation motion is treated using an explicit
   kinetic energy operator and potential energy function. The Hamiltonian
   in the computer program is set up as a 2 x 2 partitioned matrix, where
   each diagonal block contains a traditional torsion rotation Hamiltonian
   (as in the earlier program BELGI), and the two off-diagonal blocks
   contain tunneling terms. This hybrid formulation permits the use of the
   permutation-inversion group G(6) (isomorphic to C-3v) for terms in the
   two diagonal blocks but requires G(12) for terms in the off-diagonal
   blocks. The first application of the new program is to
   2-methylmalonaldehyde. Microwave data for this molecule were previously
   fit using an all-tunneling Hamiltonian formalism to treat both
   large-amplitude motions. For 2-methylmalonaldehyde, the hybrid program
   achieves the same quality of fit as was obtained with the all-tunneling
   program, but fits with the hybrid program eliminate a large discrepancy
   between internal rotation barriers in the OH and OD isotopologs of
   2-methylmalonaldehyde that arose in fits with the all-tunneling program.
   This large isotopic shift in internal rotation barrier is thus almost
   certainly an artifact of the all-tunneling model. Other molecules for
   application of the hybrid program are mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum is a key component in many heterogeneous hydrogenation
   catalysts. Because of its high price, fairly strong interaction with
   intermediates, and susceptibility to CO poisoning, it is often mixed
   with other elements. These bimetallic alloys have complex surface
   structures, and the atomic structure of their active sites is not well
   understood. In this study, we examine the effect of the geometric
   arrangement of dilute Pt-Cu alloys on H-2 activation, spillover, and
   release. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly visualize the
   atomic arrangement of Pt-Cu alloys and show that small amounts of Pt
   (similar to 1\%) exists as isolated atoms in the Cu surface. These Pt
   monomers are capable of facile H-2 dissociation and spillover to Cu at
   temperatures as low as 85 K. Additionally, the low-temperature
   desorption of H-2 (230 K) suggests a reduced desorption barrier compared
   to monometallic Pt or Cu. We find these single atom alloy surfaces are
   robust to multiple adsorption/desorption and heating cycles to 450 K.
   Larger Pt ensembles in Cu exhibit higher temperature desorption profiles
   due to the stronger binding of H to extended Pt ensembles, demonstrating
   how the geometric arrangement of Pt atoms in Cu impacts the binding of H
   to catalytic surface sites. Overall, dilute Pt-Cu alloys containing only
   isolated Pt atoms are most favorable for H-2 activation, spillover, and
   release and hence should be capable of catalyzing hydrogenation
   reactions with a greatly reduced concentration of the precious metal.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating gait disorder in
   Parkinson's disease (PD). In advanced PD patients with FoG, the
   supraspinal locomotor network may be dysregulated (relative to similar
   patients without FoG) during gait. Here, we sought to characterize the
   metabolism of locomotor networks involved in FoG. Methods: Twenty-two PD
   patients (11 with off-drug FoG and 11 without) each underwent two
   {[}F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET brain scans in the off-drug state: one
   at rest and another during radiotracer uptake while performing a
   standardized gait trajectory that incorporated the usual triggers for
   FoG. Results: For the 11 freezers, FoG was present for 39\% (+/- 23\%)
   of the time during the gait trajectory. The FoG-associated abnormalities
   were characterized by (i) hypometabolism in frontal regions (the
   associative premotor, temporopolar and orbitofrontal areas, i.e.
   Brodmann areas 6 and 8), (ii) hypermetabolism in the paracentral lobule
   (Brodmann area 5), and (iii) deregulation of the basal ganglia output
   (the globus pallidus and the mesencephalic locomotor region).
   Conclusion: FoG during a real gait task was associated with impaired
   frontoparietal cortical activation, as characterized by abnormally low
   metabolic activity of the premotor area (involved in the indirect

Abstract = {{How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses
   distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function(1), its interactions with
   sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to
   control sensory selection(2-5). To test this idea and, more generally,
   dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a
   cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access
   to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in
   a temporally precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately
   between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished.
   Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour
   was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus,
   not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the
   visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent
   changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN
   activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional
   optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of
   electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated
   that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through
   feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical
   model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular
   subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate
   inputs for further processing.}},

Title = {{Estimating the ground-state probability of a quantum simulation with
   product-state measurements}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{One of the goals in quantum simulation is to adiabatically generate the
   ground state of a complicated Hamiltonian by starting with the ground
   state of a simple Hamiltonian and slowly evolving the system to the
   complicated one. If the evolution is adiabatic and the initial and final
   ground states are connected due to having the same symmetry, then the
   simulation will be successful. But in most experiments, adiabatic
   simulation is not possible because it would take too long, and the
   system has some level of diabatic excitation. In this work, we quantify
   the extent of the diabatic excitation even if we do not know a priori
   what the complicated ground state is. Since many quantum simulator
   platforms, like trapped ions, can measure the probabilities to be in a
   product state, we describe techniques that can employ these simple
   measurements to estimate the probability of being in the ground state of
   the system after the diabatic evolution. These techniques do not require
   one to know any properties about the Hamiltonian itself, nor to
   calculate its eigenstate properties. All the information is derived by
   analyzing the product-state measurements as functions of time.}},

Title = {{MPLA incorporation into DC-targeting glycoliposomes favours anti-tumour
   T cell responses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{216}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DC) are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy as
   they initiate strong and long-lived tumour-specific T cell responses. DC
   can be effectively targeted in vivo with tumour antigens by using
   nanocarriers such as liposomes. Cross-presentation of tumour antigens is
   enhanced with strong adjuvants such as TLR ligands. However, often these
   adjuvants have off-target effects, and would benefit from a DC-specific
   targeting strategy, similar to the tumour antigen. The goal of this
   study was to develop a strategy for specifically targeting DC with
   tumour antigen and adjuvant by using glycoliposomes. We have generated
   liposomes containing the glycan Lewis(Le)(X) which is highly specific
   for the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN expressed by DC. Le(X)-modified
   liposomes were taken up by human monocyte-derived DC in a
   DC-SIGN-specific manner. As adjuvants we incorporated the TLR ligands
   Pam(3)CySK(4), Poly I:C, MPLA and R848 into liposomes and compared their
   adjuvant capacity on DC. Incorporation of the TLR4 ligand MPLA into
   glycoliposomes induced DC maturation and production of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines, in a DC-SIGN-specific manner, and DC activation was
   comparable to administration of soluble MPLA. Incorporation of MPLA into
   glycoliposomes significantly enhanced antigen cross-presentation of the
   melanoma tumour antigen gp100(280-288) peptide to CD8(+) T cells
   compared to nonglycosylated MPLA liposomes. Importantly, antigen
   cross-presentation of the gp100(280-288) peptide was significantly
   higher using MPLA glycoliposomes compared to the co-administration of
   soluble MPLA with glycoliposomes. Taken together, our data demonstrates
   that specific targeting of a gp100 tumour antigen and the adjuvant MPLA
   to DC-SIGN-expressing DC enhances the uptake of peptide-containing
   liposomes, the activation of DC, and induces tumour antigen-specific
   CD8(+) T cell responses. These data demonstrate that adjuvant-containing
   glycoliposome-based vaccines targeting DC-SIGN(+) DC represent a
   powerful new approach for CD8(+) T cell activation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is a theoretical risk of adverse events following immunization
   with a preservative-free, 2-dose vial formulation of
   10-valent-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10). We set out to measure
   this risk. Four population-based surveillance sites in Kenya (total
   annual birth cohort of 11,500 infants) were used to conduct a 2-year
   post-introduction vaccine safety study of PCV10. Injection-site
   abscesses occurring within 7 days following vaccine administration were
   clinically diagnosed in all study sites (passive facility-based
   surveillance) and, also, detected by caregiver-reported symptoms of
   swelling plus discharge in two sites (active household-based
   surveillance). Abscess risk was expressed as the number of abscesses per
   100,000 injections and was compared for the second vs first vial dose of
   PCV10 and for PCV10 vs pentavalent vaccine (comparator). A total of
   58,288 PCV10 injections were recorded, including 24,054 and 19,702
   identified as first and second vial doses, respectively (14,532 unknown
   vial dose). The risk ratio for abscess following injection with the
   second (41 per 100,000) vs first (33 per 100,000) vial dose of PCV10 was
   1.22 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.37-4.06). The comparator vaccine
   was changed from a 2-dose to 10-dose presentation midway through the
   study. The matched odds ratios for abscess following PCV10 were 1.00
   (95\% CI 0.12-8.56) and 0.27 (95\% CI 0.14-0.54) when compared to the
   2-dose and 10-dose pentavalent vaccine presentations, respectively. In
   Kenya immunization with PCV10 was not associated with an increased risk
   of injection site abscess, providing confidence that the vaccine may be
   safely used in Africa. The relatively higher risk of abscess following
   the 10-dose presentation of pentavalent vaccine merits further study.}},

Title = {{Dietary carbohydrate and lipid source affect cholesterol metabolism of

Abstract = {{Plant feedstuffs (PF) are rich in carbohydrates, which may interact with
   lipid metabolism. Thus, when considering dietary replacement of fishery
   by-products with PF, knowledge is needed on how dietary lipid source
   (LS) and carbohydrates affect lipid metabolism and other metabolic
   pathways. For that purpose, a 73-d growth trial was performed with
   European sea bass juveniles (IBW 74 g) fed four diets differing in LS
   (fish oil (FO) or a blend of vegetable oils (VO)) and carbohydrate
   content (0 \% (CH-) or 20 \% (CH+) gelatinised starch). At the end of
   the trial no differences among diets were observed on growth and feed
   utilisation. Protein efficiency ratio was, however, higher in the CH+
   groups. Muscle and liver fatty acid profiles reflected the dietary LS.
   Dietary carbohydrate promoted higher plasma cholesterol and
   phospholipids (PL), whole-body and hepatic (mainly 16 : 0) lipids and
   increased muscular and hepatic glycogen. Except for PL, which were
   higher in the FO groups, no major alterations between FO and VO groups
   were observed on plasma metabolites (glucose, TAG, cholesterol, PL),
   liver and muscle glycogen, and lipid and cholesterol contents.
   Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme
   lipogenesis-related enzymes - increased with carbohydrate intake.
   Hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism was
   up-regulated with carbohydrate (HMGCR and CYP3A27) and VO (HMGCR and
   CYP51A1) intake. No dietary regulation of long-chain PUFA biosynthesis
   at the transcriptional level was observed. Overall, very few
   interactions between dietary carbohydrates and LS were observed.
   However, important insights on the direct relation between dietary
   carbohydrate and the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in European sea
   bass were demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We report the magnetic properties, of nano-crystalline powders

   diffraction, and elucidate the effect of Tb site substitution on the
   magnetic structure of TbMnO3. All samples crystallized in the
   orthorhombic structure conforming to space group Pnma, and exhibited an
   incommensurate collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of the Mn ions below
   similar to 40 K. Furthermore, at T <= 20 K, all these samples showed a
   change in magnetic structure (of Mn moments) to a spiral ordering down
   to 2K, the lowest measured temperature. For the samples with x = 0, 0.1,
   and 0.2, a short-ranged two dimensional (2D) ordering of Tb moments was
   also observed at 2K. However, for the other samples (x-0.3 and 0.4), no
   magnetic ordering of Tb moments was found down to 2K. So with Y
   substitution, a crossover from 2D ordering to a disordering of Tb
   moments was observed. The moments at the Mn site were found to be lower
   than the full Mn3+(4 mu B) moment for all the samples below 40 K. The

   more pronounced than those of the reported single crystals of same

Title = {{Modelling DNA origami self-assembly at the domain level}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{We present a modelling framework, and basic model parameterization, for
   the study of DNA origami folding at the level of DNA domains. Our
   approach is explicitly kinetic and does not assume a specific folding
   pathway. The binding of each staple is associated with a free-energy
   change that depends on staple sequence, the possibility of coaxial
   stacking with neighbouring domains, and the entropic cost of
   constraining the scaffold by inserting staple crossovers. A rigorous
   thermodynamic model is difficult to implement as a result of the
   complex, multiply connected geometry of the scaffold: we present a
   solution to this problem for planar origami. Coaxial stacking of helices
   and entropic terms, particularly when loop closure exponents are taken
   to be larger than those for ideal chains, introduce interactions between
   staples. These cooperative interactions lead to the prediction of sharp
   assembly transitions with notable hysteresis that are consistent with
   experimental observations. We show that the model reproduces the
   experimentally observed consequences of reducing staple concentration,
   accelerated cooling, and absent staples. We also present a simpler
   methodology that gives consistent results and can be used to study a
   wider range of systems including non-planar origami. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Exploiting the aerobic endospore-forming bacterial diversity in saline
   and hypersaline environments for biosurfactant production}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biosurfactants are surface-active biomolecules with great
   applicability in the food, pharmaceutical and oil industries.
   Endospore-forming bacteria, which survive for long periods in harsh
   environments, are described as biosurfactant producers. Although the
   ubiquity of endospore-forming bacteria in saline and hypersaline
   environments is well known, studies on the diversity of the
   endospore-forming and biosurfactant-producing bacterial genera/species
   in these habitats are underrepresented.
   Methods: In this study, the structure of endospore-forming bacterial
   communities in sediment/mud samples from Vermelha Lagoon, Massambaba,
   Dois Rios and Abraao Beaches (saline environments), as well as the Praia
   Seca salterns (hypersaline environments) was determined via denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis. Bacterial strains were isolated from these
   environmental samples and further identified using 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing. Strains presenting emulsification values higher than 30 \%
   were grouped via BOX-PCR, and the culture supernatants of representative
   strains were subjected to high temperatures and to the presence of up to
   20 \% NaCl to test their emulsifying activities in these extreme
   conditions. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to demonstrate the
   presence of surfactin.
   Results: A diverse endospore-forming bacterial community was observed in
   all environments. The 110 bacterial strains isolated from these
   environmental samples were molecularly identified as belonging to the
   genera Bacillus, Thalassobacillus, Halobacillus, Paenibacillus,
   Fictibacillus and Paenisporosarcina. Fifty-two strains showed
   emulsification values of at least 30\%, and they were grouped into18 BOX
   groups. The stability of the emulsification values varied when the
   culture supernatants of representative strains were subjected to high
   temperatures and to the presence of up to 20\% NaCl. The presence of
   surfactin was demonstrated in one of the most promising strains.
   Conclusion: The environments studied can harbor endospore-forming
   bacteria capable of producing biosurfactants with biotechnological
   applications. Various endospore-forming bacterial genera/species are
   presented for the first time as biosurfactant producers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Linear growth and final height are reported as normal in
   congenital hypothyroid patients in the neonatal screening era.
   Methods: We evaluated the final height in 215 patients with congenital
   hypothyroidism to assess if it improved over the last 2 decades.
   Results: Final height (-0.1 +/- 1.0 SDS) was higher than target height
   (-0.8 +/- 1.0 SDS, p < 0.001) and not different among the 4 quartiles
   for birthdate. It was correlated with target height (r(2) = 0.564, p <
   0.001) and height at puberty onset (r(2) = 0.685, p < 0.001), but not
   with age at diagnosis or the starting LT4/kg/day dose. The curve fitting
   analysis showed that the age at diagnosis progressively decreased during
   the 20-year study period, while the target height and the starting
   LT4/kg/day increased. Final height was not affected by the birthdate,
   the age at diagnosis, the starting LT4 dose.
   Conclusions: The final height is higher than the target height, but
   despite the improvement in the screening and the treatment, it did not
   improve over the last 20 years. These findings are in keeping with the
   described secular trend and suggest that earlier diagnosis and
   replacement therapy do not significantly modify final height in these
   patients.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{We perform all-electron path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and density
   functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) calculations to explore
   warm dense matter states of oxygen. Our simulations cover a wide
   density-temperature range of 1-100 g cm(-3) and 10(4)-10(9) K. By
   combining results from PIMC and DFT-MD, we are able to compute pressures
   and internal energies from first-principles at all temperatures and
   provide a coherent equation of state. We compare our first-principles
   calculations with analytic equations of state, which tend to agree for
   temperatures above 8 x 10(6) K. Pair-correlation functions and the
   electronic density of states reveal an evolving plasma structure and
   ionization process that is driven by temperature and density. As we
   increase the density at constant temperature, we find that the
   ionization fraction of the 1s state decreases while the other electronic
   states move towards the continuum. Finally, the computed shock Hugoniot
   curves show an increase in compression as the first and second shells
   are ionized. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin B-12, folate and homocysteine have long been implicated in
   mental illness, and growing evidence suggests that they may play a role
   in positive mental health. Elucidation of these relationships is
   confounded due to the dependence of homocysteine on available levels of
   vitamin B-12 and folate. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships
   between vitamin B-12, folate, homocysteine and subjective well-being
   were assessed in a sample of 391 older, community-living adults without
   clinically diagnosed depression. Levels of vitamin B-12, but not folate,
   influenced homocysteine levels 18 months later. Vitamin B-12, folate and
   their interaction significantly predicted levels of positive affect (PA)
   18 months later, but had no impact on the levels of negative affect or
   life satisfaction. Cross-sectional relationships between homocysteine
   and PA were completely attenuated in the longitudinal analyses,
   suggesting that the cross-sectional relationship is driven by the
   dependence of homocysteine on vitamin B-12 and folate. This is the first
   study to offer some evidence of a causal link between levels of folate
   and vitamin B-12 on PA in a large, non-clinical population.}},

Abstract = {{Large amplitude traveling waves of the Korteweg-de-Vries (KdV) equation
   can be excited and controlled by a chirped frequency driving
   perturbation. The process involves capturing the wave into autoresonance
   (a continuous nonlinear synchronization) with the drive by passage
   through the linear resonance in the problem. The transition to
   autoresonance has a sharp threshold on the driving amplitude. In all
   previously studied autoresonant problems the threshold was found via a
   weakly nonlinear theory and scaled as alpha(3/4), alpha being the
   driving frequency chirp rate. It is shown that this scaling is violated
   in a long wavelength KdV limit because of the increased role of the
   nonlinearity in the problem. A fully nonlinear theory describing the
   phenomenon and applicable to all wavelengths is developed.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of supplementing
   broiler feed with hesperidin or naringin, on growth performance, carcass
   characteristics, breast meat quality and the oxidative stability of
   breast and thighmeat. Two hundred and forty 1-day-old Ross 308 broiler
   chickens were randomly assigned to 6 groups. One of the groups served as
   a control (C) and was given commercial basal diets, whereas the other
   five groups were given the same diets further supplemented with naringin
   at 0.75 g/kg (N1), naringin at 1.5 g/kg (N2), hesperidin at 0.75 g/kg
   (E1), hesperidin at 1.5 g/kg (E2) and a-tocopheryl acetate at 0.2 g/kg
   (E). At 42 days of age, 10 chickens per treatment group were slaughtered
   for meat quality and oxidative stability assessment. No significant
   differences were observed among groups in final body weight, carcass
   weight and internal organs weights (P> 0.05) apart from liver that
   decreased linearly with increased levels of naringin (P-linear< 0.05).
   Regarding the breast meat quality parameters, only redness (a{*}) value
   was higher in E1 and N1 group compared to VE group (P<0.05), while all
   the others i.e. shear values (N/mm(2)), pH(24), cooking loss (\%) and
   L{*} and b{*} color parameters were not significantly different among
   groups (P> 0.05). Measurement of lipid oxidation values showed that
   after hesperidin and naringin dietary supplementation, malondialdehyde
   values decreased in tissue samples in a dose depended manner
   (P-linear<0.05). In conclusion, hesperidin and naringin, positively
   influence meat antioxidative properties without negative implications on
   growth performance and meat quality characteristics in poultry, thus
   appearing as important additives for both the consumer and the industry.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To investigate whether children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
   Disorder have lower levels of Vitamin D-3 at birth than matched
   controls.
   Material
   Umbilical cord blood samples collected at birth from 202 children later
   diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder were analysed
   for vitamin D content and compared with 202 matched controls. 25-OH
   vitamin D-3 was analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry.
   Results
   No differences in cord blood vitamin D concentration were found between
   children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (median 13.0
   ng/ml) and controls (median 13.5 ng/ml) (p = 0.43). In a logistic
   regression analysis, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder showed a
   significant association with maternal age (odds ratio: 0.96, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.92-0.99) but not with vitamin D levels (odds
   ratio: 0.99, 95\% confidence interval: 0.97-1.02).
   Conclusion
   We found no difference in intrauterine vitamin D levels between children
   later developing Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and matched
   control children. However, the statistical power of the study was too
   weak to detect an eventual small to medium size association between
   vitamin D levels and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.}},

Title = {{A molecular dynamics simulations study on the relations between

   viscous liquids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{We perform molecular dynamics simulations for viscous liquids to study
   the relations between dynamical heterogeneity, structural (alpha)
   relaxation, and self-diffusion. For atomistic models of supercooled
   water, polymer melts, and an ionic liquid, we characterize the
   space-time characteristics of dynamical heterogeneity by the degree of
   deviations from Gaussian displacement statistics (alpha(2)), the size of
   clusters comprising highly mobile particles (S-omega), and the length of
   strings consisting of cooperatively moving particles (L-omega).
   Comparison of our findings with previous simulation results for a large
   variety of viscous liquids, ranging from monoatomic liquids to silica
   melt, reveals a nearly universal decoupling between the time scales of
   maximum non-Gaussian parameter (tau(alpha 2)) and the time constant of
   the a relaxation (tau(alpha)) upon cooling, explicitly, tau alpha(2)
   proportional to tau(3/4)(alpha). Such uniform relation was not observed
   between the peak times of S-omega or L-omega and tau(alpha). On the
   other hand, the temperature-dependent time scale of maximum string
   length (tau(L)) follows the inverse of the self-diffusion coefficient
   (D) for various systems at sufficiently low temperatures, i.e., tau(L)
   proportional to D-1. These observations are discussed in view of a
   breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation for the studied systems. It is
   found that the degree of deviation from this relation is correlated with
   the stretching of the a relaxation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The necking extent of the superplasticity of IN718 alloy is difficult to
   quantificationally evaluate because of its point fracture (with extreme
   small final fracture area) after failure. In this investigation, we have
   defined a necking angle to donate the necking extent after failure and
   systematically investigated the superplastic behavior of the alloy at
   temperatures between 935 degrees C and 1010 degrees C in strain rate
   range 5 x 10(-4)-10(-2) s(-1). In the temperature range 935-980 degrees
   C, the elongation was found to decrease with the increasing strain rate
   while the necking angle (extent) increased because softening source
   provided by the dynamic recrystallization increased with the increasing
   strain rate at necking zone. In contrast, at 1010 degrees C, due to a
   good balance between the grain refinement by recrystallization and the
   dynamic grain growth, a peak elongation of 225\% was obtained at 10(-3)
   s(-1). Our study has emphasized the vital role of the dynamic
   recrystallization during the superplasticity of IN718 alloy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Using a random-matrix approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we generate
   scattering matrices and cross sections for compound-nucleus reactions.
   In the absence of direct reactions we compare the average cross sections
   with the analytic solution given by the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble
   (GOE) triple integral, and with predictions of statistical approaches
   such as the ones from Moldauer; Hofmann, Richert, Tepel, and
   Weidenmuller; and Kawai, Kerman, and McVoy. We find perfect agreement
   with the GOE triple integral and display the limits of validity of the
   latter approaches. We establish a criterion for the width of the
   energy-averaging interval such that the relative difference between the
   ensemble-averaged and the energy-averaged scattering matrices lies below
   a given bound. Direct reactions are simulated in terms of an
   energy-independent background matrix. In that case, cross sections
   averaged over the ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations fully agree with
   results from the Engelbrecht-Weidenmuller transformation. The limits of

Abstract = {{Current logic devices rely on 3D architectures, such as the tri-gate
   field effect transistor (finFET), which utilize the (001) and (110)
   crystal faces simultaneously thus requiring passivation methods for the
   (110) face in order to ensure a pristine 3D surface prior to further
   processing. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), and correlated electrical measurement on MOSCAPs
   were utilized to compare the effects of a previously developed in situ
   pre-atomic layer deposition (ALD) surface clean on the InGaAs (001) and
   (110) surfaces. Ex situ wet cleans are very effective on the (001)
   surface but not the (110) surface. Capacitance voltage indicated the
   (001) surface with no buffered oxide etch had a higher C-max
   hypothesized to be a result of poor nucleation of HfO2 on the native
   oxide. An in situ pre-ALD surface clean employing both atomic H and
   trimethylaluminum (TMA) pre-pulsing, developed by Chobpattana et al. and
   Carter et al. for the (001) surface, was demonstrated to be effective on
   the (110) surface for producing low D-it high C-ox MOSCAPs. Including
   TMA in the pre-ALD surface clean resulted in reduction of the magnitude
   of the interface state capacitance. The XPS studies show the role of
   atomic H pre-pulsing is to remove both carbon and oxygen while STM shows
   the role of TMA pre-pulsing is to eliminate H induced etching. Devices
   fabricated at 120 degrees C and 300 degrees C were compared. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Diel-cycling hypoxia co-occurs with diel-cycling pH in shallow waters
   that are typically considered as refuge from deep-water hypoxia and are,
   therefore, targeted for restoration. These areas also tend to be heavily
   impaired by eutrophication from nutrient over-enrichment which increases
   the occurrence and severity of hypoxia and pH cycles. We used laboratory
   experiments to investigate the effects of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen
   (DO) and co-varying diel-cycling pH on infections of Perkinsus spp. and
   hemocyte activity in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Perkinsus
   marinus is the protistan parasite that causes Dermo disease in oysters.
   Severe diel-cycling DO increased the acquisition and progression of
   Perkinsus infections during exposure, and had a legacy effect the next
   year. Diel-cycling pH did not significantly affect infection dynamics
   either on its own or in combination with diel-cycling DO. Diel-cycling
   DO and pH both individually and in conjunction stimulated hemocyte
   activity, although this stimulated activity may not be effective at
   preventing Perkinsus infection. The magnitude of cycling conditions is
   an important consideration when choosing restoration sites, as severe
   cycling may hinder the re-establishment of oysters by creating areas
   that serve as reservoirs for parasites that can infect nearby
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Triazole-conjugated spiropyran was synthesized by Cu(I)-catalyzed azide
   alkyne cycloaddition and its metal sensing properties were investigated.
   Color changes were observed upon the formation of metal complex between
   the spiropyran and Cu2+, which was found to be selective for Cu2+ ions
   among Co2+, Hg2+, Li+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ ions. Moreover,
   because of the color change, the complex could be detected by the naked
   eye. An interesting two-stage metal binding mechanism was observed for
   the sensing process. First, a metal cation brought the two
   1,2,3-triazoles together. Second, the Cu2+ ion was selectively sensed by
   the conversion of the spiropyran to the merocyanine form. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Individuals with blood group O have a higher bleeding risk than non-O
   blood groups. This could be explained by the lower levels of FVIII and
   von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels in O individuals. We investigated the
   relationship between blood groups, thrombin generation (TG), prothrombin
   activation and thrombin inactivation. Plasma levels of VWF, FVIII,
   antithrombin, fibrinogen, prothrombin and alpha(2)Macroglobulin (alpha
   M-2) levels were determined. TG was measured in platelet rich (PRP) and
   platelet poor plasma (PPP) of 217 healthy donors and prothrombin
   conversion and thrombin inactivation were calculated. VWF and FVIII
   levels were lower (75\% and 78\%) and alpha M-2 levels were higher
   (125\%) in the O group. TG is 10\% lower in the O group in PPP and PRP.
   Less prothrombin was converted in the O group (86\%) and the thrombin
   decay capacity was lower as well. In the O group, alpha M-2 plays a
   significantly larger role in the inhibition of thrombin (126\%). In
   conclusion, TG is lower in the O group due to lower prothrombin
   conversion, and a larger contribution of alpha M-2 to thrombin
   inactivation. The former is unrelated to platelet function because it is
   similar in PRP and PPP, but can be explained by the lower levels of
   FVIII.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological cancers in the
   world but in India, it is the top most cancer among women. Persistent
   infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) is the most
   important risk factor. The sequence variation(s) in the most common
   HR-HPV i.e. HPV type 16 leads to altered biological functions with
   possible clinical significance in the different geographical locations.
   Sixteen major variants (V1-V16) in full length L1 gene of HPV-16 were
   identified following analysis of 250 prospectively collected cervical
   cancer tissue biopsies and their effect on immunogenicity was studied.
   The effect of these major variations on the epitopes were predicted by
   in silico methods and the immunogenicity of variants and respective
   reference DNA vaccine constructs were evaluated by administration of
   prepared DNA vaccine constructs in female BALB/c mice to evaluate
   antibody titer. In the present study, L500F (V16) variation showed a
   significant similar to 2.7 fold (p < 0.002) increase in antibody titer,
   whereas T379P (V8) showed similar to 0.4 fold (p < 0.328) decrease after
   final injection. These results showed a promising roadmap for the
   development of DNA based vaccine and for the generation of effective
   response, though there is a need to study more prevalent variants of HPV
   in the Indian population.}},

Title = {{Comparing the normalization methods for the differential analysis of
   Illumina high-throughput RNA-Seq data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently, rapid improvements in technology and decrease in
   sequencing costs have made RNA-Seq a widely used technique to quantify
   gene expression levels. Various normalization approaches have been
   proposed, owing to the importance of normalization in the analysis of
   RNA-Seq data. A comparison of recently proposed normalization methods is
   required to generate suitable guidelines for the selection of the most
   appropriate approach for future experiments.
   Results: In this paper, we compared eight non-abundance (RC, UQ, Med,
   TMM, DESeq, Q, RPKM, and ERPKM) and two abundance estimation
   normalization methods (RSEM and Sailfish). The experiments were based on
   real Illumina high-throughput RNA-Seq of 35-and 76-nucleotide sequences
   produced in the MAQC project and simulation reads. Reads were mapped
   with human genome obtained from UCSC Genome Browser Database. For
   precise evaluation, we investigated Spearman correlation between the
   normalization results from RNA-Seq and MAQC qRT-PCR values for 996
   genes. Based on this work, we showed that out of the eight non-abundance
   estimation normalization methods, RC, UQ, Med, TMM, DESeq, and Q gave
   similar normalization results for all data sets. For RNA-Seq of a
   35-nucleotide sequence, RPKM showed the highest correlation results, but
   for RNA-Seq of a 76-nucleotide sequence, least correlation was observed
   than the other methods. ERPKM did not improve results than RPKM. Between
   two abundance estimation normalization methods, for RNA-Seq of a
   35-nucleotide sequence, higher correlation was obtained with Sailfish
   than that with RSEM, which was better than without using abundance
   estimation methods. However, for RNA-Seq of a 76-nucleotide sequence,
   the results achieved by RSEM were similar to without applying abundance
   estimation methods, and were much better than with Sailfish.
   Furthermore, we found that adding a poly-A tail increased alignment
   numbers, but did not improve normalization results.
   Conclusion: Spearman correlation analysis revealed that RC, UQ, Med,
   TMM, DESeq, and Q did not noticeably improve gene expression
   normalization, regardless of read length. Other normalization methods
   were more efficient when alignment accuracy was low; Sailfish with RPKM
   gave the best normalization results. When alignment accuracy was high,
   RC was sufficient for gene expression calculation. And we suggest
   ignoring poly-A tail during differential gene expression analysis.}},

Abstract = {{To understand and evaluate the thermomechanical property of Ti-6Al-4V
   alloy prepared by the 3D laser deposition technology, an uniaxial
   compression test was performed on cylindrical samples using an
   electronic universal testing machine and enhanced Hopkinson technique,
   over the range of strain rate from 0.001/s to 5000/s, and at initial
   temperatures from the room temperature to 1173 K. The microstructure of
   the undeformed and deformed samples was examined through optical
   microscopy and the use of scanning electron microscope (SEM). The
   experimental results show the followings: (1) the anisotropy of the
   mechanical property of this alloy is not significant despite the visible
   stratification at the exterior surfaces; (2) initial defects, such as
   the initial voids and lack of fusion, are found in the microstructure
   and in the crack surfaces of the deformed samples, and they are
   considered as a major source of crack initiation and propagation; (3)
   adiabatic shear bands and shearing can easily develop at all selected
   temperatures for samples under compression; (4) the yield and ultimate
   strengths of this laser-deposited Ti-6Al-4V alloy are both lower than
   those of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy prepared by forging and electron beam
   melting, whereas both of its strengths are higher than those of a
   conventional grade Ti-6Al-4V alloy at high strain rate only. In addition
   to compression tests we also conducted tensile loading tests on the
   laser-deposited alloy at both low and high strain rates (0.1/s and
   1000/s). There is significant tension/compression asymmetry in the
   mechanical response under high-strain-rate loading. It was found that
   the quasi-static tensile fracturing exhibits typical composite fracture
   characteristic with quasi-cleavages and dimples, while the
   high-strain-rate fracturing is characterized by ductile fracture
   behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analyzing the special PFG signal attenuation behavior of intermolecular
   MQC via the effective phase shift diffusion equation method}},

Abstract = {{Inter-molecular multiple quantum coherence (iMQC) has important
   applications in NMR and MRI. However, the current theoretical methods
   still have some difficulties in analyzing the behavior of iMQC signal
   attenuation of pulsed field gradient diffusion experiments. In this
   paper, the iMQC diffusion experiments were analyzed by an effective
   phase shift diffusion equation (EPSDE) method, which is based on the
   idea that the accumulating phase shift (APS) can be viewed as the result
   of a diffusion process in virtual phase space (VPS) with effective
   diffusion coefficient K-2(t)D (rad(2)/s) where K(t) = integral(t)(0)
   gamma g(t') dt' is a wavenumber and D is the physical diffusion
   coefficient of the spin carrier in the real space. The term
   K(t(tot))z(1) needs to be added to the APS when K(t(tot)) is not zero.
   Most of the time, K(t(tot)) equals zero. However, in iMQC experiments,
   the condition K(t(tot)) equaling zero or being non-zero for each spin
   depends on the gradient pulse setting. The signal attenuations of these
   two types of iMQC, zero or non-zero K(t(tot)), were analyzed in detail
   for free and restricted diffusions, which shows that there are
   significant differences between these two types of iMQC. Particularly,
   if an apparent diffusion coefficient D-app is used to analyze the signal
   attenuation, it equals nD for zero K(t(tot)) which agrees with current
   theoretical and experimental reports, while for non-zero K(t(tot)), it
   equals (2n - 1) D which agrees with experimental results from the
   literature; there are no similar theoretical results reported for
   comparison. The result that D-app equals (2n -1) D is important because
   the higher value of Dapp means that non-zero K(t(tot)) iMQC can
   potentially provide more contrast and measure slower diffusion rates
   than zero K(t(tot)) iMQC. The EPSDE method provides a new way to analyze
   iMQC diffusion experiments. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Pb- or Bi-based perovskite oxides have been widely studied and used
   because of their large ferroelectric polarization features induced by
   stereochemically active 6s(2) lone pair electrons. It is intriguing
   whether this effect could exist in other related systems. Herein, we
   designed and synthesized a mixed Pb and Bi A site polar compound,
   PbBiNb5O15, with the TTB framework. The as-synthesized material turns
   out to be a relaxor with weak macroscopic ferroelectricity but adopts
   strong local polarizations. What's more, unusual five orders of
   incommensurate satellite reflections with strong intensities were
   observed under the electron diffraction, suggesting that the modulation
   is highly developed with large amplitudes. The structural modulation was
   solved with a (3 + 1)D superspace group using high-resolution
   synchrotron radiation combined with anomalous dispersion X-ray
   diffraction technique to distinguish Pb from Bi. We show that the strong
   modulation mainly originates from lone-pair driven Pb2+-Bi3+ ordering in
   the large pentagonal caves, which can suppress the local polarization in
   x-y plane in long ranges. Moreover, the as-synthesized ceramics display
   strong relaxor ferroelectric feature with transition temperature near
   room temperature and moderate dielectric properties, which could be
   functionalized to be electromechanical device materials.}},

Abstract = {{The histone demethylase KDM1A specifically demethylates lysine residues
   and its deregulation has been implicated in the initiation and
   progression of various cancers. However, KDM1A's molecular role and its
   pathological consequences, and prognostic significance in oral cancer
   remain less understood. In the present study, we sought to investigate
   the expression of KDM1A and its downstream role in oral cancer
   pathogenesis. By comparing mRNA expression profiles, we identified an
   elevated KDM1A expression in oral tumors when compared to normal oral
   tissues. In silica pathway prediction identified the association between
   KDM1A and E2F1 signaling in oral cancer. Pathway scanning, functional
   annotation analysis and In vitro assays showed the KDM1A's involvement
   in oral cancer cell proliferation and the cell cycle. Moreover, real
   time PCR and luciferase assays confirmed KDM1A's role in regulation of
   E2F1 signaling activity in oral cancer. Elevated KDM1A expression is
   associated with poor clinical outcome in oral cancer. Our data indicate
   that deregulated KDM1A expression is positively associated with
   proliferative phenotype of oral cancer and confers poor clinical
   outcome. These cumulative data suggest that KDM1A might be a potential
   diagnostic and therapeutic target for oral cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Identification of miRNAs with potential roles in regulation of anther
   development and male-sterility in 7B-1 male-sterile tomato mutant}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: The 7B-1 tomato line (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Rutgers) is a
   photoperiod-sensitive male-sterile mutant, with potential application in
   hybrid seed production. Small RNAs (sRNAs) in tomato have been mainly
   characterized in fruit development and ripening, but none have been
   studied with respect to flower development and regulation of
   male-sterility. Using sRNA sequencing, we identified miRNAs that are
   potentially involved in anther development and regulation of
   male-sterility in 7B-1 mutant.
   Results: Two sRNA libraries from 7B-1 and wild type (WT) anthers were
   sequenced and thirty two families of known miRNAs and 23 new miRNAs were
   identified in both libraries. MiR390, miR166, miR159 were up-regulated
   and miR530, miR167, miR164, miR396, miR168, miR393, miR8006 and two new
   miRNAs, miR\#W and miR\#M were down-regulated in 7B-1 anthers. Ta-siRNAs
   were not differentially expressed and likely not associated with 7B-1
   male-sterility. miRNA targets with potential roles in anther development
   were validated using 5'-RACE. QPCR analysis showed differential
   expression of miRNA/target pairs of interest in anthers and stem of
   7B-1, suggesting that they may regulate different biological processes
   in these tissues. Expression level of most miRNA/target pairs showed
   negative correlation, except for few. In situ hybridization showed
   predominant expression of miR159, GAMYBL1, PMEI and cystatin in tapetum,
   tetrads and microspores.
   Conclusion: Overall, we identified miRNAs with potential roles in anther
   development and regulation of male-sterility in 7B-1. A number of new
   miRNAs were also identified from tomato for the first time. Our data
   could be used as a benchmark for future studies of the molecular
   mechanisms of male-sterility in other crops.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Children and adolescents with ADHD treated with central
   stimulants (CS) often have growth deficits, but the implications of such
   treatment for final height and stature remain unclear.
   Methods: Weight and height were assessed multiple times in 410 children

   0.9 and 16.1 years. Weight and height measures were converted to
   z-scores based on age- and sex-adjusted population tables.
   Results: CS treatment was associated with (1) a relative reduction in
   body weight and a temporary halt in growth, (2) a weight and height lag
   after 72 months compared with relative baseline values. No relation to
   early start of medication (<6 years), gender, comorbid ODD/CD or
   emotional disorders was observed.
   Conclusions: Treatment with central stimulants for ADHD impacts growth
   in children and adolescents, and growth should be continuously monitored
   in patients on chronic treatment with these medications.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise the two major entities
   Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and endoscopic imaging of the
   gastrointestinal tract has always been an integral and central part in
   the management of IBD patients. Within the recent years, mucosal healing
   emerged as a key treatment goal in IBD that substantially decides about
   the clinical outcome of IBD patients, thereby demanding for a precise,
   timely and detailed endoscopic assessment of the mucosal inflammation
   associated with IBD. Further, molecular imaging has tremendously
   expanded the clinical utility and applications of modern endoscopy, now
   encompassing not only diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment but also
   the prediction of individual therapy response. Within this review we
   describe novel endoscopic approaches and advanced endoscopic imaging
   methods for the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of IBD patients.
   We begin by providing an overview over novel and advanced imaging
   techniques such as magnification endoscopy and dye-based and dye-less
   chromoendoscopy, endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy. We then describe how
   these techniques can be utilized for the precise and ultrastructural
   assessment of mucosal inflammation and dysplasia development associated
   with IBD and outline how they have enabled the endoscopist to gain
   insight onto the cellular level in real-time. Finally, we provide an
   outlook on how molecular imaging has rapidly evolved in the recent past
   and can be used to make individual predictions about the therapeutic
   response towards biological treatment.}},

Title = {{Perceptions and acceptability of pictorial health warning labels vs text
   only - a cross-sectional study in Lao PDR}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Lao PDR, health warnings were first introduced with
   printed warning messages on the side of the cigarette package in 1993
   and again in 2004. Lao PDR same year ratified the Framework Convention
   on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) but has not yet implemented pictorial
   health warnings. This paper aims to examine the perception and opinion
   of policymakers on ``text-only{''} and ``pictorial{''} health warnings
   and to understand lay people's perceptions on current health warnings
   and their opinions on the recommended types of health warnings.
   Methods: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used
   in this cross-sectional study conducted in 2008. A purposive sample of
   15 policymakers, and a representative sample of 1360 smokers and
   non-smokers were recruited. A range of different areas were covered
   including consumer attitudes towards current and proposed cigarette
   package design, views on health warning messages on the flip/slide and
   inserts, and views on the relative importance of the size, content and
   pictures of health warning messages. Descriptive statistics and content
   analysis were used.
   Results: Policy makers and survey respondents said that the current
   health warning messages were inappropriate, ineffective, and too small
   in size. All respondents perceived pictorial health warnings as a
   potentially powerful element that could be added to the messages that
   can communicate quickly, and dramatically. The majority of policymakers
   and survey respondents strongly supported the implementation of
   pictorial health warnings. The non-smokers agreed that the graphic
   pictorial health warnings were generally more likely than written health
   warnings to stimulate thinking about the health risks of smoking, by
   conveying potential health effects, increasing and reinforcing awareness
   of the negative health effect of smoking, aiding memorability of the
   health effects and arousing fear of smoking among smokers.
   Conclusions: The study suggested that current warnings are too small and
   that content is inadequate and designed to be hidden on the side pack.
   These findings are in line with FCTC's requirements and provide strong
   support for introducing pictorial warning labels also in Lao PDR.
   Furthermore, the awareness of Members of Parliament about tobacco
   control measures holds promise at the highest political level.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene decorated with 5d transitional metal atoms is predicted to

   and annealing conditions. Our results are consistent with the formation
   of Ir clusters of similar to 100 atoms at low temperature, with each
   cluster donating a single electronic charge to graphene. Annealing
   graphene increases the cluster size, reducing the doping and increasing
   the mobility. We do not observe any sign of an energy gap induced by
   spin-orbit coupling, possibly due to the clustering of Ir.}},

Abstract = {{The transcripts of the gene Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially
   Expressed (CRNDE) are recognized as long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which
   are expressed in specific regions within the human brain, and are the
   most upregulated lncRNA in gliomas. However, the underlying regulation
   and function of CRNDE in gliomas are largely unknown. In this study, the
   upregulation of CRNDE was confirmed in both primary specimens from
   glioma patients and in vitro with cell lines. Overexpression of specific
   CRNDE transcript promotes cell growth and migration in vitro while
   knockdown of CRNDE expression manifests a repressive function during
   these cellular processes. The growth promoting effect of CRNDE was also
   demonstrated in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic studies further
   revealed that histone acetylation in the promoter region might account
   for the upregulation of CRNDE, and the level of CRNDE expression could
   be modulated by mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in
   glioma. Thus, our results shed a light on utilizing CRNDE as a potential
   novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma. (C) 2015 Published

Title = {{Effectiveness of a Randomized Controlled Lifestyle Intervention to
   Prevent Obesity among Chinese Primary School Students: CLICK-Obesity
   Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Childhood obesity has been increasing rapidly worldwide. There is
   limited evidence for effective lifestyle interventions to prevent
   childhood obesity worldwide, especially in developing countries like
   China. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a
   school-based multi-component lifestyle childhood obesity prevention
   program (the CLICK-Obesity study) in Mainland China.
   Methods
   A cluster randomized controlled trial was developed among grade 4
   students from 8 urban primary schools (638 students in intervention, 544
   as control) in Nanjing City, China. Students were randomly allocated to
   the control or intervention group at school-level. A one-year
   multi-component intervention program (classroom curriculum, school
   environment support, family involvement and fun programs/events)
   together with routine health education was provided to the intervention
   group, while the control group received routine health education only.
   The main outcome variables assessed were changes in body mass index,
   obesity occurrence, obesity-related lifestyle behaviors and knowledge.
   Results Overall, 1108 (93.7\%) of the 1182 enrolled students completed
   the intervention study. The intervention group had a larger marginal
   reduction than did the control group in overall mean BMI value (-0.32
   +/- 1.36 vs. -0.29 +/- 1.40, p = 0.09), although this was not
   significant. Compared with the control group, the intervention group was
   more likely to decrease their BMI (OR = 1.44, 95\%CI = 1.10, 1.87) by
   0.5 kg/m(2) or above, increase the frequency of jogging/running (OR =
   1.55, 95\%CI = 1.18, 2.02), decrease the frequency of TV/computer use
   (OR = 1.41, 95\%CI = 1.09, 1.84) and of red meat consumption (OR = 1.50,
   95\%CI = 1.15, 1.95), change commuting mode to/from school from
   sedentary to active mode (OR = 2.24, 95\%CI = 1.47, 3.40), and be aware
   of the harm of selected obesity risk factors.
   Conclusions
   The school-based lifestyle intervention program was practical and
   effective in improving health behaviors and obesity-related knowledge
   for children in China. This study provides important policy implications
   on school-based intervention programs for modifications of
   obesity-related lifestyles.}},

Abstract = {{A novel fluorescence probe based on modified halloysite nanotubes (HNTs)
   by using 1-pyrenylboronic acid selectively grafted onto the inner
   surface of lumen was successfully achieved. The solid-state nuclear
   magnetic resonance (C-13 and B-11), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) confirmed that the boronic
   acid group only binds to alumina at the tube lumen and does not bind the
   tube's outer siloxane surface. The modified HNTs (HNTs-PY) inherit the
   spectroscopic properties relating to the pyrene units. Interestingly,
   the established Al-O-B linkage gives the H2O2-sensitivity to pyrene
   grafted tubes. HNTs-PY exhibits a highly specific ``turn-off' response
   for hyperoxide over other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative
   ions owing to their chemoselective boronate-to-phenol switch. The
   ``turn-off' response can even be tracked when the additional amount of
   H2O2 was limited to 1 x 10(-6) mol. Thus, the selective modification
   method under mild conditions for the design of novel organic inorganic
   hybrid fluorescence probe may open up a broader application as well as
   for identification and diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the rare earth element Y was added to C-f/Mg composite to
   improve the interfacial bonding strength. 60 vol\% C-f/Mg composites

   alloys. The interfacial products were identified to be MgO, Mg2Y and
   Mg24Y5 by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and selected area
   electron diffraction (SAED). Moreover, the interfacial products enhanced
   the interface bonding strength, which could be confirmed by the increase
   of interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). In particular, the C-f/Mg
   composite with 5.7 wt\% Y addition increases the ILSS by about 120.9\%

Title = {{Promoter methylation status and expression of PPAR-gamma gene are
   associated with prognosis of acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIGENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
   (PPAR-gamma) has been demonstrated to be involved in anti-inflammatory
   reactions, but its role in acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure
   (ACHBLF) is unclear. Therefore, DNA methylation patterns and expression
   level of PPAR-gamma gene were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs) from 81 patients with ACHBLF, 50 patients with chronic
   hepatitis B (CHB), and 30 healthy controls, and the possible role of
   PPAR-gamma in ACHBLF was analyzed.
   Results: We found that aberrant PPAR-gamma promoter methylation was
   attenuated in ACHBLF patients compared with CHB patients and was
   responsible for the elevated PPAR-gamma expression level, which was
   negatively correlated with total bilirubin and international normalized
   ratio. Plasma level of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in ACHBLF patients were higher
   than CHB patients and healthy controls and significantly reduced in
   unmethylated group. ACHBLF patients with PPAR-gamma promoter methylation
   had poorer outcomes than those without. Correspondingly, PPAR-gamma
   messenger RNA (mRNA) level was higher in survivors than non-survivors
   and gradually increased in survivors with time, while remained low level
   in non-survivors.
   Conclusions: Aberrant promoter methylation decline and PPAR-gamma
   expression rebound occurred in ACHBLF compared with CHB and could
   improve prognosis of ACHBLF by negatively regulating cytokines.}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Morphogenesis and physiology of tissues and organs requires planar cell
   polarity (PCP) systems that orient and coordinate cells and their
   behaviors, but the relationship between PCP systems has been
   controversial. We have characterized how the Frizzled and Dachsous-Fat
   PCP systems are connected through the Spiny-legs isoform of the
   Prickle-Spiny-legs locus. Two different components of the Dachsous-Fat
   system, Dachsous and Dachs, can each independently interact with
   Spiny-legs and direct its localization in vivo. Through characterization
   of the contributions of Prickle, Spiny-legs, Dachsous, Fat, and Dachs to
   PCP in the Drosophila wing, eye, and abdomen, we define where
   Dachs-Spiny-legs and Dachsous-Spiny-legs interactions contribute to PCP,
   and provide a new understanding of the orientation of polarity and the
   basis of PCP phenotypes. Our results support the direct linkage of PCP
   systems through Sple in specific locales, while emphasizing that cells
   can be subject to and must ultimately resolve distinct, competing PCP
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{(Bio)degradable poly(ethylene imine-co-glycine)s (P(EI-co-Gly)) were
   synthesized through efficient and controlled oxidation of linear
   poly(ethylene imine) (LPEI) using hydrogen peroxide in a methanol/water
   mixture. Temperature, peroxide concentration, and reaction time were
   varied to adjust the degree of oxidation (DO). At low temperatures, the
   oxidation process was found to be well-controlled with almost 85\% of
   ethylene imine units converted to the corresponding amide. Importantly,
   oxidation of more than 10\% of the LPEI rendered the polymers
   water-soluble. The oxidation reaction and molecular structure of
   P(EI-co-Gly)s were studied in detail by various nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) methods, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC). The introduction of backbone amide groups to the
   P(EI-co-Gly)s facilitated its (bio)degradation under acidic conditions
   or by proteases. Moreover, the P(EI-co-Gly)s exhibited negligible
   cytotoxicity, particularly relative to LPEI. The interaction of the
   copolymers with serum-containing medium was investigated showing no
   indication of coagulation. Preliminary studies indicate that
   P(EI-co-Gly) is a promising biodegradable polymer with negligible
   toxicity in human cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{The Hippo pathway significantly correlates with organ size control and

   control the mammalian Hippo pathway have not been well understood. Here,
   we reveal a connection between the Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)
   signaling pathway and the Hippo-YAP pathway in gastric cancer stem-like
   cells. The selective PAR1 agonist TFLLR-NH2 induces an increase in the
   fraction of side population cells which is enriched in CSCs, and
   promotes tumorigenesis, multi cancer drug resistance, cell morphological
   change, and cell invasion which are characteristics of CSCs. In
   addition, PAR1 activation inhibits the Hippo-YAP pathway kinase Lats via
   Rho GTPase. Lats kinase inhibition in turn results in increased nuclear
   localization of dephosphorylated YAP. Furthermore, PAR1 activation
   confers CSCs related traits via the Hippo-YAP pathway, and the Hippo-YAP
   pathway correlates with epithelial mesenchymal transition which is
   induced by PAR1 activation. Our research suggests that the PAR1
   signaling deeply participates in the ability of multi drug resistance

Title = {{Combining environmental suitability and population abundances to
   evaluate the invasive potential of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis along
   the temperate South American coast}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{The tunicate Ciona intestinalis is an opportunistic invader with high
   potential for causing economic losses in aquaculture centers. Recent
   phylogenetic and population genetic analysis support the existence of a
   genetic complex described as C. intestinalis with two main dominant
   species (sp A and B) occurring worldwide. In Chile, the species has been
   observed around 30 degrees S of latitude, but no official reports exist
   for the presence of C. intestinalis in southern regions (above 40
   degrees S), where most of the mollusk aquaculture centers are located.
   Here, we used occurrences from multiple invaded regions and extensive
   field sampling to model and validate the environmental conditions that
   allow the species to persist and to find the geographic areas with the
   most suitable environmental conditions for the spread of C. intestinalis
   in the Chilean coast. By studying the potential expansion of C.
   intestinalis southward in the Chilean Coast, we aimed to provide
   valuable information that might help the development of control plans
   before the species becomes a significant problem, especially above 40
   degrees S. Our results highlight that, by using portions of the habitat
   that are apparently distinguishable, the species seem to be not only
   genetically distinct, but ecologically distinct as well. The two
   regional models fitted for sp A and for sp B showed disagreement on
   which sections of Chilean coastline are considered more suitable for
   these species. While the model for sp A identifies moderately to highly
   suitable areas between 30 degrees and 40 degrees S, the model for sp B
   classifies the areas around 45. S as the most appropriate. Data from
   field sampling show a positive linear relationship between density of C.
   intestinalis and the index of suitability for sp A in aquaculture
   centers. Understanding the relation of the distinct species with the
   surrounding environment provided valuable insights about probable routes
   of dispersion in Chile, especially into those areas considered suitable
   for aquacultureactivities but where the species has not yet been
   recorded. We discuss the implications of our findings as a useful tool
   to anticipate the invasion of such harmful invasive species with regard
   to the most relevant environmental variables.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study compared safety and efficacy of first-and
   second-generation DES in an unrestricted, real-life population of
   diabetic patients undergoing PCI.
   Material/Methods: The study was a subanalysis of diabetic patients from
   the all-comer Katowice-Zabrze Registry of patients undergoing PCI with
   the implantation of either first-(Paclitaxel-, Sirolimus-eluting stents)
   or second-generation DES (Zotarolimus-, Everolimus-, Biolimus-eluting
   stents). Efficacy defined as major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular
   events (MACCE: death, myocardial infarction, target vessel
   revascularization, stroke) and safety defined as stent thrombosis (ST)
   were evaluated at 1 year.
   Results: From the total of 1916 patients, 717 were diabetics. Among
   them, 257 (36\%) were treated with first-generation DES (230 {[}89\%]
   Paclitaxel-eluting stents, 27 {[}11\%] Sirolimus-eluting stents), 460
   with second-generation DES (171 {[}37\%] Zotarolimus-eluting stents, 243
   {[}53\%] Everolimus-eluting stents, 46 {[}10\%] Biolimus-eluting
   stents). Rate of MACCE was equal in both groups (p=0.54).
   Second-generation DES had a better safety profile than first-generation
   DES (log-rank for cumulative ST at 1 year p<0.001). First-generation DES
   was a risk factor for ST (HR 5.75 {[}1.16-28.47], p=0.03) but not for
   MACCE (HR 0.89 {[}0.6-1.32], p=0.57).
   Conclusions: In a real-life setting of diabetic patients undergoing PCI,
   second-generation DES had lower risk of ST and similar MACCE rate
   compared to first-generation DES.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the carbonyl sulfide (OCS) land/ocean fluxes contributes to
   the understanding of both the sulfur and carbon cycles. The primary
   sources and sinks of OCS are very likely in a steady state because there
   is no significant observed trend or interannual variability in
   atmospheric OCS measurements. However, the magnitude and spatial
   distribution of the dominant ocean source are highly uncertain due to
   the lack of observations. In particular, estimates of the oceanic fluxes
   range from approximately 280 Gg S yr(-1) to greater than 800 Gg S
   yr(-1), with the larger flux needed to balance a similarly sized
   terrestrial sink that is inferred from NOAA continental sites. Here we
   estimate summer tropical oceanic fluxes of OCS in 2006 using a linear
   flux inversion algorithm and new OCS data acquired by the Aura
   Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer (TES). Modeled OCS concentrations
   based on these updated fluxes are consistent with HIAPER Pole-to-Pole
   Observations during 4th airborne campaign and improve significantly over
   the a priori model concentrations. The TES tropical ocean estimate of 70
   +/- 16Gg S in June, when extrapolated over the whole year (about 840 +/-
   192 Gg S yr(-1)), supports the hypothesis proposed by Berry et al.
   (2013) that the ocean flux is in the higher range of approximately 800
   Gg S yr(-1).}},

Title = {{How accurate is anatomic limb alignment in predicting mechanical limb
   alignment after total knee arthroplasty?}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anatomic limb alignment often differs from mechanical limb
   alignment after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to assess the
   accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity for each of three commonly used
   ranges for anatomic limb alignment (3-9 degrees, 5-10 degrees and 2-10
   degrees) in predicting an acceptable range (neutral +/- 3 degrees) for
   mechanical limb alignment after TKA. We also assessed whether the
   accuracy of anatomic limb alignment was affected by anatomic variation.
   Methods: This retrospective study included 314 primary TKAs. The
   alignment of the limb was measured with both anatomic and mechanical
   methods of measurement. We also measured anatomic variation, including
   the femoral bowing angle, tibial bowing angle, and neck-shaft angle of
   the femur. All angles were measured on the same full-length standing
   anteroposterior radiographs. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity
   for each range of anatomic limb alignment were calculated and compared
   using mechanical limb alignment as the reference standard. The
   associations between the accuracy of anatomic limb alignment and
   anatomic variation were also determined.
   Results: The range of 2-10 degrees for anatomic limb alignment showed
   the highest accuracy, but it was only 73 \% (3-9 degrees, 65 \%; 5-10
   degrees, 67 \%). The specificity of the 2-10 degrees range was 81 \%,
   which was higher than that of the other ranges (3-9 degrees, 69 \%; 5-10
   degrees, 67 \%). However, the sensitivity of the 2-10 degrees range to
   predict varus malalignment was only 16 \% (3-9 degrees, 35 \%; 5-10
   degrees, 68 \%). In addition, the sensitivity of the 2-10 degrees range
   to predict valgus malalignment was only 43 \% (3-9 degrees, 71 \%; 5-10
   degrees, 43 \%). The accuracy of anatomical limb alignment was lower for
   knees with greater femoral (odds ratio = 1.2) and tibial (odds ratio =
   1.2) bowing.
   Conclusions: Anatomic limb alignment did not accurately predict
   mechanical limb alignment after TKA, and its accuracy was affected by
   anatomic variation. Thus, alignment after TKA should be assessed by
   measuring mechanical alignment rather than anatomic alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed ultrafast photography (CUP), a computational imaging
   technique, is synchronized with short-pulsed laser illumination to
   enable dynamic three-dimensional (3D) imaging. By leveraging the

   with the compressed acquisition of 3D data in a single snapshot
   measurement, thereby allowing efficient and secure data storage and
   transmission. We demonstrated high-speed 3D videography of moving
   objects at up to 75 volumes per second. The ToF-CUP camera was applied
   to track the 3D position of a live comet goldfish. We have also imaged a

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements were used
   to investigate the thermal and mechanical properties of cross-linked
   phenolic resins as a function of the degree of cross-linking, the chain
   motif (ortho-ortho versus ortho-para), and the chain length. The chain
   motif influenced the type (interchain or intrachain) as well as the
   amount of hydrogen bonding. Ortho-ortho chains favored internal hydrogen
   bonding whereas ortho-para favored hydrogen bonding between chains.
   Un-cross-linked ortho para systems formed percolating 3D networks of
   hydrogen bonds, behaving effectively as ``hydrogen gels{''}. This
   resulted in differing thermal and mechanical properties for these
   systems. As cross-linking increased, the chain motif, chain length, and
   hydrogen bonding networks became less important. Elastic moduli, thermal
   conductivity, and glass transition temperatures were characterized as a
   function of cross-linking and temperature. Both our own experimental
   data and literature values were used to validate our simulation results.}},

Title = {{Culture moderates the relationship between interdependence and face
   recognition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Recent theory suggests that face recognition accuracy is affected by
   people's motivations, with people being particularly motivated to
   remember ingroup versus outgroup faces. In the current research we
   suggest that those higher in interdependence should have a greater
   motivation to remember ingroup faces, but this should depend on how
   ingroups are defined. To examine this possibility, we used a joint
   individual difference and cultural approach to test (a) whether
   individual differences in interdependence would predict face recognition
   accuracy, and (b) whether this effect would be moderated by culture. In
   Study 1 European Canadians higher in interdependence demonstrated
   greater recognition for same-race (White), but not cross-race (East
   Asian) faces. In Study 2 we found that culture moderated this effect.
   Interdependence again predicted greater recognition for same-race
   (White), but not cross-race (East Asian) faces among European Canadians;
   however, interdependence predicted worse recognition for both same-race
   (East Asian) and cross-race (White) faces among first-generation East
   Asians. The results provide insight into the role of motivation in face
   perception as well as cultural differences in the conception of
   ingroups.}},

Abstract = {{RMRP, the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing
   endoribonuclease, is a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) part of the RNase MRP
   complex functioning in mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA processing. Even
   though various mutations in the RMRP gene are linked to developmental
   defects and pathogenesis, its relevance to cancer etiology has not been
   well established. Here we examined the expression of RMRP and found a
   significant increase in colorectal and breast cancer patient tissues. So
   we tested whether the oncogenic signaling pathways, Wnt/beta-catenin and
   Hippo/YAP pathways, are relevant to the enhanced expression of RMRP in
   cancer cells because of the predicted beta-catenin/TCF and YAP/TBX5
   elements in the upstream regions of the RMRP gene. As expected, Wnt
   signal activation significantly induced the RMRP transcription thru
   beta-catenin and YAP transcription factors. More importantly, YAP
   protein was critical for RMRP transcription by association to the
   proximal site near the transcription start site of the RMRP gene, a Pol
   III promoter, along with beta-catenin and TBX5 proteins. We propose that
   the interplay of Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways could regulate target
   genes, coding or non-coding, by the beta-catenin/YAP/TBX5 transcription
   complex in cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{The axon initial segment (AIS) is an essential neuronal compartment. It
   is usually where action potentials are initiated. Recent studies
   demonstrated that the AIS is a plastic structure that can be regulated
   by neuronal activity and by the activation of metabotropic receptors.
   Studying the AIS in live tissue can be difficult because its
   identification is not always reliable. Here we provide a new technique
   allowing a fast and reliable identification of the AIS in live brain
   slice preparations. By simultaneous recording of extracellular local
   field potentials and whole-cell patch-clamp recording of neurons, we can
   detect sinks caused by inward currents flowing across the membrane. We
   determine the location of the AIS by comparing the timing of these
   events with the action potential. We demonstrate that this method allows
   the unequivocal identification of the AIS of different types of neurons
   from the brain.}},

Title = {{BDNF-TrkB signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell of mice has key role
   in methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Depression is a core symptom of methamphetamine (METH) withdrawal during
   the first several weeks of abstinence. However, the precise mechanisms
   underlying METH withdrawal symptoms remain unknown. Brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its specific receptor,
   tropomyosin-related kinase (TrkB), have a role the in pathophysiology of
   depression. In this study, we examined the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling
   in different brain regions of male mice with METH withdrawal symptoms.
   Repeated METH (3 mg kg(-1) per day for 5 days) administration to mice
   caused a long-lasting depression-like behavior including anhedonia.
   Western blot analysis showed that BDNF levels in the nucleus accumbens
   (NAc) of METH-treated mice were significantly higher than those of
   control mice whereas BDNF levels in other regions, including the
   prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, were not altered. METH-induced
   depression-like behavior, behavioral sensitization and dendritic changes
   in the NAc shell were improved by subsequent subchronic administration
   of TrkB antagonist ANA-12 (0.5 mg kg(-1) per day for 14 days), but not
   TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (10 mg kg(-1) per day for 14 days). In
   vivo microdialysis showed that METH (1 mg kg(-1))-induced dopamine
   release in NAc shell of METH-treated mice was attenuated after
   subsequent subchronic ANA-12 administration. Interestingly, a single
   bilateral infusion of ANA-12 into the NAc shell, but not NAc core,
   showed a rapid and long-lasting therapeutic effect. However, ketamine
   and paroxetine had no effect. These findings suggest that increased
   BDNF-TrkB signaling in the NAc shell has an important role in the
   behavioral abnormalities after withdrawal from repeated METH
   administration, and that TrkB antagonists are potential therapeutic
   drugs for withdrawal symptoms in METH abusers.}},

Abstract = {{Assembling colloidal particles into highly ordered configurations, such
   as photonic crystals, has significant potential for enabling a broad
   range of new technologies. Facilitating the nucleation of colloidal
   crystals and developing successful crystal growth strategies require a
   fundamental understanding of the equilibrium structure and morphology of
   small colloidal assemblies. Here, we report the results of a novel
   computational approach to determine the equilibrium shape of assemblies
   of colloidal particles that interact via an experimentally validated
   pair potential. While the well-known Wulff construction can accurately
   capture the equilibrium shape of large colloidal assemblies, containing
   O(10(4)) or more particles, determining the equilibrium shape of small
   colloidal assemblies of O(10) particles requires a generalized Wulff
   construction technique which we have developed for a proper description
   of equilibrium structure and morphology of small crystals. We identify
   and characterize fully several ``magic{''} clusters which are
   significantly more stable than other similarly sized clusters.}},

Title = {{SOFIE: Surgery for Olecranon Fractures in the Elderly: a randomised
   controlled trial of operative versus non-operative treatment}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Displaced olecranon fractures after a simple fall are common
   in elderly patients. This patient group often has multiple medical
   co-morbidities and low functional demands. Standard treatment for these
   fractures has been operative fixation, using either wires or a plate.
   Recent case series suggest that such injuries can be managed without
   surgery with good functional outcomes. There has been no published trial
   comparing operative to non-operative treatment for displaced olecranon
   fractures.
   This project aims to test for superiority of operative treatment versus
   non-operative treatment for displaced olecranon fractures in the
   elderly, by comparing pain and function in the affected limb up to one
   year after the injury.
   Methods/Design: SOFIE is an international study with a multicentre
   pragmatic randomised controlled trial design. The primary objective of
   the study is to compare a patient related outcome, the Disability of the
   Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score, between patients treated operatively
   and non-operatively at twelve months. Patients will be considered for
   the study if they are 75 years of age or older, medically fit for
   surgery, have an isolated displaced olecranon fracture, and present
   within 14 days of injury. Eligible patients willing to participate will
   be randomised either to operative fixation, with surgery using the
   preferred technique of the treating orthopaedic surgeon (tension band
   wiring or plate fixation), or to non-operative treatment involving early
   range of motion as tolerated.
   Secondary outcome measures will include pain, active range of motion,
   elbow extension strength, and any adverse events (infection, secondary
   interventions) at 3 and 12 months.
   Discussion: The study will answer an important clinical question about
   the effectiveness of a commonly performed orthopaedic procedure, and
   will guide future treatment for displaced olecranon fractures in the
   elderly.}},

Abstract = {{TGF beta signaling has been implicated in the metaplasia from squamous
   epithelia to Barrett's esophagus and, ultimately, esophageal
   adenocarcinoma. The role of the family member Activin A in Barrett's
   tumorigenesis is less well established. As tumorigenesis is influenced
   by factors in the tumor microenvironment, such as fibroblasts and the
   extracellular matrix, we aimed to determine if epithelial cell-derived
   Activin affects initiation and progression differently than Activin
   signaling stimulation from a mimicked stromal source. Using Barrett's
   esophagus cells, CPB, and the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines OE33
   and FLO-1, we showed that Activin reduces colony formation only in CPB
   cells. Epithelial cell overexpression of Activin increased cell
   migration and invasion in Boyden chamber assays in CPB and FLO-1 cells,
   which exhibited mesenchymal features such as the expression of the CD44
   standard form, vimentin, and MT1-MMP. When grown in organotypic
   reconstructs, OE33 cells expressed E-cadherin and Keratin 8. As
   mesenchymal characteristics have been associated with the acquisition of
   stem cell-like features, we analyzed the expression and localization of
   SOX9, showing nuclear localization of SOX9 in esophageal CPB and FLO-1
   cells.
   In conclusion, we show a role for autocrine Activin signaling in the
   regulation of colony formation, cell migration and invasion in Barrett's
   tumorigenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of noncytotoxic decidual natural killer cells (dNK) and
   extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) at the maternal-fetal interface was
   studied. Confocal microscopy revealed that many dNK interact with a
   single large EVT. Filamentous projections from EVT enriched in HLA-G
   were shown to contact dNK, and may represent the initial stage of
   synapse formation. As isolated, 2.5\% of dNK contained surface HLA-G.
   However, surface HLA-G-negative dNK contained internalized HLA-G.
   Activation of dNK resulted in the disappearance of internalized HLA-G in
   parallel with restoration of cytotoxicity. Surface HLA-G was reacquired
   by incubation with EVT. This HLA-G cycle of trogocytosis, endocytosis,
   degradation, and finally reacquisition provides a transient and
   localized acquisition of new functional properties by dNK upon
   interaction with EVT. Interruption of the cycle by activation of dNK by
   cytokines and/or viral products serves to ensure the NK control of virus
   infection at the interface, and is illustrated here by the response of
   dNK to human cytomegalo virus (HCMV)-infected decidual stromal cells.
   Thus, the HLA-G cycle in dNK can provide both for NK tolerance and
   antiviral immunity.}},

Title = {{Participant evaluation of an education module on interprofessional
   collaboration for students in healthcare studies}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interprofessional collaboration is considered a key-factor
   to deliver the highest quality of care. Interprofessional collaboration
   (IPC) assumes a model of working together, in particular with awareness
   of the process of interprofessional collaboration, to develop an
   integrated and cohesive answer to the needs of the
   client/family/population. Educational modules are developed in response
   to a perceived need to improve interprofessional collaboration for the
   benefit of patientcare. Up until 2005 no explicit module on
   interprofessional collaboration existed in the education programs of the
   Antwerp University Association (AUHA). During a decade the
   `Interprofessional Collaboration In Healthcare (IPCIHC) - module' is
   organised and evaluated by its participants.
   Methods: One group, post-test design was used to gather data from the
   participating students using a structured questionnaire. Data was
   collected between March 2005 and March 2014 from participating final
   year students in healthcare educational programs.
   Results: 3568 (84 \% overall response) students evaluated the IPCIHC
   module from 2005 up to 2014. Over 80 \% of the participants were
   convinced the IPCIHC increased their knowledge and changed their
   understanding that it will impact their future professional
   relationships, and felt a greater understanding about problem-solving in
   healthcare teams. Even though the results indicate that the goals of the
   IPCIHC module were achieved, less than 60 \% of the participants
   experienced a change in attitude towards other professional groups.
   Conclusions: Despite the positive outcomes from the participants, the
   challenge still remains to keep on educating future healthcare providers
   in interprofessional collaboration in order to achieve an increase in
   interprofessional behaviour towards other professional groups. Research
   is needed to investigate the effectiveness of undergraduate programs on
   the quality and safety of patientcare in practice.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that noble metal @ RF core shell nanostructures can be
   obtained through a facile one-pot synthesis approach in the absence of
   any additional surfactants. Monodisperse metal@RF core shell
   nanostructures can be produced within 1 h on a large scale. Both the
   core size and shell thickness can be readily tuned by altering the
   reaction parameters. Systematic studies reveal that resorcinol could
   have several functions: it could act as a reactant to form RF resin, and
   it also could passivate the surface of metallic nanoparticles to prevent
   them from aggregating. Additionally, for the first time, our results
   suggest that resorcinol may act as a reducing agent that can reduce
   metal salts to form metal nanoparticles. The core shell nanoparticles
   can be carbonized into M@carbon nanostructures, which have shown great
   performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of chlorobenzene. This work
   not only will help to achieve the controllable synthesis of noble
   metal@RF resin and M@carbon core-shell nanostructures but also will
   promote research into other RF-based nanostructures and their catalytic

Abstract = {{The blood-based diagnosis has a potential to provide an alternative
   approach for easy diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with less
   invasiveness and low-cost. However, present blood-based AD diagnosis
   mainly focuses on measuring the plasma A beta level because no other
   biomarkers are found to possess evident transport mechanisms to pass the
   blood-brain barrier. In order to avoid diagnosing non-demented
   individuals with A beta abnormality, finding additional biomarkers to
   supplement plasma A beta is essential. In this study, we introduce
   potential neurodegenerative biomarkers for blood-based diagnosis. We
   observed severe splenomegaly and structural destruction in the spleen
   with significantly decreased B lymphocytes in senile APP(swe),
   PS1(M146V) and Tau(P301L) transgenic mice. We also found that
   inflammatory cytokines associated with splenic dysfunction were altered
   in the plasma of these mice. These findings suggest potential
   involvement of the splenic dysfunction in AD and the importance of
   biomarker level alterations in the plasma as putative diagnostic targets
   for AD.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) is the most commonly
   administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with
   acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared
   with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive
   care unit (ICU).
   DESIGN AND SETTING Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover
   trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October
   2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a
   predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.
   PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid
   fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI
   requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278
   eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1\%)
   receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5\%)
   receiving saline were analyzed.
   INTERVENTIONS Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid,
   either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week
   treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2
   commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that
   each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The
   treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid
   administration.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was proportion of
   patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at
   least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of >= 3.96mg/dL with an
   increase of >= 0.5mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT
   use and in-hospital mortality.
   RESULTS In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6\%)
   developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025
   patients (9.2\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4\%{[}95\%
   CI, -2.1\% to 2.9\%]; relative risk {[}RR], 1.04 {[}95\% CI, 0.80 to
   1.36]; P=.77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of
   1152 patients (3.3\%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4\%) in the
   saline group (absolute difference, -0.1\% {[}95\% CI, -1.6\% to 1.4\%];
   RR, 0.96 {[}95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P = .91). Overall, 87 of 1152
   patients (7.6\%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110
   patients (8.6\%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute
   difference, -1.0\% {[}95\% CI, -3.3\% to 1.2\%]; RR, 0.88 {[}95\% CI,
   0.67 to 1.17]; P=.40).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid
   therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline
   did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials
   are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure
   clinical outcomes such as mortality.}},

Title = {{Smoking, smoking cessation, and 7-year mortality in a cohort of Thai
   adults}},
Journal = {{POPULATION HEALTH METRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Smoking is a strong risk factor for mortality in both the
   developed and the developing world. However, there is still limited
   research to examine the impact of smoking cessation and mortality in
   middle-income Southeast Asian populations.
   Methods: We use longitudinal data from a large Thai cohort of adult Open
   University students residing nationwide, linked with official death
   records to assess the association of smoking status and mortality risks
   during a 7-year follow-up. The log-rank test was used to evaluate the
   statistical probability of differential survival according to baseline
   smoking status. Multivariate hazard ratios (HR) were reported for
   smoking status and all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
   Results: From 2005 baseline to 2012, current smokers were more likely to
   die than cohort members who ceased smoking and never smokers (1.9 vs 1.3
   vs 0.6 \%, p < 0.05). The hazard of all-cause mortality increased with
   the daily amount of cigarette consumption among both current and former
   smokers. Cause of death analyses showed that current male smokers had a
   significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease related mortality
   (HR 3.9 {[}95 \% CI 1.8-8.1]). Former male smokers had a moderate
   increase in risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases compared to never
   smokers (HR 1.6 {[}95 \% CI 0.7-3.4]). Current male smokers between 2005
   and 2009 experienced highest subsequent mortality hazards during the
   period 2009-2012 compared to never smokers (HR 2.1 {[}95 \% CI
   1.4-3.4]). The higher risk of dying reduced if people quit smoking
   during the 2005-2009 follow-up period (HR 1.5 {[}95 \% CI 0.7-3.3]).
   Risk for mortality fell even further among long-term quitters (HR 1.4
   {[}95 \% CI 0.9-2.2]).
   Conclusion: Among a large nationwide cohort of Thai adults, current
   smokers were at a significantly and substantially higher risk of
   all-cause mortality, especially cardiovascular-related mortality. The
   higher risk of dying fell if people quit smoking and the risk for
   mortality was even lower among long-term quitters. Promotion of smoking
   cessation will contribute substantially to the reduction in avoidable
   mortality in Thailand.}},

Title = {{Factors associated with safe child feces disposal practices in Ethiopia:
   evidence from demographic and health survey}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)
   for water supply and Sanitation definition, safe child feces disposal
   practices include: children defecation into a latrine, disposal of child
   stools in a latrine or burial. Inappropriate disposal of human feces
   including unsafe child feces disposal facilitates the transmission of
   pathogens. However, the factors associated with safe child feces
   disposal practices have not been yet well explored in Ethiopia. This
   study aimed to identify factors associated with safe child feces
   disposal practices in Ethiopia.
   Methods: This study analyzed data from Ethiopian Demographic and Health
   Survey (EDHS) 2011. The practice of child's feces disposal was
   categorized into `safe' and `unsafe' based on the WHO/ UNICEF JMP for
   water supply \& Sanitation definition. Binary and multivariable logistic
   regression models were employed to identify factors associated with safe
   child feces disposal practices.
   Result: The prevalence of safe child feces disposal was 33.68 \% (95 \%
   CI: 32.82-34.55). In the final multivariable logistic regression model,
   the practice of safe disposal of child feces was significantly
   associated with urban residency (AOR = 1.25, 95 \% CI: 1.01-1.55) and
   having access to an improved latrine (AOR = 1.92, 95 \% CI: 1.56-2.36).
   Households found in the poorer, middle, richer and richest wealth
   quintile had (AOR = 2.22, 95 \% CI: 1.70-2.89), (AOR = 2.94, 95 \% CI:
   2.27-3.81), (AOR = 4.20, 95 \% CI: 3.42-5.72) and (AOR = 8.06, 95 \% CI:
   5.91-10.99) times higher odds to practice safe child feces disposal
   respectively as compared households from poorest wealth quintile.
   Mothers/caregivers with primary, secondary and higher educational status
   had (AOR = 1.29, 95 \% CI: 1.10-1.50), (AOR = 1. 64, 95 \% CI:
   1.12-2.41) and (AOR = 2.16, 95 \% CI: 1.25-3.72) times higher odds to
   practice safe child feces disposal respectively than those mothers who
   had no education. Those mothers/caregivers whose child was 48-59 months
   old had (AOR = 2.21, 95 \% CI: 1.82-2.68) times higher odds to practice
   safe child feces disposal as compared to mothers/caregivers who had a
   child with age less than 12 months old. The odds of safe child feces
   disposal among households who had one two and three under five years old
   children were (AOR = 3.11, 95 \% CI: 1.87-5.19),(AOR = 2.55, 95 \% CI:
   1.53-4.24) and (AOR = 1.92, 95 \% CI: 1.13-3.24) times higher
   respectively than households with four and more children of under five
   years old.
   Conclusion: Only one third of the mothers practiced safe child feces
   disposal in Ethiopia. Being an urban resident, having a higher wealth
   quintile, high levels of maternal education, older child age, having a
   lower number of under five years old children, and the presence of an
   improved latrine were factors associated with safe child feces disposal
   practices. Therefore interventions designed to improve safe child feces
   disposal practices should consider those factors identified. Further
   research is also needed to design intervention that will aim to improve
   safe child feces disposal.}},

Abstract = {{Using a thermodynamic integration scheme, we compute the free energy
   cost per unit area, gamma, of forming an interface between a crystal and
   a frozen structured wall, formed by particles frozen into the same
   equilibrium structure as the crystal. Even though the structure and
   potential energy of the crystalline phase in the vicinity of the wall is
   the same as in the bulk, gamma has a nonzero value and increases with
   increasing density of the crystal and the wall. Investigating the effect
   of several interaction potentials between the particles, we observe a
   positive gamma at all crystalline densities if the potential is purely
   repulsive. For models with attractive interactions, such as the
   Lennard-Jones potential, a negative value for gamma is obtained at low
   densities. A qualitative explanation for the change of sign of gamma
   when going from repulsive to attractive interactions, at low crystal
   densities, is suggested.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Effect of LiNbO3 ferroelectric substrate on the carrier mobility in top
   gated graphene field-effect transistors (G-FETs) is demonstrated. It is
   shown that, at the same residual concentration of the charge carriers,
   the mobility in the G-FETs on the LiNbO3 substrate is higher than that
   on the SiO2/Si substrate. The effect is associated with reduction of
   Coulomb scattering via screening the charged impurity field by the field
   induced in the ferroelectric substrate, but significant only for
   mobilities below 1000 cm(2)/V s. Raman spectra analysis and correlations
   established between mobility and microwave loss tangent of the Al2O3
   gate dielectric indicate that the charged impurities are located
   predominantly at the gate dielectric and/or at the gate
   dielectric/graphene interface and are likely associated with oxygen
   vacancies. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content, except where

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Globally only approximate to 50\% of applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer is
   captured by crops, and the remainder can cause pollution via runoff and
   gaseous emissions. Synchronizing soil N supply and crop demand will
   address this problem, however current soil analysis methods provide
   little insight into delivery and acquisition of N forms by roots. We
   used microdialysis, a novel technique for in situ quantification of soil
   nutrient fluxes, to measure N fluxes in sugarcane cropping soils
   receiving different fertilizer regimes, and compare these with N uptake
   capacities of sugarcane roots. We show that in fertilized sugarcane
   soils, fluxes of inorganic N exceed the uptake capacities of sugarcane
   roots by several orders of magnitude. Contrary, fluxes of organic N
   closely matched roots' uptake capacity. These results indicate root
   uptake capacity constrains plant acquisition of inorganic N. This
   mismatch between soil N supply and root N uptake capacity is a likely
   key driver for low N efficiency in the studied crop system. Our results
   also suggest that (i) the relative contribution of inorganic N for plant
   nutrition may be overestimated when relying on soil extracts as
   indicators for root-available N, and (ii) organic N may contribute more
   to crop N supply than is currently assumed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model-independent, nonperturbative relation between
   finite-volume matrix elements and infinite-volume 0 -> 2 and 1 -> 2
   transition amplitudes. Our result accommodates theories in which the
   final two-particle state is coupled to any number of other two-body
   channels, with all angular momentum states included. The derivation uses
   generic, fully relativistic field theory and is exact up to
   exponentially suppressed corrections in the lightest particle mass times
   the box size. This work distinguishes itself from previous studies by
   accommodating particles with any intrinsic spin. To illustrate the
   utility of our general result, we discuss how it can be implemented for
   studies of N + J -> (N pi, N eta, N eta', Sigma K, Lambda K)
   transitions, where J is a generic external current. The reduction of
   rotational symmetry, due to the cubic finite volume, manifests in this
   example through the mixing of S and P waves when the system has nonzero
   total momentum.}},

Abstract = {{The need for advanced fluorescent imaging and delivery platforms has
   motivated the development of smart probes that change their fluorescence
   in response to external stimuli. Here a new molecular design of
   fluorescently labeled PEG-dendron hybrids that self-assemble into
   enzyme-responsive micelles with tunable fluorescent responses is
   reported. In the assembled state, the fluorescence of the dyes is
   quenched or shifted due to intermolecular interactions. Upon enzymatic
   cleavage of the hydrophobic end-groups, the labeled polymeric hybrids
   become hydrophilic, and the micelles disassemble. This supramolecular
   change is translated into a spectral response as the dye-dye
   interactions are eliminated and the intrinsic fluorescence is regained.
   We demonstrate the utilization of this molecular design to generate both
   Turn-On and spectral shift responses by adjusting the type of the
   labeling dye. This approach enables transformation of non-responsive
   labeling dyes into smart fluorescent probes.}},

Abstract = {{Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) plays essential and conserved functions in
   regulating both cell polarity and tumorigenesis in Drosophila
   melanogaster and vertebrates. It is well recognized that plasma membrane
   (PM) or cell cortex localization is crucial for Lgl function in vivo,
   but its membrane-targeting mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we
   discovered that hypoxia acutely and reversibly inhibits Lgl PM targeting
   through a posttranslational mechanism that is independent of the
   well-characterized atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) or Aurora kinase
   mediated phosphorylations. Instead, we identified an evolutionarily
   conserved polybasic (PB) domain that targets Lgl to the PM via
   electrostatic binding to membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates. Such
   PB domain mediated PM targeting is inhibited by hypoxia, which reduces
   inositol phospholipid levels on the PM through adenosine triphosphate
   depletion. Moreover, Lgl PB domain contains all the identified
   phosphorylation sites of aPKC and Aurora kinases, providing a molecular
   mechanism by which phosphorylations neutralize the positive charges on
   the PB domain to inhibit Lgl PM targeting.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional therapies against cancer, chemo- and radiotherapy, have
   multiple limitations that lead to treatment failure and cancer
   recurrence. These limitations are related to systemic and local
   toxicity, while treatment failure and cancer relapse are due to drug
   resistance and self-renewal, properties of a small population of tumor
   cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells are involved in
   cancer initiation, maintenance, metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, in
   order to develop efficient treatments that can induce a long-lasting
   clinical response preventing tumor relapse it is important to develop
   drugs that can specifically target and eliminate CSCs. Recent
   identification of surface markers and understanding of molecular feature
   associated with CSC phenotype helped with the design of effective
   treatments. In this review we discuss targeting surface biomarkers,
   signaling pathways that regulate CSCs self-renewal and differentiation,
   drug-efflux pumps involved in apoptosis resistance, microenvironmental
   signals that sustain CSCs growth, manipulation of miRNA expression, and
   induction of CSCs apoptosis and differentiation, with specific aim to
   hamper CSCs regeneration and cancer relapse. Some of these agents are
   under evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies, most of them for
   using in combination with traditional therapies. The combined therapy
   using conventional anticancer drugs with CSCs-targeting agents, may
   offer a promising strategy for management and eradication of different
   types of cancers.}},

Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Biological systems are influenced by random processes at all scales,
   including molecular, demographic, and behavioral fluctuations, as well
   as by their interactions with a fluctuating environment. We previously
   established microbial closed ecosystems (CES) as model systems for
   studying the role of random events and the emergent statistical laws
   governing population dynamics. Here, we present long-term measurements
   of population dynamics using replicate digital holographic microscopes
   that maintain CES under precisely controlled external conditions while
   automatically measuring abundances of three microbial species via
   single-cell imaging. With this system, we measure spatiotemporal
   population dynamics in more than 60 replicate CES over periods of
   months. In contrast to previous studies, we observe strongly
   deterministic population dynamics in replicate systems. Furthermore, we
   show that previously discovered statistical structure in abundance
   fluctuations across replicate CES is driven by variation in external
   conditions, such as illumination. In particular, we confirm the
   existence of stable ecomodes governing the correlations in population
   abundances of three species. The observation of strongly deterministic
   dynamics, together with stable structure of correlations in response to
   external perturbations, points towards a possibility of simple
   macroscopic laws governing microbial systems despite numerous stochastic
   events present on microscopic levels.}},

Title = {{Transcription factor CREB3L1 mediates cAMP and glucocorticoid regulation
   of arginine vasopressin gene transcription in the rat hypothalamus}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BRAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide hormone that
   functions in the regulation of water homeostasis by controlling water
   re-absorption at kidneys, is synthesised in supraoptic nucleus and
   paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. An increase in plasma
   osmolality stimulates secretion of AVP to blood circulation and induces
   AVP synthesis in these nuclei. Although studies on mechanism of AVP
   transcriptional regulation in hypothalamus proposed that cAMP and
   glucocorticoids positively and negatively regulate Avp expression,
   respectively, the molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Recently,
   we identified CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element binding protein 3 like 1)
   as a putative transcription factor of Avp transcription in the rat
   hypothalamus. However the mechanism of how CREB3L1 is regulated in
   response of hyperosmotic stress in the neurons of hypothalamus has never
   been reported. This study aims to investigate effect of previously
   reported regulators (cAMP and glucocorticoid) of Avp transcription on
   transcription factor CREB3L1 in order to establish a molecular
   explanation for cAMP and glucocorticoids effect on AVP expression.
   Results: The effect of cAMP and glucocorticoid treatment on Creb3l1 was
   investigated in both AtT20 cells and hypothalamic organotypic cultures.
   The expression of Creb3l1 was increased in both mRNA and protein level
   by treatment with forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels.
   Activation of cAMP by forskolin also increased Avp promoter activity in
   AtT20 cells and this effect was blunted by shRNA mediated silencing of
   Creb3l1. The forskolin induced increase in Creb3l1 expression was
   diminished by combined treatment with dexamethasone, and, in vivo,
   intraperitoneal dexamethasone injection blunted the increase in Creb3l1
   and Avp expression induced by hyperosmotic stress.
   Conclusion: Here we shows that cAMP and glucocorticoid positively and
   negatively regulate Creb3l1 expression in the rat hypothalamus,
   respectively, and regulation of cAMP on AVP expression is mediated
   through CREB3L1. This data provides the connection between CREB3L1, a
   newly identified transcription factor of AVP expression, with the
   previously proposed mechanism of Avp transcription which extends our
   understanding in transcription regulation of Avp in the hypothalamus.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The Stark questionnaire measures health-related quality of
   life (QoL) using pictures almost exclusively. It is supplemented by a
   minimum of words. It comprises a mental and a physical health component.
   Methods: A German sample of n = 500 subjects, age and gender stratified,
   filled out the Stark Qol questionnaire along with various other
   questionnaires via internet.
   Results: The physical component shows good reliability (Cronbach's alpha
   = McDonalds Omega = greatest lower bound = .93), the mental component
   can be improved (Cronbach's alpha = .63, McDonalds Omega = .72, greatest
   lower bound = .77). Confirmatory factor analysis shows a good fit
   (Bentlers CFI = .97). Construct validity was proven.
   Conclusion: The Stark QoL is a promising new development in measuring
   QoL, it is a short and easy to apply questionnaire. Additionally, it is
   particularly promising for international research.}},

Title = {{Solving the Controversy on the Wetting Transparency of Graphene}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Since its discovery, the wetting transparency of graphene, the
   transmission of the substrate wetting property over graphene coating,
   has gained significant attention due to its versatility for potential
   applications. Yet, there have been debates on the interpretation and
   validity of the wetting transparency. Here, we present a theory taking
   two previously disregarded factors into account and elucidate the origin
   of the partial wetting transparency. We show that the liquid bulk
   modulus is crucial to accurately calculate the van der Waals
   interactions between the liquid and the surface, and that various
   wetting states on rough surfaces must be considered to understand a wide
   range of contact angle measurements that cannot be fitted with a theory
   considering the flat surface. In addition, we reveal that the wetting
   characteristic of the substrate almost vanishes when covered by any
   coating as thick as graphene double layers. Our findings reveal a more
   complete picture of the wetting transparency of graphene as well as
   other atomically thin coatings, and can be applied to study various
   surface engineering problems requiring wettability-tuning.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a frustrated Lewis pair consisting of sodium hydride

   treatment of zeoliteNaY loaded with Pt nanoparticles (Pt-x/NaY).
   Frustrated Lewis pair formation was confirmed using insitu neutron
   diffraction and spectroscopic measurements. The activity of the
   intrazeolite NaH as a size-selective catalyst was verified by the
   efficient esterification of acetaldehyde (a small aldehyde) to form the
   corresponding ester ethyl acetate, whereas esterification of the larger
   molecule benzaldehyde was unsuccessful. The frustrated Lewis pair
   (consisting of Na+H- and O(H+)) generated within zeoliteNaY may be a
   useful catalyst for various catalytic reactions which require both H-
   and H+ ions, such as catalytic hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of

Abstract = {{Background: Achieving durable local control while limiting normal tissue
   toxicity with definitive radiation therapy in the management of
   high-risk brain metastases remains a radiobiological challenge. The
   objective of this study was to examine the local control and toxicity of
   a 5-fraction stereotactic radiosurgical approach for treatment of
   patients with inoperable single high-risk NSCLC brain metastases.
   Methods: This retrospective analysis examines 20 patients who were
   deemed to have ``high-risk{''} brain metastases. High-risk tumors were
   defined as those with a maximum diameter greater than 2 cm and/or those
   located within an eloquent cortex. Patients were evaluated by a
   neurosurgeon prior to treatment and determined to be inoperable due to
   tumor or patient characteristics. Patients were treated using the
   CyberKnife (R) SRS system in 5 fractions to a total dose of 30 Gy, 35
   Gy, or 40 Gy.
   Results: Twenty patients with a median age of 65.5 years were treated
   from April 2010 to August 2014 in 5 fractions to a median total dose of
   35 Gy. At a median follow up of 11.3 months local tumor control was
   observed in 18 of 20 metastases (90 \%). Both local failures were
   observed in patients receiving a lower dose of 30 Gy. Median
   pre-treatment dexamethasone dose was 10 mg/day and median post-treatment
   nadir dose was 0 mg/day. Salvage intracranial therapy was required in 45
   \% of patients. Symptomatic radionecrosis was observed in 4 of 20
   patients (20 \%), two of which were treated to 40 Gy and the remainder
   to 35 Gy. Kaplan-Meier 1-year, 2-year, and median survival were
   calculated to be 45 \%, 20 \%, and 13.2 months, respectively.
   Conclusions: Five-fraction SRS to a total dose of 35 Gy appears to be a
   safe and effective management strategy for single high-risk NSCLC brain
   metastases, while a total dose of 40 Gy leads to an excess risk of
   neurotoxicity.}},

   conditions and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder
   X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy,
   thermogravimetric analysis, and nonlinear optical determination. They
   were classified as two types: Compounds 1-4 contain intersecting
   channels and exhibit various 4-connected nets built by AlO4 tetrahedra
   and oxo boron clusters, zinc-amine complexes act as the templates (1-3)
   or directly bond to the walls of the ABO (4); compound 5 exhibits a
   double-layer structure made by nanosized {[}BO2(OH)]Zn@{[}B12O21(OH)(3)]
   (\{BZn@B-12\}) clusters with Al2O7 dimers, the channels are within the
   layer. The second harmonic generation (SHG) measurement shows that the
   SHG responses of 1-3 are about 2.5, 1.6, and 0.5 times that of KH2PO4.
   Compounds 1-2 are typeI phase-matchable materials. UV/Vis spectroscopy
   indicates that compounds 1-5 are wide-band-gap semiconductors.}},

Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Knowing yield potential and yield stability of sugarcane cultivars is of
   significance in guiding sugarcane breeding and rationalising regional
   distribution of sugarcane cultivars. In the present study, a
   heritability-adjusted genotype main effect plus genotype x environment
   (HA-GGE) biplot program was used to analyze the cane and sucrose yields
   of 44 newly released sugarcane cultivars at eight pilot test sites. The
   cane and sucrose yields of nine cultivars were higher than those of the
   control cultivar ROC22. From the perspective of cane yield, cultivars FN
   40 and YZ 06-407 were well adapted to a wider range of conditions and
   produced relatively high cane yields in several pilot sites. From the
   perspective of sucrose yield, cultivars LC 03-1137, FN 38, FN 41, MT
   01-77 and LC 05-136 were well adapted to a wide range of conditions and
   produced relatively high sucrose yields. Based on these results, three
   high yielding and widely adapted cultivars, namely, FN 39, LC 05-136,
   and YZ 05-51 were recommended for production in three major Chinese
   sugarcane planting areas. The results will provide a theoretical basis
   for recommending the effective use and rational regional distribution of
   sugarcane cultivars in China.}},

Title = {{Cryptic relatedness in epidemiologic collections accessed for genetic
   association studies: experiences from the Epidemiologic Architecture for
   Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) study and the National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Epidemiologic collections have been a major resource for
   genotype-phenotype studies of complex disease given their large sample
   size, racial/ethnic diversity, and breadth and depth of phenotypes,
   traits, and exposures. A major disadvantage of these collections is they
   often survey households and communities without collecting extensive
   pedigree data. Failure to account for substantial relatedness can lead
   to inflated estimates and spurious associations. To examine the extent
   of cryptic relatedness in an epidemiologic collection, we as the
   Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) study
   accessed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
   linked to DNA samples ({''}Genetic NHANES{''}) from NHANES III and
   NHANES 1999-2002. NHANES are population-based cross-sectional surveys
   conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention. Genome-wide genetic data is not yet
   available in NHANES, and current data use agreements prohibit the
   generation of GWAS-level data in NHANES samples due issues in
   maintaining confidentiality among other ethical concerns. To date, only
   hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in a
   variety of candidate genes are available for analysis in NHANES. We
   performed identity-by-descent (IBD) estimates in three self identified
   subpopulations of Genetic NHANES (non Hispanic white, non Hispanic
   black, and Mexican American) using PLINK software to identify potential
   familial relationships from presumed unrelated subjects. We then
   compared the PLINK-identified relationships to those identified by an
   alternative method implemented in Kinship based /Nference for
   Genome-wide association studies (KING). Overall, both methods identified
   familial relationships in NHANES III and NHANES 1999-2002 for all three
   subpopulations, but little concordance was observed between the two
   methods due in major part to the limited SNP data available in Genetic
   NHANES. Despite the lack of genome-wide data, our results suggest the
   presence of cryptic relatedness in this epidemiologic collection and
   highlight the limitations of restricted datasets such as NHANES in the
   context of modern day genetic epidemiology studies.}},

Title = {{Homocysteine levels in women with a history of gestational diabetes
   mellitus}},
Journal = {{DIABETOLOGY \& METABOLIC SYNDROME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous gestational diabetes (pGDM) is a risk factor of
   type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Homocysteine
   is one of markers of cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to
   assess the homocysteine levels in women with pGDM and to evaluate its
   relationship with current carbohydrate metabolism and nourishment
   status.
   Methods: The study group comprised 199 women at 7.8 +/- 1.0 years after
   pGDM and 50 control women in whom pGDM was excluded. The analyzed
   parameters: BMI, WHR, body composition (Tanita SC-330S analyzer),
   glucose and insulin levels in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT),
   insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), HbA1c, lipid profile, homocysteine,
   creatinine and creatinine clearance. The Mann-Whitney test and
   Chi-squared test were used for comparison of continuous and nominal
   variables, respectively. Correlations between continuous variables in
   each group were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
   (Rs). A logarithmic transformation was applied for variables with
   non-normal distribution.
   Results: There were no differences between the pGDM women and controls
   in terms of age, number of childbirths, time from indexed pregnancy,
   pre-pregnancy BMI, or current anthropometric parameters. In pGDM women
   HbA1c and all glucose levels in OGTT were significantly higher, but
   still within the normal range. No significant differences were found in
   homocysteine levels, HOMA-IR, blood lipids, creatinine and creatinine
   clearance. Homocysteine levels did not differ significantly in subgroups
   categorized according to the current OGTT results or BMI. Carbohydrate
   metabolism disorders, overweight and obesity were associated with higher
   creatinine clearance. Positive correlation between homocysteine and
   creatinine (r = 0.21, p < 0.004), and a negative correlation with
   creatinine clearance (r = -0.16, p < 0.03) were found.
   Conclusions: In women with pGDM, homocysteine is not a marker of glucose
   tolerance disturbances and cardiovascular risk. Increased glomerular
   filtration rate, observed in more severe disorders of carbohydrate
   metabolism and greater BMI, may temporarily protect against an increase
   of proatherogenic homocysteine.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental to integrated photonic quantum computing is an on-chip
   method for routing and modulating quantum light emission. We demonstrate
   a hybrid integration platform consisting of arbitrarily designed

   embedded in GaAs are bonded to a SiON waveguide chip such that the QD
   emission is coupled to the waveguide mode. The waveguides are SiON core
   embedded in a SiO2 cladding. A tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometer
   (MZI) modulates the emission between two output ports and can act as a
   path-encoded qubit preparation device. The single-photon nature of the
   emission was verified using the on-chip MZI as a beamsplitter in a

Abstract = {{We studied the feeding ecology of Eutropis multifasciata in the tropical
   plains of central Vietnam to understand better the foraging mode,
   spatiotemporal and sexual variation in dietary composition, and
   rarefaction curves of prey-taxon richness for males and females. Stomach
   contents (n=161) were collected from October 2013 to May 2014 using a
   nonlethal stomach-flushing technique. A total of 680 food items (624
   animal items and 56 plant items) was found in 161 stomachs of skinks,
   representing 19 unique animal categories. We found that the diet of E.
   multifasciata is composed mainly of small, sedentary and clumped prey
   and that this skink specialises on spiders, insect larvae, snails,
   grasshoppers and crickets (with a combined importance index of 60\%).
   Dietary composition, prey size and total prey volume in E. multifasciata
   changed between dry and rainy seasons and among regions. The total
   volume of food items consumed by males was larger than that of females,
   and the diversity and evenness index of prey categories were larger in
   males than in females. However, using rarefaction curves revealed that
   females have the higher prey-taxon richness after points between 130 and
   140 prey items for frequency, and between 160 and 170 prey items for
   number of items, and the differences were not statistically significant.
   The foraging behaviour of E. multifasciata best fits a `widely foraging'
   model.}},

Title = {{Molecular analysis of the CHST6 gene in Korean patients with macular
   corneal dystrophy: Identification of three novel mutations}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify the underlying genetic defect in Korean patients
   with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD).
   Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of
   seven patients from six unrelated families with MCD (three men and four
   women). Polymerase chain reaction was performed for coding regions of
   the carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CHST6), gene followed by
   bidirectional sequencing. Targeted mutational analysis (exons 4, 11-12,
   14) of the transforming growth factor, beta-induced (TGFBI) gene was
   performed for all patients.
   Results: All seven patients were found to have compound heterozygous
   mutations in the CHST6 gene. In addition to six previously reported
   mutations, c.95C>A (p. Ser32{*}), c.521A>G (p.Lys174Arg), c.557C>G (p.
   Pro186Arg), c.613C>T (p.Arg205Trp), c.820G>A (p.Glu274Lys), and
   c.1072T>C (p.Tyr358His), three novel mutations were identified in this
   study, including two missense mutations, c.353C>T (p.Ser118Phe) and
   c.922C>T (p. His308Tyr), and one frameshift mutation, c.786delC
   (p.L264Cfs{*}117). Among the three novel mutations, only the c.353C>T
   mutation had been reported in the Exon Aggregation Consortium database
   at an extremely low frequency of 0.00005072. In addition, these three
   novel mutations were absent from controls in 1,000 genomes, dbSNP, and
   the TIARA genome database, which is a Korean personal genome database.
   The most frequent mutation was c.613C>T (p.Arg205Trp), revealed in four
   unrelated Korean families, which has not previously been reported in
   other populations. No mutations were detected in the TGFBI gene.
   Discussion: This is the first report on genetic analysis of Korean MCD
   patients. Three novel and six previously reported disease-causing CHST6
   mutations were identified, which expands the mutational spectrum of MCD.}},

Title = {{Use of ordinal information by fish}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Mammals and birds can process ordinal numerical information which can be
   used, for instance, for recognising an object on the basis of its
   position in a sequence of similar objects. Recent studies have shown
   that teleost fish possess numerical abilities comparable to those of
   other vertebrates, but it is unknown if they can also learn ordinal
   numerical relations. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) learned to recognise
   the 3rd feeder in a row of 8 identical ones even when inter-feeder
   distance and feeder positions were varied among trials to prevent the
   use of any spatial information. To assess whether guppies spontaneously
   use ordinal or spatial information when both are simultaneously
   available, fish were then trained with constant feeder positions and
   inter-feeder distance. In probe trials where these two sources of
   information were contrasted, the subjects selected the correct ordinal
   position significantly more often than the original spatial position,
   indicating that the former was preferentially encoded during training.
   Finally, a comparison between subjects trained on the 3rd and the 5th
   position revealed that guppies can also learn the latter discrimination,
   but the larger error rate observed in this case suggests that 5 is close
   to the upper limit of discrimination in guppies.}},

Title = {{A large and diverse collection of bovine genome sequences from the
   Canadian Cattle Genome Project}},
Journal = {{GIGASCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Canadian Cattle Genome Project is a large-scale
   international project that aims to develop genomics-based tools to
   enhance the efficiency and sustainability of beef and dairy production.
   Obtaining DNA sequence information is an important part of achieving
   this goal as it facilitates efforts to associate specific DNA
   differences with phenotypic variation. These associations can be used to
   guide breeding decisions and provide valuable insight into the molecular
   basis of traits.
   Findings: We describe a dataset of 379 whole-genome sequences, taken
   primarily from key historic Bos taurus animals, along with the analyses
   that were performed to assess data quality. The sequenced animals
   represent ten populations relevant to beef or dairy production. Animal
   information (name, breed, population), sequence data metrics (mapping
   rate, depth, concordance), and sequence repository identifiers (NCBI
   BioProject and BioSample IDs) are provided to enable others to access
   and exploit this sequence information.
   Conclusions: The large number of whole-genome sequences generated as a
   result of this project will contribute to ongoing work aiming to
   catalogue the variation that exists in cattle as well as efforts to
   improve traits through genotype-guided selection. Studies of gene
   function, population structure, and sequence evolution are also likely
   to benefit from the availability of this resource.}},

Title = {{Ultrafast relaxation rates and reversal time in disordered ferrimagnets}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{In response to ultrafast laser pulses, single-phase metals have been
   classified as ``fast{''} (with magnetization quenching on the time scale
   of the order of 100 fs and recovery in the time scale of several
   picoseconds and below) and ``slow{''} (with longer characteristic time
   scales). Disordered ferrimagnetic alloys consisting of a combination of
   ``fast{''} transition (TM) and ``slow{''} rare-earth (RE) metals have
   been shown to exhibit an ultrafast all-optical switching mediated by the
   heat mechanism. The behavior of the characteristic time scales of
   coupled alloys is more complicated and is influenced by many parameters
   such as the intersublattice exchange, doping (RE) concentration, and the
   temperature. Here, the longitudinal relaxation times of each sublattice
   are analyzed within the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch framework. We show that
   for moderate intersublattice coupling strength both materials slow down
   as a function of slow (RE) material concentration. For larger coupling,
   the fast (TM) material may become faster, while the slow (RE) one is
   still slower. These conclusions may have important implications in the
   switching time of disordered ferrimagnets such as GdFeCo with partial
   clustering. Using atomistic modeling, we show that in the moderately
   coupled case, the reversal would start in the Gd-rich region, while the
   situation may be reversed if the coupling strength is larger.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of gaseous plasma elements into a microwave photonic
   crystal band gap cavity structure allows for active tuning of the

   resonator is simulated and characterized through finite difference time
   domain methods. A gaseous plasma element is integrated into the cavity
   structure and the effect of plasma density on the transmission
   properties of the structure is investigated. We show, through both
   simulations and experiments, that the permittivity of the plasma can be
   adjusted to shift the peak resonance to allow for both switching and
   tunability of transmission. The experimentally measured peak shifts in
   transmission are compared to those simulated and the electron density of
   the gaseous plasma element is calculated and compared to values
   determined from the measured discharge current density. (C) 2015 AIP

   confined photo-catalytic oxidation method, we successfully demonstrate
   full polymer filed-effect transistors fabricated through four-step
   spin-coating process on a flexible polymer substrate. The approach shows
   negligible etching effect on polymeric film. Even more, the insulating
   property of polymeric dielectric is not affected by the method, which is
   vital for polymer electronics. Finally, the self-aligned full polymer
   field-effect transistors on the flexible polymeric substrate are
   fabricated, showing good electrical properties and mechanical
   flexibility under bending tests.}},

Abstract = {{Radial migration of pyramidal neurons is an important event during the
   development of cerebral cortex. Neurons experience series of
   morphological and directional transitions to get to their final laminar
   positions. Here we report that the histone methyltransferase enhancer of
   zest homolog 2 (Ezh2) is involved in the regulation of cortical radial
   migration. We show that Ezh2 knockdown leads to disturbed neuronal
   orientation, which results in the impairment of radial migration.
   Further results reveal that this migration deficiency may be due to the
   derepression of Reelin transcription in the migrating neurons. Our study
   provides evidence that epigenetic regulation of Reelin by Ezh2 maintains
   appropriate Reelin expression pattern to fulfill proper orientation of
   migrating neurons.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine an effective completion point of
   the simultaneous removal of NH4+-N and Mn2+, using a biological aerated
   filter (BAF). The simultaneous removal was performed and monitored under
   two operation modes: i.e., batch and continuous. Each mode was operated
   by supplying continuous aeration for 7.5 h and intermittent aeration for
   6 h. The results showed a higher performance of the simultaneous removal
   of NH4+-N and Mn2+ for the batch with full operation of aeration. The
   effective curves were detected for dissolved oxygen (DO),
   oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH profiles, correlating with
   the complete simultaneous removal of NH4+-N and Mn2+. By recognising the
   curves, the complete simultaneous NH4+-N and Mn2+ removal can be
   predicted effectively, affecting a reduction in human capital and
   operating costs. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and

Abstract = {{Large deformations and discontinuous problems can be calculated using
   the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method by solving time
   steps, and this method is suitable for simulating the seismic dynamic
   response of engineering rock mass structures. However, the boundary
   setting must be carefully analyzed. In this paper, four boundary
   settings for the DDA method are investigated. First, the contributions
   to the DDA equations for nonreflecting boundaries (including the viscous
   boundary and the viscoelastic boundary) are deduced based on the Newmark
   method. Second, a free-field boundary is introduced in the DDA method
   with boundary grid generation and coupling calculation algorithms to
   accurately simulate external source wave motion, such as earthquakes.
   Third, seismic input boundary treatments are intensively examined, and
   the force input method is introduced based on nonreflecting boundaries.
   Finally, the static-dynamic unified boundary is implemented to ensure
   consistent boundary transformation. The boundary setting method in the
   DDA method is discussed, and the suggested treatments are used to
   analyze the seismic dynamic response of underground caverns. Copyright

Abstract = {{Efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes is crucial
   for improving the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor
   photocatalysts. In the present study, we show surface heterojunction is
   existed on anatase TiO2 with exposed \{101\}, \{010\}, \{001\}, and
   \{110\} facets. With the help of selective Pt deposition, it is found
   the Schottky junction together with proper surface heterojunction is
   helpful to separate the photo-generated electrons and holes. Moreover,
   the photo-reduction and photo-oxidation activities of the facets are
   depended on the reaction systems, resulting in self-adjusted surface
   heterojunction. The as-prepared photocatalyst will give the highest
   phenol degradation efficiency when Pt nanoparticles are only deposited
   on the \{101\} and \{010\} facets. In contrast, more Pt deposited on the
   \{001\} and \{110\} facets will decrease the photocatalytic activity.
   The average phenol degradation rate, which will gradually reduce along
   with the increased phenol concentration, of TiO2 ( 20 mg) is ca. 1.59
   mg/min when its concentration is lower than 8 mg/L. However, similar
   results have not been observed in P25-based reaction systems, evidencing
   the great influence of self-adjusted surface heterojunction. This study
   may be helpful to understand the photocatalytic mechanisms of
   semiconductor photocatalysts with exposed different facets. Thus more
   efficient practical application of the photocatalysts for environment
   protection can be reached. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a trivalent conversion coating on aluminium has been
   investigated using analytical electron microscopy, atomic force
   microscopy, ion beam analysis, glow discharge optical emission
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   The coating is shown to comprise a chromium- and zirconium-rich outer
   layer and an aluminium-rich inner layer. Zirconium and chromium are
   present in chemical states consistent with ZrO2, ZrF4, Cr(OH)(3),
   Cr-2(SO4)(3), CrF3 and CrO3 or CrO42-. However, negligible amounts of
   Cr(VI) species occurred in coatings formed in de-aerated solution.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the inner layer
   provides the main corrosion protection during short-term tests in 0.1 M
   sodium sulphate solution at room temperature. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{Effectiveness of motivational interviewing in patients with
   dyslipidemia: a randomized cluster trial}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is known that making people change their habits is
   challenging. It is crucial to identify the most effective approach that
   general practitioners (GPs) should use to help their patients change
   unhealthy habits. The objective this study was to assess the efficacy of
   a multifactorial intervention based on Motivational Interviewing
   performed by general practitioners to enhance lipid levels in patients
   with dyslipidemia, as compared to standard care.
   Methods: A multicenter, controlled, randomized, cluster, two-parallel
   arm trial with a 12-month follow-up conducted in 25 community health
   centers of the Spanish. 38 GPs and 227 primary care patients with
   uncontrolled dyslipidemia were included in the trial. GPs performed an
   intervention based either on Motivational Interviewing (MI) or standard
   practice. Lipid levels were measured, and the control degree was
   analyzed based on the criteria of clinical guidelines.
   Results: 107 were assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) and 120 to the
   Control Group (CG). An overall improvement was achieved in total
   cholesterol levels (Mean Difference -MD- = -19.60; 95 \% CI: -15.33 at
   -23.87 mg/dl; p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol levels (MD = -13.78; 95 \% CI:
   -9.77 at -17.79 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MD = -19.14; CI 95
   \%: -11.29 at -26.99 mg/dl; p < 0.001). No differences were found
   between the two groups. However, when we assessed the degree of lipid
   control by combining cholesterol < 200 mg/dl and LDL-cholesterol < 130
   mg/dl parameters, it was observed that a higher percentage of patients
   achieved target figures in the EG versus CG (13.1 \% vs. 5.0 \%;
   adjusted OR = 5.77, 95 \% CI: 1.67-19.91).
   Conclusion: A Motivational Interviewing-based approach conducted by
   Primary Care physicians aimed at patients with dyslipidemia, achieved a
   significant reduction in all lipid parameters, cardiovascular risk,
   weight reduction and the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, similar to
   that obtained with the usual intervention and superior in the proportion
   of patients achieving combined lipid control goals and the level of
   physical exercise.}},

Title = {{Impact of library preparation protocols and template quantity on the
   metagenomic reconstruction of a mock microbial community}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The rapid development of sequencing technologies has
   provided access to environments that were either once thought
   inhospitable to life altogether or that contain too few cells to be
   analyzed using genomics approaches. While 16S rRNA gene microbial
   community sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of community
   composition and diversity over time and space, it only provides a crude
   estimate of microbial functional and metabolic potential. Alternatively,
   shotgun metagenomics allows comprehensive sampling of all genetic
   material in an environment, without any underlying primer biases. Until
   recently, one of the major bottlenecks of shotgun metagenomics has been
   the requirement for large initial DNA template quantities during library
   preparation.
   Results: Here, we investigate the effects of varying template
   concentrations across three low biomass library preparation protocols on
   their ability to accurately reconstruct a mock microbial community of
   known composition. We analyze the effects of input DNA quantity and
   library preparation method on library insert size, GC content, community
   composition, assembly quality and metagenomic binning. We found that
   library preparation method and the amount of starting material had
   significant impacts on the mock community metagenomes. In particular, GC
   content shifted towards more GC rich sequences at the lower input
   quantities regardless of library prep method, the number of low quality
   reads that could not be mapped to the reference genomes increased with
   decreasing input quantities, and the different library preparation
   methods had an impact on overall metagenomic community composition.
   Conclusions: This benchmark study provides recommendations for library
   creation of representative and minimally biased metagenome shotgun
   sequencing, enabling insights into functional attributes of low biomass
   ecosystem microbial communities.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{314}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Reduction of fire hazard is becoming increasingly important in managed
   landscapes globally. Fuels reduction prescribed burn treatments are the
   most common form of reducing fire hazard on landscapes around the world
   but often result in homogenized fuel age structures and habitats.
   Alternatively, the size of unplanned fires, and hence fire hazard, can
   be reduced by controlling the size and patterning of fuels treatments in
   a patch mosaic arrangement on landscapes. Patch mosaic burning is being
   implemented globally as a means to increase heterogeneity to mimic
   natural fire regime results. Funding for prescribed fire programs is
   often justified primarily on hazardous fuels reduction with secondary
   consideration given for ecological effectiveness, which can be increased
   by particular fire mosaic patterns in some systems. The question we
   address is: Which of two prescribed fire treatment regimes, fuels
   reduction or patch mosaic burning, reduces fire hazard most effectively?
   We address the question using computer simulation modeling on synthetic
   landscapes representing both fire regime treatments. Treatment scale was
   important. Among fuel reduction treatments, large blocks burned less
   area than small blocks. For the mosaic treatments, small blocks reduced
   fire size the most (out of all treatments) and had the least variance in
   area burned. It is possible to reduce fire hazard and to provide
   heterogeneous age fuels structure on the landscape, simultaneously
   benefiting humans and many native fire-dependent species requiring
   mosaic habitat patterns. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: As a result of the various telemedicine projects in the past
   years a large number of studies were recently published in this field.
   However, a precise bibliometric analysis of telemedicine publications
   does not exist so far.
   Methods: The present study was conducted to establish a data base of the
   existing approaches. Density-equalizing algorithms were used and data
   was retrieved from the Thomson Reuters database Web of Science.
   Results: During the period from 1900 to 2006 a number of 3290 filed
   items were connected to telemedicine, with the first being published in
   1964. The studies originate from 101 countries, with the USA, Great
   Britain and Canada being the most productive suppliers participating in
   56.08 \% of all published items. Analyzing the average citation per item
   for countries with more than 10 publications, Ireland ranked first
   (10.19/item), New Zealand ranked second (9.5/item) followed by Finland
   (9.04/item). The citation rate can be assumed as an indicator for
   research quality. The ten most productive journals include three
   journals with the main focus telemedicine and another five with the main
   focus ``Information/Informatics{''}. In all subject categories examined
   for published items related to telemedicine, ``Health Care Sciences \&
   Services{''} ranked first by far. More than 36 \% of all publications
   are assigned to this category, followed by ``Medical Informatics{''}
   with 9.72 \% and ``Medicine, General \& Internal{''} with 8.84 \% of all
   publications.
   Conclusion: In summary it can be concluded that the data shows clearly a
   strong increase in research productivity. Using science citation
   analysis it can be assumed that there is a large rise in the interest in
   telemedicine studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: African trypanosomiasis, also known as ``sleeping
   sickness{''} in humans and ``nagana{''} in livestock is an important
   vector-borne disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Control of trypanosomiasis
   has focused on eliminating the vector, the tsetse fly (Glossina, spp.).
   Effective tsetse fly control planning requires models to predict tsetse
   population and distribution changes over time and space. Traditional
   planning models have used statistical tools to predict tsetse
   distributions and have been hindered by limited field survey data.
   Methodology/results: We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to provide
   timing and location information for tsetse fly control without
   presence/absence training data. The model is driven by daily
   remotely-sensed environment data. The model provides a flexible tool
   linking environmental changes with individual biology to analyze tsetse
   control methods such as aerial insecticide spraying, wild animal
   control, releasing irradiated sterile tsetse males, and land use and
   cover modification.
   Significance: This is a bottom-up process-based model with freely
   available data as inputs that can be easily transferred to a new area.
   The tsetse population simulation more closely approximates real
   conditions than those using traditional statistical models making it a
   useful tool in tsetse fly control planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{MicroRNA circulating in the early aftermath of motor vehicle collision
   predict persistent pain development and suggest a role for microRNA in
   sex-specific pain differences}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Background: Molecular mediators influencing the transition from acute to
   persistent musculoskeletal pain following common stress exposures such
   as motor vehicle collision (MVC) remain poorly understood. In this
   exploratory, proof of concept study, we compared circulating microRNA
   (miRNA) expression profiles in the early aftermath of MVC among
   individuals who did and did not subsequently develop persistent pain.
   Blood RNA samples were obtained from African American individuals (n =
   53) who presented to the emergency department after MVC and were
   discharged to home after evaluation. The presence or absence of severe
   pain in the axial region, the most common and morbid region in which
   post-MVC pain occurs, was assessed 6 weeks following MVC via
   standardized questionnaire. miRNA expression was determined using
   miRNA-sequencing; nonparametric analyses were used to compare miRNA
   expression levels among individuals with and without persistent pain.
   Results: Thirty-two mature miRNA were differentially expressed (p <
   0.05) in those with and without severe axial pain at 6 weeks.
   miR-135a-5p, a regulator of the serotonin receptor that is known to be
   stress-responsive, differed most significantly between groups (p = 3 x
   10(-4)). This miRNA, and miR-3613-3p (p = 0.001) survived correction for
   multiple testing (FDR = 0.15) in this small sample. Interestingly,
   differentially expressed miRNA were enriched for X chromosome location.
   In secondary analyses, the eight X chromosome miRNA were (a) more
   significantly associated with axial pain in women than men, (b)
   expressed more highly in the peripheral blood of women than men, and (c)
   predicted in pathway analyses (DIANA miRPath v 2.0) to regulate neuronal
   and neuroendocrine pathways previously implicated in various pain
   pathologies.
   Conclusions: These results show that circulating miRNA predict
   persistent severe axial pain after MVC and suggest that they may be
   involved in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic musculoskeletal pain.
   However, further studies are needed to determine if these miRNA play a
   direct causal role.}},

Title = {{Target prediction utilising negative bioactivity data covering large
   chemical space}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: In silico analyses are increasingly being used to support
   mode-of-action investigations; however many such approaches do not
   utilise the large amounts of inactive data held in chemogenomic
   repositories. The objective of this work is concerned with the
   integration of such bioactivity data in the target prediction of orphan
   compounds to produce the probability of activity and inactivity for a
   range of targets. To this end, a novel human bioactivity data set was
   constructed through the assimilation of over 195 million bioactivity
   data points deposited in the ChEMBL and PubChem repositories, and the
   subsequent application of a sphere-exclusion selection algorithm to
   oversample presumed inactive compounds.
   Results: A Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm was trained using the data
   and evaluated using fivefold cross-validation, achieving a mean recall
   and precision of 67.7 and 63.8 \% for active compounds and 99.6 and 99.7
   \% for inactive compounds, respectively. We show the performances of the
   models are considerably influenced by the underlying intraclass training
   similarity, the size of a given class of compounds, and the degree of
   additional oversampling. The method was also validated using compounds
   extracted from WOMBAT producing average precision-recall AUC and BEDROC
   scores of 0.56 and 0.85, respectively. Inactive data points used for
   this test are based on presumed inactivity, producing an approximated
   indication of the true extrapolative ability of the models. A
   distance-based applicability domain analysis was also conducted;
   indicating an average Tanimoto Coefficient distance of 0.3 or greater
   between a test and training set can be used to give a global measure of
   confidence in model predictions. A final comparison to a method trained
   solely on active data from ChEMBL performed with precision-recall AUC
   and BEDROC scores of 0.45 and 0.76.
   Conclusions: The inclusion of inactive data for model training produces
   models with superior AUC and improved early recognition capabilities,
   although the results from internal and external validation of the models
   show differing performance between the breadth of models. The realised
   target prediction protocol is available at

Title = {{Test-enhanced learning: analysis of an experience with undergraduate
   nursing students}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study is based on the evidence that tests can be used
   as an educational tool to enhance learning, not just as an evaluation
   tool. There is a growing body of research that shows that participating
   in repeated testing improves learning, a phenomenon defined as
   Test-Enhanced Learning. The aim of the present study was to analyse the
   effect of the use of a test enhanced learning program integrated into a
   general psychology course for undergraduate nursing students and its
   interaction with the students' test anxiety.
   Methods: 161 undergraduate nursing students attending a General
   Psychology course followed an educational program based on Test-Enhanced
   Learning methodology. Students were divided into two groups, an
   experimental group (TEL group) and a control group (Re-study group). TEL
   students took a multiple-choice test on the lecture topics. The Re-study
   group just read study material. Testing and re-study occurred at
   intervals of about a week after each lesson. TEL students received
   feedback immediately after each test. About two weeks after the end of
   the lessons, all the students took a final cumulative test on all the
   topics. Statistical analysis was used to analyse students' performances.
   After the administration of the cumulative unit test, all the students
   took a graded examination.
   Results: Students in the TEL group performed better than the controls,
   both in the final cumulative test and in a graded examination. TEL
   participants experienced better final cumulative test results than
   students not tested (M-TEL = 23.11, MRe-study = 20.47, t(109.86) =
   -2.57, p < 0.05, r = 0.24). Test-Enhanced Learning program participation
   has a positive impact on exam performance (beta(G\_Step1) = 0.46, p <
   0.001). Finally, the analysis performed shows a slight moderating effect
   of test anxiety on Test-Enhanced Learning (beta(GxTA\_Step3) = 0.15, p <
   0.05). Discussion and
   Conclusions: Test-Enhanced Learning can be an effective tool for
   promoting and enhancing learning. In fact, taking tests after studying
   produced better long-term retention and then better final test
   performance than re-reading without testing.
   Both students in the TEL group and the Re-study group with a high test
   anxiety level perform less well than colleagues with lower test anxiety.
   Nevertheless, students with higher test anxiety may obtain more benefits
   from participating in a Test-Enhanced Learning process than people with
   lower test anxiety.
   Further studies on larger and more representative samples are necessary
   in order to investigate the effect of test anxiety on Test-Enhanced
   Learning.}},

Title = {{Understanding the experiences and needs of individuals with Spinal
   Muscular Atrophy and their parents: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The clinical features of SMA, which range along a spectrum
   of severity, are relatively well described. In contrast, the literature
   on how individuals with SMA and their families experience this condition
   is limited. To address this gap, we undertook a qualitative study with
   individuals affected by SMA Types I, II and III, parents of those
   affected, and clinicians.
   Methods: We completed 16 focus group sessions and 37 interviews in the
   US with 96 participants including: 21 with individuals with SMA; 64
   parents of individuals affected by SMA; and 11 clinicians who specialize
   in the care of SMA patients.
   Results: The Diagnostic Journey: Families reported substantial
   diagnostic delays owing to: 1) lack of awareness and knowledge about
   SMA; 2) the difficulty of distinguishing normal from abnormal
   development; and 3) the challenge of differential diagnosis. Lack of
   sensitivity in how clinicians communicated this potentially devastating
   diagnosis compounded parents' negative impressions.
   Newborn Screening: Parents generally held positive views about adding
   SMA to newborn screening panels. For example, it would: 1) enable
   earlier access to care; 2) shorten the diagnostic journey; and 3) give
   families more time to prepare to care for a disabled child. Some noted
   negative outcomes such as prematurely affecting a parent's relationship
   with a child before symptoms are evident.
   The Psychosocial Impact of Living with SMA: Ten thematic areas
   characterized the impact: 1) confronting premature death; 2) making
   difficult treatment choices; 3) fearing the loss of functional ability;
   4) coming to terms with lost expectations; 5) loss of sleep and stress;
   6) stigma; 7) limitations on social activities; 8) independence; 9)
   uncertainty and helplessness; and 10) family finances.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest high levels of burden
   experienced by individuals with SMA and their families. The difficulties
   of living with SMA begin with the long and often arduous process of
   finding a diagnosis for their child. Newborn screening for SMA is seen
   as an important step toward shortening this journey. The psychosocial
   effects of coping with SMA are substantial and wide ranging both for the
   individual living with this condition and family members of affected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{White-nose syndrome (WNS) was first detected in North American bats in
   New York in 2006. Since that time WNS has spread throughout the
   northeastern United States, southeastern Canada, and southwest across
   Pennsylvania and as far west as Missouri. Suspect WNS cases have been
   identified in Minnesota and Iowa, and the causative agent of WNS
   (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) has recently been detected in
   Mississippi. The impact of WNS is devastating for little brown bats
   (Myotis lucifugus), causing up to 100\% mortality in some overwintering
   populations, and previous research has forecast the extirpation of the
   species due to the disease. Recent evidence indicates that remnant
   populations may persist in areas where WNS is endemic. We developed a
   spatially explicit model of little brown bat population dynamics to
   investigate the potential for populations to recover under alternative
   scenarios. We used these models to investigate how starting population
   sizes, potential changes in the number of bats overwintering
   successfully in hibernacula, and potential changes in demographic rates
   of the population post WNS may influence the ability of the bats to
   recover to former levels of abundance. We found that populations of the
   little brown bat and other species that are highly susceptible to WNS
   are unlikely to return to pre-WNS levels in the near future under any of
   the scenarios we examined. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{If X and Y are independent, Y and Z are independent, and so are X and Z,
   one might be tempted to conclude that X, Y, and Z are independent. But
   it has long been known in classical probability theory that, intuitive
   as it may seem, this is not true in general. In quantum mechanics one
   can ask whether analogous statistics can emerge for configurations of
   particles in certain types of entangled states. The explicit
   construction of such states, along with the specification of suitable
   sets of observables that have the purported statistical properties, is
   not entirely straightforward. We show that an example of such a
   configuration arises in the case of an N-particle GHZ state, and we are
   able to identify a family of observables with the property that the
   associated measurement outcomes are independent for any choice of 2, 3,
   ..., N - 1 of the particles, even though the measurement outcomes for
   all N particles are not independent. Although such states are highly
   entangled, the entanglement turns out to be `fragile', i.e. the
   associated density matrix has the property that if one traces out the
   freedom associated with even a single particle, the resulting reduced
   density matrix is separable.}},

Abstract = {{Disclosing the origin of convolutions in the mammalian brain remains a
   scientific challenge. Primary folds form before we are born: they are
   static, well defined and highly preserved across individuals. Secondary
   folds occur and disappear throughout our entire lifetime: they are
   dynamic, irregular and highly variable among individuals. While
   extensive research has improved our understanding of primary folding in
   the mammalian brain, secondary folding remains understudied and poorly
   understood. Here, we show that secondary instabilities can explain the
   increasing complexity of our brain surface as we age. Using the
   nonlinear field theories of mechanics supplemented by the theory of
   finite growth, we explore the critical conditions for secondary
   instabilities. We show that with continuing growth, our brain surface
   continues to bifurcate into increasingly complex morphologies. Our
   results suggest that even small geometric variations can have a
   significant impact on surface morphogenesis. Secondary bifurcations, and
   with them morphological changes during childhood and adolescence, are
   closely associated with the formation and loss of neuronal connections.
   Understanding the correlation between neuronal connectivity, cortical
   thickness, surface morphology and ultimately behaviour, could have
   important implications on the diagnostics, classification and treatment
   of neurological disorders.}},

   emerged for addressing the supplier selection problem (SSP). Experience
   and studies have shown that there is no best way for evaluating and
   selecting a specific supplier process, but that it varies from one

Abstract = {{The major light harvesting complex II (LHCII) of green plants plays a
   key role in the absorption of sunlight, the regulation of
   photosynthesis, and in preventing photodamage by excess light. The
   latter two functions are thought to involve the lumenal loop and the
   N-terminal domain. Their structure and mobility in an aqueous
   environment are only partially known. Electron paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) has been used to measure the structure of these hydrophilic
   protein domains in detergent-solubilized LHCII. A new technique is
   introduced to prepare LHCII trimers in which only one monomer is
   spin-labeled. These heterogeneous trimers allow to measure
   intra-molecular distances within one LHCII monomer in the context of a
   trimer by using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). These data
   together with data from electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)
   allowed to model the N-terminal protein section, which has not been
   resolved in current crystal structures, and the lumenal loop domain. The
   N-terminal domain covers only a restricted area above the superhelix in
   LHCII, which is consistent with the ``Velcro{''} hypothesis to explain
   thylakoid grana stacking (Standfuss, J., van Terwisscha Scheltinga, A.
   C., Lamborghini, M., and Kuhlbrandt, W. (2005) EMBOJ. 24, 919-928). The
   conformation of the lumenal loop domain is surprisingly different
   between LHCII monomers and trimers but not between complexes with and
   without neoxanthin bound.}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under 5
   years of age globally, making research on modifiable risk factors for
   childhood pneumonia important for reducing this disease burden. Millions
   of children globally are exposed to elevated levels of arsenic in
   drinking water. However, there is limited data on the association
   between arsenic exposure and respiratory infections, particularly among
   pediatric populations.
   Methods: This case control study of 153 pneumonia cases and 296 controls
   28 days to 59 months of age in rural Bangladesh is the first to assess
   whether arsenic exposure is a risk factor for pneumonia in a pediatric
   population. Cases had physician diagnosed World Health Organization
   defined severe or very severe pneumonia. Urine collected during
   hospitalization (hospital admission time point) and 30 days later
   (convalescent time point) from cases and a single specimen from
   community controls was tested for urinary arsenic by graphite furnace
   atomic absorption.
   Results: The odds for pneumonia was nearly double for children with
   urinary arsenic concentrations higher than the first quartile (>= 6 mu
   g/L) at the hospital admission time point (Odd Ratio (OR): 1.88 (95 \%
   Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 3.53)), after adjustment for urinary
   creatinine, weight for height, breastfeeding, paternal education, age,
   and number of people in the household. This was consistent with findings
   at the convalescent time point where the adjusted OR for children with
   urinary arsenic concentrations greater than the first quartile (>= 6 mu
   g/L) was 2.32 (95 \% CI: 1.33, 4.02).
   Conclusion: We observed a nearly two times higher odds of pneumonia for
   children with creatinine adjusted urinary arsenic concentrations greater
   than the first quartile (>= 6 mu g/L) at the hospital admission time
   point. This novel finding suggests that low to moderate arsenic exposure
   may be a risk factor for pneumonia in children under 5 years of age.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures are emerging as promising building
   blocks for a large spectrum of applications. One critical issue in
   integration regards mastering the thin, flat, and chemically stable
   insulating layer that must be implemented on the nanostructure network
   in order to build striking nano-architectures. In this letter, we report
   an innovative method for nanoscale planarization on 3D nanostructures by
   using hydrogen silesquioxane as a spin-on-glass (SOG) dielectric
   material. To decouple the thickness of the final layer from the height
   of the nanostructure, we propose to embed the nanowire network in the
   insulator layer by exploiting the planarizing properties of the SOG
   approach. To achieve the desired dielectric thickness, the structure is
   chemically etched back with a highly diluted solution to control the
   etch rate precisely. The roughness of the top surface was less than 2
   nm. There were no surface defects and the planarity was excellent, even
   in the vicinity of the nanowires. This newly developed process was used
   to realize a multilevel stack architecture with sub-deca-nanometer-range
   layer thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)
   is associated with migraine phase; however, whether PACAP levels could
   be used to distinguish between migraine and tension-type headache (TTH)
   remains unknown. We compared interictal plasma PACAP levels among
   healthy controls, migraineurs, and patients with TTH.
   Methods: Interictal plasma levels of PACAP were measured in 133
   migraineurs, 106 patients with TTH, and 50 controls using enzyme-linked
   immunoassays. We further evaluated the relationships between interictal
   PACAP plasma concentrations and clinical parameters, such as headache
   severity, attack frequency, and duration.
   Results: We found that migraineurs had significantly lower interictal
   plasma PACAP levels than patients with TTH and healthy controls.
   However, there were no significant differences between patients with TTH
   and healthy controls. Plasma PACAP levels were significantly lower in
   patients with episodic migraine (EM) than in patients with episodic
   tension-type headache (ETTH) and in patients with chronic migraine (CM)
   than in patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Interictal
   PACAP levels were negatively correlated with duration in the CM group.
   Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated differences in
   interictal PACAP levels in migraine and TTH, suggesting that PACAP is
   involved in the pathogenesis of migraine rather than TT-I. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a key regulator of
   intracellular Ca2+ concentration that release Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores in
   response to various external stimuli. IP3R also works as a signal hub
   which form a platform for interacting with various proteins involved in
   diverse cell signaling. Previously, we have identified an IP3R homolog
   in the parasitic protist, Trypanosoma cruzi (TcIP3R). Parasites
   expressing reduced or increased levels of TcIP3R displayed defects in
   growth, transformation, and infectivity. In the present study, we
   established parasitic strains expressing a dominant negative form of
   TcIP3R, named DN-TcIP3R, to further investigate the physiological
   role(s) of TcIP3R. We found that the growth of epimastigotes expressing
   DN-TcIP3R was significantly slower than that of parasites with TcIP3R
   expression levels that were approximately 65\% of wild-type levels. The
   expression of DN-TcIP3R in epimastigotes induced metacyclogenesis even
   in the normal growth medium. Furthermore, these epimastigotes showed the
   presence of dense mitochondria under a transmission electron microscope.
   Our findings confirm that TcIP3R is crucial for epimastigote growth, as
   previously reported. They also suggest that a strong inhibition of the
   IP3R-mediated signaling induces rnetacyclogenesis and that mitochondrial
   integrity is closely associated with this signaling. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Increasing evidences suggest a close association between tumor
   metastasis and the inflammatory factors secreted by tumor
   microenvironment. It has been reported that epithelial
   mesenchymal-transition (EMT) plays a significant role during multiple
   types of tumor metastasis and progression induced by inflammatory factor
   from tumor microenvironment. Previous researches implied that fibroblast
   growth factor I (FGF1) can promote tumor progression and cause poor
   prognosis in several types of malignant tumors via interacting with its
   receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor I (FGFR1). However, the
   effects of FGF1-FGFR1 on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) are not
   yet completely understood. In the present study, we evaluated the
   effects and function of FGF1-FGFR1 axis on TSCC metastasis. In addition,
   we investigated whether the EMT pathway is involved in these effects,
   thus modulating the TSCC progression. The expression of FGFR1 was
   measured both in tongue cancer cell lines and tissues by qRT-PCR and
   western blot. We found that FGFR1 was up-regulated in TSCC tissues
   compared to non-neoplastic tongue tissues. Additionally, overexpression
   of FGFR1 is positively associated with poor differentiation and
   metastasis potential. Furthermore, the function of FGF1-FGFR1 was
   examined in TSCC cell line. The results implied that FGF1 can obviously
   promote Cal27 cells migration and invasion abilities through FGFR1,
   while the motile and invasive capabilities can be severely attenuated
   when knockdown the expression of FGFR1 by specific siRNAs. Further
   investigation results show that FGF1-FGFR1 axis promotes TSCC metastasis
   by modulating EMT pathway. However, this effect can be inhibited by
   blocking the FGF1-FGFR1 axis using FGFR1 specific siRNAs. In conclusion,
   our findings of the present study provide the evidences that FGF1-FGFR1
   axis promotes the TSCC metastasis through the EMT pathway. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Glomerular hyperfiltration is recognized as an early marker of
   progressive kidney dysfunction in the obese population. This study aimed
   to identify the relationship between glomerular hyperfiltration and body
   fat distribution measured by computed tomography (CT) in healthy Korean
   adults. The study population included individuals aged 20-64 years who
   went a routine health check-up including an abdominal CT scan. We
   selected 4,378 individuals without diabetes and hypertension. Glomerular
   filtration rate was estimated using the CKD-EPI equation, and glomerular
   hyperfiltration was defined as the highest quintile of glomerular
   filtration rate. Abdominal adipose tissue areas were measured at the
   level of the umbilicus using a 16-detector CT scanner, and the
   cross-sectional area was calculated using Rapidia 2.8 CT software. The
   prevalence of glomerular hyperfiltration increased significantly
   according to the subcutaneous adipose tissue area in men (OR = 1.74
   (1.16-2.61), P for trend 0.016, for the comparisons of lowest vs.
   highest quartile) and visceral adipose tissue area in women (OR = 2.34
   (1.46-3.75), P for trend < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. After
   stratification by body mass index (normal < 23 kg/m(2), overweight >= 23
   kg/m(2)), male subjects with greater subcutaneous adipose tissue, even
   those in the normal BMI group, had a higher prevalence of glomerular
   hyperfiltration (OR = 2.11 (1.17-3.80), P for trend = 0.009). Among
   women, the significance of visceral adipose tissue area on glomerular
   hyperfiltration resulted from the normal BMI group (OR = 2.14
   (1.31-3.49), P for trend = 0.002). After menopause, the odds ratio of
   the association of glomerular hyperfiltration with subcutaneous
   abdominal adipose tissue increased (OR = 2.96 (1.21-7.25), P for trend =
   0.013). Subcutaneous adipose tissue areas and visceral adipose tissue
   areas are positively associated with glomerular hyperfiltration in
   healthy Korean adult men and women, respectively. In post-menopausal
   women, visceral adipose tissue area shows significant positive
   association with glomerular hyperfiltration as in men.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The limiting factor for lung transplantation is the lack of
   donor organs. The usage of lungs from donation after cardiac death (DCD)
   would dramatically increase donor availability. In the present paper we
   wanted to investigate lungs exposed to 1 h of warm ischemia without
   heparin followed by flush-perfusion and cold storage compared to lungs
   harvested from heart beating donors (HBD) using standard harvesting
   technique.
   Methods: Twelve Swedish domestic pigs were randomized into two groups.
   Six pigs (DCD group) underwent ventricular fibrillation and were then
   left untouched for 1 h after declaration of death. They did not receive
   heparin. The lungs were then harvested and flush-perfused with Perfadex
   (R) solution and the organs were stored at 8 degrees C for 4 h. Six pigs
   (HBD group) received heparin and the lungs were harvested and
   flush-perfused with Perfadex (R) solution and the organs were stored at
   8 degrees C for 4 h. Lung function was evaluated, using ex vivo lung
   perfusion (EVLP), with blood gases at different oxygen levels, pulmonary
   vascular resistance (PVR), lung weight, and macroscopic appearance.
   Results: At FiO(2) 1.0, the PaO2 in the DCD group was 51.7 +/- 2.0 kPa
   and in the HBD group 68.6 +/- 2.4 kPa (p < 0.01). Significantly lower
   PVR levels were measured in the DCD group (372 +/- 31 dyne x s/cm(5))
   compared to the HBD group (655 +/- 45 dyne x s/cm(5)) (p < 0.001). There
   was no significant difference between groups in weight, compliance or
   signs of pulmonary thrombosis or embolization.
   Conclusions: It seems as if DCD lungs exposed to 1 h of warm ischemia
   before 4 h of cold storage has satisfying oxygenation capacity, low PVR,
   normal weight and no signs of thrombosis or embolization. According to
   our study it seems as lungs exposed to 1 h warm ischemia without heparin
   might be good candidates for transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Several evidences have shown that salt excess is an important
   determinant of cardiovascular and renal derangement in hypertension. The
   present study aimed to investigate the renal effects of chronic high or
   low salt intake in the context of hypertension and to elucidate the
   molecular mechanisms underlying such effects. To this end, newly weaned
   male SHR were fed with diets only differing in NaCl content: normal salt
   (NS: 0.3\%), low salt (LS: 0.03\%), and high salt diet (HS: 3\%) until 7
   months of age. Analysis of renal function, morphology, and evaluation of
   the expression of the main molecular components involved in the renal
   handling of albumin, including podocyte slit-diaphragm proteins and
   proximal tubule endocytic receptors were performed. The relationship
   between diets and the balance of the renal angiotensin-converting enzyme
   (ACE) and ACE2 enzymes was also examined. HS produced glomerular
   hypertrophy and decreased ACE2 and nephrin expressions, loss of
   morphological integrity of the podocyte processes, and increased
   proteinuria, characterized by loss of albumin and high molecular weight
   proteins. Conversely, severe hypertension was attenuated and renal
   dysfunction was prevented by LS since proteinuria was much lower than in
   the NS SHRs. This was associated with a decrease in kidney ACE/ ACE2
   protein and activity ratio and increased cubilin renal expression. Taken
   together, these results suggest that LS attenuates hypertension
   progression in SHRs and preserves renal function. The mechanisms
   partially explaining these findings include modulation of the intrarenal
   ACE/ACE2 balance and the increased cubilin expression. Importantly, HS
   worsens hypertensive kidney injury and decreases the expression nephrin,
   a key component of the slit diaphragm.}},

Abstract = {{Both mucin 1 (MUC1) and galectin-3 are known to be over-expressed in
   various malignant tumors and associated with a poor prognosis. It has
   been extensively reported that MUC1 is involved in potentiation of
   growth factor-dependent signal transduction. Because some carbohydrate
   moieties carried on MUC1 change to preferable ones for binding of
   galectin-3 in cancer cells, we speculated that MUC1-mediated signaling
   may occur through direct binding of galectin-3. Immunochemical studies
   showed that the distribution of galectin-3 coincided with that of MUC1
   in various human tumor tissues but not in human nonmalignant tissues,
   and the level of galectin-3 retained on the surface of various cancer
   cells paralleled that of MUC1. Treatment of MUC1-expressing cells with
   galectin-3 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt following enhanced
   phosphorylation of MUC1 C-terminal domain, consistently promoting tumor
   cell malignancy. It is also noted that this enhanced phosphorylation
   occurred independently of EGF receptor-mediated signaling in both EGF
   receptor-and MUC1-expressing cells, and multivalency of galectin-3 was
   important for initiation of MUC1-mediated signaling. Expectedly, both
   silencing of endogenous galectin-3 and treatment with galectin-3
   antagonists down-regulated cell proliferation of MUC1-expressing cells.
   These results suggest that the binding of galectin-3 to MUC1 plays a key
   role in MUC1-mediated signaling. Thus, constitutive activation of
   MUC1-mediated signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner caused by
   ligation of galectin-3 promotes uncontrolled tumor cell malignancy. This
   signaling may be another MUC1-mediated pathway and function in parallel
   with a growth factor-dependent MUC1-mediated signaling pathway.}},

Title = {{A phylogenetic approach to study the origin and evolution of the
   CRINKLY4 family}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Cell cell communication plays a crucial role in plant growth and
   development and relies to a large extent on peptide ligand receptor
   kinase signaling mechanisms. The CRINKLY4 (CR4) family of receptor-like
   kinases is involved in a wide range of developmental processes in
   plants, including mediating columella stem cell identity and
   differentiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana root tip. Members of the CR4
   family contain a signal peptide, an extracellular part, a single-pass
   transmembrane helix and an intracellular cytoplasmic protein kinase
   domain. The main distinguishing features of the family are the presence
   of seven ``crinkly{''} repeats and a TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR
   (TNER)-like domain in the extracellular part. Here, we investigated the
   evolutionary origin of the CR4 family and explored to what extent
   members of this family are conserved throughout the green lineage. We
   identified members of the CR4 family in various dicots and monocots, and
   also in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii and the bryophyte
   Physcomitrella patens. In addition, we attempted to gain insight in the
   evolutionary origin of different CR4-specific domains, and we could
   detect ``crinkly{''} repeat containing proteins already in single celled
   algae. Finally, we related the presence of likely functional CR4
   orthologs to its best described signaling module comprising
   CLAVATA3/EMBRY0 SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 40 (CLE40), WUSCHEL RELATED
   HOMEOBOX 5 (W0X5), CLAVATA 1 (CLV1), and ARABIDOPSIS CR4 (ACR4), and
   established that this module likely is already present in bryophytes and
   lycophytes.}},

   saturation scale is for the cross-section scaling compatible with the
   one found in deep inelastic ep scattering at HERA. Next, by
   parametrizing charged particle distributions by the Tsallis-like
   formula, we find a somewhat unexpected solution that still exhibits GS,
   but differs from the ``standard{''} one where the Tsallis temperature is
   proportional to the saturation scale.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying changes in the transcriptional regulation of target genes
   from high-throughput studies is important for unravelling molecular
   mechanisms controlled by a given perturbation. When measuring global
   transcript levels only, the effect of the perturbation {[}e.g.,
   transcription factor (TF) overexpression or drug treatment] on its
   target genes is often obscured by delayed feedback and secondary effects
   until the changes are fully propagated. As a proof of principle, we show
   that selective measuring of transcripts that are only synthesised after
   a perturbation {[}4-thiouridine (4sU) sequencing (4sU-seq)] is a more
   sensitive method to identify targets and time-dependent transcriptional
   responses than global transcript profiling. By metabolically labelling
   RNA in a time-course setup, we could vastly increase the sensitivity of
   MYCN target gene detection compared to traditional RNA sequencing. The
   validity of targets identified by 4sU-seq was demonstrated using
   chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and neuroblastoma microarray
   tumour data. Here, we describe the methodology, both molecular biology
   and computational aspects, required to successfully apply this 4sU-seq
   approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio A, is an
   autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of
   N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), which causes major
   skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities and affects multiple organ
   systems. In this study, one MPS IVA patient with a severe form from
   consanguine large Iranian family has been investigated. To find a
   mutation, all of the 14 exons and intron-exon junctions of GALNS gene
   were sequenced. Sequencing results were analyzed using bioinformatic
   analysis in order to predict probable pathogenic effect of the variant.
   One novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 5, c.542A > G (p.Y181C),
   was found in the proband. That was predicted as being probably
   pathogenic by bioinformatics analysis. Segregation and familial study
   confirmed this pathogenic mutation. In conclusion, we have identified
   the novel mutation responsible for MPS IVA in an Iranian patient to
   assist in the diagnosis, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of
   the affected families. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Phylogeny of the genus Rhynchocalamus (Reptilia; Colubridae) with a

Abstract = {{The genus Rhynchocalamus comprises three species distributed in
   Southwest Asia. Little is known about them, most probably because of
   their secretive fossorial lifestyle. The poor knowledge of the genus is
   even underscored by the fact that its phylogenetic affinities remained
   unclear until very recently. The least known of the species,
   Rhynchocalamus arabicus, is known only from the holotype collected in
   Aden, Yemen, and it has not been observed since its description in 1933.
   Here we provide a second record for this species, which represents the
   first record of this genus for Oman. This extends its range in southern
   Arabia by more than 1000 km. The observed specimen was determined as R.
   arabicus on the basis of its similarity in size, color, and scalation
   with the holotype. Furthermore, we sequenced three mitochondrial (12S,
   16S, cytb) and one nuclear (cmos) genes for R. arabicus and for two
   individuals of R. melanocephalus and one R. satunini and inferred the
   phylogenetic relationships of all currently recognized species of the
   genus for the first time. The results of our phylogenetic analyses
   indicate that Rhynchocalamus is a member of the Western Palearctic clade
   of Colubrinae and is sister to Lytorhynchus, with which it forms a very
   well supported clade and shares some morphological characters. As our
   results show, R. satunini is the basal lineage of the genus and R.
   melanocephalus is sister to R. arabicus.}},

Abstract = {{Orai1 is one of the key components of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)
   involved in diverse physiological functions. Orai1 may associate with
   other proteins to form a signaling complex. In the present study, we
   investigated the interaction between Orai1 and small conductance
   Ca2+-activated potassium channel 3 (SK3). With the use of RNA
   interference technique, we found that the SOCE and its associated
   membrane hyperpolarization were reduced while Orai1 was knocked down by
   a specific Orai1 siRNA in guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle. However,
   with the use of isometric tension measurements, our results revealed
   that agonist-induced muscle contractility was significantly enhanced
   after Orai1 protein was knocked down or the tissue was treated by SK3
   inhibitor apamin, but not affected by larger conductance Ca2+-activated
   potassium channel inhibitor iberiotoxin or intermediate conductance
   Ca2+-activated potassium channel inhibitor TRAM-34. In addition, in the
   presence of apamin, rail siRNA had no additional effect on
   agonist-induced contraction. In coimmunoprecipitation experiment, SK3
   and Orai1 pulled down each other. These data suggest that, Orai1
   physically associated with SK3 to form a signaling complex in
   gallbladder smooth muscle. Ca2+ entry via rail activates SK3, resulting
   in membrane hyperpolarization in gallbladder smooth muscle. This
   hyperpolarizing effect of Orai1-SK3 coupling could serve to prevent
   excessive contraction of gallbladder smooth muscle in response to
   contractile agonists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of
   yield and grain quality traits in winter wheat genotypes using
   association mapping approach, and identify linked molecular markers for
   marker assisted selection. A total of 120 elite facultative/winter wheat
   genotypes were evaluated for yield, quality and other agronomic traits
   under rain-fed and irrigated conditions for two years (2011-2012) at the
   Tel Hadya station of ICARDA, Syria. The same genotypes were genotyped
   using 3,051 Diversity Array Technologies (DArT) markers, of which 1,586
   were of known chromosome positions. The grain yield performance of the
   genotypes was highly significant both in rain-fed and irrigated sites.
   Average yield of the genotypes ranged from 2295 to 4038 kg/ha and 4268
   to 7102 kg/ha under rain-fed and irrigated conditions, respectively.
   Protein content and alveograph strength (W) ranged from 13.6-16.1\% and
   217.6-375 Jx10-4, respectively. DArT markers wPt731910 (3B), wPt4680
   (4A), wPt3509 (5A), wPt8183 (6B), and wPt0298 (2D) were significantly
   associated with yield under rain-fed conditions. Under irrigated
   condition, tPt4125 on chromosome 2B was significantly associated with
   yield explaining about 13\% of the variation. Markers wPt2607 and
   wPt1482 on 5B were highly associated with protein content and alveograph
   strength explaining 16 and 14\% of the variations, respectively. The
   elite genotypes have been distributed to many countries using ICARDA's
   International system for potential direct release and/or use as parents
   after local adaptation trials by the NARSs of respective countries. The
   QTLs identified in this study are recommended to be used for marker
   assisted selection after through validation using bi-parental
   populations.}},

Title = {{Aiming for a representative sample: Simulating random versus purposive
   strategies for hospital selection}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: A ubiquitous issue in research is that of selecting a
   representative sample from the study population. While random sampling
   strategies are the gold standard, in practice, random sampling of
   participants is not always feasible nor necessarily the optimal choice.
   In our case, a selection must be made of 12 hospitals (out of 89 Dutch
   hospitals in total). With this selection of 12 hospitals, it should be
   possible to estimate blood use in the remaining hospitals as well. In
   this paper, we evaluate both random and purposive strategies for the
   case of estimating blood use in Dutch hospitals.
   Methods: Available population-wide data on hospital blood use and number
   of hospital beds are used to simulate five sampling strategies: (1)
   select only the largest hospitals, (2) select the largest and the
   smallest hospitals ('maximum variation'), (3) select hospitals randomly,
   (4) select hospitals from as many different geographic regions as
   possible, (5) select hospitals from only two regions. Simulations of
   each strategy result in different selections of hospitals, that are each
   used to estimate blood use in the remaining hospitals. The estimates are
   compared to the actual population values; the subsequent prediction
   errors are used to indicate the quality of the sampling strategy.
   Results: The strategy leading to the lowest prediction error in the case
   study was maximum variation sampling, followed by random, regional
   variation and two-region sampling, with sampling the largest hospitals
   resulting in the worst performance. Maximum variation sampling led to a
   hospital level prediction error of 15 \%, whereas random sampling led to
   a prediction error of 19 \% (95 \% CI 17 \%-26 \%). While lowering the
   sample size reduced the differences between maximum variation and the
   random strategies, increasing sample size to n = 18 did not change the
   ranking of the strategies and led to only slightly better predictions.
   Conclusions: The optimal strategy for estimating blood use was maximum
   variation sampling. When proxy data are available, it is possible to
   evaluate random and purposive sampling strategies using simulations
   before the start of the study. The results enable researchers to make a
   more educated choice of an appropriate sampling strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, magnetic hyperthermia nanoparticles have drawn great
   attention for cancer therapy because they have no limitation of tissue
   penetration during the therapy process. In this study, cubic nanoporous
   Fe2O3 nanoparticles derived from cubic Prussian blue nanoparticles were
   used as magnetic cores to generate heat by alternating the current
   magnetic field (AMF) for killing cancer cells. In addition, polypyrrole
   (PPy) was coated on the surfaces of the cubic Fe2O3 nanoparticles to
   load doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The PEG component was then
   physically adsorbed onto the surfaces of the nanoparticles, resulting in
   a Fe2O3@PPy-DOX-PEG nanocomposite. The nanocomposite was triggered by
   acid stimulus and AMF to release DOX, resulting in a remarkable
   combination therapeutic effect via chemotherapy and magnetic
   hyperthermia. Furthermore, the nanocomposite could realize magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) due to the magnetic core structure. The study
   provides an alternative for the development of new nanocomposites for
   combination cancer therapy with MR imaging in vivo.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide survey of two-component signal transduction systems in the
   plant growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Two-component systems (TCS) play critical roles in sensing
   and responding to environmental cues. Azospirillum is a plant
   growth-promoting rhizobacterium living in the rhizosphere of many
   important crops. Despite numerous studies about its plant beneficial
   properties, little is known about how the bacterium senses and responds
   to its rhizospheric environment. The availability of complete genome
   sequenced from four Azospirillum strains (A. brasilense Sp245 and CBG
   497, A. lipoferum 4B and Azospirillum sp. B510) offers the opportunity
   to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the TCS gene family.
   Results: Azospirillum genomes harbour a very large number of genes
   encoding TCS, and are especially enriched in hybrid histidine kinases
   (HyHK) genes compared to other plant-associated bacteria of similar
   genome sizes. We gained further insight into HyHK structure and
   architecture, revealing an intriguing complexity of these systems. An
   unusual proportion of TCS genes were orphaned or in complex clusters,
   and a high proportion of predicted soluble HKs compared to other
   plant-associated bacteria are reported. Phylogenetic analyses of the
   transmitter and receiver domains of A. lipoferum 4B HyHK indicate that
   expansion of this family mainly arose through horizontal gene transfer
   but also through gene duplications all along the diversification of the
   Azospirillum genus. By performing a genome-wide comparison of TCS, we
   unraveled important `genus-defining' and `plant-specifying' TCS.
   Conclusions: This study shed light on Azospirillum TCS which may confer
   important regulatory flexibility. Collectively, these findings highlight
   that Azospirillum genomes have broad potential for adaptation to
   fluctuating environments.}},

Title = {{Local-scale topoclimate effects on treeline elevations: a country-wide
   investigation of New Zealand's southern beech treelines}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Although treeline elevations are limited globally by growing season
   temperature, at regional scales treelines frequently deviate below their
   climatic limit. The cause of these deviations relate to a host of
   climatic, disturbance, and geomorphic factors that operate at multiple
   scales. The ability to disentangle the relative effects of these factors
   is currently hampered by the lack of reliable topoclimatic data, which
   describe how regional climatic characteristics are modified by
   topographic effects in mountain areas. In this study we present an
   analysis of the combined effects of local-and regional-scale factors on
   southern beech treeline elevation variability at 28 study areas across
   New Zealand. We apply a mesoscale atmospheric model to generate
   local-scale (200 m) meteorological data at these treelines and, from
   these data, we derive a set of topoclimatic indices that reflect
   possible detrimental and ameliorative influences on tree physiological
   functioning. Principal components analysis of meteorological data
   revealed geographic structure in how study areas were situated in
   multivariate space along gradients of topoclimate. Random forest and
   conditional inference tree modelling enabled us to tease apart the
   relative effects of 17 explanatory factors on local-scale treeline
   elevation variability. Overall, modelling explained about 50\% of the
   variation in treeline elevation variability across the 28 study areas,
   with local landform and topoclimatic effects generally outweighing those
   from regional-scale factors across the 28 study areas. Further, the
   nature of the relationships between treeline elevation variability and
   the explanatory variables were complex, frequently non-linear, and
   consistent with the treeline literature. To our knowledge, this is the
   first study where model-generated meteorological data, and derived
   topoclimatic indices, have been developed and applied to explain
   treeline variation. Our results demonstrate the potential of such an
   approach for ecological research in mountainous environments.}},

Title = {{Quantification of the natural history of visceral leishmaniasis and
   consequences for control}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Visceral leishmaniasis has been targeted for elimination as
   a public health problem (less than 1 case per 10,000 people per year) in
   the Indian sub-continent by 2017. However, there is still a high degree
   of uncertainty about the natural history of the disease, in particular
   about the duration of asymptomatic infection and the proportion of
   asymptomatically infected individuals that develop clinical visceral
   leishmaniasis. Quantifying these aspects of the disease is key for
   guiding efforts to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis and maintaining
   elimination once it is reached.
   Methods: Data from a detailed epidemiological study in Bangladesh in
   2002-2004 was analysed to estimate key epidemiological parameters. The
   role of diagnostics in determining the probability and rate of
   progression to clinical disease was estimated by fitting Cox
   proportional hazards models. A multi-state Markov model of the natural
   history of visceral leishmaniasis was fitted to the data to estimate the
   asymptomatic infection period and the proportion of asymptomatic
   individuals going on to develop clinical symptoms.
   Results: At the time of the study, individuals were taking several
   months to be diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis, leading to many
   opportunities for ongoing transmission. The probability of progression
   to clinical disease was strongly associated with initial seropositivity
   and even more strongly with seroconversion, with most clinical symptoms
   developing within a year. The estimated average durations of
   asymptomatic infection and symptomatic infection for our model of the
   natural history are 147 days (95 \% CI 130-166) and 140 days (95 \% CI
   123-160), respectively, and are significantly longer than previously
   reported estimates. We estimate from the data that 14.7 \% (95 \% CI
   12.6-20.0 \%) of asymptomatic individuals develop clinical symptoms-a
   greater proportion than previously estimated.
   Conclusions: Extended periods of asymptomatic infection could be
   important for visceral leishmaniasis transmission, but this depends
   critically on the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic
   individuals to sandflies. These estimates could be informed by similar
   analysis of other datasets. Our results highlight the importance of
   reducing times from onset of symptoms to diagnosis and treatment to
   reduce opportunities for transmission.}},

Journal = {{ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Epithelial ovarian cancer is often considered a single pathological
   entity, but increasing evidence suggests that it is rather a group of
   different neoplasms, each with unique pathological characteristics,
   molecular features, and clinical behaviours. This heterogeneity accounts
   for the different sensitivity to antineoplastic drugs and makes the
   treatment of ovarian tumours a challenge.
   For early-stage disease, as well as for heavily pre-treated patients
   with recurrent ovarian cancer, the benefit of chemotherapy remains
   uncertain.
   Clear-cell, mucinous, low-grade serous, and endometrioid carcinomas show
   different molecular characteristics, which require different therapeutic
   approaches. In the era of personalised cancer medicine, understanding
   the pathogenesis and the genetic background of each subtype of
   epithelial ovarian tumour may lead to a tailored therapy, maximising the
   benefits of specific treatments and possibly reducing the side effects.
   Furthermore, personal factors, such as the patient's performance status,
   should be taken into account in the management of ovarian cancer, with
   the aim of safeguarding the patients' quality of life.}},

Title = {{Systems analysis of non-parenchymal cell modulation of liver repair
   across multiple regeneration modes}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: A hallmark of chronic liver disease is the impairment of the
   liver's innate regenerative ability. In this work we use a computational
   approach to unravel the principles underlying control of liver repair
   following an acute physiological challenge.
   Methods: We used a mathematical model of inter-and intra-cellular
   interactions during liver regeneration to infer key molecular factors
   underlying the dysregulation of multiple regeneration modes, including
   delayed, suppressed, and enhanced regeneration. We used model analysis
   techniques to identify organizational principles governing the cellular
   regulation of liver regeneration. We fit our model to several published
   data sets of deficient regeneration in rats and healthy regeneration in
   humans, rats, and mice to predict differences in molecular regulation in
   disease states and across species.
   Results: Analysis of the computational model pointed to an important
   balance involving inflammatory signals and growth factors, largely
   produced by Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, respectively. Our
   model analysis results also indicated an organizational principle of
   molecular regulation whereby production rate of molecules acted to
   induce coarse-grained control of signaling levels while degradation rate
   acted to induce fine-tuning control. We used this computational
   framework to investigate hypotheses concerning molecular regulation of
   regeneration across species and in several chronic disease states in
   rats, including fructose-induced steatohepatitis, alcoholic
   steatohepatitis, toxin-induced cirrhosis, and toxin-induced diabetes.
   Our results indicate that altered non-parenchymal cell activation is
   sufficient to explain deficient regeneration caused by multiple disease
   states. We also investigated liver regeneration across mammalian
   species. Our results suggest that non-invasive measures of liver
   regeneration taken at 30 days following resection could differentiate
   between several hypotheses about how human liver regeneration differs
   from rat regeneration.
   Conclusions: Overall, our results provide a new computational platform
   integrating a wide range of experimental information, with broader
   utility in exploring the dynamic patterns of liver regeneration across
   species and over multiple chronic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We report on archaeological excavations undertaken at Kumukumu 1 atop
   the dense rainforest-clad Aird Hills of the Kikori river delta islands,
   south coast of Papua New Guinea. Results indicate exploitation of the
   nearby environment, including the gathering of some 200 million
   shellfish from riverine habitats at the base of the hill some 600 years
   ago, and deposition of shell remains onto hilltop middens. We ask what
   the implications of such a site in a defensive location on the upper,
   steep hillslope of Kumukumu hill are for regional occupation and
   dynamics. We conclude that the hinterland-marine fringe islands of the
   river deltas that include the site of Kumukumu 1 were especially
   sensitive to heightened cross-cultural influences and inter-group raids
   and competition, leading to accelerated processes of centralisation and
   aggrandisement among some groups, and the subjugation, fragmentation and
   dispersal of less powerful neighbouring groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against
   climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide(1).
   Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse
   grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during
   drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than
   that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental
   tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments
   that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity
   provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show
   that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of
   climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or
   prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the
   productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species
   changed by approximately 50\% during climate events, whereas that of
   high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant,
   changing by only approximately 25\%. By a year after each climate event,
   ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal
   levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities,
   leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on
   biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes
   ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services,
   by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental
   changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease
   ecosystem stability(14), and restoration of biodiversity to increase it,
   mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors are closely clustered in
   postsynaptic membranes and are believed to interact actively with each
   other to control excitatory synaptic transmission. Metabotropic
   glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), for example, has been well documented to
   potentiate ionotropic NMDA receptor activity, although underlying
   mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the
   role of mGluR5 in regulating trafficking and subcellular distribution of
   NMDA receptors in adult rat striatal neurons. We found that the mGluR1/5
   agonist DHPG concentration-dependently increased NMDA receptor G1uN1 and
   G1uN2B subunit expression in the surface membrane. Meanwhile, DHPG
   reduced GluN1 and GluN2B levels in the intracellular compartment. The
   effect of DHPG was blocked by an mGluR5 selective antagonist MTEP but
   not by an mGluR1 selective antagonist 3-MATIDA. Pretreatment with an
   inhibitor or a specific inhibitory peptide for synapse-enriched
   Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) also blocked the
   DHPG-stimulated redistribution of GluN1 and G1uN2B. In addition, DHPG
   enhanced CaMKII alpha activity and elevated G1uN2B phosphorylation at a
   CaMKII-sensitive site (serine 1303). These results demonstrate that
   mGluR5 regulates trafficking of NMDA receptors in striatal neurons.
   Activation of mGluR5 appears to induce rapid trafficking of G1uN1 and
   G1uN2B to surface membranes through a signaling pathway involving
   CaMKII. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The maintenance of stability during perturbations is essential for
   living organisms, and cellular networks organize multiple pathways to
   enable elements to remain connected and communicate, even when some
   pathways are broken. Here, we evaluated the biconnectivity of the
   metabolic networks of 506 species in terms of the clustering
   coefficients and the largest biconnected components (LBCs), wherein a
   biconnected component (BC) indicates a set of nodes in which every pair
   is connected by more than one path. Via comparison with the rewired
   networks, we illustrated how biconnectivity in cellular metabolism is
   achieved on small and large scales. Defining the biconnectivity of
   individual metabolic compounds by counting the number of species in
   which the compound belonged to the LBC, we demonstrated that
   biconnectivity is significantly correlated with the evolutionary age and
   functional importance of a compound. The prevalence of diseases
   associated with each metabolic compound quantifies the compounds
   vulnerability, i.e., the likelihood that it will cause a metabolic
   disorder. Moreover, the vulnerability depends on both the biconnectivity
   and the lethality of the compound. This fact can be used in drug
   discovery and medical treatments.}},

Title = {{Increased male fertility using fertility-related biomarkers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Conventional semen analyses are used to evaluate male factor
   fertility/infertility in humans and other animals. However, their
   clinical value remains controversial. Therefore, new tools that more
   accurately assess male fertility based on sperm function and
   fertilization mechanism are of interest worldwide. While protein markers
   in spermatozoa that might help differentiate fertile and infertile sperm
   have been identified, studies are in their infancy, and the markers
   require validation in field trials. In the present study, to discover
   more sensitive biomarkers in spermatozoa for predicting male fertility,
   we assessed protein expression in capacitated spermatozoa. The results
   demonstrated that cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2 (UQCRC2) was
   abundantly expressed in high-litter size spermatozoa (>3-fold). On the
   other hand, equatorin, beta-tubulin, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1
   (UQCRC1), speriolin, Ras-related protein Rab-2A (RAB2A), spermadhesin
   AQN-3, and seminal plasma sperm motility inhibitor were abundantly
   expressed in low-litter size spermatozoa (>3-fold). Moreover, RAB2A and
   UQCRC1 expression negatively correlated with litter size, while UQCRC2
   expression positively correlated with litter size. Finally, the putative
   biomarkers predicted litter size in field trials. Our study suggests
   that biomarkers present in spermatozoa after capacitation can help
   differentiate superior male fertility from below-average fertility with
   high sensitivity.}},

Title = {{The Relationship Between School Climate and Mental and Emotional
   Wellbeing Over the Transition from Primary to Secondary School}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY OF WELL-BEING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: School climate has often been described as the ``quality and
   character of school life{''}, including both social and physical aspects
   of the school, that can positively promote behaviour, school
   achievement, and the social and emotional development of students.
   Methods: The current study examined the relationship between students'
   mental and emotional wellbeing and factors pertaining to school climate,
   focussing on the domains of safety, social relationships and school
   connectedness, during the last year of their primary schooling (age
   11-12 years) and their first 2 years of secondary school. Data was
   collected using a self-completion questionnaire, four times over 3 years
   from 1800 students' aged 11-14 years. Multilevel modelling was used to
   determine the strongest school climate predictor of students' mental and
   emotional wellbeing at each time point.
   Results: In the last year of primary school, peer support was the
   strongest protective predictor of wellbeing, while feeling less
   connected and less safe at school predicted mental wellbeing. Feeling
   safe at school was the strongest protective factor for student wellbeing
   in the first year of secondary school. In the second year of secondary
   school, peer support was the strongest protective factor for mental
   wellbeing, while feeling safe at school, feeling connected to school and
   having support from peers were predictive of emotional wellbeing.
   Conclusions: School climate factors of feeling safe at school, feeling
   connected to school, and peer support are all protective of mental and
   emotional wellbeing over the transition period while connectedness to
   teachers is protective of emotional wellbeing. Primary school appears to
   be an important time to establish quality connections to peers who have
   a powerful role in providing support for one another before the
   transition to secondary school. However, school policies and practices
   promoting safety and encouraging and enabling connectedness are
   important during the first years of secondary school.
   Recommendations for effective school policy and practice in both primary
   and secondary schools to help enhance the mental and emotional wellbeing
   of adolescents are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sialylconjugates on cell surfaces are involved in many biological events
   such as cellular recognition, signal transduction, and immune response.
   It has been reported that aberrant sialylation at the nonreducing end of
   glycoconjugates and overexpression of sialyltransferases (STs) in cells
   are correlated with the malignance, invasion, and metastasis of tumors.
   Therefore, inhibitors of STs would provide valuable leads for the
   discovery of antitumor drugs. On the basis of the transition state of
   the enzyme-catalyzed sialylation reaction, we proposed that the
   cydopentane skeleton in its two puckered conformations might mimic the
   planar structure of the donor (CMP-Neu5Ac) in the transition state. A
   series of cydopentane-containing compounds were designed and synthesized
   by coupling different cydopentane alpha-hydroxyphosphonates with
   cytidine phosphoramidite. Their inhibitory activities against
   recombinant human ST6Gal-I were assayed, and a potent inhibitor 481 with
   a K-i of 0.028 +/- 0.006 mu M was identified. The results show that the
   cydopentanoid-type compounds could become a new type of
   sialyltransferase inhibitors as biological probes or drug leads.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene is a gaseous phytohormone that plays vital roles in plant
   growth and development. Previous studies uncovered EIN2 as an essential
   signal transducer linking ethylene perception on ER to transcriptional
   regulation in the nucleus through a ``cleave and shuttle'' model. In
   this study, we report another mechanism of EIN2-mediated ethylene
   signaling, whereby EIN2 imposes the translational repression of EBF1 and
   EBF2 mRNA. We find that the EBF1/2 3' UTRs mediate EIN2-directed
   translational repression and identify multiple poly-uridylates (PolyU)
   motifs as functional cis elements of 3' UTRs. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that ethylene induces EIN2 to associate with 3' UTRs and
   target EBF1/2 mRNA to cytoplasmic processing-body (P-body) through
   interacting with multiple P-body factors, including EIN5 and PABs. Our
   study illustrates translational regulation as a key step in ethylene
   signaling and presents mRNA 3' UTR functioning as a ``signal
   transducer'' to sense and relay cellular signaling in plants.}},

Title = {{Development and feasibility of a personalized, interactive risk
   calculator for knee osteoarthritis}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is rising. While
   several risk factors have been associated with the development of knee
   OA, this information is not readily accessible to those at risk for
   osteoarthritis. Risk calculators have been developed for several
   prevalent chronic conditions but not for OA. Using published evidence on
   established risk factors, we developed an interactive, personalized knee
   OA risk calculator (OA Risk C) and conducted a pilot study to evaluate
   its acceptability and feasibility.
   Methods: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated,
   state-transition simulation of the natural history and management of OA,
   to generate data for OA Risk C. Risk estimates for calculator users were
   based on a set of demographic and clinical factors (age, sex,
   race/ethnicity, obesity) and select risk factors (family history of knee
   OA, occupational exposure, and history of knee injury). OA Risk C
   presents personalized risk of knee OA in several ways to maximize
   understanding among a wide range of users. We conducted a study of 45
   subjects in a primary care setting to establish the feasibility and
   acceptability of the OA risk calculator. Pilot study participants were
   asked several questions regarding ease of use, clarity of presentation,
   and clarity of the graphical representation of their risk. These
   questions used a five-level agreement scale ranging from strongly
   disagree to strongly agree.
   Results: OA Risk C depicts information about users' risk of symptomatic
   knee OA in 5 year intervals. Study participants estimated their lifetime
   risk at 38 \%, while their actual lifetime risk, as estimated by OA Risk
   C, was 25 \%. Eighty-four percent of pilot study participants reported
   that OA Risk C was easy to understand, and 89 \% agreed that the graphs
   depicting their risk were clear and comprehensible.
   Conclusions: We have developed a personalized, computer-based OA risk
   calculator that is easy to use. OA Risk C may be utilized to estimate
   individuals' knee OA risk and to deliver educational and behavioral
   interventions focused on osteoarthritis risk reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Chilling injury and death are the ultimate consequence of low
   temperature exposure for chill susceptible insects, and low temperature
   tolerance is considered one of the most important factors determining
   insect distribution patterns. The physiological mechanisms that cause
   chilling injury are unknown, but chronic cold exposure that causes
   injury is consistently associated with elevated extracellular {[}K+],
   and cold tolerant insects possess a greater capacity to maintain ion
   balance at low temperatures. Here, we use the muscle tissue of the
   migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) to examine whether chill injury
   occurs during cold exposure or following return to benign temperature
   and we specifically examine if elevated extracellular {[}K+ ], low
   temperature, or a combination thereof causes cell death. We find that in
   vivo chill injury occurs during the cold exposure (when extracellular
   {[}K+] is high) and that there is limited capacity for repair
   immediately following the cold stress. Further, we demonstrate that that
   high extracellular {[}K+] causes cell death in situ, but only when
   experienced at low temperatures. These findings strongly suggest that
   that the ability to maintain ion (particularly K+) balance is critical
   to insect low temperature survival, and highlight novel routes of study
   in the mechanisms regulating cell death in insects in the cold.}},

Abstract = {{Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen that infects both animals and
   humans worldwide. The epidemiology of infection caused by Y
   pseudotuberculosis is poorly understood; however, its outbreaks have
   been traced back to a probable source in wildlife. This study aimed to
   characterise Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates collected from animals with
   yersiniosis. This study included 90 isolates of Y pseudotuberculosis
   collected from different animals with yersiniosis between 1996 and 2013
   in Italy. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and
   were biotyped. Genes associated with virulence plasmid pYV and those
   encoding O-antigen, high pathogenicity island (HPI), and super-antigenic
   toxin (YPM) were determined by performing PCR. Pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed using NotI and SpeI enzymes, and 3
   dendrograms were generated. No antibiotic resistance was found. The
   presence of pYV was shown in 57 out of 90 isolates. Virulence profiles
   of majority of the isolates indicated that they belonged to O:1a and
   O:1b serotypes, biotype 1, and genetic type 2. Isolates belonging to
   O:2a serotype were detected in sheep and cattle and were found to be
   associated (for the first time) with septicemia in hares. Y
   pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to O:5a and 0:12013 serotypes were
   also detected in hares. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   detect Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to the O:12-O13 serotype
   from a clinical case in Europe. Results of PFGE indicated that it was a
   reliable method for investigating the genetic relatedness of Y.
   pseudotuberculosis isolates. Thus, characterisation of Y
   pseudotuberculosis infection in animals should be considered a possible
   tool for the surveillance of pseudotuberculosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Resisting false recognition: An ERP study of lure discrimination}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1624}},
Pages = {{336-348}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{There is keen interest in what enables rememberers to differentiate true
   from false memories and which strategies are likely to be the most
   effective. This study measured electrical brain activity while healthy
   young adults performed a mnemonic discrimination task, deciding whether
   color pictures had been studied, were similar to studied pictures
   (lures), or were new. Between 500 and 800 ms post-stimulus,
   event-related potentials (ERPs) for correctly recognized studied
   pictures and falsely recognized lures compared to those for correctly
   rejected novel items had a left centroparietal scalp distribution. This
   was typical of the parietal old/new effect associated with recollection,
   and in line with previous evidence that similar lures may elicit false
   or phantom recollection as opposed to just familiarity. There was no
   evidence of a parietal effect for correctly rejected lures as would be
   expected if recall-to-reject was used. The ERP old/new effects for lures
   also varied with individual differences in performance. Parietal effects
   for falsely recognized lures were larger in better performers, who
   successfully rejected a greater number of lures as ``similar{''}. The
   better performers also showed more pronounced right frontocentral
   old/new effects between 800 and 1100 ms for correctly rejected and
   falsely recognized similar lures. The enhancement of false recollection
   in better performers implies false recognition of lures occurred only
   when more specific information was recovered about the study episodic.
   Together, the findings suggest reliance on recollection to decide that
   items were studied, supported by post-retrieval processing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Apelin peptides and the apelin receptor represent a relatively new
   therapeutic axis for the potential treatment of cardiovascular disease.
   Several reports suggest apelin receptor activation with apelin peptides
   results in cardioprotection as noted through positive ionotropy,
   angiogenesis, reduction of mean arterial blood pressure, and apoptosis.
   Considering the potential therapeutic benefit attainable through
   modulation of the apelinergic system, research is expanding to develop
   novel therapies that limit the inherent rapid degradation of endogenous
   apelin peptides and produce metabolically stable small molecule agonists
   and antagonists to more rigorously interrogate the apelin receptor
   system. This review details the structure-activity relationships for
   chemically modified apelin peptides and recent disclosures of small
   molecule agonists and antagonists and summarizes the peer reviewed and
   patented literature. Development of metabolically stable ligands of
   apelin receptor and their effects in various models over the coming
   years will hopefully lead to establishment of this receptor as a
   validated target for cardiovascular indications.}},

Title = {{Treatment of traumatised refugees with basic body awareness therapy
   versus mixed physical activity as add-on treatment: Study protocol of a
   randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Treatment of traumatised refugees is one of the fields
   within psychiatry, which has received little scientific attention.
   Evidence based treatment and knowledge on the efficiency of the
   treatment for this complex patient group is therefore scarce. This leads
   to uncertainty as to which treatment should be offered and potentially
   lowers the quality of life for the patients. Chronic pain is very common
   among traumatised refugees and it is believed to maintain the mental
   symptoms of trauma. Hence, treating chronic pain is believed to be of
   high clinical value for this patient group. In clinical studies,
   physical activity has shown a positive effect on psychiatric illnesses
   such as depression and anxiety and for patients with chronic pain.
   However, scientific knowledge about physical activity as part of the
   treatment for traumatised refugees is very limited and no guidelines
   exist on this topic.
   Methods/design: This study will include approximately 310 patients,
   randomised into three groups. All three groups receive psychiatric
   treatment as usual for the duration of 6-7 months, consisting of
   consultations with a medical doctor including pharmacological treatment
   and manual-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The first group only
   receives treatment as usual while the second and the third groups
   receive either Basic-Body Awareness Therapy or mixed physical activity
   as add-on treatments. Each physical activity is provided for an
   individual 1-hour consultation per week, for the duration of 20 weeks.
   The study is being conducted at the Competence Centre for Transcultural
   Psychiatry, Mental Health Centre Ballerup in the Capital Region of
   Denmark. The primary endpoint of the study is symptoms of Post Traumatic
   Stress Disorder; the secondary endpoints are depression and anxiety as
   well as quality of life, functional capacity, coping with pain, body
   awareness and physical fitness.
   Discussion: This study will examine the effect of physical activity for
   traumatised refugees. This has not yet been done in a randomised
   controlled setting on such a large scale before. Hereby the study will
   contribute to important knowledge that is expected to be used in future
   clinical guidelines and reference programs.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1624}},
Pages = {{167-174}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The Useful Field of View Test (UFOV) is often used as a behavioral
   assessment of age-related decline in visual perception and cognition.
   Poor performance may reflect slowed processing speed, difficulty
   dividing attention, and difficulty ignoring irrelevant information.
   However, the underlying neural correlates of UFOV performance have not
   been identified. The relationship between older adults UFOV performance
   and event-related potential (ERP) components reflecting visual
   processing was examined. P1 amplitude increased with better UFOV
   performance involving object identification (subtest 1), suggesting that
   this task is associated with stimulus processing at an early perceptual
   level. Better performance in all UFOV subtests was associated with
   faster speed of processing, as reflected by decreases in P3b latency.
   Current evidence supports the hypothesis that the UFOV recruits both
   early perceptual and later cognitive processing involved in attentional
   control. The implications of these results are discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Quercetin is a dietary flavonoid which exerts anti-oxidant,

   investigated the anti-proliferative effect of quercetin in two breast
   cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), which differed in hormone
   receptor. IC50 value (37 mu M) of quercetin showed significant
   cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells
   even at 100 mu M of quercetin treatment. To study the response of cancer
   cells to quercetin, with respect to different hormone receptors, both
   the cell lines were treated with a fixed concentration (40 mu M) of
   quercetin. MCF-7 cells on quercetin treatment showed more apoptotic
   cells with G1 phase arrest. In addition, quercetin effectively
   suppressed the expression of CyclinD1, p21, Twist and phospho p38MAPK,
   which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. To analyse the molecular
   mechanism of quercetin in exerting an apoptotic effect in MCF-7 cells,
   Twist was over-expressed and the molecular changes were observed after
   quercetin administration. Quercetin effectively regulated the expression
   of Twist, in turn p16 and p21 which induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In
   conclusion, quercetin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through
   suppression of Twist via p38MAPK pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic action of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a
   two-step process: (1) binding to lysinerich fibrin (K-m event) and (2)
   converting local plasminogen into plasmin (K-cat, event). Overcoming
   limitations of other structural biophysics methods, we wanted to employ
   small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to visualize what shape changes
   occur/accompany t-PA activation, but the prime hurdle was the
   polydisperse nature of the fibrin, which occluded scattering Groove Open
   information from `c-PA. Earlier, larger polylysine peptides have been
   used to potentiate activation of t-PA, so while screening short
   polylysine peptides as alternatives to fibrin or larger peptides, we
   found that penta-polylysine (PS) specifically activates t-PA in a
   dose-dependent manner, averaging to almost 3-fold more than in the
   absence of any peptide. SAXS data analysis confirmed that PS does not
   induce association of t-PA molecules, and a narrower peak profile of the
   Kratky plot indicated that PS binding quenches inherent motion in t-PA.
   Shape reconstruction of the PA -/+ P5 revealed that P5 closes the
   ``gap{''} between the two gross domains of t-PA, viz. fused F/E, K1 and
   K2 domains, and the P domain. Docking experiments suggested that, while
   other polylysine peptides preferentially interacted with the surfaces of
   kringle domains, PS ``slipped into{''} the gap/groove between 1(2 and P
   domains, thereby mediating a substantial increase in the number of
   long-range interactions between the 1(2 domain and exosites in the P
   domain. We report here dissection of shape events involved in between
   K-m/K-cat steps of t-PA activation, which can pave the way toward the
   search for small molecule function regulator(s) of t-PA.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeological research on islands of the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Province (GBRMP) only commenced in the mid-to-late 1970s. Initial
   research was exploratory and restricted in scope. Recent research on a
   limited number of island groups has been more focussed. Despite the
   large area and numerous islands some significant issues have been
   identified in respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander use of
   the area. We review these issues here and also highlight others
   requiring ongoing investigation. In particular we focus on the extent of
   Pleistocene and Holocene environmental change within the GBRMP and how
   this affected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander use of the islands.
   While our emphasis is on environmental factors we do not consider them
   the sole cause of change in the archaeological record or in human
   responses. We also address what role population change, culture contact,
   economic adaptation, insularity and other factors played in the complex
   interplay of environment and human adaptation in the GBRMP. (C) 2015

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical analysis of the (p) over bar-Lambda circle plus
   p-(Lambda) over bar correlation function in 10\% most central Au+Au
   collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy root s(NN) =
   200 GeV shows that the contribution of residual correlations is a
   necessary factor for obtaining a satisfactory description of the
   experimental data. Neglecting the residual correlation effect leads to
   an unrealistically low source radius, about 2 times smaller than the
   corresponding value for p-Lambda circle plus (p) over bar-(Lambda) over
   bar case, when one fits the experimental correlation function within
   Lednicky-Lyuboshitz analytical model. Recently an approach that accounts
   effectively for residual correlations for the baryon-antibaryon
   correlation function was proposed, and a good RHIC data description was
   reached with the source radius extracted from the hydrokinetic model
   (HKM). The (p) over bar-Lambda scattering length, as well as the
   parameters characterizing the residual correlation effect-annihilation
   dip amplitude and its inverse width-were extracted from the
   corresponding fit. In this paper we use these extracted values and
   simulated in HKM source functions for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy
   root s(NN) = 2.76 TeV to predict the corresponding p-Lambda and
   p-(Lambda) over bar correlation functions.}},

Title = {{Rationally Targeted Mutations at the V1V2 Domain of the HIV-1 Envelope
   to Augment Virus Neutralization by Anti-V1V2 Monoclonal Antibodies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) are the only viral antigens present
   on the virus surface and serve as the key targets for virus-neutralizing
   antibodies. However, HIV-1 deploys multiple strategies to shield the
   vulnerable sites on its Env from neutralizing antibodies. The V1V2
   domain located at the apex of the HIV-1 Env spike is known to encompass
   highly variable loops, but V1V2 also contains immunogenic conserved
   elements recognized by cross-reactive antibodies. This study evaluates
   human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against V2 epitopes which overlap
   with the conserved integrin alpha 4 beta 7-binding LDV/I motif,
   designated as the V2i (integrin) epitopes. We postulate that the V2i Abs
   have weak or no neutralizing activities because the V2i epitopes are
   often occluded from antibody recognition. To gain insights into the
   mechanisms of the V2i occlusion, we evaluated three elements at the
   distal end of the V1V2 domain shown in the structure of V2i epitope
   complexed with mAb 830A to be important for antibody recognition of the
   V2i epitope. Amino-acid substitutions at position 179 that restore the
   LDV/I motif had minimal effects on virus sensitivity to neutralization
   by most V2i mAbs. However, a charge change at position 153 in the V1
   region significantly increased sensitivity of subtype C virus ZM109 to
   most V2i mAbs. Separately, a disulfide bond introduced to stabilize the
   hypervariable region of V2 loop also enhanced virus neutralization by
   some V2i mAbs, but the effects varied depending on the virus. These data
   demonstrate that multiple elements within the V1V2 domain act
   independently and in a virus-dependent fashion to govern the antibody
   recognition and accessibility of V2i epitopes, suggesting the need for
   multi-pronged strategies to counter the escape and the shielding
   mechanisms obstructing the V2i Abs from neutralizing HIV-1.}},

Abstract = {{Stimuli-responsive biomaterials are used to facilitate drug and gene
   delivery by shielding the drug/gene during circulation times and
   selectively releasing the cargo at the desired target. Within
   stimuli-responsive materials, pH-responsive materials are exploited for
   delivery to specific organs, intracellular compartments, cancer cells,
   site of inflammation or infection as those sites are characterized by pH
   that is different from the blood pH. In this paper we use molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations to design such pH-responsive biomaterials
   where the balance between the various intermolecular interactions (e.g.,
   electrostatics, van der Waals) within the biomaterials allow
   biofunctional molecules to be reversibly shielded and exposed to the
   environment with change in pH. In our model the shielding aspect is
   imparted by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) brush and the pH-responsive
   component is a PEG-tethered oligopeptide that undergoes changes in
   conformations via protonation of residues upon changes in pH. Starting
   with a PEG-tethered peptide in a monodisperse short PEG brush, we first
   vary the composition and sequence of histidine (H), lysine (K), and
   glutamate (E) along the oligopeptide sequence to find the design
   parameters that maximize the shielding and exposure of the oligopeptide
   at pH similar to 7.0 and pH <7.0, respectively. Then, we probe the
   effect of the PEG brush on the conformations of the oligopeptides by
   simulating PEG-tethered peptide in a bimodal PEG brush containing short
   PEG and long PEG chains. We characterize the intermolecular interactions
   involving the PEG, peptide, and solvent that influence the shielded and
   exposed conformations of the oligopeptides at the two different pHs. In
   a short monodisperse PEG brush, with a longer PEG-tethered peptide
   containing large blocks of histidines that undergo change in protonation
   state as a response to pH change, placed between a protonated lysine and
   deprotonated glutamate, the PEG brush exhibits maximum shielding and
   exposure with pH change. This change from shielded to exposed state is
   driven by electrostatic repulsion upon H protonation. The presence of
   long PEG chains in a bimodal PEG brush leads to dominating PEG peptide
   attractive interactions that reduces the contrast in shielded and
   exposed conformations of the PEG-tethered peptide upon protonation of
   histidines.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   contributes to the processing of chronic pain. However, the sources of
   H2S production in the nociceptive system are poorly understood. Here we
   investigated the expression of the H2S releasing enzyme cystathionine
   gamma-lyase (CSE) in the nociceptive system and characterized its role
   in chronic pain signaling using CSE deficient mice. We show that paw
   inflammation and peripheral nerve injury led to upregulation of CSE
   expression in dorsal root ganglia. However, conditional knockout mice
   lacking CSE in sensory neurons as well as global CSE knockout mice
   demonstrated normal pain behaviors in inflammatory and neuropathic pain
   models as compared to WT littermates. Thus, our results suggest that CSE
   is not critically involved in chronic pain signaling in mice and that
   sources different from CSE mediate the pain relevant effects of H2S. (C)

Abstract = {{The general structure of the conformal boundary J(+) of asymptotically
   de Sitter spacetimes is investigated. First we show that Penrose's
   quasi-local mass, associated with a cut. of the conformal boundary, can
   be zero even in the presence of outgoing gravitational radiation. On the
   other hand, following a Witten-type spinorial proof, we show that an
   analogous expression based on the Nester-Witten form is finite only if
   the Witten spinor field solves the two-surface twistor equation on S,
   and it yields a positive functional on the twosurface twistor space on
   S, provided the matter fields satisfy the dominant energy condition.
   Moreover, this functional is vanishing if and only if the domain of
   dependence of the spacelike hypersurface which intersects J(+) in the
   cut. is locally isometric to the de Sitter spacetime. For non-contorted
   cuts this functional yields an invariant analogous to the Bondi mass.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Within a high-magnetic-field approximation, employing Ruelle's algebraic
   perturbation theory, a field-dependent free-energy expression is
   proposed which allows one to determine the magnetic properties of
   ferrofluids modeled as dipolar hard-sphere systems. We compare the
   ensuing magnetization curves, following from this free energy, with
   those obtained by Ivanov and Kuznetsova {[}Phys. Rev. E 64, 041405
   (2001)] as well as with new corresponding Monte Carlo simulation data.
   Based on the power-series expansion of the magnetization, a closed
   expression for the magnetization is also proposed, which is a
   high-density extension of the corresponding equation of Ivanov and
   Kuznetsova. From both magnetization equations the zero-field
   susceptibility expression due to Tani et al. {[}Mol. Phys. 48, 863
   (1983)] can be obtained, which is in good agreement with our MC
   simulation results. From the closed expression for the magnetization the
   second-order nonlinear magnetic susceptibility is also derived, which
   shows fair agreement with the corresponding MC simulation data.}},

Title = {{Nature of the Volume Isotope Effect in Ice}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The substitution of hydrogen (H) by deuterium (D) in ice Ih and in its
   H-ordered version, ice XI, produces an anomalous form of volume isotope
   effect (VIE), i.e., volume expansion. This VIE contrasts with the normal
   VIE (volume contraction) predicted in ice-VIII and in its H-disordered
   form, ice VII. Here we investigate the VIE in ice XI and in ice VIII
   using first principles quasiharmonic calculations. We conclude that
   normal and anomalous VIEs can be produced in ice VIII and ice XI in
   sequence by application of pressure (ice XI starting at negative
   pressures) followed by a third type-anomalous VIE with zero-point volume
   contraction. The latter should also contribute to the isotope effect in
   the ice VII -> ice X transition. The predicted change between normal and
   anomalous VIE in ice VIII at 14.3 GPa and 300 K is well reproduced
   experimentally in ice VII using x-ray diffraction measurements. The
   present discussion of the VIE is general, and conclusions should be
   applicable to other solid phases of H2O, possibly to liquid water under
   pressure, and to other H-bonded materials.}},

Title = {{Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) running the gauntlet: an evaluation of
   translocations into free-range environments in Namibia}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Following dramatic range and population declines, the cheetah is
   Africa's most endangered large felid. In Namibia, private land managers
   still trap cheetahs but increasingly consider moving animals instead of
   killing them. Across Africa, managers have translocated perceived
   conflict carnivores for decades, but rarely evaluated their actions. We
   analyse the outcomes of 15 cheetah translocations (for 23 adults and 10
   dependent offspring) into free-range environments in Namibia. We
   released cheetahs at an average distance of 419.6 km +/- 216.1 km SD
   (range: 71-816 km) after captive periods ranging from 1-1,184 days
   (350.6 days +/- 439.0 days SD). An individual's ability to survive the
   first year predominantly determined the overall translocation success of
   40\%. Post-release conflict and homing had less impact on success.
   Cheetah survival was lowest in the first three months after release.
   Human persecution (50\% of deaths) and spotted hyaenas (29\% of deaths)
   had the highest effect on survival. The degree of habituation to humans
   acquired during captivity significantly influenced chances of survival.
   Cheetahs surviving the initial post-release period (similar to 90 days)
   often settled into ranges and females reproduced successfully. However,
   all individuals exhibited extensive movements, frequently roaming >4,000
   km(2) in the first six months after release (with a maximum of 19,743
   km(2) in 112 days), resulting in low release site fidelity. Soft release
   and larger recipient area size did not improve site fidelity. Based on
   these outcomes, we evaluated which unfenced conservation areas in
   Namibia could potentially receive cheetahs. We found that there are
   currently few public and/or private reserves large enough to contain the
   movement profiles we observed in this study. This suggests that most
   translocations will result in cheetahs re-entering farmlands where they
   face a high risk of persecution. In conclusion, translocations into
   unconfined areas can successfully conserve individual cheetahs. Due to
   high mortality and unpredictable outcomes, however, conservation efforts
   need to focus on improving tolerance of cheetahs in commercial livestock
   and game farming areas in order to reduce the number of indiscriminately
   trapped animals.}},

Title = {{Phase Diagram and High-Temperature Superconductivity of Compressed
   Selenium Hydrides}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (T-c = 190 K) in
   sulfur hydrides at megabar pressures breaks the traditional belief on
   the T-c limit of 40 K for conventional superconductors, and opens up the
   doors in searching new high-temperature superconductors in compounds
   made up of light elements. Selenium is a sister and isoelectronic
   element of sulfur, with a larger atomic core and a weaker
   electronegativity. Whether selenium hydrides share similar
   high-temperature superconductivity remains elusive, but it is a subject
   of considerable interest. First-principles swarm structure predictions
   are performed in an effort to seek for energetically stable and metallic
   selenium hydrides at high pressures. We find the phase diagram of
   selenium hydrides is rather different from its sulfur analogy, which is
   indicated by the emergence of new phases and the change of relative
   stabilities. Three stable and metallic species with stoichiometries of
   HSe2, HSe and H3Se are identified above similar to 120 GPa and they all
   exhibit superconductive behaviors, of which the hydrogen-rich HSe and
   H3Se phases show high T-c in the range of 40-110 K. Our simulations
   established the high-temperature superconductive nature of selenium
   hydrides and provided useful route for experimental verification.}},

Abstract = {{3-O-demethylswertipunicoside (3-ODS) has been reported to protect
   dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxidty induced by
   1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in PC12 cells. Here, we investigate
   the neuroprotectdve effects in vivo and antioxidant activities in vitro
   of 3-ODS. In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine
   (MPTP)-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), 3-ODS
   dose-dependently improved motor coordination (as shown by rotarod test),
   increased the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the
   striatum, and increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TN)-positive
   neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition, 3-ODS also increased
   the spine density in hippocampal CA1 neurons. In antioxidant assays,
   3-ODS showed a strong capacity in scavenging hydroxyl radical,
   superoxide anion and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical in a
   concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, we conclude that 3-ODS
   attenuates the PD-related motor deficits mainly through its
   neuroprotective effects, growth-promoting effects on spine density, and
   its antioxidant activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Health care costs incurred prior to the appropriate patient-provider
   transaction (i.e., transaction costs of access to health care) are
   potential barriers to accessing health care in low- and middle-income
   countries. This paper explores these transaction costs and their
   implications for health system governance through a cross-sectional
   survey of adult patients who received their first diagnosis of pulmonary
   tuberculosis (TB) at the three designated secondary health centres for
   TB care in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The patients provided information on
   their care-seeking pathways and the associated costs prior to reaching
   the appropriate provider. Of the 452 patients, 84\% first consulted an
   inappropriate provider. Only 33\% of inappropriate consultations were
   with qualified providers (QP); the rest were with informal providers
   such as pharmacy providers (PPs; 57\%) and traditional providers (TP;
   10\%). Notably, 62\% of total transaction costs were incurred during the
   first visit to an inappropriate provider and the mean transaction costs
   incurred was highest with QPs (US\$30.20) compared with PPs (US\$14.40)
   and TPs (US\$15.70). These suggest that interventions for reducing
   transaction costs should include effective decentralisation to integrate
   TB care with services at the primary health care level, community
   engagement to address information asymmetry, enforcing regulations to
   keep informal providers within legal limits and facilitating referral
   linkages among formal and informal providers to increase early contact
   with appropriate providers.}},

Abstract = {{People who live in semi-arid regions of India are often faced with
   challenges and constraints of poverty. Foremost among the challenges are
   the marginal environmental conditions for agriculture, often influenced
   by low and erratic rainfall. If a meager amount of rainwater is
   harvested and used sensibly, it could enhance irrigation opportunities
   leading to better agricultural production. However, due to the lack of
   proper water harvesting and distribution structures, most of the surface
   runoff from the rainfall is lost into the rivers. This article presents
   a case study of community-based lift irrigation practiced in the
   ecologically fragile drylands of India, with high potential for a more
   sustainable agriculture that promotes village-level food security.}},

Abstract = {{Ghana Health Service conducted an audit to strengthen the referral
   system for pregnant or recently pregnant women and newborns in northern
   Ghana. The audit took place in 16 facilities with two 3-month cycles of
   data collection in 2011. Midwife-led teams tracked 446 referred women
   until they received definitive treatment. Between the two audit cycles,
   teams identified and implemented interventions to address gaps in
   referral services. During this time period, we observed important
   increases in facilitating referral mechanisms, including a decrease in
   the dependence on taxis in favour of national or facility
   ambulances/vehicles; an increase in health workers escorting referrals
   to the appropriate receiving facility; greater use of referral slips and
   calling ahead to alert receiving facilities and higher feedback rates.
   As referral systems require attention from multiple levels of
   engagement, on the provider end we found that regional managers
   increasingly resolved staffing shortages; district management addressed
   the costliness and lack of transport and increased midwives' ability to
   communicate with pregnant women and drivers; and that facility staff
   increasingly adhered to guidelines and facilitating mechanisms. By
   conducting an audit of maternal and newborn referrals, the Ghana Health
   Service identified areas for improvement that service providers and
   management at multiple levels addressed, demonstrating a platform for
   problem solving that could be a model elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report a target-catalyzed DNA four-way junction (DNA-4WJ) on the
   basis of toehold-mediated DNA strand displacement reaction (TM-SDR),
   which is readily applied in enzyme-free amplified chemiluminescence
   resonance energy transfer (CRET) imaging of microRNA. In this system,
   the introduction of target microRNA-let-7a (miR-let-7a) activates a
   cascade of assembly steps with four DNA hairpins, followed by a
   disassembly step in which the target microRNA is displaced and released
   from DNA-4WJ to catalyze the self-assembly of additional branched
   junctions. As a result, G-quadruplex subunit sequences and fluorophore
   fluorescein amidite (PAM) are encoded in DNA-4WJ in a close proximity,
   stimulating a CRET process in the presence of hemin/K+ to form
   horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzyme that catalyzes the
   generation of luminol/H2O2 chemiluminescence (CL), which further
   transfers to PAM. The background signal is easily reduced using magnetic
   graphene oxide (MGO) to remove unreacted species through magnetic
   separation, which makes a great contribution to improve the detection
   sensitivity and achieves a detection limit as low as 6.9 fM
   microRNA-let-7a (miR-let-7a). In addition, four-input concatenated logic
   circuits with an automatic reset function have been successfully
   constructed relying on the architecture of the proposed DNA-4WJ. More
   importantly, DNA nanohydrogels are self-assembled using DNA-4WJs as
   building units after centrifugation, which are driven by liquid
   crystallization and dense packaging of building units. Moreover, the DNA
   nanohydrogels are readily functionalized by incorporating with aptamers,
   bioimaging agents, and drug loading sites, which thus are served as
   efficient nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy
   with high loading capacity and excellent biocompatibility.}},

Title = {{Does School-Based Health Promotion Affect Physical Activity on Weekends?
   And, Does It Reach Those Students Most in Need of Health Promotion?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To determine whether a school-based health promotion program affects
   children's weekend physical activity and whether this effect varies
   according to socioeconomic-status.
   Methods
   This was a quasi-experimental trial of school-based programs on physical
   activity levels implemented in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Alberta,
   Canada. In 2009 and 2011, 7 full days of pedometer data were collected
   from cross-sectional samples of grade 5 students (age 10-11 years) from
   10 intervention schools in low-socioeconomic neighbourhoods and 20
   comparison schools in middle-socioeconomic neighbourhoods. Multilevel
   models assessed differences in step-counts between intervention and
   comparison groups overtime by weight (objectively measured) and
   socioeconomic status subgroups.
   Results
   In 2009, children from intervention schools were less active on weekends
   relative to comparison schools (9212 vs. 11186 steps/day p<0.01). Two
   years later, daily step-counts on weekend days among children in low
   socioeconomic intervention schools increased such that they approximated
   those of children from middle socioeconomic comparison schools (12148
   vs. 12121 steps/day p = 0.96). The relative difference in steps between
   intervention and comparison schools on weekends reduced from -21.4\% to
   0.2\% following the intervention. The normalization of weekend step
   counts was similar for normal weight (-21.4\% to +2.0\%) and overweight
   (-19.1 to +3.9\%) children, and was balanced across socioeconomic
   subgroups.
   Conclusions
   These data suggest that school-based health promotion is effective for
   reducing inequities in physical activity levels outside school hours.
   Investments in school-based health promotion lead to behavior
   modification beyond the school environment.}},

Title = {{Probing CPT in transitions with entangled neutral kaons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel CPT symmetry test in the neutral kaon
   system based, for the first time, on the direct comparison of the
   probabilities of a transition and its CPT reverse. The required
   interchange of in <-> out states for a given process is obtained
   exploiting the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations of neutral kaon
   pairs produced at a phi-factory. The observable quantities have been
   constructed by selecting the two semileptonic decays for flavour tag,
   the pi and 3 pi(0) decays for CP tag and the time orderings of the decay
   pairs. The interpretation in terms of the standard Weisskopf-Wigner
   approach to this system, directly connects CPT violation in these
   observables to the violating R delta parameter in the mass matrix of K-0
   - (K) over bar (0), a genuine CPT violating effect independent of Delta
   Gamma and not requiring the decay as an essential ingredient.
   Possible spurious effects induced by CP violation in the decay and/or a
   violation of the Delta S = Delta Q rule have been shown to be well under
   control. The proposed test is thus fully robust, and might shed light on
   possible new CPT violating mechanisms, or further improve the precision
   of the present experimental limits. It could be implemented at the DA
   Phi NE facility in Frascati, where the KLOE-2 experiment might reach a
   statistical sensitivity of O (10(-3)) on the newly proposed observable
   quantities.}},

Title = {{Spectroscopy of the neutron-rich actinide nucleus U-240 following
   multinucleon-transfer reactions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nuclear structure information for the neutron-rich actinide
   nuclei is important since it is the benchmark for theoretical models
   that provide predictions for the heaviest nuclei.
   Purpose: gamma-ray spectroscopy of neutron-rich heavy nuclei in the
   actinide region.
   Method: Multinucleon-transfer reactions in Zn-70 + U-238 and Xe-136 +
   U-238 have been measured in two experiments performed at the INFN
   Legnaro, Italy. In the Zn-70 experiment the high-resolution HPGe Clover
   Array (CLARA) coupled to the magnetic spectrometer PRISMA was employed.
   In the Xe-136 experiment the high-resolution Advanced Gamma Tracking
   Array (AGATA) was used in combination with PRISMA and the Detector Array
   for Multinucleon Transfer Ejectiles (DANTE).
   Results: The ground-state band (g.s. band) of U-240 was measured up to
   the 20(+) level and a tentative assignment was made up to the (24(+))
   level. Results from gamma gamma coincidence and from particle
   coincidence analyses are shown. Moments of inertia (MoI) show a clear
   upbend. Evidence for an extended first negative-parity band of U-240 is
   found.
   Conclusions: A detailed comparison with latest calculations shows best
   agreement with cranked relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (CRHB)
   calculations for the g.s. band properties. The negative-parity band
   shows the characteristics of a K-pi = 0 band based on an octupole
   vibration.}},

Abstract = {{A large collection of scalibregmatid polychaetes from the east Antarctic
   Peninsula in May 2000 has yielded specimens of three new species of
   Scalibregma, Pseudoscalibregma, and Oligobregma. The new species of
   Scalibregma is represented by more than 400 specimens that include
   post-larval and juvenile forms which, for the first time, provide data
   on the sequence of development of key characters of a scalibregmatid.
   These data demonstrate that taxonomic characters including the form of
   the prostomium and presence of branchiae develop late in ontogeny and
   that small specimens cannot be reliably referred to a species or genus
   without a growth sequence. Juvenile morphology is also presented for the
   new species of Oligobregma. The new species of Scalibregma is compared
   with five northern hemisphere species and differs in details of the
   peristomium, upper and lower lips of the mouth, dorsal and ventral
   cirri, and nature of the short spinous setae of setiger 1. The new
   species of Pseudoscalibregma is unique in the nature of asymmetrical
   ventral cirri of posterior setigers. The new species of Oligobregma has
   large acicular spines in both noto- and neuropodia and these are present
   in juveniles. However, the final adult configuration of the prostomium
   is not evident until late in development. The taxonomic significance of
   the timing of development of post-larval and juvenile morphology
   elucidated in this study is discussed in relation to the validity of
   certain taxa and the current system of genera used in the family.}},

Abstract = {{Health providers' understanding of disability determines how disabled
   people are treated, and hence it is imperative to address
   conceptualisations of disability, as this will contribute to better
   opportunities and realisation of human rights for disabled people. This
   article will use data from a qualitative study exploring
   conceptualisations of disability by 22 health service providers from the
   total health care system in Malawi, including the professional sector
   (e.g. medical doctors and nurses) and the folk sector (healers and
   indigenous practices). We will discuss how these perceptions influence
   the lives of disabled people, using the case of a health service user
   with physical and speech impairment as an example. Our data show that
   health providers largely conceptualise disability according to the
   medical model for disability, contributing to the exclusion of disabled
   people. The bio-psycho-social model for disability, largely absent as an
   explanatory model for disability among our informants, is the most
   inclusive and rights based.}},

Abstract = {{We present wide-field observations of the NGC 2264 molecular cloud in
   the dust continuum at 850 and 450 mu m using SCUBA-2 on the James Clerk
   Maxwell Telescope. Using (CO)-C-12 3 -> 2 molecular line data, we
   determine that emission from CO contaminates the 850 mu m emission at
   levels similar to 30 per cent in localized regions associated with
   high-velocity molecular outflows. Much higher contamination levels of 60
   per cent are seen in shocked regions near the massive star S Mon. If not
   removed, the levels of CO contamination would contribute an extra 13 per
   cent to the dust mass in NGC 2264. We use the FELLWALKER routine to
   decompose the dust into clumpy structures, and a Hessian-based routine
   to decompose the dust into filamentary structures. The filaments can be
   described as a hub-filament structure, with lower column density
   filaments radiating from the NGC 2264 C protocluster hub. Above mean
   filament column densities of 2.4 x 10(22) cm(-2), star formation
   proceeds with the formation of two or more protostars. Below these
   column densities, filaments are starless, or contain only a single
   protostar.}},

Abstract = {{Granule cell-mediated inhibition is critical to patterning principal
   neuron activity in the olfactory bulb, and perturbation of synaptic
   input to granule cells significantly alters olfactory-guided behavior.
   Despite the critical role of granule cells in olfaction, little is known
   about how sensory input recruits granule cells. Here, we combined
   whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse olfactory bulb
   slices with biophysical multicompartmental modeling to investigate the
   synaptic basis of granule cell recruitment. Physiological activation of
   sensory afferents within single glomeruli evoked diverse modes of
   granule cell activity, including subthreshold depolarization, spikelets,
   and suprathreshold responses with widely distributed spike latencies.
   The generation of these diverse activity modes depended, in part, on the
   asynchronous time course of synaptic excitation onto granule cells,
   which lasted several hundred milliseconds. In addition to asynchronous
   excitation, each granule cell also received synchronous feedforward
   inhibition. This inhibition targeted both proximal somatodendritic and
   distal apical dendritic domains of granule cells, was reliably recruited
   across sniff rhythms, and scaled in strength with excitation as more
   glomeruli were activated. Feedforward inhibition onto granule cells
   originated from deep short-axon cells, which responded to glomerular
   activation with highly reliable, short-latency firing consistent with
   tufted cell-mediated excitation. Simulations showed that feedforward
   inhibition interacts with asynchronous excitation to broaden granule
   cell spike latency distributions and significantly attenuates granule
   cell depolarization within local subcellular compartments. Collectively,
   our results thus identify feedforward inhibition onto granule cells as a
   core feature of olfactory bulb circuitry and establish asynchronous
   excitation and feedforward inhibition as critical regulators of granule
   cell activity.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{To solve computationally intensive and technically complex control of
   nonpoint source pollution, the traditional genetic algorithm was
   modified into an auto-adaptive pattern, and a new framework was proposed
   by integrating this new algorithm with a watershed model and an economic
   module. Although conceptually simple and comprehensive, the proposed
   algorithm would search automatically for those Pareto-optimality
   solutions without a complex calibration of optimization parameters. The
   model was applied in a case study in a typical watershed of the Three
   Gorges Reservoir area, China. The results indicated that the
   evolutionary process of optimization was improved due to the
   incorporation of auto-adaptive parameters. In addition, the proposed
   algorithm outperformed the state-of-the-art existing algorithms in terms
   of convergence ability and computational efficiency. At the same cost
   level, solutions with greater pollutant reductions could be identified.
   From a scientific viewpoint, the proposed algorithm could be extended to
   other watersheds to provide cost-effective configurations of BMPs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The tendency to reproduce figures close to or superimposed
   on the model in copying tasks, the so-called Closing-in (CI) phenomenon,
   has been rarely reported in individuals affected by Parkinson's disease
   and associated dementia (PD-D). We aimed to comprehend the genesis of CI
   in PD-D individuals by assessing whether reduction of
   attention/executive resources can increase the tendency to deviate
   toward the model. Method: Thirty PD-D individuals underwent a
   neuropsychological evaluation exploring visuo-spatial,
   visuo-constructional, executive and memory abilities. An experimental
   copying task was employed in single and in two dual task conditions to
   assess whether a (verbal) cognitive load can increase CI in these
   individuals, compared with a matched sample of healthy adults. Results:
   CI occurred in 19/30 (63.3\%) PD-D individuals: 4 of them produced
   copies close to the model (near-CI), whereas 15 individuals also
   superimposed their copies on the model (adherent-CI) besides showing
   near-CI. Presence of CI in PD-D individuals was significantly correlated
   with executive dysfunction but not with general cognitive impairment. In
   the experimental copying task the tendency to deviate toward the model
   was strongly correlated with executive dysfunction, and significantly
   increased when PD-D individuals were engaged in dual-task compared with
   single task conditions. Some individuals attempted to counteract CI, but
   this trend significantly decreased in dual-task compared with the single
   task conditions. In healthy adults the drift toward the model was
   significantly smaller than in PD-D individuals; in dual-task conditions
   healthy adults only showed a significant decrease in their ability to
   compensate for this drift. Conclusions: In PD-D individuals the tendency
   to deviate toward a salient model is strongly enhanced by a concurrent
   cognitive load. Such preliminary findings would suggest a relationship
   between reduction of executive attentional resources and the genesis of
   CI in PD-D individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Despite the potential for recreational drugs and new
   psychoactive substances (NPSs) to cause significant morbidity and
   mortality, there is limited collection of systematic data on acute
   drug/NPS toxicity in Europe. Objective. To report data on acute drug/NPS
   toxicity collected by a network of sentinel centres across Europe with a
   specialist clinical and research interest in the acute toxicity of
   recreational drugs and NPS to address this knowledge gap. Methods.
   Sixteen sentinel centres in 10 European countries (Denmark, Estonia,
   France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the UK)
   collected data on all acute drug toxicity presentations to their
   Emergency Rooms (ERs) for 12 months (October 2013-September 2014);
   information on the drug(s) involved in the presentations was on the
   basis of patient self-reporting. Results. Data were collected on a total
   of 5529 presentations involving 8709 drugs (median (interquartile range
   {[}IQR]): 1 (1-2) drugs per presentation), a median of 0.3\% of all ER
   attendances. Classical recreational drugs were most common (64.6\%)
   followed by prescription drugs (26.5\%) and NPS (5.6\%). The top five'
   drugs recorded were heroin (1345 reports), cocaine (957), cannabis
   (904), GHB/GBL (711) and amphetamine (593). 69.5\% of individuals went
   to hospital by ambulance (peak time between 19:00 and 02:00 at
   weekends); the median (IQR) age was 31 (24-39) years and 75.4\% were
   male. Although serious clinical features were not seen in most
   presentations and 56.9\% were medically discharged from the ER (median
   length of stay: 4.6 hours), a significant number (26.5\%) was agitated,
   in 10.5\% the GCS was 8 or less and 35 presented in cardiac arrest.
   There were 27 fatalities with opioids implicated in 13. Conclusion. The
   Euro-DEN dataset provides a unique insight into the drugs involved in
   and clinical pattern of toxicity/outcome of acute recreational drug
   toxicity presentations to hospitals around Europe. This is complimentary
   to other indicators of drug-related harm and helps to build a fuller
   picture of the public health implications of drug use in Europe.}},

   The combination of astaxanthin and lycopene gave optimal protection

   donation. Quenching of singlet oxygen by carotenoids close to

Abstract = {{We extend the definition of the electronic chemical potential (mu(e))
   and chemical hardness (eta(e)) to finite temperatures by considering a
   reactive chemical species as a true open system to the exchange of
   electrons, working exclusively within the framework of the grand
   canonical ensemble. As in the zero temperature derivation of these
   descriptors, the response of a chemical reagent to electron-transfer is
   determined by the response of the (average) electronic energy of the
   system, and not by intrinsic thermodynamic properties like the chemical
   potential of the electron-reservoir which is, in general, different from
   the electronic chemical potential, mu(e). Although the dependence of the
   electronic energy on electron number qualitatively resembles the
   piecewise-continuous straight-line profile for low electronic
   temperatures (up to ca. 5000 K), the introduction of the temperature as
   a free variable smoothens this profile, so that derivatives (of all
   orders) of the average electronic energy with respect to the average
   electron number exist and can be evaluated analytically. Assuming a
   three-state ensemble, well-known results for the electronic chemical
   potential at negative (-I), positive (-A), and zero values of the
   fractional charge (-(I + A)/2) are recovered. Similarly, in the zero
   temperature limit, the chemical hardness is formally expressed as a
   Dirac delta function in the particle number and satisfies the well-known
   reciprocity relation with the global softness. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Microbial population dynamics during long-term sludge adaptation of
   thermophilic and mesophilic sequencing batch digesters treating sewage
   fine sieved fraction at varying organic loading rates}},

Abstract = {{Background: In this research, the feasibility of, and population
   dynamics in, one-step anaerobic sequencing batch reactor systems
   treating the fine sieved fraction (FSF) from raw municipal wastewater
   was studied under thermophilic (55 degrees C) and mesophilic (35 degrees
   C) conditions. FSF was sequestered from raw municipal wastewater, in the
   Netherlands, using a rotating belt filter (mesh size 350 micron). FSF is
   a heterogeneous substrate that mainly consists of fibres originating
   from toilet paper and thus contains a high cellulosic fraction (60-80 \%
   of total solids content), regarded as an energy-rich material.
   Results: Results of the 656-day fed-batch operation clearly showed that
   thermophilic digestion was more stable, applying high organic loading
   rates (OLR) up to 22 kg COD/(m(3) day). In contrast, the mesophilic
   digester already failed applying an OLR of 5.5 kg COD/(m(3) day),
   indicated by a drop in pH and increase in volatile fatty acids (VFAs).
   The observed viscosity values of the mesophilic sludge were more than
   tenfold higher than the thermophilic sludge. 454-pyrosequencing of eight
   mesophilic and eight thermophilic biomass samples revealed that
   Bacteroides and aceticlastic methanogen Methanosaeta were the dominant
   genera in the mesophilic digester, whereas OP9 lineages, Clostridium and
   the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanothermobacter dominated the
   thermophilic one.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that applying thermophilic conditions
   for FSF digestion would result in a higher biogas production rate and/or
   a smaller required reactor volume, comparing to mesophilic conditions.}},

Title = {{Observation of Exchange Anisotropy in Single-Phase Layer-Structured
   Oxides with Long Periods}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{A remarkable exchange bias effect arising from the temperature-dependent
   interaction among the ferromagnetic-like cluster glasses and
   antiferromagnetic regions was observed in a newly developed single-phase
   multiferroic compound of Bi10Fe6Ti3O30 which has a nine-layer
   Aurivillius structure. Inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic Fe ions
   inside this long-period layered structure was experimentally identified
   via the atomic level imaging. The results confirmed the presence of the
   short-range magnetic ordering (the cluster glassy state) and the canted
   antiferromagnetism, and then the direct interaction among them was
   further confirmed. Finding of this new single-phase material
   accompanying this remarkable exchange bias effect would be beneficial to
   both basic physics understanding and the potential device development.}},
