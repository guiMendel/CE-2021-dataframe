Abstract = {{Although cratons have long been recognized as an important part of
   continental tectonic processes, we still have much to learn about their
   structural features and their relation to the genesis of basins,
   sedimentary thickness distributions, fold and thrust belts and surface
   processes. Contributing to a better knowledge of the crustal state and
   configuration of the southernmost part of the Rio de la Plata Craton,
   could shed light on the still controversial tectonic processes, which
   were responsible for the deformation of the southwestern margin of
   Gondwana during the Late Paleozoic. In particular, the deformation and
   uplift of the Sierras Australes, which are part of the Claromeco Basin
   (Buenos Aires, Argentina), would be closely related to the crustal
   structure of the southern limit of the Rio de la Plata Craton.
   Therefore, it is of crucial importance to investigate the possible
   existence of crustal heterogeneities underneath the Claromeco Basin, the
   Sierras Australes and the Colorado Basin, which can be related to
   structural features and weakness zones that could have played a major
   role in the tectonic evolution of the study area. For this purpose, we
   developed a 3D lithospheric-scale density model integrating various
   data, such as geological information, global gravity models, well data
   (thicknesses and lithologies), seismic tomography data (Moho depth), and
   pre-existing 3D density models of the Colorado Basin. Our model includes
   layers of sediments, crystalline crust and lithospheric mantle and
   therefore predicts the thickness variation of the upper and lower crust
   in the study area and of the main sedimentary sequences infilling the
   basins. Moreover, by analysing the model results, we propose a tentative
   location of the southern limit of the Rio de la Plata Craton and its
   possible tectonic relationship with transfer zones identified in the
   Atlantic platform southwards. Our results suggest that the southern
   boundary of the craton is located along the northernmost limit of the
   Colorado Basin, which is in contrast with the boundary proposed in
   previous works. Therefore, we propose that the Colorado Basin rifting
   process could have occurred along this weakness domain.}},

Abstract = {{A large F2 cross with 920 Japanese quail was used to map QTL for
   phosphorus utilization, calcium utilization, feed per gain and body
   weight gain. In addition, four bone ash traits were included, because it
   is known that they are genetically correlated with the focal trait of
   phosphorus utilization. Trait recording was done at the juvenile stage
   of the birds. The individuals were genotyped genome-wide for about 4k
   SNPs and a linkage map constructed, which agreed well with the reference
   genome. QTL linkage mapping was performed using multimarker regression
   analysis in a line cross model. Single marker association mapping was
   done within the mapped QTL regions. The results revealed several
   genome-wide significant QTL. For the focal trait phosphorus utilization,
   a QTL on chromosome CJA3 could be detected by linkage mapping, which was
   substantiated by the results of the SNP association mapping. Four
   candidate genes were identified for this QTL, which should be
   investigated in future functional studies. Some overlap of QTL regions
   for different traits was detected, which is in agreement with the
   corresponding genetic correlations. It seems that all traits
   investigated are polygenic in nature with some significant QTL and
   probably many other small-effect QTL that were not detectable in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in
   ecosystems globally. Many suggestions have been made about the role that
   biofilms colonizing plastics in the environment-termed the
   ``Plastisphere{''}-may play in the transportation and ecological impact
   of these plastics. By collecting and re-analyzing all raw 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing and metadata from 2,229 samples within 35 studies, we have
   performed the first meta-analysis of the Plastisphere in marine,
   freshwater, other aquatic (e.g., brackish or aquaculture) and
   terrestrial environments. We show that random forest models can be
   trained to differentiate between groupings of environmental factors as
   well as aspects of study design, but-crucially-also between plastics
   when compared with control biofilms and between different plastic types
   and community successional stages. Our meta-analysis confirms that
   potentially biodegrading Plastisphere members, the hydrocarbonoclastic
   Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales are consistently more abundant in
   plastic than control biofilm samples across multiple studies and
   environments. This indicates the predilection of these organisms for
   plastics and confirms the urgent need for their ability to biodegrade
   plastics to be comprehensively tested. We also identified key knowledge
   gaps that should be addressed by future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Drought-related forest growth declines are observed globally in main
   forest types, especially with repeatedly hot droughts. Therefore,
   quantifying forest resilience and identifying the factors driving
   resilience in response to extreme drought with the consideration of
   atmospheric CO2 fertilization is crucial for the accurate assessment of
   forest dynamics under current climate change, particularly for the
   widespread and climate-sensitive spruce forests in the arid Tianshan
   Mountains, China. Here, we explored the growth response of Schrenk
   spruce (Picea schrenkiana) to six extreme drought events since 1900, and
   investigated how tree resilience in pure stands is related to local
   drought intensity, cambial age (CA), and intrinsic water-use efficiency
   (iWUE). Specifically, we found that spruce trees had a mean resistance
   (Rt) value of less than 1, with iWUE contributing less to Rt variation.
   The results are in agreement with the drought-induced limitations on
   tree growth in response to increasing CO2, in spite of rising iWUE
   trends. However, increased iWUE has significant and positive impacts on
   the recovery (17\%) and resilience (15\%) of trees, suggesting that
   increased iWUE enhances the restoration of Schrenk spruce growth after
   extreme drought events. The growth resilience indices of Schrenk spruce
   showed that juvenile and adult trees exhibit different strategies to
   mitigate the drought influences. This study indicated that tree age,
   climate conditions, and variation in iWUE should be considered
   simultaneously in drought resilience evaluations to assess forest
   dynamics objectively in relation to climate change (i.e., drought) and
   propose appropriate forest management strategies.}},

Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{47}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ethanol is preferred to be oxidized into CO2 for the construction of a
   high-performance direct ethanol fuel cell since this complete ethanol
   oxidation reaction (EOR) transfers 12 electrons. However, this EOR is
   sluggish and has the low activity as well as poor selectivity. To
   promote such a favorable EOR, more exactly the cleavage selectivity of
   C-C bonds in ethanol, phosphorus-doped silver-core-and-Pd-shell
   catalysts (denoted as Ag@PdP) are designed and synthesized. In the
   alkaline media, a Ag@Pd2P0.2 catalyst is superior toward EOR into CO2.
   It exhibits seven times higher mass activity and six times higher
   selectivity than the benchmark Pd/C catalyst. As confirmed by means of
   density functional theory calculation and in situ Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy, such high performance stems from an increased
   adsorption energy of OH radicals on the Pd active sites. Meanwhile, the
   tensile strain effect of a core-shell structure of this Ag@Pd2P0.2
   catalyst favors the formation of adsorbed CH3CO intermediate, the key
   species for the enhanced C-C cleavage into CO2, instead of acetate. The
   proposed way to design and synthesize such high-performance EOR
   catalysts will explore the practical applications of direct alkaline
   ethanol fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{Upon herbivore attack, plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles
   (HIPVs). HIPVs can prime defences and resistance of intact plants.
   However, how HIPVs are decoded and translated into functional defence
   responses is not well understood, especially in long-lived woody plants.
   Here, we investigated the impact of the aromatic HIPV indole on
   defence-related early signalling, phytohormone accumulation, secondary
   metabolite biosynthesis and herbivore resistance in tea plants. We find
   that tea plants infested with tea geometrid caterpillars release indole
   at concentrations >450 ng{*}hr(-1). Exposure to corresponding doses of
   synthetic indole primes the expression of early defence genes involved
   in calcium (Ca2+) signalling, MPK signalling and jasmonate biosynthesis.
   Indole exposure also primes the production of jasmonates and
   defence-related secondary metabolites. These changes are associated with
   higher herbivore resistance of indole-exposed tea plants. Chemical
   inhibition of Ca2+ and jasmonate signalling provides evidence that both
   are required for indole-mediated defence priming and herbivore
   resistance. Our systematic assessment of the impact of indole on defence
   signalling and deployment shows that indole acts by boosting Ca2+
   signalling, resulting in enhanced jasmonate-dependent defence and
   resistance in a woody plant. Our work extends the molecular basis of
   HIPV-induced defence priming from annual plants to an economically
   important tree species.}},

   the Effect of Muscle Contraction}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are accompanied by
   masticatory muscle-related pain, making it meaningful to assess the
   stiffness of the masticatory muscles. The present study investigated the
   intra- and inter-operator reliabilities of MyotonPRO for assessing the
   elasticity of masseter muscles, to determine minimal detectable changes,
   and to quantify changes in stiffness from conditions of relaxation to
   maximal contraction.
   Material/Methods: Twenty healthy subjects (10 men and 10 women) were
   recruited. The stiffness of their masseter muscles was quantified with
   MyotonPRO in both relaxed and maximal contraction conditions. Two
   experienced operators (A and B) measured stiffness on the same day, and
   operator A repeated this procedure 5 days later.
   Results: Intra-rater reliability was good (ICC=0.78) and inter-operator
   reliability was excellent (ICC=0.95) for assessing masseter muscle
   stiffness with MyotonPRO. The mean stiffness of the masseter muscle on
   the dominant side was 369.5 N/m under relaxed conditions and 618.3 N/m
   at maximum bite force, an increase of 67.4\%. Stiffness on the dominant
   and non-dominant sides did not differ significantly under both
   conditions (P>0.05).
   Conclusions: MyotonPRO is a reliable method for quantifying the
   stiffness of the masseter muscle and monitoring its changes under
   different contraction conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutically targeting CD138, a define multiple myeloma (MM) antigen,
   is not yet approved for patients. We here developed and determined the
   preclinical efficacy of VIS832, a novel therapeutic monoclonal antibody
   (MoAb) with differentiated CD138 target binding to BB4 that is
   anti-CD138 MoAb scaffold for indatuximab ravtansine (BT062). VIS832
   demonstrated enhanced CD138-binding avidity and significantly improved
   potency to kill MM cell lines and autologous patient MM cells regardless
   of resistance to current standard-of-care therapies, via robust
   antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis mediated by NK
   and macrophage effector cells, respectively. Specifically,
   CD38-targeting daratumumab-resistant MM cells were highly susceptible to
   VIS832 which, unlike daratumumab, spares NK cells. Superior maximal
   cytolysis of VIS832 vs. daratumumab corresponded to higher CD138 vs.
   CD38 levels in MM cells. Furthermore, VIS832 acted synergistically with
   lenalidomide or bortezomib to deplete MM cells. Importantly, VIS832 at a
   sub-optimal dose inhibited disseminated MM1S tumors in vivo as
   monotherapy (P < 0.0001), and rapidly eradicated myeloma burden in all
   mice concomitantly receiving bortezomib, with 100\% host survival. Taken
   together, these data strongly support clinical development of VIS832,
   alone and in combination, for the therapeutic treatment of MM in
   relapsed and refractory patients while pointing to its potential
   therapeutic use earlier in disease intervention.}},

Title = {{Modeling of the filtered drag force in gas-solid flows via a deep
   learning approach}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{A deep learning approach based on a proposed artificial neural network
   (ANN) is exploited to predict the filtered drag force, which is a
   desirable term for coarse-grid simulations of gas-solid flows. The
   proposed ANN model includes one input layer, five hidden layers and one
   output layer. The hidden layers are composed of three convolutional
   layers and two fully-connected layers. The results show that the
   proposed ANN model is superior to the multi-layered perceptron (MLP)
   model and the best available traditional functional model over a wide
   range of the filter size. The results also indicate that the use of the
   information on neighboring coarse grids is necessary for accurate
   estimation of the filtered drag force at the considered filter sizes.
   This finding is substantiated by a budget analysis which demonstrates
   that the diffusion of the Reynolds stress and solid phase stress
   significantly affects the filtered drag force. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {{59-80}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new methodology to estimate/update and forecast dynamic
   real time origin-destination travel matrices (OD) for a public transport
   corridor is presented. The main objective is to use available historical
   data, and combine it with online information regarding the entry and
   exit of each particular user (e.g. through the fare system, FS), to make
   predictions and updates for the OD matrices. The proposed methodology
   consists of two parts: (1) an estimation algorithm for OD matrices of
   public transport (EODPT), and (2) a prediction algorithm (PODPT) based
   on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The EODPT is based on a model that
   incorporates the travel time distribution between OD pairs and the
   modeling of the travel destination choice as a multinomial distribution,
   which is updated using a Bayesian approach with new available
   information. This approach makes it possible to correct the estimates of
   both the current OD interval matrices and of preceding intervals. The
   proposed approach was tested using actual demand data for the Metro of
   Valparaiso corridor in Chile (Merval), and simulated travel information
   in the corridor. The results are compared favorably with a static
   approach and can support the use of this methodology in real
   applications. The execution times obtained in the test cases do not
   exceed 10 s.}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, great efforts have been made in the development
   of 3D cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors operating at room
   temperature for gamma-ray spectroscopic imaging. This work presents the
   spectroscopic performance of new high-resolution CZT drift strip
   detectors, recently developed at IMEM-CNR of Parma (Italy) in
   collaboration with due2lab (Italy). The detectors (19.4 mm x 19.4 mm x 6
   mm) are organized into collecting anode strips (pitch of 1.6 mm) and
   drift strips (pitch of 0.4 mm) which are negatively biased to optimize
   electron charge collection. The cathode is divided into strips
   orthogonal to the anode strips with a pitch of 2 mm. Dedicated pulse
   processing analysis was performed on a wide range of collected and
   induced charge pulse shapes using custom 32-channel digital readout
   electronics. Excellent room-temperature energy resolution (1.3\% FWHM at
   662 keV) was achieved using the detectors without any spectral
   corrections. Further improvements (0.8\% FWHM at 662 keV) were also
   obtained through a novel correction technique based on the analysis of
   collected-induced charge pulses from anode and drift strips. These
   activities are in the framework of two Italian research projects on the
   development of spectroscopic gamma-ray imagers (10-1000 keV) for
   astrophysical and medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Current uncertainties about the similarity between human
   diseases and their experimental models are hampering the development of
   new therapies. This is especially the case for diabetic kidney disease
   (DKD), the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease. To better
   understand the nature of the commonality between humans and their mouse
   models, we posed the question: in diabetic kidney disease are
   transcriptional profiles primarily disease-specific or species-specific?
   Methods: We performed a meta-comparison of the glomerular transcriptomic
   characteristics of 133 human and 66 mouse samples including five human
   kidney diseases and five mouse models, validating expression patterns of
   a central node by immunohistochemistry.
   Findings: Principal component analysis controlled for mouse background,
   revealed that gene expression changes in glomeruli from humans with DKD
   are more similar to those of diabetic mice than they are to other human
   glomerular diseases. This similarity enabled the construction of a
   discriminatory classifier that distinguishes diabetic glomeruli from
   other glomerular phenotypes regardless of their species of origin. To
   identify where the commonality between mice and humans with diabetes
   lies, networks of maximally perturbed protein interactions were
   examined, identifying a central role for the epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR). By immunohistochemical staining, we found EGFR to be
   approximately doubled in its glomerular expression in both humans and
   mice.
   Interpretation: These findings indicate that diabetic mouse models do
   mimic some of the features of human kidney disease, at least with
   respect to their glomerular transcriptomic signatures, and they identify
   EGFR as being a central player in this inter-species overlap. Crown

Abstract = {{It is well known that the chemical precipitation is regarded as an
   effective approach for the preparation of nano-materials. Nevertheless,
   it represented several drawbacks, including high energy demand, high
   cost, and high toxicity. This work investigated the eco-sustainable
   application of plant-derived urease enzyme (PDUE)-urea mixture for
   synthesizing Zn-/Zr-carbonates and -oxides nanoparticles. Hydrozincite
   nanosheets and spherical-shaped Zr-carbonate nano-particles were
   produced after adding PDUE-urea mixture to the dissolved Zn and Zr
   salts, respectively. PDUE not only acts as a motivator for urea
   hydrolysis, but it is also used as a dispersing agent for the
   precipitated nano-carbonates. The exposure of these carbonates to 500
   degrees C for 2 h has resulted in the production of the relevant oxides.
   The retention time (after mixing urea with urease enzyme) is the
   dominant parameter which positively affects the yield\% of the
   nano-materials, as confirmed by statistical analyses. Compared with
   traditional chemical-precipitation, the proposed method exhibited higher
   efficiency in the formation of nano-materials with smaller particle size
   and higher homogeneity. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Liver reserve affects survival in hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC). Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is used to predict
   overall survival (OS) and to prioritize HCC patients on the
   transplantation waiting list, but more accurate models are needed. We
   hypothesized that integrating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
   levels into MELD score (MELD-IGF-1) improves OS prediction as compared
   to MELD. Methods: We measured plasma IGF-1 levels in training (n = 310)
   and validation (n = 155) HCC cohorts and created MELD-IGF-1 score. Cox
   models were used to determine the association of MELD and MELD-IGF-1
   with OS. Harrell's c-index was used to compare the predictive capacity.
   Results: IGF-1 was significantly associated with OS in both cohorts.
   Patients with an IGF-1 level of <= 26 ng/mL in the training cohort and
   in the validation cohorts had significantly higher hazard ratios than
   patients with the same MELD but IGF-1 >26 ng/mL. In both cohorts,
   MELD-IGF-1 scores had higher c-indices (0.60 and 0.66) than MELD scores
   (0.58 and 0.60) (p < 0.001 in both cohorts). Overall, 26\% of training
   and 52.9\% of validation cohort patients were reclassified into
   different risk groups by MELD-IGF-1 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: After
   independent validation, the MELD-IGF-1 could be used to risk-stratify
   patients in clinical trials and for priority assignment for patients on
   liver transplantation waiting list.}},

Abstract = {{Bone injuries that arise from trauma, cancer treatment, or infection are
   a major and growing global challenge. An increasingly ageing population
   plays a key role in this, since a growing number of fractures are due to
   diseases such as osteoporosis, which place a burden on healthcare
   systems. Current reparative strategies do not sufficiently consider
   cell-substrate interactions that are found in healthy tissues;
   therefore, the need for more complex models is clear. The creation of in
   vitro defined 3D microenvironments is an emerging
   topographically-orientated approach that provides opportunities to apply
   knowledge of cell migration and differentiation mechanisms to the
   creation of new cell substrates. Moreover, introducing biofunctional
   agents within in vitro models for bone regeneration has allowed, to a
   certain degree, the control of cell fate towards osteogenic pathways. In
   this research, we applied three methods for functionalizing
   spatially-confined electrospun artificial microenvironments that
   presented relevant components of the native bone stem cell niche. The
   biological and osteogenic behaviors of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
   were investigated on electrospun micro-fabricated scaffolds
   functionalized with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (collagen I),
   glycosaminoglycans (heparin), and ceramic-based materials (bioglass).
   Collagen, heparin, and bioglass (BG) were successfully included in the
   models without modifying the fibrous structures offered by the
   polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were
   successfully seeded in all the biofunctional scaffolds and they showed
   an increase in alkaline phosphatase production when exposed to PCL/BG
   composites. This research demonstrates the feasibility of manufacturing
   smart and hierarchical artificial microenvironments for studying stem
   cell behavior and ultimately the potential of incorporating these
   artificial microenvironments into multifunctional membranes for bone
   tissue regeneration}},

Abstract = {{Self-excitation of acoustic resonance in axisymmetric cavities can lead

   of various excitable acoustic modes in an axisymmetric shallow cavity
   configuration with an aspect ratio of L/d = 1 over the lock-in region.
   The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved at a resolution
   sufficient to capture the flow and the acoustic dynamics. The excitation
   of three acoustic modes of different aerodynamic characteristics over
   the range of the tested flow velocities was observed. These modes are a
   stationary diametral mode, a spinning diametral mode, and a longitudinal
   mode. The initiation and separation of vortices over the cavity mouth
   accompanying the self-excitation of each mode involve different
   dynamics. If two antisymmetric series of vortical crescents separate
   successively at the leading edge, a stationary acoustic mode is excited.
   The formation of a continuously rotating helical vortex, connecting the
   leading edge and the trailing edge, leads to the excitation of the
   diametral spinning mode. The excitation of the longitudinal mode is
   associated with symmetric rings of vortices. Complex patterns of flow
   velocities and Reynolds stresses in the circumferential direction are
   observed for the diametral modes but not for the longitudinal mode. In
   all cases, the excitation of acoustic resonance requires a
   synchronization of the vortex separation and impingement processes,
   which is necessary for efficient feedback to sustain the flow-sound
   coupling mechanism.}},

Title = {{Field and Modeling Study on Saving Mineral Fertilizers, Increasing Farm

   Water from Fish Farms}},
Journal = {{WATER}},

Abstract = {{The reuse of new and non-traditional sources of water for the purpose of
   irrigation is the primary goal of all countries that are located in dry
   areas and suffer from water scarcity, including Egypt in particular.
   This study was conducted to determine the appropriateness and quantify
   the benefits of using fish farm wastewater (DWFF), as an alternative to
   fresh irrigation water (IW), for the irrigation of barley. Two types of
   water quality were tested for the irrigation of barley, namely DWFF and
   IW, in addition to four levels of fertilization rates, 100\%N, 80\%N,
   60\%N, and 40\%N, where 100\%N represents 156 kg of nitrogen per
   hectare. The results showed a positive effect of increasing the nitrogen
   fertilization rate with irrigation water on the crop with the use of
   DWFF and IW for irrigating barley in two seasons: 2017/2018 and
   2018/2019. The yield when using DWFF for the irrigation of barley was
   higher than the yield when using IW, which was in the range of 5.1\% and
   25.9\% in 2017/2018 and between 9.8\% and 33.3\% in 2018/2019. This was
   due to the additional amount of dissolved biological nitrogen and other
   nutrients contained in DWFF. Notably, an additional amount of dissolved
   nitrogen is inherent in DWFF (12.81 kg nitrogen ha(-1) in 2017/2018 and
   12.43 kg nitrogen ha(-1) in 2018/2019) and other elements, such as
   phosphorus and potassium, which are two macronutrients for crops. The
   SALTMED model was used to simulate soil moisture content, water
   application efficiency, nitrogen concentration in the soil layer in the
   effective root zone, N uptake, the dry matter of grown barley, and yield
   and water productivity for all treatments, with R-2 values of 0.94,
   0.89, 0.99, 0.916, 0.89, 0.915, and 0.919 respectively. The research
   concluded that the use of DWFF is an effective alternative to IW for
   irrigating barley. It also helped to achieve higher yields while
   applying lower amounts of IW and chemical fertilizers. There are also
   additional benefits, such as reducing the drainage to the drainage
   network and increasing the income of farmers.}},

   welfare of renewable-based distribution networks considering risk
   analysis}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, a progressive increase in the penetration of dispersal
   renewable energies in electricity markets has imposed many serious
   challenges such as congestion of lines, customer dissatisfaction, and
   disassembly of nodal prices. To counter these problems, this article
   examines merchant cryogenic energy storage (CES) along with renewable
   resources to relieve the congestion of distribution systems considering
   distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP). Moreover, a novel
   reconfiguration mechanism has been incorporated into the model to
   increase the performance of CES in smoothing DLMP. The proposed problem
   is formulated to alleviate the possible congestion aimed at maximizing
   the social welfare of the system while meeting the environmental
   constraints. To deal with uncertainty subject to renewable generation,
   and efficient risk-constrained stochastic programming is extended
   employing the conditional value-at-risk index to create a meaningful
   trade-off between the expected profit and the risk of exposure to the
   uncertainty. In the end, the simulation was demonstrated on the IEEE
   33-bus and 118-bus distribution systems to prove the efficacy of the
   proposed method. The results evidenced that the proposed approach not
   only alleviates the congestion of network but also can smooth the LMPs
   at different locations.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of present study consist of collecting more information on the
   geochemistry of the Varzob river unconsolidated sediments as reflecting
   the diversity of the South-Hissar range together with a comprehensive
   evaluation of the anthropogenic contamination of the same sediments.
   Accordingly, the content of nine major, rock forming elements - Na, Mg,
   Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn and Fe as well as of other 27 trace ones - Sc, V,
   Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Sb, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd,
   Tb, Yb, Hf, Ta, W, Th, and U was determined by Epithermal Neutron
   Activation Analysis. A special attention was given to potential heavy
   contaminants - V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Sb and Ba whose content was
   used to calculate more environmental contamination proxies i.e.
   contamination factor, geoaccumulation, and pollution load indices. At
   the same time, the content of Cr, Ni, Sc, Zr, REE, Th and U were used to
   establish the nature and origin of recent sediments. The increased
   values of some pollution indices characteristic of industrial activity
   in the upper part of the Varzob River indicate an anthropogenic origin
   of As, Sb and Mn while the increased contents of Th and U in the lower
   reaches of the Varzob River could be attributed to the pegmatite field
   of the Odjuk tributary.}},

Abstract = {{Oral cancer and diabetes are highly prevalent among the Indian
   population and are part of the top four non-communicable diseases
   responsible for mortality and morbidity. Their numbers are so great that
   they pose a unique burden to the socioeconomic growth of the country. In
   recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies
   examining the role of diabetes in oral cancer reporting co-existence of
   diabetes and cancer. There is also growing evidence of a higher risk for
   developing a number of cancers among individuals with diabetes,
   including pancreatic, liver, gynecologic, colorectal, oral and breast
   cancer, and consequently `diabetic oncopathy' is emerging as one of the
   complications of diabetes. Diabetes may lead to the development of
   cancer through oxidative damage leading to accumulation of DNA mutations
   and/or through immune dysfunction, which predisposes to viral infection.
   Cancer and diabetes may co-occur due to shared risk factors such as
   increased insulin-like growth factor-1 and obesity, but there is no
   clear biologic link between the two disorders. This literature review
   aims to review the evidence showing the current burden of two
   non-communicable diseases, diabetes and oral cancer and their potential
   association, with particular reference to India. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

   background electrons and nucleons, and by pair-production of standard
   model particles on background neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. In this
   paper, we evolve the particle cascades of high energy non-thermal
   neutrinos injections, using dark matter decay as a specific example,
   including relevant collision processes of these neutrinos with the
   background particles and taking into account the expansion of the
   universe. We study the effect of these non-thermal neutrino injections
   on the CMB spectral shape and abundance of light elements produced in
   the big bang nucleosynthesis. We show that CMB spectral distortions and
   abundance of light elements can constrain neutrino energy density at the
   recombination, parameterized as contribution to N-eff, from high energy
   neutrino injection. These constraints are stronger by several orders of
   magnitudes compared to the CMB anisotropy constraints. We also show that
   CMB spectral distortions can probe neutrino injections to significantly
   higher redshifts (z > 2 x 10(6)) as compared to pure electromagnetic
   energy injection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Study 4030 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blinded study
   of 565 HIV-1 RNA-suppressed participants switching to
   bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) or
   dolutegravir (DTG)+F/TAF. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
   (NRTI), non-NRTI, and protease inhibitor resistance (-R) was allowed,
   but integrase strand transfer inhibitor-R was excluded. Here, we
   describe the detailed resistance analysis. Methods: Historical plasma
   HIV-1 RNA genotypes and baseline proviral DNA genotypes were analyzed.
   Documented or investigator-suspected NRTI-R was grouped for
   stratification into 3 categories of level of resistance. Viral blips
   were assessed through week 48. Virologic failures had genotypic and
   phenotypic resistance analyses at week 48, confirmed failure, or last
   visit, if HIV-1 RNA did not resuppress to <50 copies/mL while on study
   drug. Results: In total, 83\% (470/565) of participants had baseline
   genotypic data available with NRTI-R detected in 24\% (138/565),
   including 5\% (30/565) with K65R/E/N or >= 3 thymidine analog mutations
   and 19\% (108/565) with other NRTI-R mutations. M184V/I was present in
   14\% (81/565). Pre-existing integrase strand transfer inhibitor-R
   mutations were found in 4\% (20/565) of participants. Primary non-NRTI-R
   and protease inhibitor-R mutations were present in 21\% (118/565) and
   7\% (38/565) of participants. High rates of viral suppression were
   maintained in all groups through week 48; blips were observed in only 15
   participants (2.7\%). Three participants met criteria for resistance
   analysis (all in DTG+F/TAF arm); none developed treatment-emergent
   resistance to study drugs. Conclusions: Participants with baseline NRTI
   resistance, much of which was previously undocumented, maintained
   suppression 48 weeks after switching to B/F/TAF or DTG+F/TAF triple
   therapy. Blips and virologic failure were uncommon using either regimen,
   with no treatment-emergent resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The design of rolling stock plays a key role in the attractiveness of
   the rail transport. Train design must strictly meet the requirements of
   rail operators to ensure high quality and cost-effective services.
   Semiconductor power devices made from silicon carbide (SiC) have reached
   a level of technology enabling their widespread use in traction power
   converters. SiC transistors offering energy savings, quieter operation,
   improved reliability and reduced maintenance costs have become the
   choice for the next-generation railway power converters and are quickly
   replacing the IGBT technology which has been used for decades. The paper
   describes the design and development of a novel SiC-based DC power
   electronic traction transformer (PETT) intended for electric multiple
   units (EMUs) operated in 3 kV DC rail traction. The details related to
   the 0.5 MVA peak power medium voltage prototype, including the
   electrical design of the main building blocks are presented in the first
   part of the paper. The second part deals with the implementation of the
   developed SiC-based DC PETT into a regional train operating on a 3 kV DC
   traction system. The experimental results obtained during the testing
   are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed 3 kV DC
   PETT prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The use of cured-in-place pipe lining systems for the rehabilitation of
   cast iron water pressure pipe has grown significantly in the past 20
   years. With limited information on the performance of these lining
   systems in service, strain measurements are needed to evaluate
   theoretical findings about three-dimensional strength limits. The
   application of distributed optical fiber sensing to study the properties
   of a polymer composite liner was investigated in this research.
   Polyimide optical fibers were installed into flat liner coupons
   fabricated in the laboratory, and the specimens were subsequently tested
   in uniaxial tension and four-point bending. Using optical frequency
   domain reflectometry, Rayleigh backscatter was monitored from
   preinstalled optical fiber sensors and strains of up to 4,000 mu e were
   obtained. Comparisons between experimental optical fiber measurements
   and results obtained from conventional strain measurement techniques
   (i.e., extensometer and crosshead displacement) showed a strong
   correlation with an average difference of 3 \% in four-point bending and
   6 \% in tension. However, the orientation and diameter of the composite
   fiber reinforcements were observed to affect distributed sensing
   performance.}},

Title = {{Long-Term Follow-Up of a Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Excessive
   Weight Gain in Infancy: Protocol for the Prevention of Overweight in
   Infancy (POI) Follow-Up Study at 11 Years}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) randomized
   controlled trial assessed the effect of a more conventional food,
   physical activity, and breasffeeding intervention, with a more novel
   sleep intervention on weight outcomes at 2 years of age. The trial had
   58\% uptake at recruitment, and retention was 86\% at age 2 years, 77\%
   at age 3.5 years, and 69\% at age 5 years. Children who received the
   brief sleep intervention in infancy had just half the risk of obesity at
   2 years of age compared to those who did not receive the sleep
   intervention. Importantly, this substantially reduced risk was still
   apparent at our follow-up at 5 years of age.
   Objective: The primary aim of this follow-up at age 11 years is to
   determine whether differences in BMI z-score and obesity risk remain
   apparent now that it is at least 9 years since cessation of the sleep
   intervention. Several secondary outcomes of interest will also be
   examined including 24-hour movement patterns, mental health and
   wellbeing, and use of electronic media, particularly prior to sleep.
   Methods: We will seek renewed consent from all 734 of the original 802
   POI families who expressed interest in further involvement. Children and
   parent(s) will attend 2 clinics and 1 home appointment to obtain
   measures of anthropometry and body composition (dual-energy x-ray
   absorptiometry scan), 24-hour movement patterns (sleep, sedentary time,
   and physical activity measured using an AX3 accelerometer), mental
   health and wellbeing (validated questionnaires), family functioning
   (validated questionnaires), use of electronic media (wearable and
   stationary cameras, questionnaires), and diet and eating behaviors
   (24-hour recall, questionnaires).
   Results: This follow-up study has full ethical approval from the
   University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (H19/109) and was funded in
   May 2019 by the Health Research Council of New Zealand (grant 19/346).
   Data collection commenced in June 2020, and first results are expected
   to be submitted for publication in 2022.
   Conclusions: Long-term outcomes of early obesity intervention are rare.
   Despite the growing body of evidence linking insufficient sleep with an
   increased risk of obesity in children, interventions targeting
   improvements in sleep have been insufficiently explored. Our initial
   follow-up at 5 years of age suggested that an early sleep intervention
   may have long-term benefits for effective weight management in children.
   Further analysis in our now preteen population will provide much-needed
   evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness of sleep interventions in
   infancy as an obesity prevention approach.}},

   + VitD) and periodontal therapy (PT) among low income Brazilian pregnant
   women with periodontitis (IMPROVE trial). This 2 x 2 factorial
   feasibility trial used a mixed-methods evaluation. In total, 69 pregnant
   women were randomly allocated to four groups: 1. fortified sachet with
   Ca+VitD and milk plus early PT (throughout gestation); 2. placebo and
   milk plus early PT; 3. fortified sachet with Ca+VitD and milk plus late
   PT after childbirth; 4. placebo and milk plus late PT. Data were
   collected via questionnaires, field notes, participant flow logs,
   treatment diary, and focal group discussions. Quantitative and
   qualitative data were analysed using appropriate descriptive statistics
   and content analysis, respectively. Eligibility rate (12\%) was below
   the target of 15\%, but participation (76.1\%) and recruitment rate (2
   women/week) exceeded the targets. Retention rate (78.6\%) was slightly
   below the target (80\%). Adherence to the PT was significantly higher in
   the early treatment groups (98.8\%) compared to the late treatment
   groups (29\%). All women accepted the random allocation, and baseline
   groups were balanced. There was no report of adverse events. This
   multi-component intervention is acceptable, well-tolerated, and feasible
   among low-risk pregnant women in Brazil.}},

Journal = {{FERTILITY AND STERILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether the purpose of ovarian stimulation
   (oocyte cryopreservation {[}OC] versus in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
   associated with perceived stress before or after ovarian stimulation;
   and whether perceived stress is associated with ovarian stimulation
   outcomes.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Academic practice.
   Patients: Women undergoing their first ovarian stimulation cycle as part
   of a randomized clinical trial, the Learning from Online Video Education
   (LOVE) study (NCT02979990).
   Interventions: Questionnaire before and after ovarian stimulation.
   Main Outcome Measures(S): Perceived stress scale (PSS) scores before and
   after stimulation. The number of oocytes collected was a secondary
   measure.
   Results: After adjustment for age, income, race, education, financial
   assistance, and fertility diagnosis, the indication for treatment (IVF
   vs. OC) was a significant predictor of pretreatment PSS scores. IVF
   participants had higher pretreatment scores (18.01 +/- 6.43) than did OC
   participants (15.62 +/- 5.61). Posttreatment PSS scores did not differ
   between the two groups. IVF participants experienced a decrease of 0.85
   +/- 2.34 points in PSS scores after treatment, whereas OC participant
   scores were stable over time. The trajectory of PSS scores differed
   between the two groups and neared significance. Financial support was a
   significant predictor of pretreatment and posttreatment PSS scores for
   the entire cohort. Neither pretreatment nor posttreatment PSS was
   predictive of the number oocytes collected.
   Conclusion: Compared with OC patients, IVF patients have higher stress
   levels, which decrease after ovarian stimulation. Perceived stress does
   not affect oocyte yield. ((C) 2020 by American Society for Reproductive

Title = {{Assessing the relationship between organizational management factors and
   a resilient safety culture in a collegiate aviation program with Safety
   Management Systems (SMS)}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Extant research advocates for assessing and continuously improving
   resilient safety culture in high-reliability organizations (HROs) such
   as aviation that has a fully functional Safety Management Systems (SMS).
   Perceptions on the relationship between four (4) organizational
   management factors (Principles, Policy, Procedures, Practices) and
   resilient safety culture in a collegiate aviation program was assessed
   using an online survey instrument drafted using Reason (2011) concept on
   safety resilience. Sample was drawn from aviation students, flight
   instructors, faculty and administrators. Structural Equation Model (SEM)
   and Causal Path Analysis (CPA) techniques were used to assess conceptual
   models. Results suggest good reliability and construct validity for
   survey instrument. All the measurement models had acceptable fit based
   on various goodness-of-fit indices. The results suggest all four
   management factors had significant predictive relationship with
   resilient safety culture. Practices had the weakest predictive
   relationship and Policy had the highest. Procedures strongly mediated
   path between Policies and Practices and there was no significant causal
   relationship between Principles and Practices. Results suggest that more
   focus should be placed on resilient safety practices in the collegiate
   aviation program. Significant benefit of this study is the validation of
   an instrument that explores the relationship between resilient safety
   culture and organizational management factors and adds to literature on
   resilient safety culture in collegiate aviation programs. Future studies
   using this survey instrument and models in other collegiate aviation
   programs, airlines and airports are highly recommended.}},

Title = {{Saturation of Energy Levels of the Hydrogen Atom in Strong Magnetic
   Field}},
Journal = {{UNIVERSE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the finiteness of the limiting values of the lower
   energy levels of a hydrogen atom under an unrestricted growth of the
   magnetic field, into which this atom is embedded, is achieved already
   when the vacuum polarization (VP) is calculated in the magnetic field
   within the approximation of the local action of Euler-Heisenberg. We
   find that the mechanism for this saturation is different from the one
   acting, when VP is calculated via the Feynman diagram in the Furry
   picture. We study the effective potential that appears when the
   adiabatic (diagonal) approximation is exploited for solving the
   Schrodinger equation for the longitudinal degree of freedom of the
   electron on the lowest Landau level in the atom. We find that the
   (effective) potential of a point-like charge remains nonsingular thanks
   to the growing screening provided by VP. The regularizing length turns
   out to be root alpha/3 pi lambda(C), where lambda(C) is the electron
   Compton length. The family of effective potentials, labeled by growing
   values of the magnetic field condenses towards a certain limiting,
   magnetic-field-independent potential-distance curve. The limiting values
   of even ground-state energies are determined for four magnetic quantum
   numbers using the Karnakov-Popov method.}},

Abstract = {{Silica (SiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized from rice husk (RH) via wet
   milling method and evaluated for enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
   applications. Physical properties of RH-SiO2 nanoparticles (RH-SNP) with
   its size distribution were explored through field emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FESEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS).
   Stability, functional groups and purity of RH-SNP were determined by
   zeta potential, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), respectively. Effect of RH-SNP on the precipitation
   and thermal degradation of oilfield polyacrylamide (HPAM) was studied
   using Brookfield RST rheometer. Interfacial tension (IFT) properties of
   RH-SiO2 polymeric nanofluid (RH-SPNF) at interface of oil and water
   (O/W) were investigated using Easy-Dyne KRUSS tensiometer. Subsequently,
   oil displacement efficiency of RH-SPNF was determined and compared with
   oilfield HPAM at reservoir conditions using Fars EOR high-pressure
   high-temperature (HPHT) core flooding equipment. The wet milling method
   was effective in producing RH-SNP of size ranges 43.9-59.5 nm with a
   purity of 98\% through the mechanism of nucleation, Brownian motion and
   coalescence. Rheological results show that RH-SNP inhibited the
   precipitation and thermal degradation of oilfield HPAM. IFT of RH-SPNF
   showed a monotonic tendency as temperature increased. HPAM and RH-SPNF
   flooding showed an incremental oil recovery of approximately 10\% and
   24\%, respectively. Emulsion generated using RH-SPNF shows higher
   stability and resistance to coalescence. Finally, mobility ratio of
   water flooding approaches unity faster, compared to HPAM and RH-SPNF.
   Overall, the low energy utilization, use of low-cost and benign raw
   material make RH-SNP and the extraction method an appropriate substitute
   to commercially available SiO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{The LTPS and IGZO were the two possible options for next generation
   displays with its own advantages and disadvantages. In terms of
   reliability, the LTPS TFT offers the superior threshold voltage
   stability as compare to the IGZO TFT under the gate bias stress.
   However, the continuing scaling of the LTPS and IGZO limits the
   electrical performance at higher voltages. LTPS and IGZO TFT still
   retains the reliability issues at smaller device dimensions. Therefore,
   the negative bias stress instability in a-IGZO and LTPS TFT having
   similar device dimension (width x length) has been investigated and
   compared. The negative bias stress without illumination shows the good
   thermal stability and no threshold voltage change in the LTPS TFT.
   However, under illumination (NBIS), the asymmetrical degradation in the
   LTPS TFT was observed, shows the degradation in off current (I-OFF)
   almost by two order (10(-11) A) due to self-heating effects. Whereas,
   the NBIS on a-IGZO TFT shows the positive shift in the threshold voltage
   (Delta V-th = 2.71 V), due to the double donor state within a-IGZO and
   gate insulator. It is noticed that, the LTPS and a-IGZO TFT show
   different photo-generated carrier behavior under NBIS, which may limit
   the performance for future CMOS device at smaller dimensions.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Separation of the stereoisomers of the antifungal drug itraconazole
   using supercritical fluid chromatography and normal-phase liquid
   chromatography is presented. The performances of the two methods are
   evaluated based on their speed, resolution, and the analytical method
   greenness score. Both methods achieve baseline separation and meet the
   United States Pharmacopeia-recommended resolution of >= 1.5 between the
   four stereoisomers. The methods are validated following the
   International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and evaluated in
   terms of specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and range; they
   are thus appropriate for purposes of quantification. Supercritical fluid
   chromatography achieves separation more rapidly and is found to be more
   ecofriendly than normal-phase liquid chromatography. To emphasize the
   use of ecofriendly alternatives, the assessment is performed using a
   metric termed as the analytical method greenness score. The method can
   thus be implemented for determination of chiral purity in various
   Quality control laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Phenolics from plant materials have garnered attention in nanomedicine
   research, due to their various medicinal properties. Caffeic acid, a
   phenolic compound that is abundant in coffee beans, has been proven to
   have anticancer effects, due to its reactive oxygen species
   (ROS)-inducing properties. Here, a supramolecular nanomedicine was
   designed using caffeic acid molecule and the synthetic anticancer drug
   bortezomib, via catechol-boronic acid conjugation and Fe(III) ion
   crosslinking. Bortezomib is a proteasome-inhibiting drug and its boronic
   acid functional group can bind to caffeic acid's catechol moiety. By
   having a nanoparticle formulation that can deliver bortezomib via
   intracellular endocytosis, the catechol-boronic acid conjugation can be
   dissociated, which liberates the boronic acid functional group to bind
   to the 26S proteasome of the cell. The ROS-inducing property of caffeic
   acid also complements the bortezomib payload, as the latter suppresses
   the survival mechanism of the cell through NF-kappa B inhibition.}},

Title = {{An implicit 3D corotational formulation for frictional contact dynamics
   of beams against rigid surfaces using discrete signed distance fields}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{371}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of beam-like structures against surfaces is a
   challenging problem with applications in engineering (wheel- rail
   contact, pipeline-soil interaction, ropes sliding on the seabed) and in
   medical applications such as surgical planning and training (catheter
   navigation, aneurysm coiling, stent deployment). This contact problem is
   traditionally solved using Total Lagrangian beam formulations, which
   interact against Lagrangian triangulated surfaces. Overall, the
   computational speed is affected, due to the nonlinearities of the beam
   formulation and, as well as due to the expensive search algorithms,
   required to find the close point projection. In the search towards an
   efficient beam to surface contact algorithm, this paper explores the
   combined use of (1) a corotational beam formulation, where the motion of
   the beam element is decomposed in rigid body and pure deformational
   parts and (2) an implicit description of the surface by means of
   discrete signed distance fields (SDF), which can be seen as a Lagrangian
   beam immersed within an Eulerian (rigid) solid. To do so, a previously
   reported implicit corotational formulation for beam dynamics is modified
   to account for frictional contact, by means of a penalty term. The new
   contributions are fully linearized to update the tangent operator and
   the system is integrated in time by means of the HHT-a method. Overall,
   a consistent implicit contact dynamics formulation is provided. A SDF,
   defined in a voxel-type grid, is used to represent implicitly the
   surface geometry. The SDF values and derivatives are computed at the
   Lagrangian point of integration of the beam by means of an efficient
   tensor product of compact, high order, 1D Kernels, as widely used in
   immersed Fluid-Structure Interaction techniques. A wide variety of
   validation tests are presented which prove the accuracy and robustness
   of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic clinical
   -pathological disorder with an immunological basis characterised by
   symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction and, histologically, eosinophilic
   inflammation.
   Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and differences in
   children and adults diagnosed with EoE in a tertiary level hospital.
   Method: Descriptive, retrospective and cross-sectional study. We
   randomly selected 40 children and 40 adults diagnosed with EoE between
   2009 and 2016. The patient characteristics were analysed by means of
   epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic variables.
   Results: The average age at diagnosis was 10 years (children) and 34
   years (adults), with a higher frequency in males. The majority were
   sensitised to aeroallergens (77.5\% children vs. 82.5\% adults) and
   foods (75\% children vs. 82.5\% adults). Statistically significant
   differences were detected in sensitisation to fruits (p= 0.007) and
   grains (p< 0.001). Differences were observed in impaction (22.5\%
   children vs. 82.5\% adults), dysphagia (42.5\% children vs. 77.5\%
   adults) and abdominal pain (25\% children vs. 7.5\% adults). Endoscopy
   showed that children had a higher frequency of exudates (92.5\%) and
   adults, trachealisation (50\% vs. 5\%) and stenosis (17.5\% vs. 2.5\%).
   Statistically significant differences were found in treatment with
   topical corticosteroids (30\% children vs. 77.5\% adults), with a
   variable positive response. 77.5\% of the patients received elimination
   diets.
   Conclusions: Statistically significant differences were observed between
   the paediatric and adult populations in the food sensitisation profiles,
   clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings and treatments received.
   This is a complex pathology that calls for a multidisciplinary team and
   would require new non-invasive techniques to facilitate its management.

Abstract = {{Barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles (BT NPs) have shown exceptional
   characteristics such as high dielectric constant and suitable ferro-,
   piezo-, and pyro-electric properties. Thus, BT NPs have shown potential
   to be applied in various fields including electro-optical devices and
   biomedicine. However, very limited knowledge is available on the
   interaction of BT NPs with human cells. This work was planned to study
   the interaction of BT NPs with human lung carcinoma (A549) cells.
   Results showed that BT NPs decreased cell viability in a dose- and
   time-dependent manner. Depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential and
   induction of caspase-3 and -9 enzyme activity were also observed
   following BT NP exposure. BT NPs further induced oxidative stress
   indicated by induction of pro-oxidants (reactive oxygen species and
   hydrogen peroxide) and reduction of antioxidants (glutathione and
   several antioxidant enzymes). Moreover, BT NP-induced cytotoxicity and
   oxidative stress were effectively abrogated by N-acetyl-cysteine (an ROS
   scavenger), suggesting that BT NP-induced cytotoxicity was mediated
   through oxidative stress. Intriguingly, the underlying mechanism of
   cytotoxicity of BT NPs was similar to the mode of action of ZnO NPs. At
   the end, we found that BT NPs did not affect the non-cancerous human
   lung fibroblasts (IMR-90). Altogether, BT NPs selectively induced
   cytotoxicity in A549 cells via oxidative stress. This work warrants
   further research on selective cytotoxicity mechanisms of BT NPs in
   different types of cancer cells and their normal counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal endophytes inference a significant role in the germination of
   Achnatherum inebrians. It is important to find out the best-known
   conditions for its germination. In this study, germination percentage of
   A. inebrians seeds infected with Epichloeeurogansuensis and non-infected
   seeds were tested under five salinity concentrations (100 mM, 200 mM,
   300 mM, 400 mM and 500 mM) and five water pH levels (pH = 5, 6, 7, 8 and
   9) with distilled water (pH = 6.5) as a control. These treatments were
   carried out in the presence of constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and
   30 degrees C) under constant light exposure and alternating temperatures
   (15/5, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 and 35/25 degrees C) for 12 h light: 12 h
   dark photoperiod. Germination percentage was calculated after 14 days of
   incubation under these programmed conditions. Increase in salinity
   resulted in a gradual decrease in germination percentage while increase
   in pH up to 7 resulted in increased germination. Germination of
   endophyte infected and non-infected seeds were increased at 20 degrees C
   and 25/15 degrees C for constant light and 12:12 h photoperiod.
   Endophyte infected seeds were found to exhibit the most significant
   results as compared to non-infected seeds under varying range of
   salinity, pH, light, photoperiod and temperature indicating that
   endophyte infection in A. inebrians seeds increased the germination
   percentage and survival of seeds with the ability to tolerate stress

Abstract = {{Acclaimed as one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs, the technology
   of CRISPR has brought significant improvement in the biotechnological
   spectrum-from editing genetic defects in diseases for gene therapy to
   modifying organisms for the production of biofuels. Since its inception,
   the CRISPR-Cas9 system has become easier and more versatile to use. Many
   variants have been found, giving the CRISPR toolkit a great range that
   includes the activation and repression of genes aside from the
   previously known knockout and knockin of genes. Here, in this
   Perspective, we describe efforts on automating the gene-editing
   workflow, with particular emphasis given on the use of microfluidic
   technology. We discuss how automation can address the limitations of
   gene-editing and how the marriage between microfluidics and gene-editing
   will expand the application space of CRISPR.}},

Title = {{Molecular Interactions between Asphaltene and Surfactants in a
   Hydrocarbon Solvent: Application to Asphaltene Dispersion}},
Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Heavy oil and bitumen supply the vast majority of energy resources in
   Canada. Different methods can be implemented to produce oil from such
   unconventional resources. Surfactants are employed as an additive to
   water/steam to improve an injected fluid's effectiveness and enhance oil
   recovery. One of the main fractions in bitumen is asphaltene, which is a
   non-symmetrical molecule. Studies of interactions between surfactants,
   anionic, and non-anionic, and asphaltene have been very limited in the
   literature. In this paper, we employed molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation to theoretically focus on the interactions between surfactant
   molecules and different types of asphaltene molecules observed in real
   oil sands. Both non-anionic and anionic surfactants showed promising
   results in terms of dispersant efficiency; however, their performance
   depends on the asphaltene architecture. Moreover, a hydrogen/carbon
   (H/C) ratio of asphaltenes plays an inevitable role in asphaltene
   aggregation behavior. A higher H/C ratio resulted in decreasing
   asphaltene aggregation tendency. The results of these studies will give
   a deep understanding of the interactions between asphaltene and
   surfactant molecules.}},

Title = {{A G-Quadruplex-Binding Small Molecule and the HDAC Inhibitor SAHA

   Pancreatic Cancer Cells dagger}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The stabilisation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) by small-molecule compounds is
   an effective approach for causing cell growth arrest, followed by cell
   death. Some of these compounds are currently being developed for the
   treatment of human cancers. We have previously developed a substituted
   naphthalene diimide G4-binding molecule (CM03) with selective potency
   for pancreatic cancer cells, including gemcitabine-resistant cells. We
   report here that CM03 and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA
   (suberanilohydroxamic acid) have synergistic effects at concentrations
   close to and below their individual GI(50) values, in both
   gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines.
   Immunoblot analysis showed elevated levels of gamma-H2AX and cleaved
   PARP proteins upon drug combination treatment, indicating increased
   levels of DNA damage (double-strand break events: DSBs) and apoptosis
   induction, respectively. We propose that the mechanism of synergy
   involves SAHA relaxing condensed chromatin, resulting in higher levels
   of G4 formation. In turn, CM03 can stabilise a greater number of G4s,
   leading to the downregulation of more G4-containing genes as well as a
   higher incidence of DSBs due to torsional strain on DNA and chromatin
   structure.}},

   (polysaccharide) and soy protein. Nanoemulsification method was adopted
   with high encapsulation efficiency in case of soy protein, about 95\%,
   and slightly lower efficiency for chitosan, about 75\%. The NCs
   characteristics were confirmed by FTIR spectra, TEM, fluorescence
   spectra and spectrophotometric analysis. Good lipid NCs of oil/water
   emulsion type with diameter range of about 5-300 nm were obtained in
   presence of Tween20 surfactant according to TEM images. FTIR spectra
   indicated that the most extracted polyphenolic compounds were
   encapsulated successfully. The NCs have enhanced the antioxidant
   activity of phenolic extract, apple juice and pineapple juice indicating
   their potential as food edible materials.}},

Abstract = {{Using social worlds as a framework, the purpose of this study was to
   determine the relationships between event travel career progression with
   travel behavior and related intentions. As such, this study has depicted
   the evolving behaviors and preferences of active sport tourists in an
   effort to improve the localized impact of events. Using previous
   research on social worlds and active sport event travel careers, the
   authors have hypothesized that differences in social worlds immersion
   would be present based on event participation, travel party conditions,
   flow-on tourism activities, and repeat/revisit intentions, as well as
   differences in flow-on tourism activities based on travel conditions. In
   partnership with a large running festival in the Midwest United States,
   data were collected and analyzed to test these hypotheses (N = 2,219).
   The results indicated support for the hypotheses previously outlined.
   Theoretical contributions to the study of active sport tourism and
   practical implications for the management of events and destinations are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{MEDICINA-LITHUANIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Oxidative stress (OS) participates in the
   pathophysiology of septic shock, which leads to multiple organ failure
   (MOF), ischemia-reperfusion injury, and acute respiratory distress
   syndrome. Therefore, antioxidants have been proposed as therapy. Here,
   we evaluated the effect of antioxidant treatments in patients with
   septic shock with MOF and determined levels OS before and after
   treatment. This study was a randomized, controlled, triple-masked, and
   with parallel assignment clinical trial with a control group without
   treatment. Materials and Methods: It included 97 patients of either sex
   with septic shock. 5 treatments were used each in an independent group
   of 18 patients. Group 1 received vitamin C (Vit C), group 2 vitamin E
   (Vit E), group 3 n-acetylcysteine (NAC), group 4 melatonin (MT), and
   group 5 served as control. All antioxidants were administered orally or
   through a nasogastric tube for five days as an adjuvant to the standard
   therapy. Results: The results showed that all patients presented MOF due
   to sepsis upon admission and that the treatment decreased it (p =
   0.007). The antioxidant treatment with NAC increased the total
   antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05). The patients that received Vit C had
   decreased levels of the nitrate and nitrite ratio (p < 0.01) and
   C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.04). Procalcitonin levels were reduced
   by Vit E (p = 0.04), NAC (p = 0.001), and MT (p = 0.04).
   Lipid-peroxidation was reduced in patients that received MT (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: In conclusion, antioxidant therapy associated with standard
   therapy reduces MOF, OS, and inflammation in patients with septic shock.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1147-1162}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In engineering practice, multiple repair actions are considered
   carefully by designers, and their success or failure defines further
   control actions and the evolution of the system state. Such treatment is
   not fully supported by the current state-of-the-art in dependability
   analysis. We propose a novel approach for explicit modelling and
   analysis of repairable systems, and describe an implementation, which
   builds on HiP-HOPS, a method and tool for model-based synthesis of
   dependability evaluation models. HiP-HOPS is augmented with Pandora, a
   temporal logic for the qualitative analysis of Temporal Fault Trees
   (TFTs), and capabilities for quantitative dependability analysis via
   Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN). Dependability prediction is achieved
   via explicit modelling of local failure and repair events in a system
   model and then by: (i) propagation of local effects through the model
   and synthesis of repair-aware TFTs for the system, (ii) qualitative
   analysis of TFTs that respects both failure and repair logic and (iii)
   quantification of dependability via translation of repair-aware TFTs
   into SAN. The approach provides insight into the effects of multiple and
   alternative failure and repair scenarios, and can thus be useful in
   reconfigurable systems that typically employ software to utilise
   functional redundancies in a variety of ways.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{29-34}},

Abstract = {{Amatoxins, most of which are hepatotoxic, can cause fatal intoxication.
   While mushrooms in the amatoxin-containing Galerina genus are rare, they
   can poison humans and animals worldwide. Few studies have profiled the
   toxicity of Galerina marginata. In addition, many studies indicate that
   macrofungi can have different characteristics in different regions. In
   this study, the quantities of toxins present in G. marginata from
   different provinces in Turkey were analysed using reversed-phase
   high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection
   (RP-HPLC-UV) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem
   mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). G. marginata samples were collected
   from three different regions of Turkey. The taxonomic categorization of
   mushrooms was based on their micro- and macroscopic characteristics. The
   presence of toxins alpha-amanitin (AA), beta-amanitin (BA),
   gamma-amanitin (GA), phalloidin (PHD) and phallacidin (PHC) quantities
   were measured using RP-HPLC-UV and then were confirmed using
   LC-ESI-MS/MS. BA levels were higher than AA levels in G. marginata
   mushrooms collected from all three regions. Moreover, the levels of GA
   were below the detection limit and no phallotoxins were detected. This
   is the first study to identify and test the toxicity of G. marginata
   collected from three different regions of Turkey using RP-HPLC-UV. This
   is also the first study to confirm the UV absorption of amatoxins in G.
   marginata using LC-ESI-MS/MS, which is a far more sensitive process.
   More studies evaluating the toxicity of G. marginata in other geographic
   regions of the world are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological measurement of corpus callosum (CC) in magnetic resonance
   imaging studies has an important value for clinical decision-making
   during the period of childhood. Although there is evidence for
   differences in brain morphology in terms of socioeconomic disparities,
   there is no research specifically on CC morphology from any low- and
   middle-income countries. This study aims to report structural
   measurements and area of CC of healthy children from Turkey, a
   middle-income country, and find out whether the CC morphology differs
   between male and female children in different age groups. Healthy
   children aged 6-18 years were recruited retrospectively and their CC
   anteroposterior (AP) length, genu, body and splenium width (GW, BW, SW)
   and CC midsagittal area were measured from magnetic resonance imaging
   studies. Independent sample t-test was used to compare CC measurements
   of the sex and age groups. Pearson correlation test was used to
   determine linear correlations between age and CC parameters. The sample
   consisted of 200 healthy children; at least 5 female and 5 male children
   for each age; 103 (51.5\%) females, 97 (45.5\%) males. There was a
   positive correlation between the age and CC AP length (r=0.248, p<0.001)
   and SW (r=0.325, p<0.001) as well as midsagittal area (r=0.191,
   p<0.007). The CC AP length, GW, BW, SW and area were not different
   statistically between sex groups.
   This study is the first report providing age and sex-related
   morphological measurements of CC of healthy children in Turkey. The
   findings may be helpful for clinicians and researchers from Turkey as
   well as other low- and middle-income countries.}},

Abstract = {{Ions in radio-frequency traps are widely used in various fields of
   applied and fundamental physics, such as metrology and quantum
   computing. One of the important tasks required for modern experiments is
   deep cooling of ion crystals. The results of simulations of an increase
   in the efficiency of deep cooling of linear ion crystals by the method
   of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT cooling) by imposing an
   optical lattice on the radio-frequency trap have been reported. It has
   been shown that this method makes it possible to narrow the frequency
   range occupied by various vibrational modes of ions and to increase
   their axial frequencies of motion without violating the linear
   configuration of the crystal. Thus, for a crystal of eight ions in a
   Paul trap with secular frequencies omega(z) = 2 pi x 100 kHz and
   omega(r) = 2 pi x 650 kHz, the application of an optical lattice allows
   the reduction of the frequency range occupied by vibrational modes by a
   factor of 2. The dependence of the optimal power of the optical lattice
   for narrowing the vibrational spectrum on the number of particles in the
   trap and its parameters has been investigated.}},

Title = {{On hysteresis modeling of a piezoelectric precise positioning system
   under variable temperature}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose the modeling of hysteresis nonlinearities in a piezoelectric
   material-based tube actuator classically employed in precise positioning
   applications under different surrounding temperatures. Beyond the
   voltage-to-displacement hysteresis nonlinearities they exhibit, these
   actuators are sensitive to the surrounding temperature. Therefore,
   contrary to the existing works in the literature where the two phenomena
   were treated individually, this paper suggests to model the hysteresis
   nonlinearities and the temperature effects simultaneously. First an
   experimental study was performed to investigate the effects of the
   surrounding temperature on the voltage-to-displacement hysteresis loops
   of the piezoelectric tube actuators. The experimental results show that
   increasing the input surrounding temperature contributes an increase in
   the voltage-to-displacement sensitivity of the piezoelectric tube
   actuator under the input voltage range considered in the experimental
   tests. Then, two different nonlinear temperature-dependent hysteresis
   models a temperature-dependent (TD) electromechanical model and a
   temperature-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model (TD-PI) were proposed to
   account the temperature effects on the hysteresis nonlinearity. In
   First, the mathematical formulation of TD-electromechanical model was
   presented to describe the electrical and mechanical properties of
   piezoelectric tube actuator. This model integrates the temperature
   dependent electromechanical coupling factor to model the temperature
   effects, the Simscape library in MATLAB-Simulink software was used to
   develop a physical simulation for the TD-electromechanical model. In a
   second time, a TD-PI model was proposed to describe the
   voltage-to-displacement characteristic of piezoelectric tube actuator
   using a proposed temperature shape function. The parameters of the two
   proposed models were estimated using proposed optimization algorithms
   based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The modeling results demonstrate
   that the two proposed models can account for the hysteresis
   nonlinearities of the piezoelectric tube actuators under different
   levels of the surrounding temperatures. Finally, the analytical inverse
   of TD-PI model was derived and applied in feed forward manner to
   compensate the hysteresis nonlinearities under different levels of the
   surrounding temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Canada has resettled more than 57,000 Syrian refugees since 2015
   (Government of Canada, 2017). However, little is known about refugee
   children's language and literacy development. The present study
   evaluated Syrian refugee children's performance on language and literacy
   measures in English and Arabic, and examined whether the simple view of
   reading model is applicable in both of their languages. Participants
   consisted of 115 Syrian refugee children 6-13 years of age. They
   received a battery of language and literacy measures including word
   reading, vocabulary, oral narratives, and reading comprehension in both
   English and Arabic. Compared to the normative samples, refugee children
   performed poorly on English standardized measures. They also
   demonstrated difficulties in Arabic, as more than half of the children
   were not able to read in the language. Despite the relatively low
   performance, there was evidence to support the simple view of reading
   model in both languages. In addition, oral language skills played a
   larger role in English reading comprehension in the older group than the
   younger group. This age-group comparison was not carried out in Arabic
   due to reduced sample size. Theoretical and practical implications of
   the findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of high
   performance work systems (HPWS) on higher education institutions
   performance in Sultanate of Oman. An attempt was made to study whether
   performance work systems are not limited to staffing, training,
   involvement, performance, communication and caring practices influence
   employee's performance. The study also examined the effects of mediator
   variables namely, concern for customers and service performance on
   institutional performance. 530 participants were selected using a
   stratified sampling technique. The sample was selected from among
   general managers, assistant general managers or those in authority from
   the selected institution. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to
   test and confirm whether the extracted factors fulfilled the
   psychometric properties and empirically could be considered as
   meaningful factors. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test
   the complex relationship between HPWS and institutional performance. The
   results showed a direct relationship between HPWS and institutional
   performance and indirect relationship via concerns for employees and
   service performance.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of reinforced scaffolds to repair and regenerate defected
   bone is still a major challenge. Bone tissue engineering is an advanced
   medical strategy to restore or regenerate damaged bone. The excellent
   biocompatibility and osteogenesis behavior of porous scaffolds play a
   critical role in bone regeneration. In current studies, we synthesized
   polymeric nanocomposite material through free-radical polymerization to
   fabricate porous nanocomposite scaffolds by freeze drying. Functional
   group, surface morphology, porosity, pore size, and mechanical strength
   were examined through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),
   Single-Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET), and
   Universal Testing Machine (UTM), respectively. These nanocomposites
   exhibit enhanced compressive strength (from 4.1 to 16.90 MPa), Young's
   modulus (from 13.27 to 29.65 MPa) with well appropriate porosity and
   pore size (from 63.72 +/- 1.9 to 45.75 +/- 6.7 mu m), and a foam-like
   morphology. The increasing amount of graphene oxide (GO) regulates the
   porosity and mechanical behavior of the nanocomposite scaffolds. The
   loading and sustained release of silver-sulfadiazine was observed to be
   90.6\% after 260 min. The in-vitro analysis was performed using mouse
   pre-osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cell lines. The developed nanocomposite
   scaffolds exhibited excellent biocompatibility. Based on the results, we
   propose these novel nanocomposites can serve as potential future
   biomaterials to repair defected bone with the load-bearing application,
   and in bone tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the association between the voluntary formation of a
   board investment committee (IC) and corporate cash holdings for a large
   sample of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) firms over the 2005-2013
   period. We provide evidence that the existence of a specialized IC
   increases corporate cash holdings. We also find that several IC
   characteristics, i.e., member experience, independence, number of
   meetings, and committee size, are associated with an increase in firms'
   cash holdings. Furthermore, the local and foreign institutional
   ownership of GCC firms moderates the IC-cash holdings relationship.
   These results remain robust to alternative specifications of cash
   holdings and endogeneity tests. We contribute to the literature on
   firms' incentives to hold cash and to the literature on governance in
   emerging market contexts.}},

Abstract = {{A self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) was developed to
   enhance Paclitaxel (PTX) solubility and membrane permeability, thus
   improve its bioavailability. Pre-formulation studies were performed to
   optimize PTX-SMEDDS formulation. Then, in vitro characteristics of the
   formulation were determined and PTX oral absorption was investigated in
   rabbits. The optimized PTX-SMEDDS showed emulsification time of 31 +/- 4
   s, droplet size of 19.4 +/- 0.5 nm, poly-dispersibility index of 0.35
   +/- 0.08, percentage transmittance after dilution of 99 +/- 0.02\%, zeta
   potential of 36.82 +/- 1.8 mv, cloud point of 78 +/- 0.5 degrees C and
   infinite dilution capability. The formulation maintained its physical
   and chemical stability during storage at 4 degrees C for three months.
   Oraladministration of 10mg/kg of 1.5\% w/wPTX-loadedSMEDDS to rabbits
   increased PTX bioavailability by 4.5 fold in comparison to untreated PTX
   suspension. While when the rabbits received 1.5\% w/w PTX-loaded SMEDDS
   after pretreated with 1 dose and 2 doses of cyclosporine A, PTX
   bioavailability increased by 4.4 and 7.8 fold, respectively. This
   indicates that the combined effect of the SMEDDS formulation in addition
   to pretreatment with P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, can improve the oral
   bioavailability of poorly soluble and poorly permeable drugs such as PTX
   in rabbits. (C) 2020 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by

Title = {{Analysis of the performance of TAM in oil and gas industry: Factors and

Abstract = {{Although it is well recognized that turnaround maintenance (TAM)
   projects are key determinant of the performance of oil and gas (O\&G)
   companies, little is known about the factors that determine their
   performance and what solutions can be proposed to improve their
   reliability and efficiency. This paper aims at filling this gap. For
   this purpose, a focus group analysis was conducted to identify the
   factors affecting the performance of TAM projects and propose
   alternatives for improvement. Next, a questionnaire was administered
   with managers and practitioners of O\&G TAM in Qatar to collect the
   required data set for the analysis. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process
   (AHP) approach, our empirical findings reveal that the top five factors
   affecting TAM's performance in the O\&G sector are labor skills, lack of
   supervision, communication skills, safety-related issues and on-site
   labor transportation. The study found that improving estimates of
   activities' durations and resources is the best solution to improve the
   performance of TAM in O\&G companies. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{The present research investigated the bond behavior of a cleaned

   and a partial depth concrete repair followed by the application of
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets. Twelve lap splice beams were cast

   partial depth repair with prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC)
   for six lap splice beams and additional confinement with carbon fiber
   reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets for another six beams. The test results
   for the repaired lap splice beams were compared with those for a
   monolithic lap splice beam. This research found that the average bond
   strength increased as the bar mass loss increased for all bonded
   lengths. The lap splice beams repaired with partial depth were able to
   repair concrete with similar properties to those of the monolithic
   concrete. However, they had higher concrete strength than the monolithic
   beams which showed a higher average bond strength than the monolithic
   lap splice beams. The beams confined with FRP sheets showed a rise in
   the bond strength and the equivalent slip by 34-49\%, and 56-260\% as
   compared to the unconfined beams, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Vacuum bell and exercise therapy are non-invasive treatments
   for pectus excavatum (PE). The purpose of this study was to determine
   the effects of the physiotherapy programme applied in addition to vacuum
   bell treatment in patients with PE.
   METHODS: The study included 26 male patients with PE aged 11-18 years.
   Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group 1 received only
   vacuum bell treatment; group 2 had vacuum bell therapy and
   physiotherapy. Patient demographic and disease-related characteristics,
   type of sternal depression, perception of their deformity, postural
   evaluations, treatment satisfaction and quality of life were evaluated
   before and 12 weeks after treatment.
   RESULTS: From external chest circumference measurements related to PE,
   sternal depression and anthropometric index values showed improvement in
   both groups (P < 0.05), but better results were observed in group 2 than
   in group 1 (P <0.05). Modified percent depth and scores from the T3
   region (distance between the most prominent point of the sternum and the
   spinous process of the vertebra at the same level) showed improvement
   only in group 2 (P< 0.01), whereas severity of PE, the patient's
   perception of his deformity and parental physiological quality-of-life
   scores improved in both groups (P <0.05). Posture, satisfaction with
   treatment and the patients' physiological quality-of-life scores were
   significantly better in group 2 (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Due to the additional improvements and greater satisfaction
   in the group receiving physiotherapy, we think that a proper
   rehabilitation programme should be applied simultaneously with the
   vacuum bell treatment in patients with PE.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of the Internet has significantly changed consumption
   patterns and habits. Online grocery shopping is a way of purchasing food
   products using a web-based shopping service. The current COVID-19
   pandemic is determining a rethinking of purchase choice elements and of
   consumers' behavior. This work aims to investigate which characteristics
   can affect the decision of online food shopping during the pandemic
   emergency in Italy. In particular, the work aims to analyze the effects
   of a set of explanatory variables on the level of satisfaction for the
   food online shopping experience. For achieving this aim, the
   proportional odds version of the cumulative logit model is carried out.
   Data derive from an anonymous on-line questionnaire administrated during
   the first months of the pandemic and filled by 248 respondents. The
   results of this work highlight that people having familiarity with
   buying food online, that have a higher educational level and consider
   food online channels easy to use, appear more satisfied for the food
   online shopping experience. These findings can be crucial for the future
   green global challenges as online shopping may help to reach competitive
   advantages for company sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-based technologies play a central role in the dentistry field,
   as they present many methods for diagnosing and detecting various
   diseases, such as periodontitis. The current study aimed to develop and
   evaluate the state-of-the-art object detection and recognition
   techniques and deep learning algorithms for the automatic detection of
   periodontal disease in orthodontic patients using intraoral images. In
   this study, a total of 134 intraoral images were divided into a training
   dataset (n = 107 {[}80\%]) and a test dataset (n = 27 {[}20\%]). Two
   Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) models using
   ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were developed. The first
   model detects the teeth to locate the region of interest (ROI), while
   the second model detects gingival inflammation. The detection accuracy,
   precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) were calculated to
   verify the significance of the proposed model. The teeth detection model
   achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP of 100 \%, 100\%,
   51.85\%, and 100\%, respectively. The inflammation detection model
   achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP of 77.12\%, 88.02\%,
   41.75\%, and 68.19\%, respectively. This study proved the viability of
   deep learning models for the detection and diagnosis of gingivitis in
   intraoral images. Hence, this highlights its potential usability in the
   field of dentistry and aiding in reducing the severity of periodontal
   disease globally through preemptive non-invasive diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Visualization of Activated T Cells by OX40-ImmunoPET as a Strategy for
   Diagnosis of Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease}},
Journal = {{CANCER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4780-4790}},

Abstract = {{Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major complication of allogeneic
   hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), mediated primarily by donor T
   cells that become activated and attack host tissues. Noninvasive
   strategies detecting T-cell activation would allow for early diagnosis
   and possibly more effective management of HCT recipients. PET imaging is
   a sensitive and clinically relevant modality ideal for GvHD diagnosis,
   and there is a strong rationale for the use of PET tracers that can
   monitor T-cell activation and expansion with high specificity. The TNF
   receptor superfamily member OX40 (CD134) is a cell surface marker that
   is highly specific for activated T cells, is upregulated during GvHD,
   and mediates disease pathogenesis. We recently reported the development
   of an antibody-based activated T-cell imaging agent targeting OX40. In
   the present study, we visualize the dynamics of OX40 expression in an
   MHC-mismatch mouse model of acute GvHD using OX40-immunoPET. This
   approach enabled visualization of T-cell activation at early stages of
   disease, prior to overt clinical symptoms with high sensitivity and
   specificity. This study highlights the potential utility of the OX40 PET
   imaging as a new strategy for GvHD diagnosis and therapy monitoring.
   Significance: OX40-immunoPET imaging is a promising non-invasive
   strategy for early detection of GvHD, capable of detecting signs of GvHD
   pathology even prior to the development of overt clinical symptoms.}},

Title = {{Cylindrical micro and nanowires: Fabrication, properties and
   applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{513}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The state of the art in cylindrical nano and micro wires is reviewed
   with particular emphasis on the latest research trends. We analyze some
   of the key properties for prospective applications including magnetic
   anisotropy and micromagnetic structure, spin-caloritronics, domain wall
   dynamics and its control by transverse magnetic field and induced
   anisotropy, high frequency impedance and magnetic control of the
   electric polarizability, shape-memory and magnetocaloric effects in
   Heusler alloys wires. Cylindrical nanowires present specific magnetic
   domain configurations as complex vortex and transverse domains while the
   magnetization reversal typically involves propagation of Bloch-point
   domain walls. Such magnetic behavior offers new perspectives for
   applications in advanced technologies including spintronics, logic
   devices and novel magnetic recording media, functionalization and
   bioengineering and sensor devises. In particular, rapidly solidified
   glass-coated amorphous nanowires and submicron wires which constitute a
   novel class of ultrathin soft magnetic materials are attractive for
   future micro and nano sensors.
   Amorphous and nanocrystalline microwires prepared by rapid quenching
   from the melt can present quite peculiar magnetic properties, like
   spontaneous magnetic bistability associated with single and large
   Barkhausen jump and magnetoimpedance effect. Magnetic properties of
   amorphous microwires are related to the value and sign of the
   magnetostriction constant since the magnetoelastic anisotropy is one of
   the main sources of the magnetic anisotropy. As-prepared microwires with
   positive magnetostriction constant show generally rectangular hysteresis
   loops and fast domain wall propagation. In the case of low and negative
   magnetostriction, the wires demonstrate inclined hysteresis loops and
   large magnetoimpedance. To refine the magnetic structure, the easy
   anisotropy can be adjusted by annealing in the presence of a magnetic
   field and/or mechanical stress. Thus, the magnetic bistability in
   negative magnetostriction wires can be induced by annealing. Minimizing
   the magnetoelastic anisotropy either by adjusting the chemical
   composition with a low magnetostriction coefficient or by heat treatment
   is an appropriate route for enhancing the domain wall velocity.
   Tailoring the magnetic anisotropy by stress-annealing is also a
   promising method of the optimization of the domain wall dynamics in
   magnetic microwires.
   Soft magnetic properties and tunable magnetic structure of amorphous
   microwires are responsible for the magnetoimpedance effect, which
   preserves a high sensitivity up to GHz frequencies. This opens up novel
   applications based on the electric polarization of a finite-length
   microwire depending on the wire surface impedance near the antenna
   resonance, including embedded wireless sensing elements, self-sensing
   composites and selective microwave materials.
   Heusler alloys demonstrate the huge variety of physical properties that
   can be obtained by simple change in composition. Naturally, the efforts
   have been made to produce Heusler-based nano and micro wires to take
   advantage of variety of their physical properties in a miniature form.
   In this review, the emphasis is made on Heusler alloy glass-coated
   microwires.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study carried out at an elementary school
   that led to a characterization of mathematical modeling projects aimed
   at generating social impact. It shows their potential as generators of
   mathematical learning opportunities. In the school project, upper-grade
   students (sixth grade, 11-year-olds) studied the way in which the rest
   of the students at the institution traveled from their homes to school.
   Its purpose was to identify risk points from the standpoint of road
   safety and to develop a set of recommendations so that all the children
   could walk safely to school. In our study, we identified, on the one
   hand, the mathematical learning opportunities that emerged during the
   development of the project and, on the other, the mathematical models
   created by the students. We discuss the impact of the project on the
   different groups in the school community (other students, parents, and
   teachers). We conclude with a characterization of the mathematical
   modeling projects oriented towards social impact and affirm that they
   can be generators of mathematical learning opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Desperately seeking greater health of mind, body, and spirit,
   communities face confusing and conflicting narratives. The Church owns
   an opportunity to serve as a guide, revealing the intimate linkage
   between physical health and spiritual health. An oft-neglected topic,
   food is a powerful reminder of the mercy of sustenance, but our
   collective broken relationship with food begs for intervention. The very
   food we eat has the ability to promote recovery and prevent disease.
   Sadly, much of the modern diet does the opposite, increasing the risk
   for early death and disabling believers from investment in their
   callings. God's redemptive message and the fruits of modern science
   promote clarity as we eat to heal, eat to serve, eat to celebrate, and
   eat to change. The Church can invest in supporting communities as they
   experience God's best through nourishing daily bread and, ultimately,
   through the Bread of Life.}},

Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{The mitigation of furfuryl alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 2-furoic
   acid, and 5-hydroxymethyl 2-furoic acid was conducted in two dry model
   systems mimicking coffee and an actual coffee system by incorporating 14
   chemicals, that are categorized to phenolic acids, flavonoids,
   non-phenolic antioxidants, and non-antioxidant agents. Mitigation
   effects were determined as the decrease in the levels of the studied
   furan derivatives after the systems went through a controlled roasting
   process. Strong mitigation effects in the dry model systems were
   observed after the application of phenolic acids, quinic acid or EDTA.
   The mitigation effects of phenolic acids and flavonoids depended on the
   number and availability of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Certain agents
   exhibited a furan derivative-specific reducing effect while most of them
   showed a generalized effect. The mitigation efficacy decreased with the
   increasing complexity of the tested systems. In the coffee system,
   mitigation effects were almost completely lost in comparison with dry
   model systems. Still, taurine and sodium sulfite exerted the strongest
   mitigation effect in the coffee system.}},

Abstract = {{Zfp423 encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein that interacts with
   canonical signaling and lineage pathways. Mutations in mouse Zfp423 or
   its human ortholog ZNF423 are associated with a range of developmental
   abnormalities reminiscent of ciliopathies, including cerebellar vermis
   hypoplasia and other midline brain defects. Null mice have reduced
   viability in most strain backgrounds. Here we show complete lethality on
   a C57BL/6J background, dominant rescue in backcrosses to any of 13
   partner strains, with strain-dependent survival frequencies, and
   evidence for a BALB/c-derived survival modifier locus on chromosome 5.
   Survival data indicate both perinatal and postnatal periods of
   lethality. Anatomical data from a hypomorphic gene trap allele observed
   on both C57BL/6J and BALB/c congenic backgrounds shows an aggregate
   effect of background on sensitivity to Zfp423 loss rather than a binary
   effect on viability.}},

Abstract = {{There has been increased interest in phytoestrogens due to their
   potential effect in reducing the risk of developing cancer and
   cardiovascular disease. To evaluate phytoestrogens' exposure, sensitive
   and accurate methods should be developed for their quantification in
   food and human matrices. The present study aimed to validate a
   comprehensive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for
   the quantification of 16 phytoestrogens: Biochanin A,
   secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, enterodiol, enterolactone, equol,
   quercetin, genistein, glycitein, luteolin, naringenin, kaempferol,
   formononetin, daidzein, resveratrol and coumestrol, in food, serum and
   urine. Phytoestrogen extraction was performed by solid-phase extraction
   (food and serum) and liquid-liquid extraction (urine), and analyzed by
   LC diode-array detector (DAD) coupled with a single quadrupole MS with
   electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. Validation included
   selectivity, sensibility, recovery, accuracy and precision. The method
   was proved to be specific, with a linear response (r(2) >= 0.97). Limits
   of quantification were 0.008-3.541 ng/mL for food, 0.01-1.77 ng/mL for
   serum and 0.003-0.251 ng/mL for urine. Recoveries were 66-113\% for
   food, 63-104\% for serum and 76-111\% for urine. Accuracy and precision
   were below 15\% (except for enterodiol in food with 18\% and resveratrol
   in urine with 15.71\%). The method is suitable for the quantification of
   a wide number of phytoestrogens in food, serum and urine. The method was
   successfully applied in highly consumed food items (n = 6) from North
   Mexico and biofluids from healthy women (n = 10).}},

Abstract = {{A sequence of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with diverse Bi2O3 content
   (0.5-5 molar \%) has been synthesized by the sonication-mixture method
   using mesoporous beta-Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 and utilized as efficient
   photocatalysts for hydrogen generation from aqueous glycerol solutions
   beneath visible light irradiation. Mesoporous Bi2O3 particles were
   effectively integrated at the exterior of two-dimensional (2D) g-C3N4
   nanolayers producing effective heterojunctions that facilitate the
   charge transference amongst g-C3N4 and Bi2O3 and minimize the
   recombination of photocharges. The number and efficiency of the
   heterojunctions in the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites depend on the Bi2O3
   amount, reaching the optimal development at 3.0 molar \% of Bi2O3. The
   maximum H-2 production was then obtained on the 3.0\% beta-Bi2O3/g-C3N4
   nanocomposite that achieves a production (8600 mu mol g(-1)) 20-fold
   greater than that obtained on bare beta-Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 counterparts.
   The improvement in the photoactivity of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was
   analyzed taking into account the differences in the capability of the
   nanocomposites to fascinate visible light and the efficiency of
   detaching the photoinduced charges derived from the different Bi2O3

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is a growing concern regarding increasing road
   traffic accidents due to overburdened drivers, which also affect their
   general health. Drivers maintain the extreme position of arm, forearm,
   and legs which during distant journeys may put increased constraint on
   nerves passing in forearm and legs in addition to the vibrations
   transmission i.e., Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and Foot
   Transmitted Vibration (FTV).
   Aim: To find out if chronic repeated movements at wrist and foot along
   with vibration transmitted from steering wheel and pedals influence the
   nerve conduction parameters and to find out which nerves are more prone
   to neurological conduction defects.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted over a
   period of two years in neurophysiology lab, Department of Physiology, JN
   Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh,
   India. Mean peak sensory and motor latency, mean motor and sensory Nerve
   Conduction Velocity (NCV), Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP) and
   Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) of median, ulnar and common
   peroneal nerve in Professional Heavy Vehicle Drivers (PHVD) was compared
   with non-drivers using Medicaid System's (Electromyography) EMG/ (Nerve
   Conduction Velocity) NCV equipment with neuroperfect software. Student's
   unpaired t-test was used to assess the significance of difference in
   nerve conduction study findings.
   Results: Heavy vehicle drivers showed slow Sensory Nerve Conduction
   Velocity (SNCV) (drivers: 51.40 +/- 3.30, non-drivers: 53.66 +/- 3.60 in
   right hand p-value 0.0001) and (drivers: 52.51 +/- 3.78, non-drivers:
   53.87 +/- 3.61 in left hand p-value= 0.0145) and increase in sensory
   latency (drivers: 3.71 +/- 0.72, nondrivers: 2.89 +/- 0.56 in right hand
   p-value<0.0001 and drivers: 3.4 +/- 0.81 non-drivers: 2.76 +/- 0.70 in
   left hand p-value < 0.0001) of median nerve. Ulnar nerve sensory latency
   was prolonged (drivers: 2.98 +/- 0.52, non-drivers: 2.76 +/- 0.42 in
   right hand p-value 0.0021 and drivers: 2.97 +/- 0.42, non-drivers: 2.80
   +/- 0.65 in left hand p-value 0.0386) and sural nerve sensory latency
   was prolonged (drivers: 3.05 +/- 0.55, non-drivers: 2.78 +/- 0.54 in
   right leg p-value=0.0011 and drivers: 2.92 +/- 0.45, non-drivers: 2.69
   +/- 0.40 in left leg p-value 0.0004). There was no significant
   difference in Motor Nerve Conduction Velocity (MNCV), motor latency,
   SNAP and CMAP of median, ulnar and common peroneal nerve among heavy
   vehicle drivers in comparison to non-drivers.
   Conclusion: We conclude that pressure and vibrations transmitted at hand
   and foot along with repeated movements at forearm wrist and pedals leads
   to more neurological conduction defects in median nerve than in ulnar
   and sural nerve. Flexibility in delivery time, incorporating judicious
   breaks in duty, better ergonomics design may help in improving work
   conditions of drivers.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the factors associated with the development of
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), hospital stay and
   mortality, and early versus late MRSA infection.
   Methods: Cases (n=44) were intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted
   to King Fahd Specialist Hospital, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia between 2015
   and 2019 who developed MRSA during their hospital stay. Controls (n=48)
   were patients from the same place and period who did not develop MRSA.
   Data were abstracted from hospital records.
   Results: Admission with sepsis (case: 46\% vs. control: 2\%, p<0.001)
   and having at least one comorbid condition (case: 95\% vs. control:
   46\%, p<0.001) were significantly associated with the development of
   MRSA. Age (mean +/- SD: case: 65 +/- 18, control: 64 +/- 18, p=0.7) and
   gender (\% male, case: 52\%, control: 56\%4=0.70) were not associated
   with the development of MRSA. Approximately 73\% of all MRSA cases
   developed within the first 2 weeks of admission. Among the early cases,
   44\% died during their ICU stay; the corresponding percentage among the
   late cases was 42\% (p=0.69). There was no difference between early and
   late MRSA cases in terms of non-sepsis admissions (50\% vs. 67\%,
   p=0.32) or comorbid status (at least one: 97\% vs. 92\%, p=0.17).

   Detection System}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Detection and mitigation of modern malware are critical for the normal
   operation of an organisation. Traditional defence mechanisms are
   becoming increasingly ineffective due to the techniques used by
   attackers such as code obfuscation, metamorphism, and polymorphism,
   which strengthen the resilience of malware. In this context, the
   development of adaptive, more effective malware detection methods has
   been identified as an urgent requirement for protecting the IT
   infrastructure against such threats, and for ensuring security. In this
   paper, we investigate an alternative method for malware detection that
   is based on N-grams and machine learning. We use a dynamic analysis
   technique to extract an Indicator of Compromise (IOC) for malicious
   files, which are represented using N-grams. The paper also proposes
   TF-IDF as a novel alternative used to identify the most significant
   N-grams features for training a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the
   paper evaluates the proposed technique using various supervised
   machine-learning algorithms. The results show that Logistic Regression,
   with a score of 98.4\%, provides the best classification accuracy when
   compared to the other classifiers used.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a positive and significant IVOL effect in the
   Singapore Stock Market meaning that the highly volatile stocks are
   showing better returns in the subsequent month. More explicitly, there
   is a strong positive relationship between stock's idiosyncratic
   volatility (IVOL) and its subsequent month's return in the Singapore
   equity market. This positive IVOL effect is stronger only for small
   market-statistic firms. But for the Large capital firms, the positive
   IVOL effect is insignificant. In addition, this paper shows that the

   subsequent month's return is positive and significant in this market.
   However, IVOL is the true effect of this market rather than MAX.}},

Title = {{The duration o embryo culture after mouse IVF differentially affects
   cardiovascular and metabolic health in male offspring}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2497-2514}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Do the long-term health outcomes following IVF differ
   depending upon the duration of embryo culture before transfer?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that in male but not
   female offspring, adverse cardiovascular (CV) health was more likely
   with prolonged culture to the blastocyst stage, but metabolic
   dysfunction was more likely if embryo transfer (ET) occurred at the
   early cleavage stage.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ART associate with increased risk of adverse CV
   and metabolic health in offspring, and these findings have been
   confirmed in animal models in the absence of parental infertility
   issues. It is unclear which specific ART treatments may cause these
   risks. There is increasing use of blastocyst, versus cleavage-stage,
   transfer in clinical ART which does not appear to impair perinatal
   health of children born, but the longer-term health implications are
   unknown.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Five mouse groups were generated
   comprising: (i) natural mating (NM)-naturally mated, nonsuperovulated
   and undisturbed gestation; (ii) IV-ET-2Cell-in-vivo derived two-cell
   embryos collected from superovulated mothers, with immediate ET to
   recipients; (iii) IVF-ET-2Cell-IVF generated embryos, from oocytes from
   superovulated mothers, cultured to the two-cell stage before ET to
   recipients; (iv) IV-ET-BL-in vivo derived blastocysts collected from
   superovulated mothers, with immediate ET to recipients; (v)
   IVF-ET-BL-IVF generated embryos, from oocytes from superovulated
   mothers, cultured to the blastocyst stage before ET to recipients. Both
   male and female offspring were analysed for growth, CV and metabolic
   markers of health. There were 8-13 litters generated for each group for
   analyses; postnatal data were analysed by multilevel random effects
   regression to take account of between-mother and within-mother variation
   and litter size.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: C57/BL6 female mice (3-4
   weeks old) were used for oocyte production; CBA males for sperm with
   human tubal fluid medium were used for IVF. Embryos were transferred
   (ET) to MF1 pseudo-pregnant recipients at the two-cell stage or cultured
   in synthetic oviductal medium enriched with potassium medium to the
   blastocyst stage before ET. Control in-vivo embryos from C57BL6 x CBA
   matings were collected and immediately transferred at the two-cell or
   blastocyst stage. Postnatal assays included growth rate up to 27 weeks;
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 9,15 and 21 weeks; lung and serum
   angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity at time of cull (27 weeks);
   glucose tolerance test (GTT; 27 weeks); basal glucose and insulin levels
   (27 weeks); and lipid accumulation in liver cryosections using Oil Red O
   imaging (27 weeks).
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Blastocysts formed by IVF developed
   at a slower rate and comprised fewer cells that in-vivo generated
   blastocysts without culture (P < 0.05). Postnatal growth rate was
   increased in all four experimental treatments compared with NM group
   (P<0.05). SBP, serum and lung ACE and heart/body weight were higher in
   IVF-ET-BL versus IVF-ET-2Cell males (P<0.05) and higher than in other
   treatment groups, with SBP and lung ACE positively correlated (P <
   0.05). Glucose handling (GTT AUC) was poorer and basal insulin levels
   were higher in IVF-ET-2Cell males than in IVF-ET-BL (P<0.05) with the
   glucose:insulin ratio more negatively correlated with body weight in
   IVF-ET-2Cell males than in other groups. Liver/body weight and liver
   lipid droplet diameter and density in IVF-ET-2Cell males were higher
   than in IVF-ET-BL males (P<0.05). IVF groups had poorer health
   characteristics than their in-vivo control groups, indicating that
   outcomes were not caused specifically by background techniques
   (superovulation, ED. No consistent health effects from duration of
   culture were identified in female offspring.
   LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results from experimental animal
   models cannot be extrapolated to humans. Nevertheless, they are valuable
   to develop conceptual models, in this case, in the absence of
   confounding parental infertility, in assessing the safety of ART
   manipulations.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The study indicates that longer
   duration of embryo culture after IVF up to blastocyst before ET leads to
   increased dysfunction of CV health in males compared with IVF and
   shorter cleavage-stage ET. However, the metabolic health of male
   offspring was poorer after shorter versus longer culture duration. This
   distinction indicates that the origin of CV and metabolic health
   phenotypes after ART may be different. The poorer metabolic health of
   males after cleavage-stage ET coincides with embryonic genome activation
   occurring at the time of ET.}},

   months from the mid 2019 till the mid 2020. All type 2 diabetic patients
   attending the diabetes center during the period of the study were
   eligible to be included in the present study. The data collection tools
   were two questionnaires. The first one is general and structured
   questionnaire designed with special emphasis on general demographics and
   risk factors of MCI. The second one was the Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment (MoCA). Result: The mean age of the studied patients was 52.2
   +/- 7.5 years with 59\% participants aged 50 and more years, and male
   patients were representing 71\% of the studied patients. Of the studied
   200 patients there have been 118 (59\%) patients showed normal cognitive
   function. Forty-eight patients (24\%) were found to have mild cognitive
   impairment, 15\% showed moderate and 2\% showed severe impairment. The
   pie chart showed the frequency distribution and percentage of the
   cognitive impairment among the studied diabetic patients. Hypertensive
   patients were only showed a significant higher prevalence of mild
   cognitive impairment (34\% vs. 21.2\%). Although not significant the
   prevalence was also higher among patients with heart (38.4\%) and CNS
   diseases (33.3\%). Conclusion: There was considerable increment of MCI
   among type 2 diabetic patients. Certain factors appeared to be at a
   higher risk of MCI and was found to increase the prevalence among the
   studied diabetic patients. patients' age, sex, marital status,
   educational level and occupation are amongst the socio-demographic
   factors. Also, the diabetes duration, compliance to treatment, HbA1c
   level and type of medication as well as the associated heart disease and
   hypertension were included.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular switching of complexes based on diarylethenes in a
   solid-state is their most frequently studied property. This switching
   becomes possible when the active carbon atoms acquire a suitable
   interatomic separation in the molecule. Even if the structural analysis
   may suggest conditions disfavouring the occurrence of such switching, it
   may still be enabled by post-synthetic modification of the sample, like
   dehydration. In the present study, a novel one-dimensional coordination
   polymer with composition \{{[}Zn(mu(3)-HA)(H2O)(3)]center dot H2O\}(n)
   (I) was prepared and characterized. In its solid state, however, its
   thiophene rings were arranged in the nonswitchable conformation yielding
   a C center dot center dot center dot C separation 4.148(6) angstrom
   between the active carbon atoms. After fully dehydrating the sample,
   this interatomic separation decreased to 3.814 angstrom, making it
   susceptible to photochromism by UV radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and
   ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammatory condition of the
   gastrointestinal tract. Since the treatment of IBD is still an
   unresolved issue, we designed our study to investigate the effect of a
   novel therapeutic target, sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R), considering its
   ability to activate antioxidant molecules. As a model,
   2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) was used to induce colitis in
   Wistar-Harlan male rats. To test the beneficial effects of sigma 1R,
   animals were treated intracolonically (i.c.): (1) separately with an
   agonist (fluvoxamine (FLV)), (2) with an antagonist of the receptor
   (BD1063), or (3) as a co-treatment. Our results showed that FLV
   significantly decreased the severity of inflammation and increased the
   body weight of the animals. On the contrary, simultaneous treatment of
   FLV with BD1063 diminished the beneficial effects of FLV. Furthermore,
   FLV significantly enhanced the levels of glutathione (GSH) and
   peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and caused a significant reduction in
   3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels, the effects of which were abolished by
   co-treatment with BD1063. Taken together, our results suggest that the
   activation of sigma 1R in TNBS-induced colitis through FLV may be a
   promising therapeutic strategy, and its protective effect seems to
   involve the antioxidant pathway system.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, the development of cone beam computed tomography
   (CBCT) has led to a large range of imaging methods. CBCT has advantages
   compared to other extraoral radiographic imaging, but its contribution
   to radiation dose in patients is a point of concern. This study aims to
   provide a full understanding and determination of absorbed dose and an
   estimation of effective dose to the thyroid, bone marrow, salivary
   glands and brain in patients during CBCT examinations and to estimate
   the radiogenic risk resulting from radiation exposure. In this study, a
   total of 157 pediatric and adult patients with different indications
   were investigated at the dental clinic. All procedures were performed
   using Planmeca ProMax 3D Max. Sensitive organ equivalent doses were
   estimated using PCXMC software. Organ equivalent doses were also
   estimated using PCXMC software. The fixed tube voltage was set to 90.0
   kVp, the mean tube current was 12.7.0 mA (range: 8.0 to 14.0) and the
   mean exposure time was 12.5 +/- 1.8 s (range: 12.0-16.0). The overall
   mean patient effective dose was 150.8 mu Sv (range: 22.4-210.0).
   Salivary gland equivalent dose was the highest of all the organs
   measured as no protective shield was used in these patients. Patient
   doses were slightly higher compared to those in previous studies. Poor
   patient protection conditions were noted. Staff training is a vital
   priority regardless of a low dose of CBCT compared to other imaging
   modalities.}},

Title = {{Intra-cerebral haemorrhage but not neurodegenerative disease appears
   over-represented in deaths of Australian cadaveric pituitary hormone
   recipients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Recent scientific reports and epidemiological
   studies have engendered mounting concerns regarding the potential
   human-to-human transmissibility of non-prion neurodegenerative and
   related diseases. This study investigated whether recipients of
   cadaveric pituitary hormone treatments are at increased risk of death
   from non-prion neurodegenerative and related diseases.
   Methods: A retrospective national cohort study based on death
   certificates of recipients of the cadaveric pituitary hormone treatments
   (n = 184) as part of the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program
   (AHPHP; n = 2940) 1967-1985. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) from
   non-prion neurodegenerative and other diseases were estimated based on
   the Australian population.
   Results: Allowing for potential diagnostic mis-attributions, there was
   no significant increase in the SMR from non-prion central nervous system
   (CNS) neurodegenerative disease, especially dementia and/or Alzheimer's
   disease (0.47; {[}95\% CI: 0.19, 1.12] P = 0.081). The SMR for
   intra-cerebral haemorrhage, potentially related to cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy (CAA), was increased (2.77; {[}95\% CI: 1.12-5.75] P =
   0.009), although accommodation of possible mis-diagnosis through
   conflation of this category with other stroke causes of death
   emphasising likely intra-cranial haemorrhage showed no persisting
   significant increase in mortality in cadaveric pituitary hormone
   recipients, including all deaths recorded as due to intracranial
   haemorrhage (1.72; {[}95\% CI: 0.80, 3.26] P = 0.123).
   Conclusion: In the setting of recent evidence strongly supporting the
   likelihood of brain-to-brain horizontal transmission and subsequent
   propagation and deposition of abnormally folded proteins associated with
   non-prion neurodegenerative and related disorders, this study offers
   further tentative support for deaths directly stemming from transmission
   of non-prion disease related to cadaveric pituitary hormone treatment.
   Acknowledging the limitations of the present study, however, ongoing
   detailed assessments of this potential risk are necessary. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The present study addresses the immobilization of the GOX enzyme into a
   conventional polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) membrane and a multi-layer
   membrane system (PCL/PVOH/PCL), both synthetized through electrospinning
   technique. More specifically, the enzyme was encapsulated inside a PVOH
   hydrophilic membrane, which was in turn protected by two hydrophobic
   polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes (multilayer system). The manufactured
   systems were characterized through IR spectroscopy, enzymatic kinetics
   and mechanical properties. Moreover, the morphology of the fibers
   composing the membranes was studied by Scanning Electronic Microscopy
   (SEM) and image analysis. Finally, the enzyme activity of the systems
   was in-vitro bacterial cultures using E. coli. The results obtained
   indicate that the addition of the GOX enzyme involves a slight reduction
   of the mechanical properties (maximum strain at break and maximum
   stress), which is associated with an increase of the polydispersity of
   the generated fibers. However, the mats showed antibacterial properties,
   which were evidenced by the inhibition of E. coli growth. These results
   indicate that this technique is suitable for the immobilization of
   enzymes with potential use in the active packaging industry. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{In this work we present two mathematical models for the infection
   dynamics of scabies. The dynamics is described by four-dimensional
   system of ordinary differential equations that expresses the
   transmissions between susceptible and infectious/infective individuals.
   In the second model, we include the importance of adult scabiei mite in
   the real interaction with hosts. Nonnegativity and boundedness of
   solutions of the models are conducted. A threshold parameter is
   calculated for each model which ensures the existence of all
   corresponding equilibria. Using candidate Lyapunov functions, it is
   shown that whenever the threshold parameter is less than or equal unity,
   the models have an associated disease-free equilibrium that is globally
   asymptotically stable. In addition, when the threshold exceeds unity the
   models have a globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium.
   Finally, using some parameter values related to the scabies infection
   dynamics, numerical simulation results are demonstrated to clarify the
   main theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated temporary
   modifications in the current head and neck oncology treatment paradigm.
   Till date, no definite treatment for COVID-19 has been discovered.
   Considering the situation of the global COVID-19 outbreak, methods that
   minimize patient visits with no compromise in efficacy should be
   considered. The optimal method for tongue reconstruction has not been
   determined yet. The artificial bilayer membrane has been used as mucosal
   substitute in few cases of tongue reconstruction with promising results.
   Case presentation: We present two cases of tongue reconstruction with
   acellular dermal matrix post partial glossectomy for tongue carcinoma
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both patients showed good recovery and
   healing, and no side effects and/or complications were reported.
   Discussion: The acellular dermal matrix is not a standard technique for
   tongue reconstruction but one of the available options. The few reported
   cases in literature showed promising results in regard of function and
   healing.
   Conclusion: We believe the use of acellular dermal matrix can help in
   preventing the spread of COVID-19 because of the absence of donor
   morbidity, decreasing post-operative hospital stay and visits.}},

   shifting epidemic by person, place, and time}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{216}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: With the emergence of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl-involved
   overdose rates increased from 2013 to 2017 in the United States (US). We
   describe US trends in opioid-related overdose mortality rates by race,
   age, urbanicity, and opioid type before and after the emergence of
   fentanyl.
   Methods: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER
   database, we estimated crude and agestandardized opioid-related overdose
   mortality rates at the intersections of race (non-Hispanic {[}NH] Black
   and white), age (<55 and >= 55 years), sex (male and female) and
   urbanicity (urban and rural residence) from 2005 to 2017. We compare
   relative changes in mortality from 2013 to 17, and describe changes in
   the contributions of fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids to
   opioid-related overdose mortality.
   Results: From 2013 to 2017, the overall opioid overdose mortality rate
   was consistently higher in NH white Americans, however, the rate
   increase was greater among NH Black (174 \%) compared to NH white (85
   \%) Americans. The steepest increases occurred in the overdose rates
   between 2013 and 2017 among younger (aged <55 years) urban NH Black
   Americans (178 \% increase). Among older (>= 55 years) adults, only
   urban NH Black Americans had an increase in overdose-related mortality
   rate (87 \% increase). Urban NH Black Americans also experienced the
   greatest increase in the percent of fentanyl-involved deaths (65 \% in
   younger, 61 \% in older).
   Conclusions: In the era of increased availability of illicitly
   manufactured fentanyl (2013-2017), there has been a disproportionate
   increase in opioid-related overdose deaths among urban NH Black
   Americans. Interventions for urban NH Black Americans are urgently
   needed to halt the increase in overdose deaths.}},

Abstract = {{Improving management of complex and congested facilities in hospital
   buildings is a potential point for both reducing money spent and
   enhancing quality level of the medical services provided in public
   hospitals of Iran. Although Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   identified as an effective tool for improving Facility Management (FM),
   use of advantages it offers to the FM processes of hospitals has been
   neglected thus far in the country. To address this issue, this research
   aims to investigate the BIM capabilities and the supporting
   organizational structure of public hospitals in Iran which can help
   improve their FM processes. A comprehensive literature review of
   applicable capabilities of BIM to the FM processes was conducted.
   Hierarchical FM structure of public hospitals in the country was
   recognized through a review of the related regulations. A public
   hospital case was chosen for in-depth recognition of FM process
   operations and validation of the proposed BIM-based improvements. It was
   argued that the use of BIM capabilities could substantially improve the
   FM processes of public hospitals. Reduced duration of FM activities,
   improved facility layouts, enhanced communication and coordination,
   facilitated training, and improved emergency management are some of the
   expected outcomes. (C) 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {{Most ecological studies require a cost-effective collection of

   large-sized grabs to collect infauna have been used at greater depths,
   despite no consistent relationship between grab size and replication
   across studies; and (2) the total number of taxa and individuals is
   largely determined by the replication. Then, infauna from a sedimentary
   (sandy) seabed at Gran Canaria Island was collected through van Veen
   grabs of three sizes: 0.018, 0.042 and 0.087 m(2) to optimize, on a
   simple cost-benefit basis, sample size and replication. Specifically,
   (1) the degree of representativeness in the composition of assemblages,
   and (2) accuracy of three univariate metrics (species richness, total
   infaunal abundances and the Shannon-Wiener index), was compared
   according to replication. Then, by considering mean times (a surrogate
   of costs) to process a sample by each grab, (3) their cost-efficiency
   was estimated. Representativeness increased with grab size. Irrespective
   of the grab size, accuracy of univariate metrics considerably increased
   when n > 10 replicates. Costs associated with the 0.087 m(2) grab were
   consistently lower than costs by the other grabs. In conclusion, because
   of high representativeness and low cost, a 6.87 L grab appears to be the
   optimal sample size to assess infauna at our local site.}},

Abstract = {{SIGNIFICANCE
   The selective reduction in visible wavelengths transmitted through
   commercially available blue-blocking lenses (BBLs) is known to influence
   the appearance and contrast detection of objects, particularly at low
   light levels. This influence may impair the human retinal receptor
   response time to dynamic light changes during photostress events.
   PURPOSE
   This study aimed to assess whether BBLs selectively affect photostress
   recovery times (PSRTs) for chromatic and achromatic stimuli of different
   Weber contrasts that were viewed on a dark black background. METHODS
   Photostress recovery times were measured in 12 younger participants (18
   to 39 years old) with no history of ocular disease or abnormal vision.
   Photostress recovery times were evaluated for four brands of BBLs, which
   were compared with a control lens. In these experiments, after exposure
   to an intense light source for 5 seconds, the time taken to recover
   vision and correctly identify a computer-generated letter stimulus
   viewed under low and high luminance levels was determined, which means
   perception is likely to be governed by mesopic and photopic conditions.
   Across conditions, the letter stimulus was achromatic and chromatic and
   could differ in luminance contrast. RESULTS
   Under photopic stimulus conditions, although reducing luminance contrast
   increased PSRTs, BBLs had no significant effect on PSRTs relative to
   control lens. However, under mesopic stimulus conditions, BBLs
   significantly affect PSRTs for both achromatic (F-2.006,F-8.02 = 61.95,
   P < .0001) and chromatic stimuli (F-3,F-16 =139.01, P < .0001),
   particularly for blue targets, which had considerably longer PSRTs
   (38.40 seconds). The brand of BBL was also shown to selectively affect
   PSRTs, with those with transmittance profiles that block the most blue
   light having longer PSRTs. CONCLUSIONS
   The present study suggests that, although the color and contrast of the
   target stimuli affected recovery times, the difference in recovery times
   between different types of BBLs was noticed only under low-light-level
   stimulus conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physical activity can help to protect against cognitive
   decline in older adults. However, little is known about the potential
   combined relationships of time spent in sedentary behavior (SB),
   light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous
   physical activity (MVPA) with indices of cognitive health. We examined
   the cross-sectional associations of objectively-determined sedentary and
   physically-active behaviors with an indicator of cognitive function
   decline (CFD) in older adults.
   Methods: A randomly-recruited sample of 511 Japanese older adults (47\%
   male; aged 65-84 years) wore a tri-axial accelerometer for 7 consecutive
   days in 2017. Cognitive function was assessed by interviewers using the
   Japanese version of Mini-Mental State Examination, with a score of <= 23
   indicating CFD. Associations of sedentary and physically-active
   behaviors with CFD were examined using a compositional logistic
   regression analysis based on isometric log-ratio transformations of time
   use, adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results: Forty one (9.4\%) of the participants had an indication of CFD.
   Activity compositions differed significantly between CFD and normal
   cognitive function (NCF); the proportion of time spent in MVPA was
   39.1\% lower, relative to the overall mean composition in those with
   CFD, and was 5.3\% higher in those with NCF. There was a significant
   beneficial association of having a higher proportion of MVPA relative to
   other activities with CFD. LPA and SB were not associated with CFD when
   models were corrected for time spent in all activity behaviors.
   Conclusions: Larger relative contribution of MVPA was favorably
   associated with an indicator of CFD in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{The pandemic provoked by COVID-19 poses a series of dilemmas for
   democratic systems. In the first place, governing a complex problem like
   this requires a great deal of coordination between different levels and
   areas of government. This coordination can lead to processes where power
   is concentrated in the hands of state cabinets and, therefore, weaken
   the separation of horizontal and vertical powers. Likewise, controlling
   the pandemic calls for measures that might represent major restrictions
   on fundamental rights and freedoms. We analyse these dilemmas in this
   article and study how citizens respond to them. By analysing a panel
   survey carried out in January, March and June 2020, we can see a very
   marked trend, in the first instance, demanding strong, technocratic and
   centralised leadership, as well as accepting restrictions on freedoms.
   After the first wave of infections, there was a significant shift in
   this trend, with the exception of technocratic preferences, which are
   still at significantly higher levels than prior to the pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{In this prospective, interventional, international study, we investigate
   continuous monitoring of hospitalised patients' vital signs using
   wearable technology as a basis for real-time early warning scores (EWS)
   estimation and vital signs time-series prediction. The collected
   continuous monitored vital signs are heart rate, blood pressure,
   respiration rate, and oxygen saturation of a heterogeneous patient
   population hospitalised in cardiology, postsurgical, and dialysis wards.
   Two aspects are elaborated in this study. The first is the high-rate
   (every minute) estimation of the statistical values (e.g., minimum and
   mean) of the vital signs components of the EWS for one-minute segments
   in contrast with the conventional routine of 2 to 3 times per day. The
   second aspect explores the use of a hybrid machine learning algorithm of
   kNN-LS-SVM for predicting future values of monitored vital signs. It is
   demonstrated that a real-time implementation of EWS in clinical practice
   is possible. Furthermore, we showed a promising prediction performance
   of vital signs compared to the most recent state of the art of a boosted
   approach of LSTM. The reported mean absolute percentage errors of
   predicting one-hour averaged heart rate are 4.1, 4.5, and 5\% for the
   upcoming one, two, and three hours respectively for cardiology patients.
   The obtained results in this study show the potential of using wearable
   technology to continuously monitor the vital signs of hospitalised
   patients as the real-time estimation of EWS in addition to a reliable
   prediction of the future values of these vital signs is presented.
   Ultimately, both approaches of high-rate EWS computation and vital signs
   time-series prediction is promising to provide efficient cost-utility,
   ease of mobility and portability, streaming analytics, and early warning
   for vital signs deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{The progressive population aging is both, a public responsibility and a
   social challenge. There is a shortage of qualitative social studies
   focused on analysing the problems faced by older adults, according to
   their own perspective. For this reason, the present study, based on the
   paradigm of active aging, aims to analyse mayor concerns and
   self-perceived problems by older adults themselves, as well as
   subjective assessment and attributions they make of them. Therefore, we
   study not only these problems, but also the implications that these have
   in personal, emotional, family and social areas. Furthermore, this
   research is approached from a comparative perspective between Germany
   and Spain, which are context with different models of Social Welfare.
   For this purpose, a qualitative research was designed using the
   techniques of semi-structured interview and focus group. Participants
   were selected in a double profile: expert and older adult. The criterion
   of discourse saturation established the final sample of 56 study
   subjects. We highlight poverty, loneliness and the break with lifestyles
   and social networks,which feed each other and affect different areas of

Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the application of graph theory with
   functional connectivity to distinguish left from right temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE).
   Methods: Alterations in functional connectivity within several brain
   networks - default mode (DMN), attention (AN), limbic (LN), sensorimotor
   (SMN) and visual (VN) - were examined using resting-state functional MRI
   (rsfMRI). The study accrued 21 left and 14 right TLE as well as 17
   nonepileptic control subjects. The local nodal degree, a feature of
   graph theory, was calculated for each of the brain networks.
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the
   accuracy of identifying seizure laterality based on significant
   differences in local nodal degree in the selected networks.
   Results: Left and right TLE patients showed dissimilar patterns of
   alteration in functional connectivity when compared to control subjects.
   Compared with right TLE, patients with left TLE exhibited greater nodal
   degree' (i.e. hyperconnectivity) with right superomedial frontal gyms
   (in DMN), inferior frontal gyms pars triangularis (in AN), right caudate
   and left superior temporal gyms (in LN) and left paracentral lobule (in
   SMN), while showing lesser nodal degree (i.e. hypoconnectivity) with
   left temporal pole (in DMN), right insula (in LN), left supplementary
   motor area (in SMN), and left fusiform gyms (in VN). The LN showed the
   highest accuracy of 82.9\% among all considered networks in determining
   laterality of the TLE. By combinations of local degree attributes in the
   DMN, AN, LN, and VN, logistic regression analysis demonstrated an
   accuracy of 94.3\% by comparison.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the utility of graph theory
   application to brain network analysis as a potential biomarker to assist
   in the determination of TLE laterality and improve the confidence in
   presurgical decision-making in cases of TLE.}},

   Scale. Plasma concentrations of TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta were
   measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays before and after six
   months of treatment. IL-6 and IL-1 beta significantly increased as a
   factor of time after 6 months of treatment. The elevation was
   statistically significant confined to children with pretreatment
   suicidality. Within the children with pretreatment suicidality, IL-6
   levels increased significantly after 6 months only in the children who
   developed SSRI-associated suicidality. To summarize, an increase in IL-6
   levels after 6 months of treatment may be associated with SSRI-emergent
   suicidality in children with pretreatment suicidality. Further studies
   are needed to clarify the role and mechanism(s) of IL-6 in the
   pathogenesis of this life-threatening adverse event. (C) 2020 Elsevier

   background-oriented schlieren (BOS)}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tomographic background-oriented schlieren (BOS) is used to measure
   three-dimensional instantaneous density fields in turbulent flows.
   Density gradients are related to the refractive index through the
   Gladstone-Dale relation. Based on path-integrated apparent displacements
   in a background pattern from path variations in light rays travelling
   through the flow, a tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional
   refractive index gradients can be obtained. A Poisson equation of the
   reconstructed gradients is solved to obtain the refractive index field.
   We examine four sources of measurement error: (i) defocus blurring; (ii)
   spatial averaging in the finite difference scheme for solving the
   Poisson equation; (iii) limited-view tomographic reconstruction; and
   (iv) displacement field noise. Synthetic BOS displacements are generated
   from the instantaneous density fields of a heated jet at a Reynolds
   number of 10 000 and jet exit centreline-to-ambient density ratio of
   0.83 computed via DNS. Synthetic background displacements are produced
   by raytracing through the refractive index field obtained using the
   Gladstone-Dale relation. The virtual BOS setup consists of 15 cameras
   placed circumferentially around the jet axis, based on a proposed
   experimental setup. We show that defocus blurring has the greatest
   impact on the measurement accuracy, using the RMS and peak errors
   between the measured and true DNS fields as metrics; its impact is
   greatest in the transitional region and decreases steadily downstream.
   Sources (ii) and (iv) have marginal impact (for noise 15\% of mean
   displacements). Three reconstruction methods are tested: (i) filtered
   back-projection (FBP); (ii) an algebraic reconstruction technique (ART);
   and (iii) sequential FBP-ART. ART and FBP-ART are similarly accurate,
   producing under half the errors of FBP, which suffers from significant
   reconstruction artefacts. The reconstruction error is modest compared to
   the impact of defocus blurring.}},

Title = {{Estimation of Tunisian Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Different Livestock

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) from seven Tunisian livestock species and their evolution
   over eleven consecutive years (2008-2018). The species of animals used
   were cattle (dairy and others), sheep, goats, camelids, horses, donkeys
   and mules, and poultry. The estimations of CH4 and N2O emissions were
   based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines
   for national inventories, using Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches, with its
   default emission factors (EFs). The Tier 2 approach was applied only for
   the calculation of EF to estimate CH4 emissions related to livestock
   manure management. CH4 emission represented more than 92\% of the total
   greenhouse gas (GHG) from livestock emissions. Moreover, 53\% of the
   total CH4 emissions from livestock were derived from cattle, followed by
   sheep, goats, other mammals (camelids, horses, mules, and donkeys), and
   poultry. During the period covered by the study (2008-2018), a slight
   and continuous decrease of both livestock population and total GHG
   emissions was observed, mainly in terms of CH4. In mammals, CH4
   emissions were greater than N2O emissions, whereas in poultry, N2O
   emissions were up to 2.6 times greater than CH4 emissions. The
   aggressive drive of the government to increase cattle and sheep
   production might affect CH4 emissions in the future. Therefore, periodic
   estimations of GHG emissions from livestock are required to follow the
   time trends for more rational decision-making regarding livestock and
   GHG emissions policies.}},

Journal = {{NANOMATERIALS}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in a variety
   of consumer products. Cellular exposure to TiO2 NPs results in complex
   effects on cell physiology that could impact biological systems. We
   investigated the behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in intestinal
   epithelial cells pre-treated with either a low or high (1 and 20 mu
   g/cm(2)) dose of TiO2 NPs. Our results indicate that the pre-treated
   cells with a low dose became more permissive to listeria infection;
   indeed, both adhesion and invasion were significantly increased compared
   to control. Increased invasion seems to be correlated to cytoskeletal
   alterations induced by nanoparticles, and higher bacterial survival
   might be due to the high levels of listeriolysin O that protects L.
   monocytogenes from reactive oxygen species (ROS). The potential risk of
   increased susceptibility to L. monocytogenes infection related to
   long-term intake of nanosized TiO2 at low doses should be considered.}},

Title = {{Adolescent alcohol exposure increases orexin-A/hypocretin-1 in the

Journal = {{ALCOHOL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Adolescence is a time of marked changes in sleep, neuromaturation, and
   alcohol use. While there is substantial evidence that alcohol disrupts
   sleep and that disrupted sleep may play a role in the development of
   alcohol use disorders (AUD), there is very little known about the brain
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. The orexin (also known as
   hypocretin) system is fundamental for a number of homeostatic
   mechanisms, including the initiation and maintenance of wakefulness that
   may be impacted by adolescent alcohol exposure. The current study
   investigated the impact of adolescent ethanol exposure on adult
   orexin-A/hypocretin-1 immunoreactive (orexin-A + IR) cells in
   hypothalamic nuclei in two models of adolescent intermittent ethanol
   (AIE) exposure. Both models assess adult hypothalamic orexin following
   either an AIE vapor exposure paradigm, or an AIE intragastric gavage
   paradigm during adolescence. Both AIE exposure models found that binge
   levels of ethanol intoxication during adolescence significantly
   increased adult orexin-A + IR expression in the anterior hypothalamic
   nucleus (AHN). Further, both AIE models found no change in orexin-A + IR
   in the posterior hypothalamic area (PH), perifornical nucleus (PeF),
   dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus dorsal part (DMD) or lateral
   hypothalamic area (LH). However, AIE vapor exposure reduced orexin-A +
   IR in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), but AIE gavage exposure did
   not. These findings suggest that the AHN orexinergic system is increased
   in adults following binge-like patterns of intoxication during
   adolescence. Altered adult AHN orexin could contribute to long-lasting
   changes in sleep. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contracaecum sp. nematodes are important parasites of fish eating birds
   that can cause animal health problems. In the present study, specimens
   of Contracaecum rudolphii sensu lato, from the great cormorant
   Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis from Sardinia, were characterized based on
   morphological and molecular data. The morphological analysis allowed to
   identify all the fourth stage larvae (n = 1918) as Contracaecum sp., and
   adults, male (n = 5845) and female (n = 8312), as C. rudolphii sensu
   lato. Population genetics and phylogenetic relationships were inferred
   based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Multiple sequence alignment
   of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer showed the coexistence of
   C. rudolphii A (n = 157), C. rudolphii B (n = 22) and a rare
   heterozygote of these species. Moreover, mitochondrial markers, namely
   NADH dehydrogenase subunits I (nad1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit (cox1
   and cox2) and small subunit of rRNA (rrnS), showed that the studied C.
   rudolphii A populations had undergone bottleneck, or founder effect
   event, subsequent to a rapid population growth and expansion. The
   observed heterozygote is with a mitochondrial pattern of C. rudolphii B.
   Although, both Contracaecum species showed high genetic diversity, no
   genetic structure between localities was detected. Phylogenetic
   reconstructions supported the paraphyly of the avian Contracaecum
   species including C. ogmorhini (parasite of otariids).}},

Abstract = {{An outbreak of winter dysentery, complicated by severe respiratory
   syndrome, occurred in January 2020 in a high production dairy cow herd
   located in a hilly area of the Calabria region. Of the 52 animals
   belonging to the farm, 5 (9.6\%) died with severe respiratory distress,
   death occurring 3-4 days after the appearance of the respiratory signs
   (caught and gasping breath). Microbiological analysis revealed absence
   of pathogenic bacteria whilst Real-time PCR identified the presence of
   RNA from Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) in several organs: lungs, small
   intestine (jejunum), mediastinal lymph nodes, liver and placenta. BCoV
   was therefore hypothesized to play a role in the lethal pulmonary
   infection. Like the other CoVs, BCoV is able to cause different
   syndromes. Its role in calf diarrhea and in mild respiratory disease is
   well known: we report instead the involvement of this virus in a severe
   and fatal respiratory disorder, with symptoms and disease evolution
   resembling those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS).}},

Abstract = {{A substructure synthesis method based on frequency response functions is
   improved to solve a security-issue-based analysis problem and is applied
   to an optimal design problem for a finished product consisting of two
   substructures. While geometry information is provided for one
   substructure, a limited number of frequency response functions are
   provided for the other substructure instead of its geometry information.
   The dynamic stiffness matrix of the latter is estimated from the
   provided frequency response functions using an experimental modal
   analysis technique. It is combined with the mass and stiffness matrices
   of the former to predict the vibration natural frequency of a finished
   product. The improved substructure synthesis method is used to predict
   the frequency response functions of a T-shaped beam consisting of a
   doubly clamped beam and a cantilever beam. Additionally, in a vehicle
   steering module, it is applied to a size optimization problem that is
   formulated to maximize its natural frequency. Numerical analysis and
   design results indicate the effectiveness of the improved substructure
   synthesis method for industrial applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional materials with atomic
   level thickness have rapidly grown to be a prosperous field of physical
   science with interdisciplinary interest for their fascinating properties
   and broad applications. Very recently, the experimental observation of
   ferromagnetism in a Cr2Ge2Te6 bilayer and a CrI3 monolayer opened a door
   to pursue long-absent intrinsic magnetic orders in two-dimensional
   materials. Meanwhile, the ferroelectricity was also experimentally found
   in a SnTe monolayer and CuInP2S6 few layers. The emergence of these
   ferroic orders in the two-dimensional limit not only brings new
   challenges to our physical knowledge but also provides more
   functionalities for potential applications. Among various
   two-dimensional ferroic ordered materials, transition/rare-earth metal
   halides and their derivants are very common. In this Research Update,
   based on transition/rare-earth metal halides, the physics of various
   ferroic orders in two-dimensional materials will be illustrated. The
   potential applications based on their magnetic and polar properties will
   also be discussed.}},

   the strongest predictors of C5 palsy after posterior surgeries and
   anterior cervical decompression-fusion, respectively. Among patients
   undergoing C4-C5 posterior laminoforaminotomy with instrumented fusion,
   cord shift on postoperative imaging was thought to be implicated in the

Title = {{Evaluation of sulfonate and sulfamate derivatives possessing benzofuran

   pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases and anticancer agents}},
Journal = {{BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ectonucleotidases are a broad family of ectoenzymes that play a crucial
   role in purinergic cell signaling. Ectonucleotide
   pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases (NPPs) belong to this group and are
   important drug targets. In particular, NPP1 and NPP3 are known to be
   druggable targets for treatment of impaired calcification disorders
   (including pathological aortic calcification) and cancer, respectively.
   In this study, we investigated a series of sulfonate and sulfamate
   derivatives of benzofuran and benzothiophene as potent and selective
   inhibitors of NPP1 and NPP3. Compounds 1c, 1g, 1n, and 1s are the most
   active NPP1 inhibitors (IC50 values in the range 0.12-0.95 mu M).
   Moreover, compounds 1e, 1f, 1j, and 1l are the most potent inhibitors of
   NPP3 (IC50 ranges from 0.12 to 0.95 mu M). Compound 1d, 1f and 1t are
   highly selective inhibitors of NPP1 over NPP3, whereas compounds 1m and
   1s are found to be highly selective towards NPP3 over NPP1.
   Structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been discussed in
   detailed. With the aid of molecular docking studies, a common binding
   mode of these compounds and suramin (the standard inhibitor) was
   revealed, where the sulfonate group acts as a cation-binding moiety that
   comes in close contact with the zinc ion of the active site. Moreover,
   cytotoxic evaluation against MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell lines revealed
   that compound 1r is the most cytotoxic towards MCF-7 cell line with IC50
   value of 0.19 mu M. Compound 1r is more potent and selective against
   cancer cells than normal cells (WI-38) as compared to doxorubicin.}},

   Converter}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The levellised cost of energy of wave energy converters (WECs) is not
   competitive with fossil fuel-powered stations yet. To improve the
   feasibility of wave energy, it is necessary to develop effective control
   strategies that maximise energy absorption in mild sea states, whilst
   limiting motions in high waves. Due to their model-based nature,
   state-of-the-art control schemes struggle to deal with model
   uncertainties, adapt to changes in the system dynamics with time, and
   provide real-time centralised control for large arrays of WECs. Here, an
   alternative solution is introduced to address these challenges, applying
   deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to the control of WECs for the first
   time. A DRL agent is initialised from data collected in multiple sea
   states under linear model predictive control in a linear simulation
   environment. The agent outperforms model predictive control for high
   wave heights and periods, but suffers close to the resonant period of
   the WEC. The computational cost at deployment time of DRL is also much
   lower by diverting the computational effort from deployment time to
   training. This provides confidence in the application of DRL to large
   arrays of WECs, enabling economies of scale. Additionally, model-free
   reinforcement learning can autonomously adapt to changes in the system
   dynamics, enabling fault-tolerant control.}},

Abstract = {{The present work aimed to obtain and characterize edible films produced
   with liquid whey and cassava starch. The films were produced with
   different proportions of whey (63.75-67.50\%) and cassava starch
   (7.50-11.25\%) and characterized in relation to physical, thermal, and
   microstructural properties. The films showed reduced solubility with
   increasing concentrations of cassava starch, and those with the highest
   proportions of whey were more stable to thermal decomposition. The
   increase in concentration of cassava starch altered the microstructure
   of the films, making them more irregular and with an accumulation of
   matter. The production of biodegradable polymer blend films is an
   important step in the development of films for use in packaging, with
   the formulation of 67.50/7.50\% whey/cassava starch being the best film
   for continued future work.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Finding the optimal structural design to avoid resonance has been a goal
   for decades. While recent applied methods often result in using
   additional active systems or higher mass, structural adaptation enables
   to shift eigenfrequencies without adding weight. The aim of this study
   is to investigate the influence of the structural adaptation of a beam
   and a plate on its eigenfrequency change, while varying the height of
   the structural pre-deformation according to its mode shapes. Besides the
   maximisation of single eigenfrequencies, also the simultaneous increase
   of multiple eigenfrequencies is analysed. It is possible to almost
   exclusively raise the frequency of the targeted i-th mode shape (i =
   1-5) of a beam, while the increase of the i-th plate mode shape
   frequency (i = 1-4) simultaneously alters other eigenfrequencies. Both
   the eigenfrequencies and specific mode shape frequencies are able to be
   significantly increased. In conclusion, the investigated, easy
   applicable method allows a strong eigenfrequency raise of axially
   constrained 1D and 2D structures by performing only small structural
   deformations without adding additional weight.}},

   stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease: A potential biomarker for
   optimal electrode placement}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic
   nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) is an effective
   treatment for cardinal motor symptoms and motor complications in
   Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, malpositioned DBS electrodes can
   result in suboptimal therapeutic response.
   Objective: We explored whether recovery of the H-reflex-an easily
   measured electrophysiological analogue of the stretch reflex, known to
   be altered in PD-could serve as an adjunct biomarker of suboptimal
   versus optimal electrode position during STN- or GPi-DBS implantation.
   Methods: Changes in soleus H-reflex recovery were investigated
   intraoperatively throughout awake DBS target refinement across 26 nuclei
   (14 STN). H-reflex recovery was evaluated during microelectrode
   recording (MER) and macrostimulation at multiple locations within and
   outside target nuclei, at varying stimulus intensities.
   Results: Following MER, H-reflex recovery normalized (i.e., became less
   Parkinsonian) in 21/26 nuclei, and correlated with on-table motor
   improvement consistent with an insertional effect. During
   macrostimulation, H-reflex recovery was maximally normalized in 23/26
   nuclei when current was applied at the location within the nucleus
   producing optimal motor benefit. At these optimal sites, H-reflex
   normalization was greatest at stimulation intensities generating maximum
   motor benefit free of stimulation-induced side effects, with
   subthreshold or suprathreshold intensities generating less dramatic
   normalization.
   Conclusion: H-reflex recovery is modulated by stimulation of the STN or
   GPi in patients with PD and varies depending on the location and
   intensity of stimulation within the target nucleus. H-reflex recovery
   shows potential as an easily-measured, objective, patient-specific,
   adjunct biomarker of suboptimal versus optimal electrode position during
   DBS surgery for PD. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been investigated as ideal biomaterials for wound
   treatment owing to their ability to form a highly moist environment
   which accelerates cell migration and tissue regeneration for prompt
   wound healing. They can also be used as a drug carrier for local
   delivery, and are able to activate immune cells to enhance wound
   healing. Here, we developed heparin-conjugated
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), an injectable, in situ gel-forming polymer,
   and evaluated its use in wound healing. Ibuprofen was encapsulated into
   the hydrogel to help reduce pain and excessive inflammation during
   healing. In addition to in vitro studies, a BALB/c mice model was used
   to evaluate its effect on would healing and the secretion of
   inflammatory mediators. The in vitro assay confirmed that the ibuprofen
   released from the hydrogel dramatically reduced
   lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by suppressing the production of
   NO, PGE2 and TNF-alpha in RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, an in vivo
   wound healing assay was conducted by applying hydrogels to wounds on the
   backs of mice. The results showed that the ibuprofen-loaded hydrogel
   improved healing relative to the phosphate buffered saline group. This
   study indicates that ibuprofen loaded in an injectable hydrogel is a
   promising candidate for wound healing therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with psychiatric illnesses are particularly
   vulnerable to highly contagious, droplet-spread organisms such as
   SARS-CoV-2. Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to
   consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and
   they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate
   infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential
   rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore,
   inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces,
   with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient
   psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion.
   Objective: With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process
   and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient
   psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and
   share key points for consideration in implementing future units

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication has attracted
   significant interest from the industry, especially with regard to the
   vision of providing ubiquitous connectivity for beyond 5G (B5G)
   networks. in this article, we motivate the need for utilizing licensed
   spectrum for UAV-assisted communication and discuss its advantages such
   as reliability and security. We explore a new dimension to spectrum
   sharing by proposing a decentralized competitive open market
   approach-based model, where the different mobile network operators
   (MNOs) have the opportunity to lease the spectrum to UAV base stations
   (UAV-BSs), leading to new revenue generation opportunities. The proposed
   spectrum sharing mechanism is based on the logarithmic utility function
   and willingness to pay of each UAV-BS. We provide a trade-off analysis
   between spectrum sharing and price offered by the MNOs, highlighting the
   impact of the willingness to pay on the spectrum sharing. The results
   also highlight the behavior of price and spectrum shared w.r.t. time,
   thereby providing an insight into different performance regions until
   the algorithm converges to its optimal value. in addition, we also
   present future directions that could lead to interesting analyses,
   especially with regard to incentive- based spectrum sharing and
   security.}},

Title = {{Incorporation of solar-thermal energy into a gasification process to
   co-produce bio-fertilizer and power}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{266}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is attracting
   increased interest because it can achieve high system energy efficiency
   (>50\%), which is predicted to increase with the increase in the solar
   share in biomass IGCC. This study evaluated the potential of crop
   residues numerically for the co-production of power and bio-fertilizer
   using ASPEN Plus (R) simulation software. The results showed that the
   gas yield increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure
   while the yield of bio-fertilizer is dependent on the biomass
   composition. The biomass with a low ash content produces high
   bio-fertilizer at the designated gasification temperature. The IGCC
   configuration conserves more energy than a directly-fired biomass power
   plant. In addition, the solar-assisted IGCC attains a higher net
   electricity output per unit of crop residue feed and achieves net
   thermal efficiencies of around 53\%. The use of such hybrid systems
   offer the potential to produce 0.55 MW of electricity per unit of
   solar-thermal energy at a relatively low cost. The ASPEN Plus model
   predicted that the solar biomass-based IGCC set up is more efficient in
   increasing the power generation capacity than any other conversion
   system. The results showed that a solar to electricity efficiency of
   approximately 55\% is achievable with potential improvements. This work
   will contribute for the sustainable bioenergy production as the
   relationship between energy production and biomass supplies very
   important to ensure the food security and environmental sustainability.

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) and its alloys have gained immense popularity as
   biomaterials in recent years. Their excellent specific strength makes
   them outstanding materials for orthopaedic applications. However, in the
   orthopaedic application, precise micro-drilling (i.e. implants inserts)
   is required, which is very challenging for these materials. To overcome
   this issue, the present research proposes an experimental study
   corroborated with a multi-objective optimization by simulating the
   drilling under electric discharge machining of Ti-6Al-4V. Taguchi's
   methodology-based L-9 orthogonal array was used for the experimental
   study. Voltage, current, pulse on and pulse off were used as the input
   parameters for the experimental investigation. In order to achieve
   suitable precise drilling, the material removal rate and surface finish
   were used as response parameters. Here, by optimizing parameters of the
   precise drilling, it is possible to obtain high material removal rate
   and better surface finish simultaneously. The Grey relational analysis
   was adopted to analyse the output quality characteristics. The optimized
   results generated through the Grey relational analysis are highly
   accurate with respect to the experimental outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium and thorium are toxic in different environments. The
   exploitation of uranium mines and associated mine drainage leaching
   towards streams, sediments, and soils cause relevant pollution. The
   U-mine areas present high concentrations of potentially toxic elements
   with several consequences to ecosystems and human health.
   Physicochemical and potentially toxic elements of mine dumps, stream
   sediments, and soils from the Canto Lagar uranium mine area (Central
   Portugal) were analyzed. Stream sediments, soils, and mine dumps show a
   large range in the concentration values of Fe, U, As, Cu, Zn, Pb, and
   Th, suggesting geological and mine contributions. Most of the selected
   potential toxic elements from sediments present a low to moderate
   contamination degree, except for As, W, and U, which vary between high
   and very high contamination index. The soils must not be used in
   agricultural or residential activities due to contamination in As and U.
   This abandoned mine represents an environmental risk due to the spatial
   mobility and dispersion of potentially toxic elements from the dumps to
   the sediments and soils, as well as by surface runoff and wind.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy independence shock
   on bond yield by allowing for heterogeneous coefficients in the model
   based on panel data for 19 developing countries using quarterly data
   from 1991 to 2016. First, we estimate the model using conventional panel
   VAR estimation with the assumption of homogeneous coefficients across
   countries. Second, by performing Chow and Roy-Zellner tests to check the
   homogeneity assumption, we find that the assumption does not hold in the
   model. Third, we apply a mean-group estimation for panel VAR as a
   solution for heterogeneity panel model. The results reveal that central
   bank independence is effective in reducing bond yield with the maximum
   at period 6 after the shock. Shock one standard deviation bond yield has
   a negative effect on consumption and investment. We determine that
   central bank independence has a contradictory effect on real activity; a
   negative effect on consumption but a positive influence on investment
   for the first two years after the shock. Additionally, we split our
   sample into three groups to make the subgroups pool. Our empirical
   result shows that monetary policy independence shock reduces bond yield.
   Meanwhile, the response of economic activity to bond yield varies for
   all three groups.}},

   paper illustrates an original approach, concerning the development of a
   risk assessment model for cultural assets, with reference to fire,
   earthquake and flood. The proposed model includes specific evaluation
   tools, that are based on parameters and indicators related to the
   factors of hazard and vulnerability for the three considered types of
   risk. The multi-dimensional set of indicators is used to get synthetics
   indices, through a multicriteria approach. Furthermore, this evaluation
   is supported by specific questionnaires to include in the assessment
   model the opinion of different experts and stakeholders to introduce the
   indicators weights.
   The results of this model are represented by specific evaluation tools
   which can be implemented in the risk assessment of cultural assets in

Abstract = {{Dichotomies are double-edged: they can simplify and enlighten as well as
   exaggerate and entangle. Seeing the eye as anterior segment vs.
   posterior segment simplifies the formidable task of dissecting the
   function of the eye. Yet this view creates artificial divisions in a
   coherent whole. Clearly, vision requires the convergence of the light
   refractive function of the front of the eye with the light sensing
   function of the back of the eye. The National Eye Institute has long
   aimed to foster research across the visual pathway. Finding the right
   balance is a constant work in progress. A recently held scientific
   meeting which we co-organized with the United States Army Medical
   Research Institute of Chemical Defense, offered an opportunity to take
   stock of what the anterior segment in general, and the ocular surface in
   particular, bring to our understanding of biology and disease of the
   eye. Multiple dichotomies surfaced: acute vs. chronic disease;
   epithelial vs. endothelial damage; fibrotic vs. vascular pathology;
   inflammation vs. resolution response; chemical exposure vs.
   countermeasure; monotherapy vs. combination therapy; mechanistic vs.
   exploratory research; human vs. animal model. Merging some of these
   dichotomies is the goal of this paper.}},

Title = {{Toxicological Characterization and Phospholipase D Activity of the Venom

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Envenomation by Loxosceles spiders (Sicariidae family) has been
   thoroughly documented. However, little is known about the potential
   toxicity of members from the Sicarius genus. Only the venom of the
   Brazilian Sicarius ornatus spider has been toxicologically
   characterized. In Chile, the Sicarius thomisoides species is widely
   distributed in desert and semidesert environments, and it is not
   considered a dangerous spider for humans. This study aimed to
   characterize the potential toxicity of the Chilean S. thomisoides
   spider. To do so, specimens of S. thomisoides were captured in the
   Atacama Desert, the venom was extracted, and the protein concentration
   was determined. Additionally, the venoms were analyzed by
   electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-recombinant L. laeta
   PLD1 serum. Phospholipase D enzymatic activity was assessed, and the
   hemolytic and cytotoxic effects were evaluated and compared with those
   of the L. laeta venom. The S. thomisoides venom was able to hydrolyze
   sphingomyelin as well as induce complement-dependent hemolysis and the
   loss of viability of skin fibroblasts with a dermonecrotic effect of the
   venom in rabbits. The venom of S. thomisoides showed intraspecific
   variations, with a similar protein pattern as that of L. laeta venom at
   32-35 kDa, recognized by serum anti-LlPLD1. In this context, we can
   conclude that the venom of Sicarius thomisoides is similar to Loxosceles
   laeta in many aspects, and the dermonecrotic toxin present in their
   venom could cause severe harm to humans; thus, precautions are necessary
   to avoid exposure to their bite.}},

Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were: (a) to describe the patterns of modes
   of commuting to school (children) and to work (parents) separated by
   gender and age, (b) to validate the questions on children's mode of
   commuting to and from school according to their parents, and (c) to
   analyse the reliability of a family questionnaire focused on commuting
   to school behaviours. A total of 611 parents (mean age: 43.28 +/- 6.25
   years old) from Granada (Spain) completed ``Family commuting-to-school
   behaviour{''} questionnaire in two sessions separated by 14 days, (2016
   and 2018). The validation between family and children's questions was
   assessed using the Kappa and Spearman correlation coefficients, and the
   test-retest reliability within the family questions was assessed using
   the Kappa and the weighted Kappa. The children's modes of commuting to
   school (mean age: 11.44 +/- 2.77 years old) were mainly passive (57.7\%
   to school) while parents' modes of commuting to work were mainly active
   (71.6\%). The validity of the mode of commuting was significant with
   high Kappa and Spearman coefficients. The test-retest reliability
   presented a good agreement for the mode of commuting to school in
   children, distance and time to school, and the mode of commuting to work
   in parents, while the questions on acceptable distance to walk or cycle
   to school showed a moderate to good agreement. The ``Family
   commuting-to-school behaviour{''} questionnaire could be a useful tool
   to assess the mode of commuting of children, distance and time to school
   for researchers and practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological or supraphysiological levels of testosterone appear to be
   associated with the development of risk factors for cardiovascular
   diseases such as hypertension, as this hormone modulates the release of
   endothelial factors. However, its actions are still controversial,
   especially in the coronary circulation of hypertensive animals. This
   study was designed to assess the effects of testosterone treatment (T)
   on endothelium-dependent coronary vascular reactivity in orchiectomized
   SHR. The animals were divided into SHAM, orchiectomized (ORX), ORX+T and
   ORX+T+aromatase inhibitor (Al). All treatments lasted 15 days. Blood
   pressure (BP) was measured. Dose-response curves to bradykinin (BK) were
   constructed using the La ngendorff technique, followed by inhibition of
   endothelium mediators (NO, prostanoids, EETs) and potassium channels.
   The intensity of eNOS, COX-1, COX-2, Akt, and gp91 phox protein
   expression was quantified by Western blotting. BP was elevated in SHAM,
   ORX+T, and ORX+T+Al groups. However, we did not observe differences in
   the ORX group. Baseline coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) remained
   unaffected. Orchiectomy did not change the BK-induced relaxation
   compared to the SHAM group, whereas testosterone treatment increased it.
   This response was diminished in the absence of NO, prostanoids, and EETs
   in the SHAM and ORX groups, while in ORX+T group the relaxation was
   diminished only in the absence of NO and EETs. There was no difference
   in eNOS, COX-1, COX-2, and gp91phox protein expression, though Akt
   expression was increased in ORX and ORX+T groups. These results show
   that testosterone treatment can modulate endothelial function,
   especially in the coronary circulation under hypertension conditions,
   via NO and EETs pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The world has been affected by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus
   (COVID-19). Health care workers are among those most at risk of
   contracting the virus. In the fight against the coronavirus, nurses play
   a critical role. Still, most social media platforms demonstrate that
   nurses fear that their health is not being prioritized. The purpose of
   this study is to investigate nurses' experiences through analyzing the
   main themes shared on Instagram by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   In contrast with highly structured research, the current paper
   highlights nurses' natural language use in describing their experiences
   during the first months of the outbreak in their workplace. Instagram
   captions were utilized as a data source. Leximancer was utilized for the
   content analysis of nurses' narratives towards their coronavirus
   experience. We sought to accomplish three research objectives: the first
   was to identify the main themes in the descriptions of nurses'
   experiences shared via their social media, specifically Instagram; then,
   to determine the relationships among concepts, and finally, to give
   useful implications based on the findings. The current study uses a
   qualitative (i.e., narratives) approach to analyze the main components
   of the nurses' experiences during the pandemic. The Leximancer software
   analysis revealed nine major textual themes and the relationships among
   these themes. In order of the relative importance, the themes were
   ``patients{''}, ``coronavirus{''}, ``exhaustion{''}, ``family{''},
   ``hospital{''}, ``personal protective equipment{''} (PPE), ``shift{''},
   ``fear{''}, and ``uncertainty{''}. The results offer practical
   implications based on the social media information regarding nurses'
   overall experiences.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are a specific type of nanomaterial whose
   applications are widespread into several fields including biomedicine as
   a smart drug targeter and environmental engineering due to their
   interactions with contaminants. Lately, the use of MNPs has also been
   demonstrated in structuring three-dimensional (3D) cultures of mammalian
   cells. However, MNPs application to other cell types is still limited.
   In this sense, some planktonic microorganisms when adhered to surfaces
   perform the swarming phenomenon to guarantee the expansion of the colony
   and to guarantee more niches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   produce MNPs coated with four carbohydrates (galactose - gal, glucose -
   glu, sucrose - suc, and maltose - mal) aiming microorganism culture
   applications and also for possible 3D arrays. The results showed that
   carbohydrate-coated MNPs showed hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 100
   to 200 nm and that their coatings influenced the chemical behavior in
   different ways. Indeed, when subjected to biological tests to determine
   their potential level of cytotoxicity, it was found that in
   concentrations of 1 mM, 800, 600, and 400 mu M (iron equivalent), there
   was not any alteration on growth of model microorganisms when visually
   evaluated. Besides, magnetization of bacteria was promoted in different
   ways as well as the modulation of swarming formation in Escherichia coil
   when exposed to MNP-Glu. In sum, MNPs coated with carbohydrates and even
   uncoated were atoxic to bacteria and one of them was able to modulate E.
   coil swarming formation showing the potential for applications in 3D
   cultures of bacteria.}},

Title = {{Perceptions versus reality: Assessing residential water conservation
   efforts in the household}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Given the scarcity of water resources, it is becoming of paramount
   importance that water utilities develop effective residential
   conservation programs. However, how residents conserve water, or
   perceive to do so, is not yet fully understood. This study explores
   whether public perceptions align with usage outcomes of water
   conservation at the residential scale. This study was enabled by a
   survey deployed in 2016 to residents from the Austin, Texas metropolitan
   area. The responses were then matched with the corresponding
   water-consumption records by the local utility. The analyses were both
   quantitative and qualitative. To assess whether residential conservation
   is present, the consumption records were grouped using seasons. Two
   values for a conservation metric were used-if a household used less than
   472 lpcpd (set by the local utility) or less than 340 lpcpd (a commonly
   cited average water consumption in the U.S.). The results show that when
   it comes to conservation, public perceptions do not align with usage
   outcomes sought by utilities; further, this misalignment is influenced
   by seasonality and the metric's value that is applied to assess
   residential conservation. Additionally, considerable heterogeneity was
   found in the statistically significant socio-demographic and geographic
   parameters that influenced perceptions and usage outcomes. By
   understanding the misalignment between perceptions and usage outcome
   expectations of utilities regarding conservation, utilities can
   implement tailored programs to improve the public understanding of
   conservation and correct for misconceptions that may decrease the
   effectiveness of conservation programs.}},

Abstract = {{The solid-state reaction between lanthanum oxide and different
   characteristics of silica has been investigated to define new process
   conditions that favor the formation of La2SiO5 and to characterize the
   La2O3: SiO2 reaction mechanisms. Silica with different crystalline
   structures (amorphous or quartz-type silica) and various average
   particle sizes of similar to 36, 12, 1, and 0.02 mu m were used. The 1:1
   M ratio mixtures between La2O3 and different types of SiO2 were ground
   and subsequently heated at 1200 and 1500 degrees C for 10 h. The
   morphology of the ground mixtures, their thermal properties, and the
   phases obtained after heating were determined in this study. The phases
   identified after each solid-state synthesis were quantified using
   Rietveld refinements. The results obtained indicate that an amorphous
   silica with a small particle size (< 1 mu m) is more advantageous in the
   La2SiO5 powder synthesis. An alternative synthesis method of using an
   amorphous colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.02 mu m is
   proposed, and the purity level achieved at 1500 degrees C after 10 h is
   higher than 90 vol\%. A reaction mechanism was suggested that highlights
   the strong effect of the size ratio (La2O3/SiO2: 1 mu m/0.02 mu m) to
   improve the reactivity and La2SiO5 phase formation.}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to develop the theory of concentration distribution
   of radiation over the receiver surface in cylindrical parabolic
   concentrator of radiation with axisymmetrical (cylindrical) radiation
   receiver has been studied. The results will make it possible to estimate
   concentration distribution over the radiation receiver surface and to
   associate output characteristics of concentrator unit for various
   combinations of design parameters at the stage of engineering, to choose
   the best combination of such parameters and to optimize reflecting
   surface and radiation receiver. Photovoltaic module with cooling or
   without it, solar collector, photovoltaic thermal module, etc. may be
   applied as radiation receivers. Mathematical physics equations have been
   deduced that describe the specifics of incident radiation flux
   reflection from the concentrator's surface and falling onto that of
   radiation receiver. Concentration distribution has been estimated, for
   various concentrator design parameters and various positions of receiver
   axis in relation to the focus of reflecting surface, on the symmetry
   plane. The most effective concentrator designs characterized by 100\%
   optical efficiency correspond to options where the focus of
   concentrator's reflecting surface is located inside radiation receiver.
   Analysis of design options using the developed theory is shown on
   examples for given values of average concentration ratio (2, 6, 8, 10,
   15, 20, 50), as well as radius of radiation receiver, half concentrator
   aperture and distance between the focus line and the symmetry axis of
   radiation receiver in cross-section. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{We explore whether housing displacement pressure could help explain
   place-based disparities in Massachusetts COVID-19 prevalence. We use
   qualitative data from the Healthy Neighborhoods Study to illustrate how
   rising and unaffordable housing costs are experienced by residents in
   municipalities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. We then predict
   municipal-level COVID-19 case rates as a function of home value
   increases and housing cost burden prevalence among low-income
   households, controlling for previously identified community-level risk
   factors. We find that housing value increase predicts higher COVID-19
   case rates, but that associations are ameliorated in areas with higher
   home values. Qualitative data highlight crowding, ``doubling up,{''}
   homelessness, and employment responses as mechanisms that might link
   housing displacement pressure to COVID-19 prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate correlation between
   centers' volume and incidence of failure to rescue (FTR) following liver
   resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Summary Background Data: FTR, defined as the probability of
   postoperative death among patients with major complication, has been
   proposed to assess quality of care during hospitalization. Perioperative
   management is challenging in cirrhotic patients and the ability to
   recognize and treat a complication may be fundamental to rescue patients
   from the risk of death.
   Methods: Patients undergoing liver resection for HCC between 2008 and
   2018 in 18 Centers enrolled in the He.Rc.O.Le.S. Italian register. Early
   results included major complications (Clavien >= 3), 90-day mortality,
   and FTR and were analyzed according to center's volume.
   Results: Among 1935 included patients, major complication rate was 9.4\%
   (8.6\%, 12.3\%, and 7.0\% for low-, intermediate- and high-volume
   centers, respectively, P = 0.001). Ninety-day mortality rate was 2.6\%
   (3.7\%, 4.2\% and 0.9\% for low-, intermediate- and high-volume centers,
   respectively, P < 0.001). FTR was significantly higher at low- and
   intermediate-volume centers (28.6\% and 26.5\%, respectively) than at
   high-volume centers (6.1\%, P = 0.002). Independent predictors for major
   complications were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) >2,
   portal hypertension, intraoperative blood transfusions, and center's
   volume. Independent predictors for 90-day mortality were ASA >2,
   Child-Pugh score B, BCLC stage B-C, and center's volume. Center's volume
   and BCLC stage were strongly associated with FTR.
   Conclusions: Risk of major complications and mortality was related with
   comorbidities, cirrhosis severity, and complexity of surgery. These
   factors were not correlated with FTR. Center's volume was the only
   independent predictor related with severe complications, mortality, and
   FTR.}},

Title = {{The study of atomic porosity effect on water/Fe nanofluid flow in a
   microchannel with a molecular dynamics method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{317}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the molecular dynamics method is used to study the atomic
   behavior of water and water/Fe nanofluid within a microchannel. In our
   simulations, the microchannel walls have atomic porosity with various
   values. The results show that the values of density, velocity, and
   temperature vary by inserting atomic porosity into the microchannel.
   Numerically, by increasing the porosity value from 1\% to 5\%, the
   maximum densities of water and water/Fe nanofluid decrease to 0.03
   atom/angstrom(3) and 0.032 atom/angstrom(3). Further, the maximum values
   of water and water/Fe nanofluid velocities converged to 0.038 and 0.053
   angstrom/fs. The temperatures of water and water/Fe nanofluid are other
   parameters which reach to 535 K and 803 K by inserting the porosity into
   the microchannel walls. Physically, we conclude that the porosity value
   has an important effect on the fluid/nanofluid atomic and thermal
   behavior such as phase transition phenomena. Numerically, by inserting
   the atomic porosity into microchannel walls, the phase transition time
   in water/Fe nanofluid structure varies from 402,000-time steps to
   282,000-time steps (Delta t = 1 fs). So, the atomic porosity improves
   the thermal behavior of nanofluid. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Supreme Court's recent decision in Azar v Allina Health Services,
   Inc opened and then declined to resolve a new question of administrative
   law. In that case, the Court affirmed the DC Circuit's holding that the
   Medicare Act, unlike the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), did not
   exempt so-called ``interpretive rules{''} from notice and comment.
   Crucially, however, the Supreme Court declined to give any further
   guidance as to what rules the Medicare Act's notice-and-comment
   provision does cover. This lack of guidance added further confusion to
   an alreadymurky area of law: the DC Circuit's current interpretation of
   the Medicare statute, which is the only one presently left standing, has
   no fixed limits and is tethered only to a dictionary definition. This
   Comment argues that courts should clarify the reach of the Medicare
   Act's notice-and-comment provision by looking to existing case law
   interpreting the APA's exemption to notice and comment for procedural
   rules. This reading would provide the administrators of the Medicare
   system with much-needed guidance as to which rules they must subject to
   notice and comment. With the effective administration of over sixty
   million Americans' health insurance on the line, clarifying the
   statute's notice-and-comment requirement is a necessary ``procedure.{''}}},

   (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis (EDAX) and TEM techniques. XRD analysis confirms that ZnO
   nanoparticles were crystalline having hexagonal Wurtzite structure with
   (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0) and (1 1 2) planes. SEM
   analyses show that the as synthesized ZnO NPs were in the form of
   agglomerates and no other impurity peak was found in the EDS. TEM
   analyses confirm that the size of the nanoparticle was approx. 50 nm.

Title = {{When the owner of information is unsure: Epistemic uncertainty
   influences evidentiality processing in Turkish}},
Journal = {{LINGUA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{247}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study deals with the extent to which epistemic uncertainty
   influences processing of grammatical evidentiality - the linguistic
   reference to information source - in Turkish native speakers. Across a
   series of sentence reading experiments administered to groups of Turkish
   adult native speakers, this study showed that indirect evidentiality in
   firsthand witnessing contexts evoked greater postinterpretive
   disruptions (Experiment 1), and were found largely unfavourable
   (Experiment 2), suggesting that in Turkish, speaking about one's own
   information with indirect evidentiality leads to an inherent effect.
   Furthermore, a first-person's witnessed information marked with direct
   evidentiality is found to be rather unacceptable or unsettling under low
   epistemic certainty conditions, where the speaker is unsure of his/her
   own witnessing (Experiment 3), whilst a non-first-person's information
   blends well with uncertainty constraints for which, Turkish readers
   strongly favour the assumption marker (Experiment 4). This study
   indicates that Turkish speakers' sensitivity to uses of evidentiality is
   influenced by the `uncertainty of information owner'. There is a
   semantic overlap and a complex interface between evidentiality and
   epistemic modality in Turkish, and this interface is mediated by the
   ownership of information (first-person versus nonfirst-person) and the
   owner's uncertainty about his/her information. Further implications are
   discussed. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   account new geochronological data, the volcanic series are correlated
   with subvolcanic and intrusive rocks of the Murmansk and Kola-Norwegian
   terranes. The comparative analysis of sections of volcanic rocks of the
   Imandra-Varzuga and Pechenga structures indicate asynchronous evolution
   of these fragments of the belt in a range of 2.51-2.40 Ga and a
   significant time gap (probably, >300 m.y.) in evolution of both the
   Imandra-Varzuga and Pechenga structures. The geochemical evidence is
   provided for the cyclic plume-lithospheric interaction during magmatism
   of the Sumian-Sariolian period, which shows that basic melts mostly
   generated from facies of spinel lherzolites exhibit features of
   significant crustal contamination as a result of their interaction with

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the cooling performance of nanofluid (NF) mixed
   convection in a porous I-shaped electronic chip with an internal
   triangular hot block using Buongiorno's two-phase model. This type of
   cavity and hot block geometry has not been studied formerly. The NF was
   assumed to be a mixture of water and CuO nanoparticles (NP) up to 4\% of
   volume concentration. As most published mathematical models for the
   thermal conductivity of NF give inaccurate predictions, a new predictive
   correlation for effective thermal conductivity was also developed with a
   high accuracy compared to the experimental data. The results showed that
   any increase in the NP volume concentration enhances the average Nusselt
   number (Nu over bar ) and the normalized entropy generation, and reduces
   the thermal performance of the cavity in all orientations of the hot
   block. The maximum enhancement in cooling performance was 17.75\% and
   occurred in the right-oriented hot block in the sand-based porous
   cavity. Furthermore, adding the NP to the base fluid leads to a more
   capable cooling system and enhances the irreversibility of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Packaging sector generates 40\% of the plastics consumption in Europe.
   Among the most consumed plastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is
   still the material that undoubtedly continues to grow in the packaging
   sector. Hence, there is a concern related to the recycling process,
   which today is only around 56\%. Therefore, the objective of this work
   focuses on the use of this recycled material as a source of raw material
   for pultrusion processes. This work studies and compares the
   processability of final composite pultruded parts by using three
   different pre-impregnated recycled materials different in their
   viscosity and stream. Those composites were characterized by mechanical
   testing and microscopy analysis. The obtained results were compared with
   those of another pultruded thermoplastic (polypropylene) composite. From
   this study, it was possible to transform a waste into a product with
   high added value, reducing the carbon footprint.}},

Title = {{The Kingdom of Spain's Key Ministries of on Combating Racism, Xenophobia
   and Other Types of Discrimination: Activities and Structures}},
Journal = {{TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{460}},
Pages = {{97-106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The article focuses on the study the structural and functional
   characteristics of three departments: the Ministry of Labor, Migration
   and Social Security; the Ministry of Internal Affairs; and the Ministry
   of the Presidency for Relations with Courts and Equality Issues, because
   these ministries directly control and regulate activities in the field
   of combating discrimination and intolerance. The aim of the article is
   to study the structure and various aspects of cooperation between these
   ministries, with particular attention to the implementation of special
   programs to combat various types of discrimination. The article was
   prepared using original sources, such as official electronic resources
   of the key ministries and institutions, regulatory documents, draft
   programs on combating discrimination and intolerance, agreements between
   Spain and international organizations. The plans and reports of the
   police, which reflect the main measures taken to combat racism and
   xenophobia, were analyzed. The study is based on an institutional
   approach, which allows carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the
   activities of Spanish public institutions and organizations in the field
   of combating discrimination and intolerance at the state, autonomous and
   city levels. The study employed the general scientific methods of
   analysis to highlight the key areas of activity of the ministries and to
   study them comprehensively, comparison to identify the general and
   specific functions of each of the organs, and generalization to identify
   the most common directions of anti-discrimination policy in Spain. In
   the course of the study, the authors develop the thesis that
   discrimination is a multidimensional phenomenon, the consequences of
   which affect not only individuals or groups, suffering from
   discrimination, but also, indirectly, society and the sociopolitical
   climate in general. Anti-discrimination measures are obligatory for the
   implementation of a comprehensive public policy, but, despite the
   presence of common functionality, the key ministries involved in this
   area have their own specifics. As a result of the study, the authors
   come to the conclusion that Spain has an extensive network of
   institutions and organizations dealing with the prevention and fight
   against various types of intolerance and discrimination. This network
   operates based not only on the local legislative basis, but also on
   international treaties and agreements with international organizations.
   The well-developed institutional structure and the introduction of new
   specialized organizations increase the effectiveness of government's
   measures. The large number of projects to combat racism and xenophobia,
   which annually receive funding from the state and the EU, indicate that
   this area is receiving very close attention.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Complete analytical solution for the normally incident water wave
   scattering by a porous flexible vertical elastic plate or tensioned
   membrane is found. The physical problem in a half-plane is reduced to a
   couple of equivalent quarter-plane problems by allowing incident waves
   from either direction of the structure. In the same way, quarter-plane
   boundary value problems are posed for solid wave potentials that are
   solutions of the scattering problem involving a rigid structure of the
   same geometric configuration. Then, two novel integral relations are
   introduced to establish a link between the required solution wave
   potentials and few resolvable solid wave potentials. Explicit
   expressions for the scattering quantities such as the reflection and the
   transmission coefficients are obtained. Also, the deflection of the
   flexible vertical structure and the solution potentials are determined
   analytically. Numerical results for the explicitly derived scattering
   quantities and structure deflections are presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: Dealing with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia symptoms is
   a major challenge for teachers and school psychologists while addressing
   students' issues. The present study was designed to examine the
   prevalence and comorbidity of specific learning disabilities (SLD)
   symptoms such as dyslexia, dysgraphia and dyscalculia in public and
   private schools of Lahore, Pakistan.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in four schools of
   Lahore from June, 2019 to December 2019. We examined 666 participants
   (boys= 384, girls= 282) from two public (n=409) and two private (n=257)
   schools of Lahore with a mean age of 13 years (SD +/- 1.44).
   Participants were assessed on Learning Disabilities Checklist (LDC)
   along with a demographic sheet. The data were analyzed by using
   descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) and inferential
   analyses of Chi Square test of association and Cohen's Kappa by using
   SPSS version 24.
   Results: Findings indicated that 39\% participants showed SLD symptoms,
   33\% dyslexia, 48\% dysgraphia and 45\% dyscalculia symptoms.
   Significant co-morbidities were seen, such as 30\% for dyslexia and
   dysgraphia symptoms, dyslexia and dyscalculia 26\% and dysgraphia and
   dyscalculia as 36\%. Variations in SLD, dyslexia, dysgraphia and
   dyscalculia symptoms were also seen across gender and schools with
   significant higher prevalence in public schools.
   Conclusion: High prevalence of SLD symptoms and comorbidity in students
   was found which is alarming, particularly in public sector schools in
   Pakistan. SLD and dyslexia were higher for boys, whereas girls scored
   high on dysgraphia and dyscalculia. Therefore, there is great need of
   introducing screening measure of assessment of SLD and management
   strategies to deal with these issues.}},

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the unsteady and incompressible viscous

   dimensional analysis, governing equations of motion converted into
   non-dimensional form and then extended with novel fractional operator of
   singular kernel and series solutions are obtained by Laplace transform
   method. As a result, we compared present result with all the existing
   fractional operators and found that momentum boundary layer thickness
   can be control by changing the value of fractional parameter. Moreover,
   it is also observed that constant proportional Caputo type operator is
   well suited in exhibiting the decay of velocity of the fluid than all
   the existing fractional operators with power law (C), exponential law
   (CF) and Mittage-Leffler law (ABC).}},

Abstract = {{The classification of pollen species and types is an important task in
   many areas like forensic palynology, archaeological palynology, and
   melissopalynology. This paper presents a new public annotated image
   dataset for the Brazilian Savanna called POLLEN73S composed of 2523
   images from 73 pollen types. Using the state-of-the-art Convolutional
   Neural Networks (CNNs), we provide a baseline for pollen grain
   classification. Our experiments showed evidence that DenseNet-201 and
   ResNet-50 have superior performance against the other CNNs tested,
   achieving precision results of 95.7\% and 94.0\%, respectively. Due to
   its category coverage and satisfactory diversity of examples, POLLEN73S
   offers a diversity of pollen grain to guide progress in computer vision
   to solve Palynology problems.}},

Abstract = {{Limiting flux (J(L)) determination is a critical issue for membrane
   processing. This work presents a modified exponential model for J(L)
   calculation, based on a previously published version. Our research
   focused on skim milk microfiltrations. The processing variables studied
   were the crossflow velocity (CFV), membrane hydraulic diameter (d(h)),
   temperature, and concentration factor, totaling 62 experimental runs.
   Results showed that, by adding a new parameter called minimum
   transmembrane pressure, the modified model not only improved the fit of
   the experimental data compared to the former version (R-2 > 97.00\%),
   but also revealed the existence of a minimum transmembrane pressure
   required to obtain flux (J). This result is observed as a small shift to
   the right on J versus transmembrane pressure curves, and this shift
   increases with the flow velocity. This fact was reported in other
   investigations, but so far has gone uninvestigated. The J(L) predicted
   values were correlated with the Reynolds number (Re) for each d(h)
   tested. Results showed that for a same Re; J(L) increased as d(h)
   decreased; in a wide range of Re within the turbulent regime. Finally,
   from dimensionless correlations; a unique expression J(L) = f (Re, d(h))
   was obtained; predicting satisfactorily J(L) (R-2 = 84.11\%) for the
   whole set of experiments}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine the impact of industrial
   processes on the digestion of six milk protein matrices using the
   harmonized INFOGEST in vitro static digestion protocol. First, this
   method was optimized to simple protein matrices using sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC) to compare the intestinal protein hydrolysis
   obtained with increasing quantities of pancreatin. Similar results were
   achieved with the originally required pancreatin amount (trypsin
   activity of 100 U.mL(-1)) and with a quantity of pancreatin equivalent
   to a trypsin activity of 27.3 U.mL(-1), which was thus used to perform
   the in vitro digestion of the milk matrices. Molecular weight profiles,
   peptide heterogeneity from LC-MS/MS data, calcium, free amino acid, and
   peptide concentrations were determined in the gastric and intestinal
   phases to compare the milk protein digests. Results showed that the
   industrial process affected not only the protein distribution of the
   matrices but also most likely the protein structures. Indeed,
   differences arose in terms of peptide populations generated when the
   caseins were reticulated or when their calcium concentrations were
   reduced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a rigorous analysis of a promising bi-modal
   multirotor vehicle that can roll and fly. This class of vehicle provides
   energetic and locomotive advantages over traditional unimodal vehicles.
   Despite superficial similarities to traditional multirotor vehicles, the
   dynamics of the vehicle analyzed herein differ substantially. This paper
   is the first to offer a complete and rigorous derivation, simulation,
   and validation of the vehicle's terrestrial rolling dynamics.
   Variational mechanics is used to develop a six degrees-of-freedom
   dynamic model of the vehicle subject to kinematic rolling constraints
   and various nonconservative forces. The resulting dynamic system is
   determined to be differentially flat and the flat outputs of the vehicle
   are derived. A functional hardware embodiment of the vehicle is
   constructed, from which empirical motion data are obtained via odometry
   and inertial sensing. A numerical simulation of the dynamic model is
   executed, which accurately predicts complex dynamic phenomena observed
   in the empirical data, such as gravitational and gyroscopic
   nonlinearities; the comparison of simulation results to empirical data
   validates the dynamic model.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing spread of antimicrobial resistance, there is growing
   attention to the contribution made by drinking water systems. The
   potential health impact of two drinking water treatment and distribution
   systems (A and B) in the North-West Province of South Africa was
   determined by investigating the water quality and occurrence of
   antimicrobial-resistant heterotrophic bacteria and genes in the raw and
   treated water over four seasons. Most of the physicochemical parameters
   except for electrical conductivity were within permissible limits.
   Coliform bacteria reduced from raw to potable water except for counts
   higher than the threshold recorded in Summer and Winter. A total of 203
   heterotrophic bacterial isolates were recovered on chromogenic R2A
   medium and subjected to susceptibility testing to twelve antibiotics.
   Most of the isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and
   Trimethoprim, whereas they were susceptible to Ciprofloxacin,
   Erythromycin, and Neomycin. The proportions of Cephalothin and
   Kanamycin-resistant isolates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) after
   treatment for site A, compared to significantly lower beta-lactam,
   Oxytetracycline, and Trimethoprim-resistant isolates for B. Over 50\% of
   isolates were of high risk, indicating their origin from high
   antibiotic-use sources. Seventy-one (35\%) isolates were
   multidrug-resistant, out of which the majority (53.5\%, n = 38)
   possessed the strA gene, followed by strB 21 (29.6\%), dfrB 13 (18.3\%),
   aadA 11 (15.5\%), bla(CTX-M) 5 (7.0\%), and tetA 3 (4.2\%). The 16S rRNA
   gene sequences of the isolates revealed strains belonging to eight
   bacterial families, some of which are clinically important.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims (1) to determine the seasonal and spatial distribution
   of THMs formed in chlorinated groundwater containing low levels of
   organic matter (0.4-0.8 mg L-1) and low to high levels of bromine
   (40-380 mu g L-1), and (2) to evaluate the multi-route cancer risks
   associated with them. The study was conducted in Kayseri (Turkey), where
   drinking water is supplied from groundwater after chlorination only. THM
   formation in 50 water samples from 18 storage tanks and 32 distribution
   points was investigated to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in
   THM concentrations for 12 months. The lifetime cancer risk associated
   with exposure to THMs through multiple pathways (i.e., oral ingestion,
   dermal absorption, and inhalation) was estimated for males and females.
   For a 12 month sampling period, the minimum and maximum THM
   concentrations varied from 2 mu g L-1 to 17 mu g L-1 and from 2 mu g L-1
   to 29 mu g L-1 in storage tanks and distribution points, respectively.
   The ranges of median concentrations of THM were 5 mu g L-1 to 9 mu g L-1
   in storage tanks and 5 mu g L-1 to 12 mu g L-1 in distribution points.
   In all samples dibromochloromethane was the dominant species, followed
   by bromoform, chloroform, and bromodichloromethane. The average values
   of total cancer risk associated with exposure to THMs via oral
   ingestion, dermal absorption, and inhalation for females and males were
   1.31 x 10(-5) and 1.25 x 10(-5) in storage tanks, and 1.46 x 10(-5) and
   1.39 x 10(-5) in distribution points, respectively. Although THM
   concentrations were very low, cancer risk values are 1.0 x 10(-6) < CR <
   1.0 x 10(-4), which are higher than the negligible risk level (1.0 x
   10(-6)).}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several studies emphasize the deleterious effects of
   Campylobacter jejuni on the chicken intestine. In this context, it was
   shown that C. jejuni, contrary to the general belief, has a negative
   influence on the gut barrier in chickens. More precisely, we
   demonstrated that C. jejuni affects gut physiology characterized by
   changes in ion transport and transepithelial ion conductance, but the
   underlying mechanism is yet to be investigated. In the actual study, to
   determine epithelial paracellular permeability, the mucosal to serosal
   flux of C-14-mannitol in the small and large intestine was measured
   applying Ussing chamber. A total of seventy-five 1-day-old Ross 308
   broiler chickens were housed in floor pens on wood shavings with feed
   and water provided ad libitum. Birds were randomly allocated to 3
   different groups (n = 25 with 5 replicates/group) and infected at 14 d
   of age with a high (10(8) colony forming units {[}CFU]) or a low (10(4)
   CFU) dose of C. jejuni and a third group kept as noninfected control.
   Infection with the low dose of C. jejuni resulted in delayed cecal
   colonization but equalized at 21 d postinfection, independent of the
   dose. Invasion of liver and spleen with C. jejuni was only noticed in
   birds infected with 10(8) (CFU). Body weight (BW) and body weight gain
   of all birds infected with C. jejuni were lower than in the control
   group and varied with the dose of infection, confirming a negative
   correlation between the infection dose and birds BW. Mannitol flux in
   jejunum and cecum was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in all C. jejuni
   infected birds compared with control birds. Likewise, significant
   differences in mannitol flux of both jejunum and cecum were detected
   depending on the infection dose of C. jejuni. The correlation analyses
   revealed a positive relationship between Campylobacter dose and mannitol
   flux of both jejunum and cecum. Altogether, the actual results emphasize
   that the adverse effect of C. jejuni on gut permeability arises in a
   dose-dependent manner.}},

Abstract = {{Nepetalactol, an iridoid with four chiral carbons, is a crucial
   component of aphid sex pheromones that have been employed with great
   success to control the insect-related diseases. Despite of agricultural
   usage as end products, iridoids are fundamental biosynthetic
   intermediates for pharmaceutically important monoterpenoid indole
   alkaloids such as camptothecin (CAM) and vinca alkaloids. Herein we
   characterized 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase (10HGO) and iridoid
   synthase (IS) from Camptotheca acuminata, a CAM-producing plant, and
   reported their application in biological preparation of nepetalactol.
   Ca10HGO and CaIS were respectively cloned from C. acuminata,
   overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. Ca10HGO
   catalyzes the oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol into 10-oxogeranial, in
   which NADP(+) was reduced to NADPH. CaIS catalyzes nepetalactol
   formation from 10-oxogeranial using NADPH cofactor. The net outcome of
   the two reactions generate nepetalactol from 10-hydroxygeraniol
   efficiently, indicating NADP(+) NADPH recycling. Ca10HGO and CaIS were
   co-overexpressed in E. coli under optimized fermentation conditions to
   prepare cell-based catalysts that catalyze the conversion of
   10-hydroxygeraniol into nepetalactol. The present work shows the
   enzymatic conversion of 10-hydroxygeraniol into nepetalactol involved in
   CAM biosynthesis. Co-overexpression of Ca10HGO and CaIS in E. coli is an
   alternative valuable cell-based biotransformation process with
   regenerating recycling of NADP(+) NADPH cofactors for nepetalactol
   preparation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Compare outcomes of operative and nonoperatively managed
   medial epicondyle fractures in upper-extremity athletes. Design:
   Retrospective chart review and phone survey. Setting: Level 1,
   tertiary-referral pediatric hospital. Patients: Propensity scores
   (probability of operative treatment) were estimated from a logistic
   regression model that included sex, age, displacement, limb dominance,
   and injury severity (presence of an additional fracture, nerve injury,
   or elbow dislocation). These were used to match subjects in the
   operative group to the nonoperative group. Main Outcome Measures: Return
   to sport, duration of time required to return to sport, pain, range of
   motion (ROM), need for physical therapy, and complications were recorded
   for both groups. Results: Twenty-eight nonoperative subjects were
   matched to 14 operative subjects. There was no significant difference in
   the proportion of subjects who returned to the same sport (92.9\% in
   each group), performance at preinjury level of competition, or median
   time to return to play (P = 0.7106). There was no significant difference
   in functional limitations in social-/work-related activities (P >
   0.9999), pain in the past 30 days (P = 0.0640), need for physical
   therapy (P = 0.5680), ROM limitations (P = 0.0988), difficulty in
   sleeping (P = 0.4773), or complications (P = 0.4081). Conclusions: Our
   study found no statistical difference in outcomes or complications
   between operative and nonoperatively treated moderately displaced medial
   epicondyle fractures in adolescent upper-extremity athletes. Our data
   show that similar outcomes may be achieved with both treatment groups
   for medial epicondyle fractures in upper-extremity athletes.}},

Title = {{Concept design evaluation by using Z-axiomatic design}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Capturing the uncertainty associated with a decision maker (DM)'s
   judgments and preferences is one of the most challenging parts of
   concept design evaluation as it depends on subjective linguistic terms.
   To address this drawback, we propose a novel approach for concept design
   evaluation that incorporates Z-number and axiomatic design (AD)
   concepts. Although pertinent literature advocates for the capture of
   uncertain information originating from DMs, the relevant need for
   information reliability has not been addressed. By incorporating
   Z-numbers, the confidence level of a decision or its reliability is
   taken into consideration, thus a more comprehensive perception of the DM
   is recorded. Then, these judgments and preferences are incorporated to
   AD to select the best design concept. Using data from the published
   literature, a case study is conducted to assess the impact of
   information reliability and the DM's risk attitude with regards to
   available design options. The proposed approach is also compared with
   previously developed methods in order to show its benefits. The results
   demonstrate that the reliability of the information has a significant
   impact on final results; and assessment of confidence, or reliability of
   information, enhances the success for better decision-making. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{Functional dyspepsia is a common gastric disease that can be associated
   with Helicobacter pylori infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate
   antral endoscopy of individuals who presented with functional dyspepsia,
   H. pylori infection status and the effects of eradication therapy on the
   symptoms. Following the diagnosis of dyspepsia as per Rome III criteria,
   260 individuals who were eligible for the study underwent upper
   gastrointestinal endoscopy and were divided into four groups of 65
   according to the endoscopic view, grades I, II, III and IV (negative).
   Stool antigen test was also performed for all patients to identify H.
   pylori infection. The early signs of dyspepsia were assessed by a
   standard questionnaire. In all groups, omeprazole, amoxicillin,
   clarithromycin and metronidazole were used for eradication treatment,
   and 1 month after the treatment, a faecal antigen test was repeated to
   evaluate the eradication of H. pylori. There was no statistically
   significant difference between the groups in terms of clinical symptoms
   before treatment. The highest response to eradication treatment was seen
   in individuals with antral gastropathy grade III (66.2\%) and the lowest
   response was in patients without antral gastropathy Grade IV (32.3\%).
   This difference was statistically significant. There was no
   statistically significant relationship between the participants in terms
   of family history, age, gender and response to treatment. Eradicating H.
   pylori reduces the symptoms of dyspepsia. The response of eradication
   therapy was greatest among the patients with grade III antral
   gastropathy. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Brain-wide mapping of c-fos expression in the single prolonged stress
   model and the e ff ects of pretreatment with ACH-000029 or prazosin}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that
   is triggered by a stressful event, with symptoms including exaggerated
   startle response, intrusive traumatic memories and nightmares. The
   single prolonged stress (SPS) is a multimodal stress protocol that
   comprises a sequential exposure to physical restraint, forced swimming,
   predator scent and ether anesthesia. This procedure generates behavioral
   and neurobiological alterations that resemble clinical findings of PTSD,
   and thus it is commonly used to model the disease in rodents. Here, we
   applied c-fos mapping to produce a comprehensive view of
   stress-activated brain regions in mice exposed to SPS alone or to SPS
   after oral pretreatment with the serotonin-noradrenaline receptor dual
   modulator ACH-000029 or the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker prazosin. The SPS
   protocol evoked c-fos expression in several brain regions that control
   the stress-anxiety response, including the central and medial amygdala,
   the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pallidum, the
   paraventricular hypothalamus, the intermediodorsal, paraventricular and
   central medial thalamic nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, the lateral
   habenula and the cuneiform nucleus. These effects were partially blocked
   by pretreatment with prazosin but completely prevented by ACH-000029.
   Collectively, these findings contribute to the brain-wide
   characterization of neural circuits involved in PTSDrelated stress
   responses. Furthermore, the identification of brain areas regulated by
   ACH-000029 and prazosin revealed regions in which SPS-induced activation
   may depend on the combined or isolated action of the noradrenergic and
   serotonergic systems. Finally, the dual regulation of serotonin and
   alpha 1 receptors by ACH-000029 might represent a potential
   pharmacotherapy that can be applied in the peri-trauma or early
   post-trauma period to mitigate the development of symptoms in PTSD
   patients.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Link prediction is one of the most important and challenging tasks in
   complex network analysis, which aims to predict missing link based on
   existing ones in a network. This problem is of both theoretical interest
   and has applications in diverse scientific disciplines, including social
   network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological networks. In
   this paper we propose a novel link prediction method that aims at
   improving the accuracy of existing path-based methods by incorporating
   information about the nodes along local paths. We investigate the
   proposed framework empirically and conduct extensive experiments on
   real-world datasets obtained from diverse domains. Results show that the
   proposed method has achieved increased prediction accuracy when compared
   to existing state-of-the-art link prediction methods. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Characterization and function of a sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)
   Class II acyl-CoA-binding protein}},
Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{300}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBP) bind to long-chain acyl-CoA esters and
   phospholipids, enhancing the activity of different acyltransferases in
   animals and plants. Nevertheless, the role of these proteins in the
   synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) remains unclear. Here, we cloned a
   cDNA encoding HaACBP1, a Class II ACBP from sunflower (Helianthus
   annuus), one of the world's most important oilseed crop plants.
   Transcriptome analysis of this gene revealed strong expression in
   developing seeds from 16 to 30 days after flowering. The recombinant
   protein (rHaACBP1) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to be
   studied by in vitro isothermal titration calorimetry and for
   phospholipid binding. Its high affinity for saturated palmitoyl-CoA
   (16:0-CoA; K-D 0.11 mu M) and stearoyl-CoA (18:0-CoA; K-D 0.13 mu M)
   esters suggests that rHaACBP1 could act in acyl-CoA transfer pathways
   that involve saturated acyl derivatives. Furthermore, rHaACBP1 also
   binds to both oleoyl-CoA (18:1-CoA; K-D 6.4 mu M) and linoleoyl-CoA
   (18:2-CoA; K-D 21.4 mu M) esters, the main acyl-CoA substrates used to
   synthesise the TAGs that accumulate in sunflower seeds. Interestingly,
   rHaACBP1 also appears to bind to different species of
   phosphatidylcholines (dioleoyl-PC and dilinoleoyl-PC), glycerolipids
   that are also involved in TAG synthesis, and while it interacts with
   dioleoyl-PA, this is less prominent than its binding to the PC
   derivative. Expression of rHaACBP in yeast alters its fatty acid
   composition, as well as the composition and size of the host acyl-CoA
   pool. These results suggest that HaACBP1 may potentially fulfil a role
   in the transport and trafficking of acyl-CoAs during sunflower seed
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Population ageing is a global phenomenon, and life expectancy in Brazil
   is growing fast. Epilepsy is the third most important chronic
   neurological disorder, and its incidence is higher among elderly
   patients than in any other segment of the population. The prevalence of
   epilepsy is greater among inpatients than in the general population and
   it is related to long length of hospital stay (LOS), which is associated
   with hospital mortality and higher healthcare costs. Despite these
   facts, reports of elderly inpatients admitted with seizures and
   associated outcomes are scarce. Objective: To identify predictors of
   long LOS among elderly inpatients admitted with seizures. Methods: We
   prospectively enrolled elders admitted with epileptic seizures or who
   experienced seizures throughout hospitalization between November 2015
   and August 2019. We analysed demographic data, neurological disorders,
   clinical comorbidities, and seizure features to identify risk factors.
   Results: The median LOS was 11 days, with an interquartile range (IQR)
   of 5-21 days. The frequency of long LOS (defined as a period of
   hospitalization >= 12 days) was 47\%. Multivariate analysis showed there
   was an exponential increase in long LOS if a patient showed any of the
   following conditions: intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR= 4.562),
   urinary tract infection (OR=3.402), movement disorder (OR=5.656), early
   seizure recurrence (OR=2.090), and sepsis (OR=4.014). Conclusion: Long
   LOS was common among elderly patients admitted with seizures, and most
   predictors of long LOS found in this cohort might be avoidable; these
   findings should be confirmed with further research.}},

Title = {{Chondrocytes respond to an altered heparan sulfate composition with
   distinct changes of heparan sulfate structure and increased levels of
   chondroitin sulfate}},
Journal = {{MATRIX BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Heparan sulfate (HS) regulates the activity of many signaling molecules
   critical for the development of endochondral bones. Even so, mice with a
   genetically altered HS metabolism display a relatively mild skeletal
   phenotype compared to the defects observed in other tissues and organs
   pointing to a reduced HS dependency of growth-factor signaling in
   chondrocytes. To understand this difference, we have investigated the
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composition in two mouse lines that produce
   either reduced levels of HS (Ext1(gt/gt) mice) or HS lacking
   2-O-sulfation (Hs2st1(-/-) mice). Analysis by RPIP-HPLC revealed an
   increased level of sulfated disaccarides not affected by the mutation in
   both mouse lines indicating that chondrocytes attempt to restore a
   critical level of sulfation. In addition, in both mutant lines we also
   detected significantly elevated levels of CS. Size exclusion
   chromatography further demonstrated that Ext1(gt/gt) mutants produce
   more but shorter CS chains, while the CS chains produced by (Hs2st1(-/-)
   mice) mutants are of similar length to that of wild type littermates
   indicating that chondrocytes produce more rather than longer CS chains.
   Expression analysis revealed an upregulation of aggrecan, which likely
   carries most of the additionally produced CS. Together the results of
   this study demonstrate for the first time that not only a reduced HS
   synthesis but also an altered HS structure leads to increased levels of
   CS in mammalian tissues. Furthermore, as chondrocytes produce 100-fold
   more CS than HS the increased CS levels point to an active,
   precursor-independent mechanism that senses the quality of HS in a vast
   excess of CS. Interestingly, reducing the level of cell surface CS by
   chondroitinase treatment leads to reduced Bmp2 induced Smad1/5/9
   phosphorylation. In addition, Erk phosphorylation is increased
   independent of Fgf18 treatment indicating that both, HS and CS, affect
   growth factor signaling in chondrocytes in distinct manners. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The composition of the political elites in sixteenth-century Ghent, one
   of the political and economic centres of the county of Flanders, changed
   from a relatively open elite group that included representatives from
   the craft guilds into a compact, aristocratic class. This article
   analyses the reasons for this transformation. First, the number of
   office-holders in the city council declined and power was increasingly
   concentrated in the hands of a smaller political elite because of
   interventions in the urban political framework by the Habsburg
   authorities in the wake of a fiscal rebellion (1537-40) and a Calvinist
   takeover of power (1578-84). Secondly, the once dominant position of the
   craft guilds on Ghent's two benches of aldermen was weakened by
   institutional reforms, a Catholic backlash against Calvinism and an
   economic recession. Thirdly, the growing wealth gap between rulers and
   the ruled, coupled with an influx of noblemen into Ghent City Council,
   gave urban politics a more aristocratic character. Consequently, a
   series of interconnected changes gave rise to a trend towards oligarchy
   and aristocracy on the city's benches of aldermen.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the inconsistency associated with judgment
   aggregation, known as the ``doctrinal paradox{''}, is not a rare
   exception. There are n individuals who have opinions about k
   propositions. Each opinion expresses the degree of belief or conviction
   and thus belongs to the unit interval {[}0, 1]. We work with an
   arbitrary proposition aggregator that maps opinions about k propositions
   into an overall opinion in {[}0, 1] and an arbitrary individual opinions
   aggregator mapping opinions of n individuals into a single judgement
   from a unit interval. We show that for any typical proposition
   aggregator, the set of individual opinion aggregators that are immune to
   the paradox is very small, i.e., is nowhere dense in the space of
   uniformly bounded functions. In addition, we offer several examples of
   judgement aggregation for which the paradox can be avoided. (C) 2020

   are additional independent sources of cross-sectional variation in stock
   returns before 1996 particularly under the Global CAPM. After 1996, the

Title = {{Criminal exploitation of child protection-involved youth}},
Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: While at higher risk, child protection-involved youth are
   the subject of negligible research focusing on the criminal exploitation
   of children by adults.
   Purpose: This exploratory study examines criminal exploitation of
   `crossover' children, those traversing the child protection and youth
   justice systems, in Victoria Australia. It examines the relationships,
   processes, and criminal activity related to child criminal exploitation
   amongst crossover children, and canvasses current legal and welfare
   responses to this phenomenon. Methods: Twenty-five interview and focus
   group consultations were undertaken with 87 child welfare, legal,
   justice, and education key stakeholders. Examples of child criminal
   exploitation were also identified from a case file audit crossover
   children (n = 300) appearing before three children's courts.
   Results: Child criminal exploitation emerged as an issue in fifty
   percent (n = 12/25) of interview and focus group consultations.
   Participants regularly described this exploitation of crossover children
   by strangers, `romantic' partners, and family members. Children in
   residential care and those with neurodisability were identified as
   vulnerable subgroups, with sexual exploitation and substance abuse
   operating as key facilitators of criminal exploitation. Legal and
   welfare responses included the use of intervention orders against
   exploiters, alongside child protection and secure welfare interventions
   with children.
   Conclusions: Child criminal exploitation is an identified concern for
   child protection-involved youth and other children who appear before
   criminal courts in the study jurisdiction. Findings demonstrate a need
   for a clear conceptualisation of child criminal exploitation, both
   locally and globally, that captures the scope of this phenomenon.
   Evidence-supported frameworks for identifying, preventing, and
   responding to child criminal exploitation are required to minimise
   detrimental legal and developmental impacts on children.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an iron-doped metal-organic framework (MOF) Fe/ZIF-8 was
   synthesized from ZIF-8 at room temperature. Direct carbonization of
   Fe/ZIF-8 under a nitrogen atmosphere produced nanoporous nitrogen doped
   carbon nanoparticles decorated with Fe component (Fe/NC). The Fe/NC
   exhibited a large surface area (1221.185 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow
   pore-size distribution (3-5 nm). The nanoporous Fe/NC components along
   with Nafion were used to modify a glassy carbon electrode for the
   electrochemical determination of chloramphenicol and metronidazole via
   linear sweep voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the reduction peak
   currents (observed at -0.237 V and -0.071 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of these
   analytes increased linearly with increasing chloramphenicol and
   metronidazole concentrations in the range of 0.1-100 mu M and 0.5-30 mu
   M, with the detection limits estimated to be 31 nM and 165 nM,
   respectively. This result was attributed to the large surface area,
   porous structure, high nitrogen content, and as well as the
   electrocatalytic effect of Fe atoms embeded in the carbon support. The
   proposed sensor was used for chloramphenicol and metronidazole analysis
   in samples, providing satisfactory results.}},

Title = {{Geldanamycin-Derived HSP90 Inhibitors Are Synthetic Lethal with NRF2}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Activating mutations in KEAP1-NRF2 are frequently found in tumors of the
   lung, esophagus, and liver, where they are associated with aggressive
   growth, resistance to cancer therapies, and low overall survival.
   Despite the fact that NRF2 is a validated driver of tumorigenesis and
   chemotherapeutic resistance, there are currently no approved drugs which
   can inhibit its activity. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need to
   identify NRF2-selective cancer therapies. To this end, we developed a
   novel synthetic lethal assay, based on fluorescently labeled isogenic
   wild-type and Keap1 knockout cell lines, in order to screen for
   compounds which selectively kill cells in an NRF2-dependent manner.
   Through this approach, we identified three compounds based on the
   geldanamycin scaffold which display synthetic lethality with NRF2.
   Mechanistically, we show that products of NRF2 target genes metabolize
   the quinone-containing geldanamycin compounds into more potent HSP90
   inhibitors, which enhances their cytotoxicity while simultaneously
   restricting the synthetic lethal effect to cells with aberrant NRF2
   activity. As all three of the geldanamyc-inderived compounds have been
   used in clinical trials, they represent ideal candidates for drug
   repositioning to target the currently untreatable NRF2 activity in
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waves propagating in the semi-bounded collisional hot QCD medium
   (quark-gluon plasma) are considered. To investigate the effect of
   collisions as damping and non-ideality factor, the longitudinal and
   transverse dielectric functions of the quark-gluon plasma are used
   within the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approach. The results were
   obtained both analytically and numerically in the long wavelength limit.
   First of all, collisions lead to smaller values of surface wave
   frequency and their stronger damping. Secondly, the results show that
   non-ideality leads to the appearance of a new branch of surface waves
   compared to the collisionless case. The relevance of the surface
   excitations (waves) for the QGP realized in experiments is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the role of Heracles as a mythical figure and god
   in Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Clitophon in order to show the ways in
   which his representation shapes a reading of the novel. This analysis
   argues that Heracles, a frequent presence in L\&C, is depicted as an
   erotic figure over a heroic one and that he, therefore, embodies the
   interweaving of myth, narrative, and eroticism captured in the phrase
   mythoi erotikoi and thematized throughout the novel. Furthermore, I
   suggest that the novel's emphasis on erotic Heracles not only influences
   the reader's understanding of Clitophon, but also contributes to the
   novel's disruption of the genre's expectations around heteroeroticism,
   monogamy, and marriage as the telos of the plot.}},

Abstract = {{Data on the occurrence and abundance of meso and microplastics for the
   South Pacific are limited and there is urgent need to fill this

   method, based on the fluorescence tagging of polymers using Nile red, to
   determine the concentration of meso and microplastics in biota, sediment
   and surface waters near the capital cities of Vanuatu and Solomon
   Islands. A spatial in-vestigation was carried out for sediment, biota
   and water as well as a temporal assessment for sediment for two
   consecutive years (2017 and 2018). Accumulation zones for microplastics
   were identified supported by previous hydrodynamic models. Microplastics
   were detected for all environmental compartments investigated indicating
   their widespread presence for Vanuatu and Solomons Islands. This method
   was in alignment with previous recommendations that the Nile red method
   is a promising approach for the largescale mapping of microplastics in a
   monitoring context.}},

Title = {{Host-to-host airborne transmission as a multiphase flow problem for
   science-based social distance guidelines}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{132}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has strikingly demonstrated how important it is to
   develop fundamental knowledge related to the generation, transport and
   inhalation of pathogen-laden droplets and their subsequent possible fate
   as airborne particles, or aerosols, in the context of human to human
   transmission. It is also increasingly clear that airborne transmission
   is an important contributor to rapid spreading of the disease. In this
   paper, we discuss the processes of droplet generation by exhalation,
   their potential transformation into airborne particles by evaporation,
   transport over long distances by the exhaled puff and by ambient air
   turbulence, and their final inhalation by the receiving host as
   interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time
   evolution of droplet/aerosol concentration is presented based on a
   theoretical analysis of the relevant physical processes. The modeling
   framework along with detailed experiments and simulations can be used to
   study a wide variety of scenarios involving breathing, talking, coughing
   and sneezing and in a number of environmental conditions, as humid or
   dry atmosphere, confined or open environment. Although a number of
   questions remain open on the physics of evaporation and coupling with
   persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a more reliable
   understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus transmission one
   can set the foundation for an improved methodology in designing
   case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines. (C)

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE
   MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric encapsulants are proven to be defect-passivating agents which
   render robust perovskite films. Here, we report the new approach of
   synthesis of tin halide perovskite encapsulated by a transparent
   conducting oligomer, namely polysilsesquioxane (PSQ). The stability of
   the tin halide perovskite was improved using the modifier. PSQ possesses
   good electrical conductivity and HOMO-LUMO energy levels being suited
   for promoting the hole conductivity of the perovskite materials. The
   crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, and current-voltage
   characteristics of PSQ encapsulated perovskites were studied using
   microscopic, spectroscopic and photovoltaic characterization techniques.
   Photovoltaic cells were fabricated under ambient atmosphere (RH > 60\%)
   and photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of similar to 2.2\% were
   obtained with a short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of similar to 5.4
   mA/cm(2), open circuit potential (V-OC) of similar to 1.0 V and a fill
   factor (FF) of similar to 40\% under 1 sun (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination.
   Our work opens a new class of chemical modifiers for improving
   environmental stability and can be further tuned for the development of
   more efficient photovoltaic conversion devices.}},

   spectroscopy, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and
   nitrogen adsorption at -196 degrees C, and submitted to toxicity and
   desorption tests. Silane functional groups blocked sepiolite active
   positions, and adsorption occurred within the zeolitic channels and on
   the surface of the functionalized solids. Caffeine and glyphosate
   effectively interacted with urea groups from grafted alkoxide, which
   could lower the mobility of the adsorbed contaminants. Glyphosate
   adsorbed on functionalized sepiolite derivatives showed low toxicity.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{During the months of March and April 2020 we witnessed the largest-scale
   experiment in history in terms of air quality in cities. Any prediction
   of this experiment's results may be obvious to science, as it was
   totally expected, the air quality has improved substantially. Simply
   stated, it comes as no surprise. The lockdown has made it pos-sible to
   quantify the limit of decrease in pollution in light of this drastic
   reduction in traffic, in Madrid and Barce-lona showed a significant
   decrease of the order of 75\%. In the case of Spain's two largest
   cities, the reductions of NO2 concentrations were 62\% and 50\%,
   respectively. Hourly measurements were obtained from 24 and 9 air
   qual-ity stations from the monitoring networks during the month of March
   2020. These results allow us to see the limits that can be achieved by
   implementing low emission zones (LEZ), as well as the amount of
   contamination that must be eliminated, which in the cases of Madrid and
   Barcelona, represent 55\%. This value defines the levels of effort and
   scope of actions to be taken in order to ensure that both cities achieve
   a clean and healthy atmo-sphere in terms of NO2. (c) 2020 The Author.

Abstract = {{The majority of fatalities thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic have been
   attributed to pneumonia. As expected, the fatality rate reported in
   China is higher in people with chronic pulmonary disease (6.3\%) and
   those who have cancer (5.6\%). According to the American College of
   Cardiology Clinical Bulletin ``COVID-19 Clinical Guidance for the CV

   (7.3\%), hypertensive (6.0\%), or have known cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) (10.5\%). We propose a biological reason for the higher mortality
   risk in these populations that is apparent. We further present a set of
   pathophysiological reasons for the heightened danger that could lead to
   therapies for enhanced management and prevention.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Zebrafish has been a reliable model system for studying human viral
   pathologies. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has become a global chaos,
   affecting millions of people. There is an urgent need to contain the
   pandemic and develop reliable therapies. We report the use of a
   humanized zebrafish model, xeno-transplanted with human lung epithelial
   cells, A549, for studying the protective effects of a tri-herbal
   medicine Coronil. At human relevant doses of 12 and 58 mu g/kg, Coronil
   inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, induced humanized zebrafish
   mortality, and rescued from behavioral fever. Morphological and cellular
   abnormalities along with granulocyte and macrophage accumulation in the
   swim bladder were restored to normal. Skin hemorrhage, renal cell
   degeneration, and necrosis were also significantly attenuated by Coronil
   treatment. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis
   identified ursolic acid, betulinic acid, withanone, withaferine A,
   withanoside IV-V, cordifolioside A, magnoflorine, rosmarinic acid, and
   palmatine as phyto-metabolites present in Coronil. In A549 cells,
   Coronil attenuated the IL-1 beta induced IL-6 and TNF-alpha cytokine
   secretions, and decreased TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa B/AP-1
   transcriptional activity. Taken together, we show the disease modifying
   immunomodulatory properties of Coronil, at human equivalent doses, in
   rescuing the pathological features induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike
   protein, suggesting its potential use in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives
   and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to
   deliver a scientific opinion on the renewal of the authorisation of
   Bacillus subtilis PB6, the extension of use to ornamental, sporting and
   game birds and a modification on the concentration of the said additive.
   The product under assessment is based on viable spores of a strain
   originally identified as Bacillus subtilis. During the course of the
   current assessment, the active agent has been redesignated as Bacillus
   velezensis ATCC PTA-6737. The bacterial species B. velezensis is
   considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS)
   approach to safety assessment. The identity of the active agent is
   established and the compliance with the other qualifications confirmed.
   Therefore, B. velezensis ATCC PTA-6737 is presumed safe for the target
   species, consumers of products derived from animals fed the additive and
   the environment. The additive is not a dermal/eye irritant or a skin
   sensitiser. Exposure via inhalation is unlikely. In the previous
   assessments performed by the FEEDAP Panel, the additive showed to be
   efficacious as a zootechnical additive in feedingstuffs for chickens for
   fattening and chickens reared for laying at the level of 1 x 10(7)
   CFU/kg. Considering that efficacy at the same level has been shown, this
   conclusion is extrapolated to ornamental, sporting and gaming birds. (C)

Abstract = {{The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic motivated this paper, which
   revisits the nexus of public health and the city, itself a main source
   of a pandemic which similarly threatens the lives and properties of the
   world population gradually one glacier at a time: climate change. We
   argue that pandemics expose both the vulnerability and resilience of the
   urban system expansively, from rooftop to the region, but also serve as
   change agents for the planning of resilient cities and regions globally.
   The discussion of the urban system and the pandemic is comparative, with
   the recent coronavirus and climate change, a persistent, long-lasting
   pandemic. The historical and critical review and synthesis of the
   durable concepts of the urban system at the kernel of the theories and
   practices of urbanism is highlighted by place matters, cyberspace,
   density, access, and the city-region. We note the implications for
   reconfiguring the resilient urban system of the future effectively with
   pandemic as change agent and the comprehensive plan and its regulatory

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes computational fluid dynamics as well as a group
   method of data handling (GMDH) method to predict the mean velocity of
   intake. Firstly, the three dimensional flow pattern in a 90-degree
   intake is simulated with ANSYS-CFX at a transverse ratio equal to one
   (W{*}(b)/W{*}(m) = 1) that W{*}(m) is the width of the main channel and
   W{*}(b) is the width of the branch channel. The comparison of mean
   velocity in the simulated intake and experimental channel represents the
   high accuracy of ANSYS-CFX modeling (mean absolute percentage error
   (MAPE) = 5\% and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.017). A group method
   of data handling (GMDH) is one type of artificial intelligence approach
   that presents elementary equations for calculating the problem's target
   parameter and performing well in complex nonlinear systems. In this
   research, to train and test the GMDH method, input data is needed in all
   parts of the channel. Since there is not enough laboratory data in all
   parts of the channel, to increase the benchmarks, the laboratory model
   is simulated by the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical model.
   After ensuring the proper accuracy of the numerical results, the
   built-in CFD numerical model has been used as a tool to create primary
   benchmarks in the channel points, especially in areas where there is no
   laboratory data. This generated data has been used in training and
   testing the GMDH method. The diversion angle with the longitudinal
   direction of the main channel (theta), the longitudinal coordinates in
   the intake (y{*}), and the ratio of the branch channel width to the main
   channel (W-r) have been applied as the input training data in the GMDH
   method to estimate mean velocity. The results of the statistical indexes
   used to quantitatively examine this model, (R-2 = 0.86, MAPE = 10.44,
   RMSE = 0.03, SI = 0.12), indicated the accuracy of this model in
   predicting the mean velocity of the flow within open channel intakes.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at examining and comparing the nutrient removal
   efficiency, biomass productivity and microbial community structure of
   two outdoor pilot-scale photobioreactors, namely a bubble column and a
   raceway pond, treating the liquid fraction of an agricultural digestate.
   Bacterial and eukaryotic communities were characterized using a
   metabarcoding approach and quantitative PCR. The abundance, composition,
   diversity, and dynamics of the main microbes were then correlated to the
   environmental conditions and operational parameters of the reactors.
   Both photobioreactors were dominated either by Chlorella sp. or
   Scenedesmus sp. in function of temperature, irradiance and the nitrogen
   compounds derived by nitrification. Other species, such as Chlamydomonas
   and Planktochlorella, were sporadically present, demonstrating that they
   have more specific niche requirement. Pseudomonas sp. always dominated
   the bacterial community in both reactors, except in summertime, when a
   bloom of Calothrix occurred in the raceway pond. In autumn, the
   worsening of the climate conditions decreased the microalgal growth,
   promoting predation by Vorticella sp. The study highlights the factors
   influencing the structure and dynamics of the microbial consortia and
   which ecological mechanisms are driving the microbial shifts and the
   consequent reactor performance. On these bases, control strategies could
   be defined to optimize the management of the microalgal-based
   technologies.}},

Title = {{Elevated CO2 Emissions during Magmatic-Hydrothermal Degassing at Awu
   Volcano, Sangihe Arc, Indonesia}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Awu is a remote and little known active volcano of Indonesia located in
   the northern part of Molucca Sea. It is the northernmost active volcano
   of the Sangihe arc with 18 eruptions in less than 4 centuries, causing a
   cumulative death toll of 11,048. Two of these eruptions were classified
   with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 4. Since 2004, a lava dome
   has occupied the centre of Awu crater, channelling the fumarolic gas
   output along the crater wall. A combined Differential Optical Absorption
   Spectroscopy (DOAS) and Multi-component Gas Analyzer System (Multi-GAS)
   study highlight a relatively small SO2 flux (13 t/d) sustained by mixed
   magmatic-hydrothermal emissions made-up of 82 mol.\% H2O, 15 mol.\% CO2,
   2.55 mol.\% total S (S-T) and 0.02 mol.\% H-2. The CO2 emission budget,
   as observed during a short observation period in 2015, corresponds to a
   daily contribution to the atmosphere of 2600 t/d, representing 1\% of
   the global CO2 emission budget from volcanoes. The gas CO2/S-T ratio of
   3.7 to 7.9 is at the upper limit of the Indonesian gas range, which is
   ascribed to (i) some extent of S loss during hydrothermal processing,
   and perhaps (ii) a C-rich signature of the feeding magmatic gas phase.
   The source of this high CO2 signature and flux is yet to be fully
   understood; however, given the peculiar geodynamic context of the
   region, dominated by the arc-to-arc collision, this may result from
   either the prolonged heating of the slab and consequent production of
   carbon-rich fluids, or the recycling of crustal carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study investigated whether ELABELA plays a role in the
   differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions of the thyroid
   gland. Subjects and methods: Of the 87 patients included in the study,
   12 had undergone surgery for benign thyroid diseases, 30 had papillary
   thyroid cancer without invasion and/or lymph node metastasis in the
   surrounding tissues in the pathology report, and 45 had papillary
   thyroid cancer with invasion and/or lymph node metastasis in the
   surrounding tissues. Results: In the macrocarcinoma group, the
   proportion of patients with severe ELABELA staining (61.1\%) was higher
   than that in the adenoma (50\%) and microcarcinoma (23.8\%) groups,
   while the proportion of those with mild to moderate staining was lower
   (p < 0.001). In the microcarcinoma group, the proportion of patients
   with severe staining was lower than that in the adenoma group, while the
   proportion of those with mild to moderate staining was higher (p
   <0.001). In papillary thyroid carcinomas, the rates of moderate and
   severe staining in the classical variant, mild staining in the
   follicular variant, severe staining in the classical + follicular
   variant, and severe staining in the oncocytic variant were higher.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to be
   conducted on this subject. In this study, ELABELA was not found to be
   significant in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant
   lesions of the thyroid gland. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, severe
   ELABELA staining patterns were more common in macrocarcinoma patients
   than in microcarcinoma patients.}},

   differences in therapeutic effects}},

Abstract = {{Author summary
   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disorder
   caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Utrophin is structurally
   similar to dystrophin and can potentially be utilized to prevent muscle
   necrosis in preclinical models of DMD. Consequently, utrophin-mediated
   therapies are a primary target for treating DMD, particularly as it may
   circumvent immune responses to dystrophin-mediated therapies. One
   promising therapeutic option is to utilize recombinant adeno-associated
   viral vectors (rAAV) to deliver a rationally designed miniaturized
   utrophin (mu Utrn) to striated muscles to prevent necrosis. Here, we
   found that rAAV-mu Utrn can profoundly prevent skeletal muscle necrosis
   in the mdx(4cv) mouse model of DMD. mu Utrn was also able to replace
   many functions of dystrophin at the neuromuscular synapse and
   myotendinous junctions. However, we provide several lines of in vivo
   evidence that steric hindrance between mu Utrn and the endogenous
   full-length utrophin on the sarcolemma impacts the longevity of the
   therapy in a muscle fiber-type selective manner. Understanding the
   stoichiometry of this effect may be important for predicting clinical
   efficacy.
   Gene therapy approaches for DMD using recombinant adeno-associated viral
   (rAAV) vectors to deliver miniaturized (or micro) dystrophin genes to
   striated muscles have shown significant progress. However, concerns
   remain about the potential for immune responses against dystrophin in
   some patients. Utrophin, a developmental paralogue of dystrophin, may
   provide a viable treatment option. Here we examine the functional
   capacity of an rAAV-mediated microutrophin (mu Utrn) therapy in the
   mdx(4cv) mouse model of DMD. We found that rAAV-mu Utrn led to
   improvement in dystrophic histopathology \& mostly restored the
   architecture of the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions.
   Physiological studies of tibialis anterior muscles indicated peak force
   maintenance, with partial improvement of specific force. A fundamental
   question for mu Utrn therapeutics is not only can it replace critical
   functions of dystrophin, but whether full-length utrophin impacts the
   therapeutic efficacy of the smaller, highly expressed mu Utrn. As such,
   we found that mu Utrn significantly reduced the spacing of the
   costameric lattice relative to full-length utrophin. Further,
   immunostaining suggested the improvement in dystrophic pathophysiology
   was largely influenced by favored correction of fast 2b fibers. However,
   unlike mu Utrn, mu dystrophin (mu Dys) expression did not show this
   fiber type preference. Interestingly, mu Utrn was better able to protect
   2a and 2d fibers in mdx:utrn(-/-) mice than in mdx(4cv) mice where the
   endogenous full-length utrophin was most prevalent. Altogether, these
   data are consistent with the role of steric hindrance between
   full-length utrophin \& mu Utrn within the sarcolemma. Understanding the
   stoichiometry of this effect may be important for predicting clinical
   efficacy.}},

Title = {{Between supercritical liquids and gases - Reconciling dynamic and
   thermodynamic state transitions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{165}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Experimental, computational, and theoretical results have shown that the
   notion of a homogeneous supercritical state space has to be replaced
   with distinct liquid-like and gas-like regions, divided by a cross-over
   line. Several such cross-over lines have been proposed, such as the
   Frenkel line, the Fisher-Widom line, and the Widom line. We use
   thermodynamics arguments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and
   experimental data to investigate the relation between these lines. This
   work proposes a new interpretation of the Widom line based on the
   curvature of the Gibbs free energy, showing that the supercritical
   cross-over can be evaluated as a projection of the subcritical phase
   transition from a liquid to an ideal gas state to supercritical
   conditions. We show that the cross-over across the Widom line should not
   be regarded as instantaneous, but instead as spreading over a finite
   temperature interval. The thermodynamic character of the Widom line
   becomes negligible at reduced pressures p/p(cr) >3 and disappears
   completely at higher pressures p/p(cr) > 10. We find evidence that
   measured transitions attributed to the Widom line do in fact match the
   Frenkel line better. In this way, we suggest a consistent view of the
   supercritical state space and resolve apparent contradictions. (C) 2020

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{903}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present a synergic study of protoplanetary disks to investigate links
   between inner-disk gas molecules and the large-scale migration of solid
   pebbles. The sample includes 63 disks where two types of measurements
   are available: (1) spatially resolved disk images revealing the radial
   distribution of disk pebbles (millimeter to centimeter dust grains),
   from millimeter observations with the Atacama Large
   Millimeter/Submillimeter Array or the Submillimeter Array, and (2)
   infrared molecular emission spectra as observed with Spitzer. The line
   flux ratios of H2O with HCN, C2H2, and CO2 all anticorrelate with the
   dust disk radius R-dust, expanding previous results found by Najita et
   al. for HCN/H2O and the dust disk mass. By normalization with the
   dependence on accretion luminosity common to all molecules, only the H2O
   luminosity maintains a detectable anticorrelation with disk radius,
   suggesting that the strongest underlying relation is between H2O and
   R-dust. If R-dust is set by large-scale pebble drift, and if molecular
   luminosities trace the elemental budgets of inner-disk warm gas, these
   results can be naturally explained with scenarios where the inner disk
   chemistry is fed by sublimation of oxygen-rich icy pebbles migrating
   inward from the outer disk. Anticorrelations are also detected between
   all molecular luminosities and the infrared index n(13-30), which is
   sensitive to the presence and size of an inner-disk dust cavity.
   Overall, these relations suggest a physical interconnection between dust
   and gas evolution, both locally and across disk scales. We discuss
   fundamental predictions to test this interpretation and study the
   interplay between pebble drift, inner disk depletion, and the chemistry
   of planet-forming material.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond the great success in machine learning (ML), the engineering
   community has been actively exploring neuromorphic computing systems
   based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). In the preliminary SNN, the
   neuronal information is simply encoded by the firing rate, which limits
   the volume of information in a certain spike pattern. Studies of the
   biological nervous system have discovered neuronal cooperativity, where
   flow of neural information is collaboratively encoded and carried by the
   spatiotemporal stamp and the correlated neuronal activity. In this
   study, by encoding the control pattern on the dual gates, a MoS2-based
   neuristor is exploited to program spatiotemporal information and
   neuronal correlations via the device's internal dynamics as well as the
   network topology, and a spiking correlated neural network (SCNN) is
   demonstrated. This correlated neural network not only succeeds in
   identifying the patterns with translational and rotational symmetry but
   also correctly reveals the rotated angles. Compared with conventional
   SNNs, the dimension of information flow in SCNNs can be greatly enlarged
   by taking advantage of the synergy between the rate coding and the
   neuronal correlations. This proof-of-concept work provides the potential
   to achieve high-volume information processing with the simplified
   circuitry of neuromorphic computing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Uncovering hidden relations in complex data sets is a key step to making
   sense of the data, which is a hot topic in our era of data deluge.
   Graph-based representations are examples of tools able to encode
   relations in a mathematical structure enabling the uncovering of
   patterns like clusters and paths. However, graphs only capture pairwise
   relations encoded in the presence of edges, but there are many forms of
   interaction that cannot be reduced to pairwise relations. To overcome
   the limitations of graph-based representations, it is necessary to
   incorporate multiway relations. In this article, we exploit tools from
   algebraic topology to handle multiway relations. Algebraic topology is a
   branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study a
   topological space, that is, a set of points, along with a set of
   neighborhoods. More specifically, we illustrate topological signal
   processing (TSP), a framework encompassing a class of methods for
   analyzing signals defined over a topological space. Given its
   generality, TSP incorporates graph signal processing (GSP) as a
   particular case. After motivating the use of topological and geometrical
   methods for detecting patterns in the data, we present the signal
   processing tools based on algebraic topology and then illustrate their
   advantages with respect to graph-based methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The controversy over the legal qualification of platform distributors
   seems to have been finally resolved by the Supreme Court, in plenary
   session, declaring that the relationship between a distributor and the
   Glovo company is of a labour nature. It is verified that the defining
   notes of the employment contract concur, in particular those of
   dependency and ``ajenidad{''}, declaring the Court that the Glovo
   company is not a mere intermediary in the contracting of services
   between businesses, clients and distributors, but that it provides
   services by fixing the essential conditions for the provision of said
   service, it is the owner of the essential means to carry out the
   activity and uses distributors who do not have their own and autonomous
   business organization, who provide their service on their behalf.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, activated carbon (AC) was prepared from agro-waste betel
   nut husks (BNH) through the chemical activation method. Different
   characterization techniques described the physicochemical nature of
   betel nut husks activated carbon (BNH-AC) through Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and pH point of zero charge. Later, the
   produced AC was used for methylene blue (MB) adsorption via numerous
   batch experimental parameters: initial concentrations of MB dye (25-250
   mg/L), contact time (0.5-24 hours) and initial pH (2-12). Dye adsorption
   isotherms were also assessed at three temperatures where the maximum
   adsorption capacity (381.6 mg/g) was found at 30 degrees C. The
   adsorption equilibrium data were best suited to the non-linear form of
   the Freundlich isotherm model. Additionally, non-linear
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model was better fitted with the
   experimental value as well. Steady motion of solute particles from the
   boundary layer to the BNH-AC's surface was the possible reaction
   dynamics concerning MB adsorption. Thermodynamic study revealed that the
   adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Saline
   water emerged as an efficient eluent for the desorption of adsorbed dye
   on AC. Therefore, the BNH-AC is a very promising and cost-effective
   adsorbent for MB dye treatment and has high adsorption capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Applying nanotechnology to deliver drug could result in several benefits
   such as prolong duration of action, enhancement in overall
   bioavailability, targeting to specific site, low initial loading dose
   require, systemic stability enhancement etc. Halloysite is one of those
   clay minerals showing maximum effectiveness when consider as a nano drug
   carriers for different kind applications. Here, we have used norfloxacin
   as the model drug for loading into halloysite nanotube (HNT) for its
   anti-bacterial activity. Norfloxacin was loaded into halloysites by
   vacuum operation and sonication. The nanotubes were evaluated using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), optical microscopy, water absorption studies, cytotoxicity
   studies, antimicrobial studies and in vitro diffusion studies. SEM,
   FT-IR and XRD analysis data showed that the norfloxacin was successfully
   loaded into nanotubes. TEM analysis confirmed loading of norfloxacin in
   halloysites' lumen. The halloysite/chitosan nanocomposites were prepared
   by solvent casting and freeze-drying method. SEM analysis revealed
   compact and rugged surface of nanocomposites due to existing norfloxacin
   loaded halloysite. FTIR and XRD confirmed formation of nanocomposite.
   The nanocomposites showed good antimicrobial effect and good
   biocompatibility in cytotoxicity study. The in-vitro release studies
   revealed that halloysite/chitosan nanocomposites were able to sustain
   the drug release. Also, the nanocomposites were stable in various
   humidity conditions. Therefore, all the outcomes suggest that the
   prepared nanocomposites can provide enhanced therapeutic benefits and
   they can be very potential nano vehicle for sustaining drug delivery.

Abstract = {{`Casteism' and `politicization of caste' are common phenomena of Indian
   society since the beginning of the twentieth century. Violation of
   social rights and caste discriminations of plural characters have added
   additional complexity to them. Casteism has thus appeared as a burden of
   postcolonial Indian society. As a subject of study, it is, however, not
   a comfortable one. Being a sensitive issue, it often gets mixed up with
   political, class, cultural and regional conflicts. Thus, academic
   scholars, general readers and policy makers do often face serious
   trouble in highlighting the basic premises of casteism. Academic studies
   on casteism and caste-discrimination in the context of West Bengal are
   also not free from this limitation. Moreover, there has been a common
   perception among the intellectuals as well as in the academic world that
   West Bengal is free from caste violence. Print, electronic and social
   media have also equally contributed to the creation of this perception
   in the late twentieth century, especially for considering `caste' merely
   as a parameter of `class'. This `invented notion' on caste has
   encouraged the people of the state to understand `caste' simply as a
   social phenomenon irrespective of its social and class differences.
   However, it would be an utter lie to accept the general propaganda that
   casteism has no presence in West Bengal. Rather, our field surveys
   either through interviews or `face-to-face group discussions' as well as
   contemporary media reports reveal that psychological, oral and
   behavioural casteism are social realities of West Bengal. Thus, this
   article is an attempt to highlight the nature of casteism and caste
   intolerance as faced by the Scheduled Castes (SCs) of West Bengal
   because of their birth in a particular sub-caste.}},

Abstract = {{Urban environments are challenged with unprecedented anthropogenic and
   natural pressures, the latter being accelerated by the growing awareness
   of the consequences of climate change. The concept of urban resilience
   has been growing in response, since it allows us to understand city
   behaviour as a system of systems, improving its response to extreme
   climate-related events. This paper presents the EU H2020 Resilience to
   Cope with Climate Change in Urban Areas (RESCCUE) project approach in
   Lisbon's research site, regarding the Hazur(R) resilience assessment
   methodology. This methodology focuses on the interdependencies between
   services and infrastructures, and on the recovery times needed to
   restore its normal functionalities. This approach allows the integration
   of several work packages of the RESCCUE project, from climate change
   projections to adaptation strategies selection. The assessment was
   conducted for 19 services and 146 infrastructures, including water
   (supply and drainage systems), power, mobility, waste,
   telecommunication, environment, and the social sector. The principal
   climate-related hazard analysed at the Lisbon research site was urban
   flooding. The main result consists of a deep understanding of the
   relations between different services and the consequent cascade effects
   triggered by flooding events. Stakeholders' involvement, beyond the
   project consortium, was fundamental for the success of the methodology
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate root canal
   preparation and apical enlargement of curved canals using rotary
   heat-treated and heat/surface-treated systems by micro computed
   tomographic imaging. Methods: Curved mesial root canals (n = 48) of
   mandibular molars (20 degrees-40 degrees) were prepared using ProDesign
   Logic (PDL; Easy Equipamentos Odontologicos, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil)
   25/.01 and 25/.06 or HyFlex EDM (HFEDM) 10/.05, HyFlex CM 20/.04, and
   HFEDM 25/.08. Apical enlargement was performed using PDL 40/.05 or HFEDM
   40/.04. Scanning (9 lim) was performed before and after preparation and
   after apical enlargement using micro computed tomographic imaging.
   Volume, percentage of volume increase, debris, untouched root canal
   surface, and centering ability were analyzed. Statistical analysis was
   performed using Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, and unpaired t tests (alpha =
   .05). Results: HFEDM promoted a higher volume increase of the root
   canals than PDL after preparation and after apical enlargement (P <
   .05). The apical enlargement promoted a significant decrease in debris
   and untouched surface in both groups (P < .05). The percentage of debris
   and untouched surface were similar between HFEDM and PDL after
   preparation and after apical enlargement (P > .05). Both systems
   promoted centered canals (P > .05). Conclusions: HFEDM instruments
   promoted greater volume of the root canal than PDL. However, the
   cleaning ability of the instruments was similar. The apical increase up
   to size 40 with both instruments provided less debris and untouched
   surfaces and allowed centralization of the curved root canals.}},

Title = {{On the non-monotonic wind influence on flammable gas cloud from CFD
   simulations for hazardous area classification}},

Abstract = {{Hazardous areas are defined as a result of a variety of variables as
   storage temperature, pressure, leak orifice size, physical properties of
   flammable substance, and wind characteristics. The potential formation
   of an explosive atmosphere must be accurately assessed to ensure process
   safety. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) arises as an
   important tool for accurate predictions as recommended by the
   international standard IEC 60079-101 (2015). This study aims to analyze
   the influence of wind velocity magnitude and direction on the hazardous
   area classification. The authors evaluated the extent and volume for
   methane, propane, and hydrogen leakages from a CFD model. For each
   flammable gas, the wind velocity magnitude and direction were regularly
   varied. The outcomes show that the behavior of the plume size as the
   wind varies mainly depends on the gas concentration. Counter-flow wind
   directions lead to zero relative velocity closer to the release point,
   which concentrates the gas, and wind in the release direction promotes a
   higher dilution of the gas cloud increasing the hazardous extent while
   decreases the volume. As a consequence, the wind also influences the
   zone type, which was accurately predicted from CFD simulations and
   significant differences were found when compared to the standard
   analyses. These differences are, to some extent, related to the
   consideration of wind velocity effects on the gas jet release.}},

Abstract = {{The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
   has resulted in significant shortages of RT-PCR testing supplies
   including RNA extraction kits. The goal of our study was to determine if
   a simplified heat-RNA release method would provide comparable detection

   results using the ChromaCode HDPCRTM SARS-CoV-2 were compared using the
   heat-RNA release method and an automated RNA extraction system (EMAG).
   The heat-RNA release method correctly identified 94 \% (81/86
   nasopharyngeal samples) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five samples
   that were missed by heat-RNA release method had a mean Ct value: 35
   using the automated extraction instrument, indi-cating a very low viral
   load. Our findings show that a simple heat-RNA release method is a
   reasonable alternative for the majority of COVID-19 positive patients
   and can help overcome the cost and availability issues of RNA extraction

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the heterogeneous effect of financial
   development on firm-level growth. Our analysis relies on the experience
   of the rapid expansion of credit in Indian states, following the process
   of banking reforms in the early 1990s. Based on a survey of Indian
   manufacturing firms (1997-2006), we examine how changes in the access to
   finance by firms across Indian states affected the growth of firms
   located in the same location. Estimation results show that initially
   larger, more productive or more profitable firms benefit the most from
   the rapid expansion of credit across Indian states. These results are
   robust to various specifications that allow to control for other reforms
   taking place simultaneously, or for potential reverse causality. The
   aggregate impact of this heterogeneous effect is important: the main
   channel that explains sector-level total factor productivity growth due
   to financial development is the reallocation of market shares across
   firms.}},

Abstract = {{Improving health literacy (HL) is critical for addressing health
   inequalities. Low literacy rates are believed to be more prevalent in
   ethnic minorities, which may have an impact on people's health. For
   measures to be implemented in this regard, HL must be evaluated to
   obtain specific indicators. Our aim, therefore, was to develop a version
   of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16), which
   is recommended to be used with vulnerable populations, suited to
   Arabic/French-speaking migrants who reside in south-eastern Spain, and
   to explore its psychometric properties for assessing health literacy in
   this population. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in a
   convenient sample of 205 migrants. The structural validity was
   calculated by a confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), which suggested
   appropriate adjustment indicators, and which indicated that the
   three-dimensional model is adequately adjusted to the data obtained in
   the study. The coefficient omega showed high internal consistency in the
   three HL dimensions (health care, disease prevention, and health
   promotion). Concurrent validity presented a significant correlation with
   the Newest Vital Sign test (r = 0.390; p < 0.001). The multigroup CFA
   showed that the heterogeneity of the sample used was not a problem for
   establishing the structural validity of the scale. The Arabic/French
   version showed good construct validity.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and dynamics of mollusk communities, as well as
   environmental factors influencing them, were analyzed in small oxbow
   lakes of the forest-steppe zone (a case of the Khoper river valley,
   Penza region, Russian Federation). 19 species of mollusks were found in
   the studied water bodies. The oxbow lakes were characterized by
   relatively low alpha-diversity (number of species 4 +/- 2) and
   relatively high beta-diversity (Jacquard index 0.26 +/- 0.18), which is
   typical for floodplain ecosystems. Lake communities were dominated by
   Planorbis planorbis (40\%), Lymnaea stagnalis (15\%), Anisus spirorbis
   (14\%), Lymnaea saridalensis (9\%), Anisus vortex (8\%). The results of
   our analysis showed that the group of factors that determined the type
   of water body (stability, light intensity, water temperature, oxygen
   concentrations) had the greatest impact on the structure of
   malacocenoses. The seasonal dynamics of mollusk communities was
   determined by the number of adjoining water bodies, water temperature,
   and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The number of adjoining oxbows was
   the major factor influencing mollusk species diversity, as well as the
   total number and biomass of mollusks. Oxbow isolation was favorable for
   mollusk communities. The factors influencing the highest number of
   mollusks species (seven) were the light intensity and the presence of
   fish. Other significant factors were the stability of lakes (shown for
   five species of mollusks), the number of adjoining oxbows and water
   transparency (four species). Aquatic vegetation positively correlated
   with the abundance of only one species-Anisus vortex. Our data suggest
   that the presence of fish could influence the abundance of Lymnaea
   saridalensis. The mollusks, in their turn, apparently, had a positive
   effect on the abundance of leeches in water bodies. Mollusk species most
   sensitive to the external factors were Lymnaea stagnalis, Lymnaea
   saridalensis, Aplexa turrita, Anisus spirorbis and Anisus leucostoma,
   most tolerant were Bathyomphalus crassus, Anisus vortex, Planorbis
   planorbis and Planorbarius corneus.}},

Title = {{A modelling approach to discriminate contributions of soil hydrological
   properties and slope gradient to water stress in Mediterranean vineyards}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Grapevine is a widespread crop for grape and wine production, often
   cultivated on hilly areas. Moderate vine water stress plays an important
   role in determining high-quality viticulture. However, a precise
   quantification of the effect of hydraulic properties and slope gradient
   on hilly soil water balance and consequently on vine stress has not yet
   been addressed in the literature. The slope-gradient effect is generally
   taken for granted, without providing experiments validating such a
   qualitative assumption. We tested the hypothesis that soil hydraulic
   properties play a greater role than slope gradient in driving soil water
   status and vine stress. In two consecutive years, we studied an
   ``Aglianico{''} vineyard grown along a 90 m slope, with up-slope soil
   having lower water holding capacity than down-slope. Up-slope vines were
   more stressed, as shown by lower leaf water potential, stomatal
   conductance, leaf CO2 assimilation and leaf area index, than down-slope
   vines.
   Water flow was simulated by using the Hydrus (2D/3D) model, calibrated
   and validated towards a two-year set of soil water content measurements.
   Significantly lower soil pressure head and higher transpiration occurred
   in the up-than the down-slope site.
   A viable procedure was developed to separate the effects of soil
   hydraulic properties and slope gradient by modelling soil water balance
   and therefore vine transpiration with and without the slope gradient.
   The simulations indicated that the difference in seasonal relative
   transpiration of 8\% in 2011 and 5\% in 2012 between the two sites was
   due to their differing soil hydraulic properties, and that the slope
   gradient had no contribution to this variation.}},

Title = {{Advancing the green infrastructure approach in the Province of

   into landscape planning}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effective integration of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and
   ecosystem services (ES) indicators into green infrastructure (GI)
   planning and conservation constitutes an important challenge for
   landscape and urban planners. In this study, we developed an operational
   framework for GI planning at the landscape scale in the Province of
   Barcelona. Building on the ES cascade model, the framework integrates a
   comprehensive assessment of biodiversity (including functional
   biodiversity), ecosystem functions, and both ES supply and demand, to
   assure a sound knowledge basis for GI planning. Specifically, we aimed
   at: (1) identifying the quantitative relationships and spatial patterns
   of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, ES supply and demand indicators;
   (2) assessing the mismatches between biodiversity, ES supply and demand
   and (3) prioritizing key areas for GI planning which respond to various
   conservation objectives and human demands. Our study underscores the
   crucial importance of peri-urban green areas, including forests or crop
   areas, for the urban biodiversity, ecosystem functions and ES provision.
   We further observe an important mismatch between the supply and demand
   of ES at landscape scale. In general, peri-urban forests provide a broad
   diversity of ES; heavy urbanized areas, including the city of Barcelona
   and its metropolitan area, as well as areas along the coast concentrate
   the highest ES demands, while areas combining high ES supply and demand
   are especially found in the urban-rural fringes. Our study revealed that
   the urban fringes should be critically focused on when integrating both
   ES and biodiversity indicators into green infrastructure planning at
   landscape scale. Our approach has been successfully implemented into
   landscape planning in the Province of Barcelona, reconciling both
   biodiversity conservation and ES enhancement in practical GI planning.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article contributes to work within extinction studies by asking how
   one might ``story{''} extinctions of creatures that have been, and will
   remain, unknown. It grapples with losses that have been unrecorded,
   unmissed, and unrecognizable via the ``lively ethography{''} approach to
   storying extinction. This approach, developed by Deborah Bird Rose and
   Thom van Dooren, seeks to draw readers into imaginative encounters with
   embodied, specific, and lively creatures to support situated ethical
   responses. While at first this approach might seem antithetical to
   exploring unknown extinctions, this article argues that it can provide
   an important stimulus for developing a situated approach to losses that
   are often thought of in terms of undifferentiated masses. The article's
   focus is on the recently discovered ecosystems of creatures that live on
   the remnants of dead whales on the sea floor, which are known as ``whale
   falls.{''} It reads these ecosystems via a notion of ``suspended
   ground,{''} which brings together philosopher Mick Smith's rethinking of
   an ethics of encounter with unknown soil extinctions and Stacy Alaimo's
   concept of ``suspension.{''} The article argues that engaging with
   ethographic writing from this perspective enables one to weave a more
   explicit account of the mysterious and the unknown into the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Indian women with an
   annual mortality of around 87,000. Treatment for breast carcinoma may
   lead to swelling of the ipsilateral arm, shoulder stiffness, arm pain,
   and cancer-related fatigue. Very few centers in India have reported the
   arm and shoulder morbidity treated in their hospitals. Aims: The aim was
   to evaluate the predictive factors of arm and shoulder morbidity and
   fatigue among breast cancer survivors. Settings and Design: This was a
   retrospective analysis based on a prospectively maintained database.
   Materials and Methods: Early and locally advanced cases of breast cancer
   patients were screened for the study during 2015-2018. Eligible
   participants were invited to fill up the predetermined questionnaire,
   and their demographic and treatment-related information was accrued from
   a file archive. Follow-up period was estimated from the date of tissue
   diagnosis to last contact/time of interview. Results: Shoulder stiffness
   was the most common complaint followed by arm numbness. Obesity and
   diabetes played a crucial role in most of the morbidities and fatigue.
   The median fatigue score was 34, and the median time of appearance of
   lymphedema was 13 months. Modified radical mastectomy and radiotherapy
   to axilla were statistically significantly (P = 0.04 and 0.01,
   respectively) associated with greater shoulder stiffness and arm
   swelling. Conclusions: Obesity, diabetes, type of surgery, the extent of
   axillary dissection, and radiation plan are the major predictive factors
   of arm and shoulder morbidity. Further prospective validation is
   necessary for future breast cancer survivorship programs.}},

Abstract = {{Computational scientists have investigated swimming performance across a
   multitude of different systems for decades. Most models depend on
   numerous model input parameters and performance is sensitive to those
   parameters. In this article, parameter subspaces are qualitatively
   identified in which there exists enhanced swimming performance for an
   idealized, simple swimming model that resembles a Caenorhabditis
   elegans, an organism that exhibits an anguilliform mode of locomotion.
   The computational model uses the immersed boundary method to solve the
   fluid-interaction system. The 1D swimmer propagates itself forward by
   dynamically changing its preferred body curvature. Observations indicate
   that the swimmer's performance appears more sensitive to fluid scale and
   stroke frequency, rather than variations in the velocity and
   acceleration of either its upstroke or downstroke as a whole.
   Pareto-like optimal fronts were also identified within the data for the
   cost of transport and swimming speed. While this methodology allows one
   to locate robust parameter subspaces for desired performance in a
   straight-forward manner, it comes at the cost of simulating orders of
   magnitude more simulations than traditional fluid-structure interaction
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Successful OR management will be based on an efficiency-oriented
   organisation of processes surrounding medical procedures, together with
   a robust reporting system for the OR. Both these conditions require the
   use of key performance indicators.
   A first uniform definition of procedural times and key performance
   indicators in relation to OR processes was agreed upon and published by
   the Professional Association of German Anaesthesiologists (BDA), the
   Professional Association of German Surgeons (BDC) and the Professional
   Association of OR management (VOPM) in 2008 {[}1].
   The update published in 2016 {[}2] and this publication from 2020
   represent evolutionary steps in the development of the glossary, taking
   into account the increasing complexity and requirements of contemporary
   OR management. In doing so, the glossary was fundamentally revised with
   updated definitions based on the current state of knowledge and
   supplemented with additional relevant content.
   This new 2020 edition includes significant changes and additions such as
   an updated definition of certain procedural times, especially in
   relation to Anaesthesia Ready and Turnover Time OR-Staff (incl. A6, A7,
   O2, K7, K15a),
   more precise definitions of metrics relating to capacity (incl. S2 and
   K18) with the addition of a definition of Core Resource Time (K18a),
   a revision of the surgical priority classification,
   a new section on classification of caesarean section based on urgency
   with regard to OR management in accordance with the C-section
   classification in the June 2020 S3-Guidelines on Caesarean Section
   published by the German-language Societies of Obstetrics and
   Gynaecology, and
   a newly introduced conceptual differentiation of terms central to OR
   management, specifically procedure, operation, session and case.
   The aim of this continuous evolution is to provide valid universal
   definitions of perioperative performance metrics suited to the current
   state of OR operation; the intent is that these be used by those
   involved in OR processes - focusing on OR managers but also on hospital
   executives - as guidance in the selection, use, interpretation and
   reporting of suitable OR performance metrics. Furthermore, they
   represent the foundation of robust benchmarking which cannot otherwise,
   without precise and universal definitions of procedural times and key
   performance indicators, provide valid results. This updated 2020 edition
   of the glossary is the first to be adopted by the respective German,
   Swiss and Austrian bodies and has as such attained validity across the
   whole German-speaking region. Amongst other things, this achievement
   provides for process analyses across borders and healthcare systems.}},

Title = {{Time-dependent effects of platelet-rich plasma on the memory and
   hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment in vascular dementia induced
   by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{299-306}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate the effects of early and late
   administration of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on learning-memory and
   hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment in rat model of vascular
   dementia. Sprague-Dawley rats (6-7 weeks) were randomly divided into
   control, sham, 2VO + V (bilateral carotid vessel occlusion + vehicle),
   2VO + E-PRP (early after 2VO), and 2VO + L-PRP (late after 2VO) groups.
   The injection of PRP started immediately or on the day 20 after 2VO in
   2VO + E-PRP and 2VO + L-PRP, respectively, and continued until 28th day
   (two-time a week).
   The passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests were used for
   evaluation of fear and spatial memory formation. The in-vivo long-term
   potentiation (LTP) was evaluated by field-potential recording,
   paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and input-output (I/O) curve which were
   monitored as indexes for evaluation of short-term plasticity (STP) and
   basal-synaptic transmission (BST), respectively.
   The 2VO decreased PPR at inter-stimuli interval (ISI) 10 ms and BST, but
   injection of PRP in both treated groups rescued the PPR and BST
   depression. In addition, the induction of LTP, fear and spatial memory
   performance decreased in the 2VO + V group. However, early treatment,
   but not late, recovered LTP and memory.
   The PPR and BST improved with early and late treatment; therefore, the
   number and time of injection seem to be not important for recovery of
   BST. However, we found that LTP and memory loss rescued only with early
   administration. Hence, timely injection, before development of the
   disease, or number of injections could be critical.}},

Abstract = {{Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) is a medicinal and aromatic plant whose
   essential oil and fatty acid composition may be affected by drought
   stress. The present study was conducted in Isfahan, Iran during 2017 and
   2018 growing seasons to investigate the effects of three irrigation
   regimes (I-1, 40 \%; 12, 60 \%; and 13, 80 \% soil permissible moisture
   depletion representing normal, moderate, and severe stress levels,
   respectively) on the seed yield, essential oil percentage, and fatty
   acid composition of ten black cumin genotypes (namely, `Arak',
   `Isfahan', `Semirom', `Shahreza', `ShahrKord', `Mashhad', `Afghanistan',
   `Pakistan', `India', and `Syria'). Drought was found to decrease seed
   yield, essential oil yield, oil content, and oil yield of the genotypes
   but enhanced their essential oil percentage. However, the effects were
   depend on drought-level and genotype, `Mashhad' under `Arak' under I-2,
   and `Semirom' under I-3 had the highest seed yield while `Shahrekord'
   produced the greatest essential oil yields under all the irrigation
   regimes. Moreover, `Mashhad' under I-1, `Arak' under I-2, and
   `Shahrekord' under I-3 recorded the highest oil yields. Linoleic (46.43
   \%), oleic (24.40 \%), and palmitic (15.04 \%) acids were found to be
   the main fatty acids produced by the species. Saturated and
   polyunsaturated fatty acid proportions increased while those of
   monounsaturated fatty acids decreased with increasing drought level but
   the polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited far greater increases than did
   the saturated ones. Overall, results indicated that black cumin
   genotypes were both qualitatively and quantitatively affected by drought
   level; hence, proper irrigation regimes might be used to optimise fatty
   acid compositions in the selected genotypes.}},

Title = {{Pharmacy Student Perceptions and Preferences of In-person Versus

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine pharmacy students' preferences for and
   perceptions of in-person and video evaluations.
   Methods. A mixed methods survey was administered to 447 first-, second-,
   and third-year students enrolled in a public US Doctor of Pharmacy
   program. A survey instrument with 14 quantitative items and four
   qualitative items was used to measure student perceptions. Eight
   response choice items measured preferences. Paired t tests were used to
   compare students' perceptions. Independent t tests were used to compare
   perceptions between students who experienced and had not experienced
   video evaluations. Two researchers performed thematic content analysis
   of the qualitative responses.
   Results. Students (n5444, 99.3\% response rate) perceived in-person
   evaluations more positively for all items except nervousness. Students
   who experienced video technology felt significantly more positive about
   video evaluations than students who had little or no experience using
   video technology on nine items. The students who experienced video
   technology felt significantly less positive toward video evaluations in
   terms of quality (1.24 vs. 0.83) and amount (1.14 vs 0.77) of written
   feedback. Although students valued the interaction with a larger, more
   diverse pool of evaluators that was made possible by video evaluations,
   they did not view video technology as applicable to their future
   practice.
   Conclusion. Students viewed in-person evaluations significantly more
   positively than video evaluations. This effect was mitigated by greater
   exposure to video technology, suggesting that concerns regarding video
   evaluations are based on conjecture rather than experience. This study
   highlights the need to reduce the technological issues associated with
   video evaluations and improve the written feedback provided to students.}},

Abstract = {{Let B(X) denote the Banach algebra of bounded operators onX, whereXis
   either Tsirelson's Banach space or the Schreier space of ordernfor some
   n is an element of N. We show that the lattice of closed ideals of B(X)
   has a very rich structure; in particular B(X) contains at least
   continuum many maximal ideals.
   Our approach is to study the closed ideals generated by the basis
   projections. Indeed, the unit vector basis is an unconditional basis for
   each of the above spaces, so there is abasis projection P-N is an
   element of B(X) corresponding to each nonempty subsetNofN. A closed
   ideal of B(X) is spatialif it is generated by P-N for some N. We can now
   state our main conclusions as follows: of spatial ideals, boolean OR
   Gamma(L)is a closed ideal that is not spatial, and
   the family of spatial ideals lying strictly between the ideal of compact
   operators and B(X) is non-empty and has no minimal or maximal elements;
   for each pair I not subset of Jof spatial ideals, there is a family
   \{Gamma(L): L is an element of Delta\}, where the index set Delta has
   the cardinality of the continuum, such that Gamma(L) is an uncountable
   chain

   whenever L, M is an element of Delta are distinct and L is an element of

Title = {{Void growth dependence on loading path and mean stress from large-scale
   numerical simulations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation of a large population of voids nucleated
   from randomly distributed spherical particles is used to assess the load
   path and mean stress dependence of void growth. The voids are formed by
   particle failure, and they grow by expansion of the void surfaces
   through the arbitrary Lagrange/Eulerian mesh. Boundary conditions
   simulating uniaxial extension and simple shear with varying levels of
   imposed volume strain provide a range of stress triaxialities and
   distinct load paths. Volume averages of the void fraction and the mean
   and effective stresses are extracted from the simulation as measures of
   the state and loading during dilatational plastic flow.
   Comparison of the numerical results with the Gurson model shows that the
   mean stress dependence on the volume fraction follows the Gurson model
   relatively well at high stress triaxialities but deviates substantially
   at low triaxialities. Conversely, the effective stress from the Gurson
   model agrees with the numerical results reasonably well at low stress
   triaxiality but it deviates appreciably at high stress triaxialities.
   The results from the simple shear loading are in closer agreement with
   the Gurson model than the extension results, suggesting load path
   dependence.}},

Title = {{Differentiating between Nitrogen and Water Deficiency in Irrigated Maize
   Using a UAV-Based Multi-Spectral Camera}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to determine if canopy reflectance
   measured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a 5-band
   multi-spectral camera can differentiate between water and nitrogen (N)
   deficiency in irrigated maize. Crop reflectance was used to generate a
   Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), Green Leaf Index (GLI), and a
   Blue Reflectance Index (BRI). These indices were then used in
   combination to categorize N and water stressed experimental units into a
   Combined Index (CI) indicating water-stressed, N-stressed, or
   non-stressed crops. The CI generated at blister (R2) successfully
   identified 90\% of experimental treatments to the correct group but only
   identified 60\% of treatments when generated at the 14th leaf stage
   (V14). The CI methodology was subsequently applied to two independent
   site-years where only N deficiency gradients were imposed. The CI was
   not successful at separating treatments at the validation sites,
   incorrectly identifying water stress where there was none. Among
   individual indices investigated, NDRE had the strongest relationship to
   grain yields (r(2) = 0.62, p < 0.001) but a weaker linear relationship
   compared to the CI (r(2) = 0.68, p < 0.005) where deficit irrigation
   treatments were imposed. At sites where irrigation was sufficient to
   meet crop water demand, NDRE (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.05) had a stronger
   relationship to grain yield compared to the CI (r(2) = 0.41, p = 0.31).
   This study found that, under narrow cropping system circumstances, N and
   irrigation-induced differences in maize productivity can be
   differentiated in-season by a combination of reflectance indices, but
   that NDRE alone provides superior information under broader contexts.}},

Abstract = {{A woman's body undergoes a myriad of changes throughout the course of a
   normal gestation. The kidneys play a central role in driving adjustments
   that guarantee maternal and fetal well-being, including a dramatic
   increase in glomerular filtration rate, alterations in tubular function,
   and changes in electrolyte and acid/base handling. Early in gestation,
   systemic vasodilation, driven by both a change in quantity of and
   response to various hormones, leads to increased renal blood flow and
   glomerular filtration rate. Vasodilation also results in activation of
   the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which combined with changing
   tubular handling causes alterations in total body stores of electrolytes
   and total body water, resulting in a lower serum sodium concentration.
   In addition, mild proteinuria, glucosuria, and a decrease in serum
   calcium and magnesium are common. The primary acid/base change seen in
   pregnancy is a mild respiratory alkalosis due to progesterone effects.
   This article provides an overview of the current understanding of the
   healthy response of the kidneys to pregnancy, an understanding of which
   is key to caring for the pregnant patient, and early identification of
   alterations that may indicate underlying kidney pathology in pregnancy.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effect of ionic liquids (ILs) confinement in the nanoporosity of
   carbons on their low temperature transitions has been studied by
   differential scanning calorimetry. The ILs consisted of the {[}EMIm(+)]
   cation and {[}FSI-], {[}TESI-] or {[}BF4-] anions. The carbons were
   strictly microporous (Maxsorb) and mesoporous with a small amount of
   micropores, i.e. a MgO templated carbon TC-1 (L-meso = 3.4 nm), a silica
   templated carbon TC-2 (L-meso = 8.7 nm), and a high surface area carbon
   black SC2A (L-meso = 9.6 nm). All ILs encapsulated in the microporous
   Maxsorb demonstrated ``flat{''} low temperature thermograms typical of
   an adsorbed state. In the narrow mesopores of TC-1, the interactions
   between the ions and the pore walls constrained the molecular motions,
   leading to a glass transition upon heating. The three confined ILs in
   SC2A displayed a melting peak at lower temperature (Delta T-m similar to
   -30 degrees C) than their neat counterpart. The Delta T-m shift was
   comparable for TC-2 soaked with {[}EMIm(+)] {[}FSI-], whereas only a
   glass transition was given by {[}EMIm(+)] {[}TESL-]and {[}EMIm(+)]
   {[}BF4-] confined in this carbon. Overall, the work shows that the
   liquid state of ILs can be extended to lower temperatures by their
   confinement in carbons possessing relatively wide mesopores. (C) 2020

   Monetary assessment of the social value created for the Spanish economy}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The role of the Social Economy (SE) in society is increasingly
   acknowledged by social agents and institutions, especially in the
   context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Commitment to SE
   requires the support of quantitative measurement of its contribution to
   society from an aggregate perspective. The difficulty in specifying it
   in quantitative terms is related to the assessment of the contribution
   of SE's differentiating and intrinsic values. These values contribute to
   the fight against some structural problems that persist in modern
   society in terms of unemployment, inequality, territorial imbalance,
   environmental problems and social exclusion that surpass the economic
   sphere and involve the contribution to social goals, social utility and
   social and territorial cohesion. Our objective is an assessment in
   quantitative terms, including an estimation, in monetary terms, of the
   specific contribution of Social Market Economy (SMkE) firms to society
   linked to their distinctive principles, and thus their behaviour, in
   comparison to traditional profit-oriented firms, used as a control
   group. We use impact analysis techniques, with a simulation exercise, by
   which SMkE entities lose{''} their identity and behave like
   profit-oriented firms. The results obtained for Spain confirm the
   existence of differential behaviour that generates social value in
   several ways. In monetary terms, in 2017, SMkEs contributed 6,229
   million Euros in benefits to Spanish society that would have been lost
   if SMkE entities had behaved like profit-oriented firms.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Diabetic foot ulcer is the main aetiology for
   non-traumatic amputation, which is a major public health care concern. A
   multidisciplinary approach in the management of this pathology has been
   shown to improve the surgical outcome. However, there are little data
   available on the tools we can use to pursue this multidisciplinary
   approach. The main goal of this cross-sectional study was to find out
   whether the implementation of a specific management pathway could
   improve the treatment outcome in the treatment of diabetic foot.
   Materials and Methods: From 2012 to 2014, we consecutively recruited
   patients with diabetic foot referred to Orthopaedic surgery department
   of our university for surgical opinion. A specific diabetic foot pathway
   was introduced in 2013. One group of patients who were treated with
   previous method were evaluated retrospectively. Another group of
   patients who were treated after implementation of the pathway were
   evaluated prospectively. We compared treatment outcome between the two
   groups.
   Results: We included 51 patients. Amputation rate was similar both the
   groups: 74\% in the retrospective group not using the new pathway versus
   73\% in a prospective group that used the new pathway. Revision surgery
   was 39\% in the retrospective group and 14\% in the prospective group
   (p=0.05).
   Conclusion: We recommend the use of this simple and cost-effective
   pathway to guide the interdisciplinary management of diabetic foot. A
   prospective study with more subjects would provide a better overview of
   this management pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of lead-free solder joints often consists of only one

   grains on the stress state of a BGA component. Different combinations of
   solder joint grain orientations are studied through thermo-mechanical
   simulations in order to assess the stress state of each joint. A
   significant effect of neighbouring joints has been observed for the

Abstract = {{Hexanchus nakamurai is a deep-water species, with very little scientific
   information. This study confirms the distribution of the species in the
   most eastern region of the Mediterranean Sea, Levantine Sea, in addition
   to providing some biological information from four pregnant individuals,
   which is being reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. A
   total of four individuals were bycaught, in two sets on opposite coasts,
   three on the 13th of May 2020 from the western coast, and an individual
   on the 14th June 2020 from east coast of the island of Cyprus. The four
   specimens, all pregnant females, measured between 107 and 116 cm in
   total length and between 4,330 and 4,960 g in weight. All specimens were
   in early pregnancy according to the level of embryo development, which
   confirms that the size at maturity is smaller than previously reported.
   In the stomachs, remains of the hake Merluccius merluccius, the
   cephalopod Loligo vulgaris and two unidentified species of Hirudinea
   (Annelida) were found. This study provides important new information on
   the Mediterranean distribution of a globally rare and data deficient
   species, including an expansion of its known range, dietary preferences
   and insights of its reproduction biology; the first pregnant females
   reported in the Mediterranean Sea.}},

Title = {{Assessing the learning capacity of water users - Adoption a social
   learning framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive water governance systems are underpinned by enhanced social
   learning capacity of the society of actors to understand and adapt to
   changes properly. Thus, as a first step, it is crucial to assess the
   learning capacity of water actors in different levels, as human
   components of a socio-ecological system (SES), to know how to improve
   the water resources system adaptive capacity. Aiming at practicing
   assessment of learning capacity in a society of water actors, the
   present paper focuses on local water users, one the society of farmers
   using the groundwater resource in Rafsanjan Plain and the other one the
   society of farmers in Lakes Tashk-Bakhtegan Basin, both situated in the
   southern Iran. A methodological framework was developed and adopted to
   assess the learning capacity of water users corresponding to both the
   process of learning (represented by social justice, perception of
   interdependency, mutual trust, and interaction among all stakeholders)
   and the learning outcomes (including width, direction, depth and
   orientation of learning). The required data were collected using
   semi-structured interviews. The results showed how the responses of the
   local water users are affected by the mechanisms which are rooted in the
   social memory, technology, path dependency, and the degree of access to
   water. Although most of the researchers have addressed the social
   learning to have positive and constructive outcomes, the results of this
   research revealed the process of social learning resulted in neutral and
   destructive outcomes among water users in the study areas. Assessment of
   learning capacity in the water associated societies, using the
   methodological framework developed in this research, can help set off
   removing learning barriers and enhancing the socio-ecological system
   adaptive capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANET) allow communications between vehicles
   using their own connection infrastructure. There are several advantages
   and applications in using this technology and one of most significant is
   road safety. As in most other networks, it is not only important to
   guarantee the transport but also the security of information. Security
   in VANET is a big challenge because there are different types of attacks
   that endanger communications of moving vehicles. This paper proposes an
   applied Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to obtain a
   prediction model of security index in VANET. The research process starts
   with network simulations to obtain a database of occurrences of attacks.
   Then, this latter is prepared and analyzed statistically. Finally, using
   MATLAB toolbox, we show the proposed model of security level that allows
   estimating the network vulnerability in the event of an attack.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Antidepressant trials are criticized due to potential
   methodological flaws. Root causes of failing methodology can be found in
   insufficient inter-rater reliability (IRR) and training practices,
   leading to higher placebo response and reduced study-power. However, it
   is unknown to what extent reliability estimates or training procedures
   are currently included in antidepressant reports. Therefore, we aimed to
   determine the proportion of publications concerning double-blind
   randomized controlled antidepressant trials that report on IRR
   coefficients and training procedures.
   Methods: We extracted all double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
   from the meta-analysis of Cipriani et al. (2018) concerning the period
   from 2000 until January 2016. Further, we conducted a Medline-search for
   double-blind RCTs from January 2016 until January 2020 for additional
   reports. We identified IRR coefficients and training procedures in these
   publications.
   Results: In total we identified 179 double-blind RCTs. Only 4.5\%
   reported an IRR coefficient whereas 27.9\% reported training procedures.
   Limitations: We did not contact individual authors for additional
   information regarding implementation of training procedures or
   inter-rater reliability assessment.
   Conclusions: There is a substantial lack of reporting IRR coefficients
   and training procedures in RCTs with antidepressant medication.
   Considering the large implications of insufficient reliability, we urge
   researchers to conduct and report training procedures and reliability
   estimations.}},

   findings from a statewide survey of domestic violence agencies}},
Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Each year, more than 6\% of all U.S. children are exposed to
   domestic violence and require intervention services from agencies that
   serve affected families. Previous research has examined detrimental
   biopsychosocial consequences of domestic violence exposure during
   childhood and the importance of effective prevention and intervention
   services for this population. However, less research has explored
   diverse intervention professionals' own perspectives on the needs of the
   domestic violence-exposed children they serve.
   Method: This study employed an inductive approach to thematic analysis
   to investigate intervention professionals' reflections and advice
   regarding the service, policy, and research needs as well as overall
   strategies to better protect children exposed to domestic violence.
   Results: Respondents articulated four primary themes of (a) building
   general education and awareness of the effects of domestic violence
   exposure on children; (b) the need for trauma-informed care; (c) the
   salience of cultural humility in serving affected families; and (d)
   essential collaboration across service domains. Respondents discussed
   these themes in the context of four key systems of care: the clinical or
   therapy, family, school, and judicial systems.
   Conclusions: Future research should integrate the voices of affected
   children and families as well as examine models for effectively
   implementing these recommendations into practice settings.}},

Title = {{Cannabinoidomics - An analytical approach to understand the effect of
   medical Cannabis treatment on the endocannabinoid metabolome}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{219}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Increasing evidence for the therapeutic potential of Cannabis in
   numerous pathological and physiological conditions has led to a surge of
   studies investigating the active compounds in different chemovars and
   their mechanisms of action, as well as their efficacy and safety. The
   biological effects of Cannabis have been attributed to phytocannabinoid
   modulation of the endocannabinoid system. In-vitro and in-vivo studies
   have shown that pure phytocannabinoids can alter the levels of
   endocannabinoids and other cannabimimetic lipids. However, it is not yet
   understood whether whole Cannabis extracts exert variable effects on the
   endocannabinoid metabolome, and whether these effects vary between
   tissues. To address these challenges, we have developed and validated a
   novel analytical approach, termed ``cannabinoidomics,{''} for the
   simultaneous extraction and analysis of both endogenous and plant
   cannabinoids from different biological matrices. In the methodological
   development liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC/HRMS/MS) was used to identify 57 phytocannabinoids, 15
   major phytocannabinoid metabolites, and 78 endocannabinoids and
   cannabimimetic lipids in different biological matrices, most of which
   have no analytical standards. In the validation process, spiked
   cannabinoids were quantified with acceptable selectivity, repeatability,
   reproducibility, sensitivity, and accuracy. The power of this analytical
   method is demonstrated by analysis of serum and four different sections
   of mouse brains challenged with three different cannabidiol (CBD)-rich
   extracts. The results demonstrate that variations in the minor
   phytocannabinoid contents of the different extracts may lead to varied
   effects on endocannabinoid concentrations, and on the CBD metabolite
   profile in the peripheral and central systems. We also show that the
   Cannabis challenge significantly decreases the levels of several
   endocannabinoids in specific brain sections compared to the control
   group. This effect is extract-specific and suggests the importance of
   minor, other-than CBD, phytocannabinoid or non-phytocannabinoid
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{A recent analytical model based on refinement of the Variable Angle
   Truss Model (VATM) and called Generalized Softened Variable Angle
   Truss-Model (GSVATM) was proposed in previous articles to predict the
   full response of reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete (PC)
   beams (solid and hollow) under torsion. The GSVATM is reformulated here
   in a unified form and used to illustrate some calculation examples
   related to RC and PC beams under torsion. It is shown that the unified
   GSVATM can provide reliable information about the effective torsional
   response of the analyzed beams; namely the torque, twist, torsional
   stiffness, and stress or strain in the materials for all loading stages,
   as well as information on the failure type of the beam. The model is not
   difficult to implement in a computer and can be used as a reliable
   analytical tool to help engineers optimize some aspects of the torsional
   design of structural concrete beams.}},

Title = {{Personality traits modulate stress responses after enclosure change of
   captive capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus)}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{232}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Husbandry procedures may cause behavioral and physiological changes to
   animals living in captivity. However, an individual's reaction is not
   uniform and may be related to different coping strategies. In this
   study, we analyzed whether and how 12 adult captive capuchin monkeys
   (Sapajus libidinosus) varying in four personality axes ('Feeding',
   `Sociability', `Exploration', and `Activity') differed in their stress
   responses to an enclosure change. Behavioral data and fecal samples of
   the individuals were collected for two months before (97 h and 246 fecal
   samples) and 14 days after the enclosure change (52 h and 666 fecal
   samples). We used Akaike Information Criteria to select the best linear
   regression models having personality axes and the period after enclosure
   change as predictive factors and behaviors potentially indicative of
   stress (BPIS) and levels of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) as
   the response variables. Best models indicate that specific personality
   axes acted as a buffer and improved individual stress coping, mainly at
   the physiological level. More sociable and more active individuals did
   not show the peak of FGM levels as that exhibited by their less sociable
   and less active counterparts on the first day of the enclosure change.
   The link between exploration and resilience to acute stress was less
   clear: more exploratory individuals showed an increase in FGM levels
   during the first week of enclosure change, while the less exploratory
   ones showed a later increase, during the second-week post-enclosure
   change, suggesting a lesser capacity to recover from stressful stimuli
   in these individuals. The results presented in this study build on
   growing literature showing that animals differ in their behavioral
   profiles and that these differences relate to resilience to
   environmental disturbances, which may impact individual survival and
   reproduction, resulting in less genetic diversity of captive colonies
   and increased issues related to research replicability. We argue that
   these interindividual differences must be considered in husbandry
   decisions and during research data collection for the sake of animal
   welfare and reliable science.}},

Title = {{Distribution, abundance and ecological requirements of the benthic phase
   of Munida gregaria (Anomura; Munididae) in the Puyuhuapi Fjord (Chilean
   Patagonia)}},
Journal = {{REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The squat lobster Munida gregaria is considered a key species within
   food webs of sub-Antarctic ecosystems of South America, and represents a
   fundamental link between detritus and higher-level predators. Although
   ecological aspects of its lengthy pelagic phase have been well
   described, those of the benthic stage remain poorly understood,
   particularly in Chilean Patagonia where information on the presence of
   benthic phases of M. gregaria has been scarce. The present paper aims to
   improve our knowledge of this important species, analysing benthic
   distribution, abundance and ecological requirements of the benthic phase
   of M. gregaria in the Puyuhuapi and Jacaf fjords in the Aysen Region of
   Chilean Patagonia. An extensive SCUBA diving survey, carried out between
   2014 and 2019, allowed us to explore and document the soft seafloors
   inside these fjords. These benthic surveys conducted photographic
   transects between depths of 5 and 20 m to enumerate populations of M.
   gregaria and to measure sizes of individuals. The study revealed the
   presence of large aggregations of M. gregaria, with densities up to 4
   times higher than previously reported maxima for South America. Munida
   gregaria appeared to be unable to live at the shallow depths of the
   brackish surface layer typical of fjords, though paradoxically, its
   presence on the seabed was linked to river outflow, and probably related
   to supply of organic matter. Chilean fjords are currently facing a
   number of challenges, particularly from climate change and other more
   direct anthropogenic impacts, and the key role of M. gregaria in these
   fjords should be considered in future monitoring activities. More
   particularly, the extremely high abundance of M. gregaria in Puyuhuapi
   Fjord should be considered in any rigorous protection measures planned
   for the fjord. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of exercise
   order on volume load (VL) and myoelectric activation (EMG) during the
   bench press (BP), military press (MP) and close-grip bench press (CGBP)
   exercises executed with a barbell and Smith machine. Twelve men
   experienced in resistance training performed four different exercise
   sessions in randomised order. Each session consisted of four sets of a
   given exercise order: O1 = CGBP + MP + BP with barbell; O2 = inverse O1
   with barbell, O3 = same O1 with Smith Machine; O4 = same O2 with Smith
   machine. EMG was assessed for the Clavicular headpectoralis major(PMC),
   anteriordeltoid(AD),triceps brachiilong head (TBLH) andbiceps
   brachii(BB). Results showed that VL in BP was affected by exercise
   order, independent of the mode (p < 0.05). However, the CGBP showed
   higher VL in O1. Moreover, when the BP was positioned last in the
   sequence (O1 and O3), myoelectric activity was higher for PMC, AD and
   TBLH (p < 0.05). Findings were similar in the CGBP (PMC and TBLH), but
   for the AD (Smith machine > barbell,p < 0.05). Therefore, it appears
   that the order and modes of exercises influence both volume load and
   myoelectric activation patterns during multiple set of resistance
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite and Cobalt Ferrite with
   different weight percentages were prepared using the sol-gel method and
   sintered at 950 degrees C. Presence of constituent phases of La-0.67
   Sr(0.33)MnO(3 )( )and CoFe2O4 peaks were confirmed from X-ray
   diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies.
   Hysteresis behaviour shows room ferromagnetism for the composite samples
   and their variation in saturation magnetization can be understood on the
   basis of competing effects between both the magnetic phases. Enhancement
   of squareness ratio and coercivity indicate the strengthening of
   exchange-coupling interaction due to closer proximity of hard and soft
   phases. Metallic state vanishes and resistivity increases with the
   incorporation of cobalt ferrite into lanthanum strontium matrix. An
   enhanced magnetoresistance in a wide temperature range is observed for
   25\% cobalt ferrite added sample and is ascribed to spin-polarized
   tunneling mechanism. Adiabatic small polaron hopping mechanism is used
   to explain the resistivity of the composites in the high temperature
   region.}},

Title = {{Multi-Label classification of multi-modality skin lesion via
   hyper-connected convolutional neural network}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Clinical and dermoscopy images (multi-modality image pairs)
   are routinely used sequentially in the assessment of skin lesions.
   Clinical images characterize a lesion's geometry and color; dermoscopy
   depicts vascularity, dots and globules from the sub-surface of the
   lesion. Together these modalities provide labels to characterize a skin
   lesion. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to the
   ability to learn low-level features and high-level semantic information
   in an end-to-end architecture, have been shown to be the
   state-of-the-art in skin lesion classification. Most of the CNN methods
   have relied on dermoscopy alone. In the few published papers that
   support multi-modalities, the methods are based on `late-fusion' to
   integrate extracted clinical and dermoscopy image features separately.
   These late-fusion methods tend to ignore the accessible complementary
   image features between the paired images at the early stage of the CNN
   architecture.
   Methods: We propose a hyper-connected CNN (HcCNN) to classify skin
   lesions. Compared to existing multi-modality CNNs, our HcCNN has an
   additional hyper-branch that integrates intermediary image features in a
   hierarchical manner. The hyper-branch enables the network to learn more
   complex combinations between the images at all, early and late, stages
   of the network. We also coupled the HcCNN with a multi-scale attention
   block (MsA) to prioritize semantically important subtle regions in the
   two modalities across various image scales.
   Results: Our HcCNN achieved an average accuracy of 74.9\% for
   multi-label classification on the 7-point Checklist dataset, which is a
   well-benchmarked public dataset. Conclusions: Our method is more
   accurate than the state-of-the-art methods and, in particular, our
   method achieved consistent and the best results in datasets with
   imbalanced label distributions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the TLR-NF-kappa B/AP-1 pathways in S. aureus
   infection-induced mammary gland fibrosis, mice were infected with S.
   aureus isolated from the mammary glands of cows with mastitis. Lactating
   mice were divided into three groups: control group (CON); PBS control
   group (PBS) and the S. aureus-treated group (S. aureus). Pathological
   observations revealed that neutrophil infiltration into mammary gland
   tissue was obviously induced by S. aureus at the early stage of
   infection (1-7 d). With persistent S. aureus infection, mammary gland
   fibrosis developed and was characterized by infiltration and
   proliferation of macrophage, lymphocyte and fibroblast and ECM
   hyperplasia (7-21 d). Immunohistochemistry staining showed upregulation
   of fibrosis associated cytokines viz bFGF and PDGF-BB. Real-time qPCR
   and Western blot analysis revealed that transcription and translation of
   TLR2, TLR4, bFGF, PDGF-BB, alpha-SMA and COL I alpha 1 was significantly
   upregulated by S. aureus. NF-kappa B p65 and AP-I c-jun were
   translocated into the nucleus after S. aureus infection. There was no
   remarkable difference between the CON and PBS groups. The datas indicate
   that mammary gland fibrosis in mice is induced by S. aureus , which
   promotes cytokine release and the expression of ECM though activating
   the TLR/NF-kappa B p65 and TLR/AP-1 c-jun signaling pathways.}},

Title = {{Persistence of a Yeast-Based (Hanseniaspora uvarum) Attract-and-Kill
   Formulation against Drosophila suzukii on Grape Leaves}},
Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest species that feeds on yeast-laden
   fruits and is attracted to fermentation products. In nature, numerous
   yeast species are associated with Drosophila suzukii. Yeasts constitute
   a food source and produce volatile compounds attractive to the fly. The
   production of attractants and chemical compounds that stimulate feeding
   by Drosophila suzukii make the use of yeasts promising for the
   development of attract-and-kill formulations. In the present work, the
   efficacy and the persistence over a one-week period of a yeast-based
   attract-and-kill formulation was evaluated treating grape plants in a
   greenhouse. The efficacy was assessed by measuring the survival and
   oviposition rate of Drosophila suzukii. The concentrations or
   presence/absence of potential feeding stimulants and attractants were
   assessed by quantitative measurement of carbohydrates, sugar alcohols,
   amino acids, and volatile compounds. Results show that the formulation
   was still effective and that some of the chemical compounds monitored
   were still present on the surface of treated leaves one week after
   treatment, though changes in the chemical profiles were observed over
   this period.
   The production of phagostimulant and attractive volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) by yeasts can be exploited to improve the efficacy of
   attract-and-kill formulations against the spotted wing drosophila (SWD).
   This study evaluated the persistence over one week of a yeast-based
   formulation under greenhouse conditions. Potted grape plants were
   treated with: (i) potato dextrose broth (PDB), (ii) PDB containing
   spinosad (PDB + S), and (iii) H. uvarum fermentation broth grown on PDB
   containing spinosad (H. u. + S). Laboratory trials were performed to
   determine the survival and the oviposition rate of SWD after exposure to
   treated leaves. Ion-exchange chromatography was performed to measure
   carbohydrates, sugar alcohols, and organic acids on leaf surfaces, while
   amino acids were assessed through liquid
   chromatography-mass-spectrometry. Additionally, the VOCs released by
   plants treated with H.uvarum were collected via closed-loop-stripping
   analysis and compared to those emitted by untreated leaves. A higher
   mortality was observed for adult SWDs in contact with H. uvarum
   containing spinosad compared to PDB containing spinosad. Generally, a
   decrease in the amounts of non-volatile compounds was observed over
   time, though numerous nutrients were still present one week after
   treatment. The application of the yeast-based formulation induced the
   emission of VOCs by the treated leaves. The concentration of
   2-phenylethanol, one of the main VOCs emitted by yeasts, decreased over
   time. These findings describe the presence of potential phagostimulants
   and compounds attractive to SWD in a yeast-based attract-and-kill
   formulation and demonstrate the efficacy of the formulation over one
   week.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activities (AA) of
   lyophilized rosemary extract and lyophilized sage extract, and their
   effects on the oxidative stability of poultry pate. For this purpose,
   four poultry pate formulations with rosemary, sage, sodium erythorbate
   and a control (without antioxidants) were produced. The rosemary and
   sage were characterized according to total phenolic compounds (TPC) and
   AA by several methods. The poultry pates stored at 4 degrees C were
   evaluated by the lipid oxidation. High concentrations of TPC were
   detected in the rosemary extract and sage extract (46.48 and 41.61 mg
   GAE/g (Gallic acid equivalent), respectively). The AA of the rosemary
   and sage extracts determined by free radical-scavenging were 4745.72 and
   2462.82 mu mol TE/g (Trolox equivalents), respectively. The high
   concentrations of catechin, rutin, myricetin and p-coumaric acids in
   these extracts may be responsible for the strong inhibitory action
   against food pathogens. Besides this, these compounds can be responsible
   for the best performance in inhibiting lipid oxidation in poultry pates
   during storage. This study suggests that rosemary and sage extracts may
   be used as a natural antioxidant in meat products.}},

Title = {{E-learning adoption: Does the instructional design model matter? An
   explanatory sequential study on midwifery schools in Uganda}},
Journal = {{E-LEARNING AND DIGITAL MEDIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{E-learning has become an integral part of mainstream society and hence
   revolutionizing distance education endeavours. A number of change agents
   and bureaucrats in Uganda have embraced this pedagogy constructing it as
   an alternative to the traditional brick and mortar educational systems,
   which have become difficult to develop and maintain. However, despite
   the high level of investment on e-learning programs, there is a slow
   adoption of this new pedagogy amongst students and faculty, and those
   who do start to use the system opt out later. This trend of slow
   adoption is likely to constrain government's efforts of improving the
   skill mix, competencies and numbers of midwives in the country. This
   research intended to ascertain whether instructional design was an
   influencer of e-learning adoption and profile the salient instructional
   design traits relevant to e-learning adoption in midwifery schools in
   Uganda. Ten schools were sampled with 224 participants. Data collection
   was conducted in two phases, the first entailed quantitative data
   collection and analysis to ascertain whether instructional design played
   a significant role in e-learning adoption and the second embraced a
   qualitative data collection and analysis to ascertain the salient traits
   of instructional design to be relied on by midwifery schools. Simple
   linear regression analysis established that instructional design had a
   significant influence on e-learning adoption with p value of (p=0.016),
   and it accounted for 38.7\% of the variance in e-learning adoption, with
   a moderate positive relationship and its key salient traits includes:
   choosing an appropriate instructional design model to guide the entire
   e-learning process, interactivity of e-learning materials, collaborative
   working in developing and updating e-learning materials, eliciting
   feedback on instructional materials, and engaging in more than one
   e-learning activity. Midwifery schools therefore have to focus on these
   six traits if they are to improve e-learning adoption.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{399-422}},

Abstract = {{The origins and focuses of adult education across Western countries are
   often about meeting adults' needs, and for purposes they have nominated,
   not those compelled by others. Unlike other sectors (e.g. schools,
   vocational colleges and universities) that were mainly initiated and
   sustained by church or state, adult education has long been grounded in
   communities and provided through hybrid institutions. Across Western
   countries, the term `movement,' is often associated with adult
   education's origins, and it is sometimes regarded as a `fourth sector'
   of education, apart from schools, vocational education and training and
   university studies. In recent times, the concept has expanded and
   diversified, however, making it more amorphous and less distinctive as
   an educational `sector'. Nevertheless, one of the continuing features of
   `adult education' has been its concern for adults' learning needs and
   preferences. This paper proposes that the formation and continuity of
   adult education have been based particularly on three key premises: i)
   meeting adults' specific but heterogeneous learning needs; ii)
   educational purposes and purposes being understood in the local context;
   and iii) the enactment of adult education being shaped by local
   considerations. Furthermore, the values underpinning `traditional' adult
   education have not only been sustained in what is now more commonly
   known as Adult and Community Education (ACE) but have expanded into
   other educational contexts. Informed by considerations of selected
   research projects the authors have been involved with in recent years,
   this paper identifies how the three premises have emerged as features of
   other educational provisions for adults.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) populations on the
   Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) provides information about the health
   of the species and the WAP marine ecosystem itself. In January 2017,
   surveys of Adelie penguin colonies at Avian Island and Torgersen Island
   off the WAP were conducted via unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS)
   collecting optical Red Green Blue (RGB), thermal, and multispectral
   imagery. A semi-automated workflow to count individual penguins using a
   fusion of multispectral and thermal imagery was developed and combined
   into an ArcGIS workflow. This workflow isolates colonies using
   multispectral imagery and detects and counts individuals by thermal
   signatures. Two analysts conducted manual counts from synoptic RGB UAS
   imagery. The automated system deviated from analyst counts by -3.96\% on
   Avian Island and by 17.83\% on Torgersen Island. However,
   colony-by-colony comparisons revealed that the greatest deviations
   occurred at larger colonies. Matched pairs analysis revealed no
   significant differences between automated and manual counts at both
   locations (p > 0.31) and linear regressions of colony sizes from both
   methods revealed significant positive relationships approaching unity (p
   < 0.0002. R-2 = 0.91). These results indicate that combining UAS surveys
   with sensor fusion techniques and semi-automated workflows provide
   efficient and accurate methods for monitoring seabird colonies in remote
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{A computationally efficient early warning technique is developed for
   forecasting flash floods during the pre-monsoon season that are
   associated with a complex topography and transboundary runoff in
   northeastern Bangladesh. Locally conditioned topographic and
   hydrometeorological observations are key forcings to the modeling system
   that simulate the hydrology and hydraulic processes. The hydrologic
   model is calibrated and validated using satellite-based observations to
   estimate the correct amount of transboundary and mountainous inflow into
   the flash flood-prone plains. Inflow is then forecasted using
   precipitation forecast from a global numerical weather prediction (NWP)
   system called the Global Forecasting System (GFS). The forecasted
   inflows serve as the upstream boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic
   model to forecast the water stage and inundation downstream in the
   floodplains. A real-time in-situ data-based error correction methodology
   is applied to maintain the skill of the system. The simulation grid size
   and time-step of the hydrodynamic model are also optimized for
   computational efficiency. Historical performance of the framework
   revealed at least 60\% accuracy at 5-day lead-time in delineating flood
   inundation when compared against Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) imagery. The study suggests that higher resolution topographic
   information and dynamically downscaled meteorological observations can
   lead to significant improvement in flash flood forecasting skills.}},

Abstract = {{Processing of aluminium and its alloy in an economical way is still a
   big challenge for the industry. In the present work, a novel continuous
   casting set-up has been designed and manufactured to introduce alloying
   elements, particulate reinforcement and grain refiners in any Al system
   by implementing mechanical force convection and bottom-feeding of
   elements or particles in liquid aluminium. The main objectives behind
   the design are to minimize capital cost, running cost, time, energy
   consumption and defects in the cast products. The present set-up does
   not lead to vortex formation during mixing to disperse the particles.
   Thus, there is less possibility of entrapment of gasses and hence
   subsequent formation of casting defects is comparatively fewer. A
   detailed study on the various temperature zones in the set-up has been
   accomplished using a data logger. The cast alloy, metal matrix composite
   and grain refiner added aluminium alloy were subjected to optical
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies.
   The results showed uniform distribution of reinforcement particles and
   alloying elements in metal matrix composite and commercial pure
   aluminium alloy, respectively. Grain refinement in aluminium alloy was
   also observed after the addition of grain refiner. A cost analysis study
   of the casted product showed that, the present proposed process is
   comparatively economical than the conventional available process. (C)

Abstract = {{E-health systems have witnessed widespread usage in the last few years,
   mainly due to advancements in health monitoring hardware and the
   availability of remote diagnostic services. Given the numerous benefits,
   there are two main challenges: management of the e-health ecosystem and
   security and privacy of sensitive data. The former results from
   nonunified, redundant, and often replicated information across numerous
   independent e-health service providers. While the later stems from
   sensitive information stored in centralized systems that can be
   compromised. Blockchain has emerged as a promising technology, which can
   be used to secure access and privacy of data and provide an umbrella
   management solution to large-scale distributed and decentralized
   enterprise systems. In this article, we present a unified system for
   migrating independent conventional e-health systems to a single
   blockchain-based ecosystem. More specifically, we address the issues of
   difference in data structures for conventional relational databases and
   blockchain file databases. The solution describes the conversion process
   and synchronization of information in a unified system for large-scale
   e-health data. The implementation and analysis show that significant
   improvements in data storage, access control, and seamless migration can

Abstract = {{Background: To use clinical and MRI radiomic features coupled with
   machine learning to assess HER2 expression level and predict pathologic
   response (pCR) in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients receiving
   neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
   Methods: This retrospective study included 311 patients. pCR was defined
   as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes
   (ypT0/isN0). Radiomics/statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB
   and CERR software. After ROC and correlation analysis, selected
   radiomics parameters were advanced to machine learning modelling
   alongside clinical MRI-based parameters (lesion type, multifocality,
   size, nodal status). For predicting pCR, the data was split into a
   training and test set (80:20).
   Findings: The overall pCR rate was 60.5\% (188/311). The final model to
   predict HER2 heterogeneity utilised three MRI parameters (two clinical,
   one radiomic) for a sensitivity of 99.3\% (277/279), specificity of
   81.3\% (26/32), and diagnostic accuracy of 97.4\% (303/311). The final
   model to predict pCR included six MRI parameters (two clinical, four
   radiomic) for a sensitivity of 86.5\% (32/37), specificity of 80.0\%
   (20/25), and diagnostic accuracy of 83.9\% (52/62) (test set); these
   results were independent of age and ER status, and outperformed the best
   model developed using clinical parameters only (p=0.029, comparison of
   proportion Chi-squared test).
   Interpretation: The machine learning models, including both clinical and
   radiomics MRI features, can be used to assess HER2 expression level and
   can predict pCR after NAC in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The production of alkali-activated materials and geopolymers from the
   finer fraction of tailings is being increasingly investigated, as they
   could be used for building and public works, or to retain heavy metals
   in a consolidated solid matrix. The present study proposes a
   Pitzer-based geochemical model to reproduce the alkaline leaching for
   two mine tailing samples and the polymerization reactions. The model
   fits the results of the leaching tests quite well over the reaction
   duration and up to NaOH 10 M and 60 degrees C. Discrepancy for the
   dissolved Mg concentration indicates that the database can handle ionic
   strength up to 5 mol.kg(-1). A geopolymer solid solution was developed
   for setting reactions modeling. The results compare favorably with
   compressive strength tests results, with C-S-H, M-S-H and geopolymers as
   the main hydration products. The study proposes an innovative
   application of Pitzer database developments with application to the
   mining industry.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Disparities in pancreatic cancer outcomes between black and
   white patients are well documented. This study aimed to use a more novel
   index to examine the impact of racial segregation on the diagnosis,
   management, and outcomes of pancreatic cancer in black patients compared
   with white patients.
   Methods. Black and white adults with pancreatic cancer in urban counties
   were identified using data from the 2018 submission of the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program and the 2010 Census. The
   racial index of dissimilarity (IoD), a validated proxy of racial
   segregation, was used to assess the evenness with which whites and
   blacks are distributed across census tracts in each county. Multivariate
   Poisson regression was performed, and stepwise models were constructed
   for each of the outcomes. Overall survival was studied using the
   Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results. The study enrolled 60,172 adults with a diagnosis of pancreatic
   cancer between 2005 and 2015. Overall, the black patients (13.8\% of the
   cohort) lived in more segregated areas (IoD, 0.67 vs 0.61; p < 0.05).
   They were less likely to undergo surgery for localized disease (relative
   risk {[}RR], 0.80; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.76-0.83) and more
   frequently had a diagnosis of advanced-stage disease (RR, 1.09; 95\% CI,
   1.01-1.19) with increasing segregation. They also had shorter survival
   times (9.8 vs 11.4 months; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. Disparities in advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, surgery
   for localized disease, and overall survival are directly related to the
   degree of residential segregation, a proxy for structural racism. In
   searching for solutions to this problem, it is important to account for
   the historical marginalization of black Americans.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Long-term control of the invasive annual grass cheatgrass is predicated
   on its biological suppression. Perennial grasses vary in their
   suppressive ability. We compared the ability of a non-native grass
   ({''}Hycrest{''} crested wheatgrass) and two native grasses (Snake River
   wheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass) to suppress cheatgrass. In a
   greenhouse in separate tubs, 5 replicates of each perennial grass were
   established for 96 d, on which two seeds of cheatgrass, 15 cm apart,
   were then sown in a semicircular pattern at distances of 10 cm, 30 cm,
   and 80 cm from the established perennial bunchgrasses. Water was not
   limiting. After 60 d growth, cheatgrass plants were harvested, dried,
   weight recorded, and tissue C and N quantified. Soil N availability was
   quantified at each location where cheatgrass was sown, both before
   sowing and after harvest. Relative to cheatgrass grown at 80 cm, all
   perennial grasses significantly reduced aboveground biomass at 30 cm
   (68\% average reduction) and at 10 cm (98\% average reduction). Sown at
   10 cm from established perennial grasses, cheatgrass aboveground biomass
   was inversely related with perennial grass root mass per unit volume of
   soil. All cheatgrass sown at 10 cm from ``Hycrest{''} crested wheatgrass
   died within 38 d. Before sowing of cheatgrass, soil 10 cm from
   established perennial grasses had significantly less mineral N than soil
   taken at 30 cm and 80 cm. Relative to cheatgrass tissue N for plants
   grown at 80 cm, cheatgrass nearest to the established perennial grasses
   contained significantly less tissue N. All perennial grasses inhibited
   the NO2- to NO3- nitrification step; for ``Hycrest{''} crested
   wheatgrass, soil taken at 10 cm from the plant had a molar proportion of
   NO2- in the NO2- + NO3- pool of > 90\%. In summary, a combination of
   reduced nitrogen availability, occupation of soil space by perennial
   roots, and attenuation of the nitrogen cycle all contributed to
   suppression of cheatgrass. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The

Abstract = {{In our times of confinement, cultural production has become as important
   as it is precarious. Reading habits were revamped during the most
   stringent moments of the early lockdown. Some would consume new
   products, some would revisit their favourite classics. In this article,
   I analyse Carlos Gimenez's pioneering graphic work, a(n)
   (auto)biographical series of comics surrounding children's experiences
   in Francoist orphanages, or `Homes' (Hogares de Auxilio). I argue that
   Paracuellos operates as an isotopic and confining device at formal,
   thematic, intragenerational and affecting levels. It displays an
   aesthetic of confinement and brings together a set of core themes that
   generate a continuum of isotopic semantics, catalysing the work's
   capacity to affect and be affected. Graphic violence is as its core and
   serves as the main constant, be that presently exercised or absently
   loomed, in a context of pathos, loss and scarcity. This article further
   explores how the comics series pulls back the veil on the folds of early
   Francoism as well as the later transition to democracy, a period of
   `lockdown' for cultural memory in general, and for the experienced
   confinement in the Francoist `Homes' in particular. The piece suggests
   that in retrieving this collection of common memories of recurrent
   episodes of violence experienced individually, Gimenez's work ultimately
   nuances the monolithic concept of collective memory within cultural
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-based brazing coatings with tungsten or chromium carbides are used
   for wear and corrosion protection in various applications. Steam turbine
   blades especially present a highly stressed application in which in
   particular the resistance to erosion and corrosion is essential.
   Therefore, novel tape architectures of brazed coatings have been
   developed and investigated within this study. In contrast to the use of
   powders, the application by means of tapes offers a high potential with
   regard to later use in industry due to the reproducible handling and
   automation. In this work, different coating systems were successfully
   deposited by means of vacuum brazing on X 12CrNiMo-12 steel substrate.
   In order to achieve a sufficient fracture toughness of the coatings,
   pure nickel powder was added to the tapes. The influence of this
   additive on the mechanical properties was analyzed by means of
   three-point bending tests. A positive effect has been observed when
   adding a volume fraction of phi(Ni) = 25 \% of nickel, increasing the
   flexural strength up to sigma(f) = 580 MPa. Furthermore, the surface
   hardness of the coating has been analyzed depending on coating
   architecture and post-deposition treatment by grinding.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Anxiety and intolerance to dental local anesthetic injections are
   common in patients undergoing dental procedures. This work was designed
   to study cytotoxicity of selected flavors in primary gingival
   keratinocytes (PGK), to acquire information on their suitability for use
   in dental lidocaine hydrochloride (LID) injection. We also evaluated the
   bio-mimetic taste of LID dental injection in the presence of selected
   flavors and sweetener using an Astree electronic tongue (ETongue).
   Methods: The cytotoxicity of chocolate natural and artificial flavor
   (CTE), raspberry flavor artificial (RAS), cherry flavor (CHR),
   bitterness suppressor flavor (BSF) and lemon flavor extract (LFE) at
   various dilutions (0.16-10\% v/v) was carried out in PGK using the live
   cell morphological analysis and MTT cell cytotoxicity assay. Based on
   the cytotoxicity data, CTE and RAS were added to Xylocaine(R) (2\%)
   along with 0.09\% sodium saccharin and taste was assessed using an
   ETongue. Results: After three hours of treatment, a dose-dependent cell
   death was induced by all flavors compared to the untreated control. BSF
   was found to be more toxic when compared to other flavors. CTE was found
   to be less toxic. The mean IC50 values of CTE, RAS, CHR, BSF and LFE in
   PGK were found to be 9.54, 8.43, 2.21, 0.38 and 4.01 mg/mL. Taste
   analysis with the ETongue showed a clear taste difference between the
   control and test formulations containing CTE and RAS flavors along with
   sodium saccharin. Conclusion: CTE and RAS flavors in combination with
   0.09\% sodium saccharin can achieve a significant taste-masking effect
   in the dental LID injection.}},

   problem that aims at finding paths for multiple agents (e.g., robots) in
   an environment (e.g., an autonomous warehouse) such that no two agents

   of paths. We consider a general version of MAPF, called mMAPF, that
   involves multi-modal transportation modes (e.g., due to velocity
   constraints) and consumption of different types of resources (e.g.,
   batteries). The real-world applications of mMAPF require flexibility
   (e.g., solving variations of mMAPF) as well as explainability. Our
   earlier studies on mMAPF have focused on the former challenge of
   flexibility. In this study, we focus on the latter challenge of
   explainability, and introduce a method for generating explanations for
   queries regarding the feasibility and optimality of solutions, the
   nonexistence of solutions, and the observations about solutions. Our

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) stress analysis of plate-type
   structures in instability conditions is presented. The
   displacement-based and hybrid-mixed four-node quadrilateral elements are
   developed taking the advantages of the sampling surfaces (SaS) method.
   The SaS formulation is based on considering inside the plate N not
   equally spaced SaS parallel to the middle surface to specify the
   displacements of these surfaces as primary plate unknowns. The
   displacements, strains and stresses are assumed to be distributed
   through the thickness using Lagrange polynomials of degree N-1 that lead
   to a well-set higher-order plate theory. The locations of SaS are based
   on the use of Chebyshev polynomial nodes that allow us to minimize
   uniformly the error due to Lagrange interpolation. To circumvent shear
   locking and have no spurious zero energy modes, the assumed transverse
   shear strains are employed. The nonlinear equilibrium equations are
   solved by the Newton-Raphson iterative method combined with the
   Crisfield arc-length algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of both
   elements in different conditions such as coarse and distorted meshes are
   investigated. The developed assumed-natural strain (ANS) elements can be
   useful for the 3D stress analysis of thin and thick plates in whole
   states of equilibrium path involving bifurcation, snap-through, and/or
   snap-back phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Squamous cell (SCC) and basal cell (BCC) skin cancer are common
   presentations in elderly patients. Skin cancer are often located in sun
   exposed areas where damage from exposure has occurred. The sun exposed
   areas are often difficult to close or would require more complex
   measures to cover. Skin grafts or rotation flaps are commonly employed
   for coverage. Having tumor free margins is required to anticipate
   avoiding local recurrence. Mohs techniques examine the surgical margin
   to ensure that lesions are completely excised. When reliable frozen
   section is not available for immediate confirmation, permanent section
   may be used. Excising lesions and implementing radial identification
   allows margin localization of involved margins for re-excision. Divided
   into quartets, directed re-excision can be undertaken with minimal
   disturbance to the healing wound bed. Use of an ECM device (MyriadT,
   Aroa Biosurgery, Auckland, New Zealand) accelerates healing and leaves a
   cosmetically acceptable result that affords margin examination and
   re-excision with minimal disturbance to healing wound. Here we present
   an evolving technique of excision of common skin cancers utilizing ECM
   Matrix Graft technology and healing. This technique affords margin
   identification utilizing permanent section examination. Subsequent
   margin identification and re-excision if necessary is localized to
   individual quadrants of the excision site allowing more precise
   re-excision and not disturbing the grafted wound site. Healing seems
   accelerated and cosmetic appearance is acceptable to patients.yyy}},

Abstract = {{The dispersive behavior of three different amorphous solid dispersion
   (ASD) formulations of the poorly soluble ABT-199 (Venetoclax) were
   studied in aqueous and biomimetic media and spontaneously forming
   supramolecular associates and particles analysed. To this end, the
   aqueous dispersions were fractionated into a submicron (colloidal) and
   micrometer-sized particle-fraction by bench-top centrifugation. The
   submicron fraction was characterized by Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow
   Fractionation in conjunction with Multi-angle Laser Light Scattering
   (AF4-MALLS), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis.
   The micron particle fraction was characterized by Single Particle
   Optical Sensing (SPOS) and light microscopy. Furthermore, drug contents
   were monitored in terms of total dispersed drug and apparently dissolved
   drug in the submicron fraction. Despite the fact, that all three
   formulations showed decent dispersive behavior with almost the complete
   drug content rapidly dispersed, substantial differences were identified
   between two of the formulations and the third one: ABT-199/12 and
   ABT-199/20 showed pronounced precipitation of the drug in form of
   micrometer particles, a phenomenon described as glass liquid phase
   separation (GLPS) and only a marginal fraction of the drug was found in
   the submicron-fraction, i.e. associated with 3 to 4 different
   supramolecular assemblies (micelles), irrespective whether buffer or
   fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) were used as dispersion
   media. In contrast, ABT-199/40 showed pronounced formation of a wide
   variety of supramolecular assemblies (micelles) along with substantial
   association of the drug with all of these, but reduced glass liquid
   phase separation.}},

Title = {{Recovery of Cobalt from the Residues of an Industrial Zinc Refinery}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The electrolytic production of metallic zinc from processing zinc
   sulfide concentrates generates a residue containing cadmium, copper, and
   cobalt that need to be removed from the electrolytic zinc solution
   because they are harmful to the zinc electro-winning process. This
   residue is commonly sent to other parties that partly recover the
   contained elements. These elements can generate revenues if recovered at
   the zinc plant site. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to
   evaluate a method to process a zinc plant residue with the objective of
   recovering cobalt into a salable product. The proposed process comprises
   washing, selective leaching, purifying and precipitation of cobalt
   following its oxidation. The process allows the production of a cobalt
   rich hydroxide precipitate assaying 45 +/- 4\% Co, 0.8 +/- 0.2\% Zn, 4.4
   +/- 0.7\% Cu, and 0.120 +/- 0.004\% Cd at a 61 +/- 14\% Co recovery.
   Replicating the whole process with different feed samples allowed the
   identification of the critical steps in the production of the cobalt
   product; one of these critical steps being the control of the oxidation
   conditions for the selective precipitation step.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of a school-based road safety educational program for
   lower secondary school students in Denmark: A cluster-randomized
   controlled trial}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Road accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injuries among
   adolescents and young adults. Road safety education programs aim to
   promote safe traffic behavior through information, skills training or
   fear appeals. During the last decade, an intervention type using victim
   testimonials has been developed. These types of programs aim to promote
   road safety by connecting a personal narrative of choices and
   consequences to the beliefs and behaviors of the audience. Studies on
   the effectiveness of this type of road safety programs among youngsters
   who are not yet drivers are still limited.
   This study used a cluster-randomized and controlled trial design to
   examine the effect of a Danish school-based road safety educational
   program using testimonials for students in lower secondary schools in
   Denmark on a) knowledge of risks factors in traffic and b) two types of
   behavior specifically relevant for the pre-driver target group: seatbelt
   use and safe bicycle behavior. Our analysis sample comprised 1007
   students from 57 schools with a matched baseline and four-month
   follow-up response.
   Linear regression analyses suggest a small positive effect on the
   students' knowledge of the three most important risk factors in traffic
   but not on the age group most at risk. Concerning seatbelt use or
   overall cycling behavior no effect was found, although a small positive
   effect was found on helmet use. Neither was the effectiveness modified
   by gender, parental educational background, or risky cycling behavior at
   baseline.
   Although classroom-based interventions using testimonials may have the
   potential to increase knowledge of risk factors in traffic among
   adolescents, translating knowledge into safe traffic behavior is
   challenging. More studies are needed on how to further adapt the
   intervention to an age group who are not yet drivers. Such research may
   focus on mechanisms of change including the age-specific relevance of
   the ambassador's testimonial and on employing strong elements of action
   guidance.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The conditions that are vulnerable urban varied qualitatively in the
   last ten years. To the already known prevailing inequality conditions
   are added the increase and consolidation of drug production, sale and
   consumption circuits, mainly paco, which generate and deepen various
   problems, structurally transforming regional, local and neighborhood
   socio-spatial dynamics. Given this situation, other modes of social
   organization arise, which bring with them new coping strategies,
   technical support (public, academic and non-governmental institutions,
   among others), design and implementation of public policies that seek to
   influence specific transformations in the territory. However, this
   scenario finds technicians mostly de-instrumented to intervene in the
   territory with the old strategies -already rudimentary and now also
   outdated- that require rigorous transformations to reach an appropriate
   social approach. That is why it is proposed as a main objective to
   identify those appropriate strategies for the integral improvement of
   the popular habitat through community participation and strengthening
   processes. For its development it is based on concrete experiences of
   technical support carried out in five vulnerable neighborhoods of the
   Gran San Miguel de Tucuman agglomerate, located in northwestern
   Argentina, since 2015.}},

Title = {{Understanding the role of gluten subunits (LMW, HMW glutenins and

   non-linear rheology}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},

Abstract = {{The differences in viscoelastic properties of gluten from two very
   different wheat flours, a weak soft flour dough and a strong semolina
   dough, primarily caused by their gliadin and glutenin content including
   gliadin to glutenin ratio were studied. The doughs were subjected to
   oscillatory time sweep tests at small and large amplitudes as well as
   small and large frequencies. The gluten subunits (LMW, HMW glutenins and
   gliadins) tagged with specific fluorescent quantum dots with a distint
   excitation wavelength were imaged with confocal laser scanning
   microscopy and their distribution and interactions were measured. The
   quantitative imaging data was converted into networking data that
   included lacunarity, network area, and number of network junctions. This
   networking data was correlated with rheology. The two different dough
   systems showed different oscillatory behavior during time sweeps. The
   critical role of LMW glutenins in keeping the structural integrity of
   semolina doughs was demonstrated by a direct correlation between the
   non-linear elastic component `e(3)/e(1)' of the dough and protein
   network parameters of LMW glutenins. It was also shown that gliadins and
   HMW glutenins co-localize and associate throughout rheological
   deformations of the dough. The disruption of the three gluten subunits
   are responsible for rheological breakdown of soft wheat flour dough,
   with gliadins influencing the breakdown of the network at higher
   amplitude deformations. This research presents a new method to analyze
   the microstructure of wheat doughs and new understanding of how the
   network structure of the dough subunits contribute and are correlated
   with fundamental rheological tests.}},

Title = {{Linking Soil Water Changes to Soil Physical Quality in Sugarcane
   Expansion Areas in Brazil}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer with projections for
   expanding the current area by 30\% in the coming years, mainly in areas
   previously occupied by pastures. We assess soil water changes induced by
   land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane expansion in the central-south
   region of Brazil. For that purpose, soil samples were collected in a
   typical LUC sequence (native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) in two
   contrasting soil textures (i.e., sandy and clayey). Soil hydro-physical
   properties such as pores size distribution, bulk density, soil water
   content, water tension, and drainage time at field capacity,
   plant-available water, and S-index were analyzed. Our data showed that
   long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture induced severe
   degradation in soil physical quality and soil water dynamics. However,
   conventional tillage used during conversion from pasture to sugarcane
   did not cause additional degradation on soil structure and soil water
   dynamics. Over time, sugarcane cultivation slightly impaired soil water
   and physical conditions, but only in the 10-20 cm layer in both soils.
   Therefore, we highlight that sustainable management practices to enhance
   soil physical quality and water dynamics in sugarcane fields are needed
   to prevent limiting conditions to plant growth and contribute to
   delivering other ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{At near-grounded glacier termini, calving can lead to the capsize of
   kilometre-scale (i.e. gigatons) unstable icebergs. The transient contact
   force applied by the capsizing iceberg on the glacier front generates
   seismic waves that propagate over teleseismic distances. The inversion
   of this seismic signal is of great interest to get insight into actual
   and past capsize dynamics. However, the iceberg size, which is of
   interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot be recovered from
   the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a complex
   process involving interactions between the iceberg, the glacier and the
   surrounding water. This paper presents a first step towards the
   construction of a complete model, and is focused on the capsize in the
   open ocean without glacier front nor ice-melange. The capsize dynamics
   of an iceberg in the open ocean is captured by computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations, which allows assessing the complexity of the
   fluid motion around a capsizing iceberg and how far the ocean is
   affected by iceberg rotation. Expressing the results in terms of
   appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale and
   field scale capsizes can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is
   found to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect ratio and to the
   water and ice densities. However, dealing at the same time with the
   fluid dynamics and the contact between the iceberg and the deformable
   glacier front requires highly complex coupling that often goes beyond
   actual capabilities of fluid-structure interaction softwares. Therefore,
   we developed a semi-analytical simplified fluid-structure model (SAFIM)
   that can be implemented in solid mechanics computations dealing with
   contact dynamics of deformable solids. This model accounts for
   hydrodynamic forces through calibrated drag and added-mass effects, and
   is calibrated against the reference CFD simulations. We show that SAFIM
   significantly improves the accuracy of the iceberg motion compared with
   existing simplified models. Various types of drag forces are discussed.
   The one that provides the best results is an integrated pressuredrag
   proportional to the square of the normal local velocity at the iceberg's
   surface, with the drag coefficient depending linearly on the iceberg's
   aspect ratio. A new formulation based on simplified added-masses or
   computed added-mass proposed in the literature, is also discussed. We
   study in particular the change of hydrodynamic-induced forces and
   moments acting on the capsizing iceberg. The error of the simulated
   horizontal force ranges between 5 and 25 per cent for different aspect
   ratios. The added-masses affect the initiation period of the capsize,
   the duration of the whole capsize being better simulated when
   added-masses are accounted for. The drag force mainly affects the
   amplitude of the fluid forces and this amplitude is best predicted
   without added-masses.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we aimed to examine the olfactory function of adolescents
   with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We investigated olfactory
   function of 50 adolescents with OCD and 50 healthy controls (min-max,
   12-17 years) by the ``Sniffin' Sticks{''} extended test. OCD and
   depression symptomatology were assessed with the Maudsley
   Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) and the Children's Depression
   Inventory (CDI). Adolescents with OCD had lower olfactory performance
   than healthy controls. The patients who responded positively to the
   treatment exhibited performance superior to the patients with partial
   response and those untreated. All olfactory measurements were
   significantly inversely correlated with MOCI and CDI total scores and
   OCD duration. Our results show that OCD has a significant impact on all
   olfactory tests, and olfactory impairment is related to symptom
   severity, duration, and course of OCD. The decrease in olfactory
   function may be a noninvasive state marker for OCD. Further
   investigations in longitudinal studies are required to confirm our
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, we identify the role of defects in modulating the
   optical properties of ZnO sub-micron rod and tube structures by
   measuring and comparing their temperature dependent (18 K-260 K)
   photoluminescence (PL) behavior. From statistical fitting of the near
   band edge (NBE) emission region of the spectra, it is observed that the
   acceptor exciton (A, X) emissions decrease with an increase in
   temperature for ZnO rod structures, whereas comparatively less variation
   is recorded for ZnO tubular structures. Employing various mathematical
   analyses, the emission patterns observed for tubular structures are
   concluded to arise from their lattice dilation and the electron-phonon
   interactions. For the rod structures, however, it is concluded that the
   emission spectra are primarily due to the defects (i.e. oxygen and/or Zn
   vacancies) present at their polar faces. The defects present at the ZnO
   basal plane affecting (A, X) emissions will influence the use of ZnO in
   optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We aimed to verify the clinical efficacy and safety of the
   electrochemotherapy in melanoma metastases and in cases of rare
   non-melanoma tumors that were difficult to treat for the specific
   anatomical site or for patient comorbidities. Patients and Methods: We
   treated 68 patients (699 cutaneous nodules), 44 patients with metastatic
   melanomas and 24 patients with non-melanoma tumors, at the Melanoma \&
   Skin Cancer Unit, Florence, Italy. Results: We obtained an objective
   response of 89.7\% (88.6\% in melanomas and 91.7\% in non-melanoma
   tumors), complete response 54.4\% and partial response 35.3\%.
   Conclusion: This study showed that electrochemotherapy is effective in
   the treatment of melanoma metastases and in rare types of non-melanoma
   tumors. In particular, we successfully treated rare tumors as
   angiosarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, sarcoma di Kaposi,
   porocarcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, malignant
   blue nevus, undifferentiated epitheliomorphic cell neoplasia and
   metastases from thyroid carcinoma. No serious adverse events were

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to the study of questions implementation of the
   provisions of the UN convention to combat desertification 1994, in the
   Republic of Iraq. In June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro hosted the UN
   Conference on environment and development (UNCED), in which the decision
   was made to change the course of development of the world community with
   way fragile, crises and disasters towards sustainable development, where
   opportunities for brand-harmonious existence of society and nature. At
   the same time, the transition to sustainable development must be
   complex, changing the course of only some countries and only in relation
   to certain components of the natural environment will not solve the
   problem. The purpose of this article - describes the progress in the
   implementation of the main objectives of the convention against
   desertification 1994. On the basis of the study, the author concluded
   that the effective implementation of Iraq their international
   obligations to combat desertification would make a significant
   contribution to the goals and the principles of the international
   convention on biological diversity, as desertification is the main and
   fundamental threat to resources biodiversity of Iraq. On the basis of
   studies, the author concluded that such agreement plays an important
   role in the implementation of modern the concept of the environment, as
   analyzed statistics clearly indicate the formation of positive trends in

Journal = {{FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widespread endocrine disrupting chemical that
   constitutes a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data from
   animal and human studies have demonstrated that early exposure to BPA
   results in adverse metabolic outcomes in adult life.
   In the present work, we exposed pregnant heterozygous estrogen receptor
   beta (ER beta) knock out (BERKO) mice to 10 mu g/kg/day BPA, during days
   9-16 of pregnancy, and measured beta-cell mass and proliferation in
   wildtype (WT) and BERKO male offspring at postnatal day 30. We observed
   increased pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and mass in WT, yet no
   effect was produced in BERKO mice. Dispersed islet cells in primary
   culture treated with 1 nM BPA showed an enhanced pancreatic beta-cell
   replication rate, which was blunted in pancreatic beta-cells from BERKO
   mice and mimicked by the selective ER beta agonist WAY200070. This
   increased beta-cell proliferation was found in male adult as well as in
   neonate pancreatic beta-cells, suggesting that BPA directly impacts
   beta-cell division at earliest stages of life. These findings strongly
   indicate that BPA during pregnancy upregulates pancreatic beta-cell
   division and mass in an ER beta-dependent manner. Thus, other natural or
   artificial chemicals may use this ER beta-mediated pathway to promote
   similar effects.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The care of critically ill children is usually invasive
   and aggressive, requiring numerous traumatic procedures that may cause
   fear, pain, and discomfort.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse the level of discomfort
   of patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of a
   specialist children's hospital and to determine the sociodemographic and
   clinical variables that influence the degree of discomfort experienced
   by critically ill paediatric patients.
   Methods: We performed a descriptive observational cross-sectional study
   that included a total of 311 children with a median age of 5.07 y
   (interquartile range = 0.9-11.7). A team of 10 paediatric critical care
   nurses assessed the degree of discomfort once for each shift (morning,
   afternoon, and night) on 2 successive days using the COMFORT Behavior
   ScaledSpanish version.
   Results: In total, 49.8\% (n = 155) of the patients were free of
   discomfort (score <10 points) vs. 50.2\% (n = 156) who experienced
   discomfort. There was a significant negative correlation between
   discomfort and the length of stay in days (Rho = 0.16; p = 0.02), that
   is, the longer the stay, the less discomfort the patient felt. The
   correlation between age and degree of discomfort was found to be both
   positive and significant (Rho = 0.230, p < 0.001); the greater the age,
   the greater the discomfort. In comparison of all children who received
   analgosedation (n = 205), with discomfort levels of 10.77 2.94, with
   those who did not receive analgosedation (n = 106), with discomfort
   levels of 11.96 2.80, we did find a statistically significant difference
   (c2 =-4.05; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Half of the patients admitted to the paediatric intensive
   care unit experienced discomfort. Age and analgosedation were the two
   most important variables involved with a high degree of discomfort.
   Clinical care practices must consider these factors and try to plan
   activities designed to relieve discomfort in all critically ill
   paediatric patients. (c) 2020 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses

   Mechanical behaviour and strain-rate effect}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Collagen forms one-third of the body proteome and has emerged as an
   important biomaterial for tissue engineering and wound healing. Collagen
   films are used in tissue regeneration, wound treatment, dural substitute
   etc. as well as in flexible electronics. Thus, the mechanical behaviour
   of collagen should be studied under different environmental conditions
   and strain rates relevant for potential applications. This study's aim
   is to assess the mechanical behaviour of collagen films under different
   environmental conditions (hydration, submersion and physiological
   temperature (37 degrees C)) and strain rates. The combination of all
   three environment factors (hydration, submersion and physiological
   temperature (37 degrees C)) resulted in a drop of tensile strength of
   the collagen film by some 90\% compared to that of dry samples, while
   the strain at failure increased to about 145\%. For the first time,
   collagen films were subjected to different strain rates ranging from
   quasi-static (0.0001 s(-1)) to intermediate (0.001 s(-1), 0.01 s(-1)) to
   dynamic (0.1 s(-1) , 1 s(-1)) conditions, with the
   strain-rate-sensitivity exponent (m) reported. It was found that
   collagen exhibited a strain-rate-sensitive hardening behaviour with
   increasing strain rate. The exponent m ranged from 0.02-0.2, with a
   tendency to approach zero at intermediate strain rate (0.01 s(-1)),
   indicating that collagen may be strain-rate insensitive in this regime.
   From the identification of hyperelastic parameter of collagen film, it
   was found that the Ogden Model provides realistic results for future
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiac arrest is among the major causes of sudden deaths
   globally. Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs more commonly,
   in-hospital cardiac arrest is still a major health problem. Critical
   care areas provide care to critically ill patients who are at risk of
   cardiac arrest. It is important that nurses are knowledgeable and
   competent in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to optimise
   the patient's chances of survival and quality of life after cardiac
   arrest.
   Objective. To investigate specialist practice nurses' knowledge of
   evidence-based guidelines for CPR.
   Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was utilised. We sampled
   all critical care registered nurses (N=96) currently working in the
   adult emergency departments and intensive care units at Charlotte Maxeke
   Johannesburg Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. A
   self-administered instrument, the `evaluation questionnaire on CPR
   knowledge for health personnel from emergency services' was used. Data
   were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics.
   Results. The mean CPR knowledge score was 46\%. A score of 84\% was
   considered adequate for a pass, and no respondents achieved this score.
   The majority of the respondents (80.85\%; n=76) were specialists in the
   field of intensive care nursing.
   Conclusion. The CPR knowledge of specialist practice nurses was
   suboptimal for the care required in high-risk settings. Further training
   is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturization strongly affects functional morphology. Whereas some
   anatomical structures are barely affected by scaling, others can
   fundamentally change as the body becomes ever smaller. No prior study
   has focused on the effect of miniaturization on grooming and attachment
   structures in Hymenoptera, which can be highly diverse and complex.
   Through comparative description of the legs of the extremely small wasps
   of the families Mymaridae and Trichogrammatidae, we evaluate the
   functional and phylogenetic patterns concerning possible functional
   effects of miniaturization. On the one hand, the studied species retain
   some features characteristic of other Chalcidoidea, while on the other,
   they display some parallelisms associated with miniaturization in leg
   structure. These observations support a two-stage morphocline of
   miniaturization, wherein the first stage is characterized by the
   preservation of structural complexity and retention of all basic
   functions, as for instance in examined Megaphragma and the females of
   Dicopomorpha. The second stage is characterized by a significant
   simplification, with the loss of redundant non-essential functions, as
   observed for the males of Dicopomorpha, which have grossly reduced leg
   structures, including total loss cleaning devices. Whether these stages
   are ordered or unordered should be evaluated in future study. Functional
   optimization of attachment in male Dicopomorpha is indicated by the
   highly derived mushroom-shaped tarsi, complemented by novel grappling
   spurs on the hindfeet, possibly for copulation. Our observations
   underline adaptive trade-offs in the expression of complex and
   multifunctional leg structures at extreme scales.}},

   zones' map for groundwater recharge. Three potential groundwater
   recharge classes were defined corresponding, respectively, to low

   zones are situated in the piedmont of the Blidean Atlas (the south of
   the study area), precisely, upstream near to wadis (wadi El Harrach,
   wadi Djemaa, wadi Mazafran) and the western aquifer limit, where the
   hydrogeological units are formed by the alluvium formation which is
   characterized by high hydraulic conductivity, high water flow, low

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Human activity recognition is one of the most challenging and active
   areas of research in the computer vision domain. However, designing
   automatic systems that are robust to significant variability due to
   object combinations and the high complexity of human motions are more
   challenging. In this paper, we propose to model the inter-frame rigid
   evolution of skeleton parts as the trajectory in the Lie group SE(3)x
   horizontal ellipsis xSE(3). The motion of the object is similarly
   modeled as an additional trajectory in the same manifold. The
   classification is performed based on a rate-invariant comparison of the
   resulting trajectories mapped to a vector space, the Lie algebra.
   Experimental results on three action and activity datasets show that the
   proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art human activity
   recognition approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the multi-period ambulance redeployment planning

   In order to account for the uncertainty inherent to both categories of

   finding a cost-effective ambulance redeployment. The model tries to
   minimize the total cost, which encompasses ambulance relocation cost,
   the dispatching cost, and the penalty cost incurred by the unsatisfied
   demand, over a multi-period planning horizon. In order to overcome the
   computational complexity of the proposed model, two heuristics are
   proposed: a Temporal Decomposition Heuristic (HDT), and a Lagrangian
   Relaxation based Heuristic (SBG). A simulation model is then proposed to
   evaluate the service level of the EMS system and ambulance utilization
   while accounting for more realistic features of the problem. The
   computational experiments are carried out using real-world data provided
   by the EMS system of the northern region of Tunisia. The results show
   the excellent performance of HDT as it provides a near-optimal solution
   within a reasonable computational time. The simulation also demonstrates
   that the service level of the EMS system is higher if HDT is used. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose to build a morpho-semantic knowledge graph
   from Arabic vocalized corpora. Our work focuses on classical Arabic as
   it has not been deeply investigated in related works. We use a tool
   suite which allows analyzing and disambiguating Arabic texts, taking
   into account short diacritics to reduce ambiguities. At the
   morphological level, we combine Ghwanmeh stemmer and MADAMIRA which are
   adapted to extract a multi-level lexicon from Arabic vocalized corpora.
   At the semantic level, we infer semantic dependencies between tokens by
   exploiting contextual knowledge extracted by a concordancer. Both
   morphological and semantic links are represented through compressed
   graphs, which are accessed through lazy methods. These graphs are mined
   using a measure inspired from BM25 to compute one-to-many similarity.
   Indeed, we propose to evaluate the morpho-semantic Knowledge Graph in
   the context of Arabic Information Retrieval (IR). Several scenarios of
   document indexing and query expansion are assessed. That is, we vary
   indexing units for Arabic IR based on different levels of morphological
   knowledge, a challenging issue which is not yet resolved in previous
   research. We also experiment several combinations of morpho-semantic
   query expansion. This permits to validate our resource and to study its
   impact on IR based on state-of-the art evaluation metrics.}},

Abstract = {{In the digital multimedia era, digital forensics is becoming an emerging
   area of research thanks to the large amount of image and video files
   generated. Ensuring the integrity of such media is of great importance
   in many situations. This task has become more complex, especially with
   the progress of symmetrical and asymmetrical network structures which
   make their authenticity difficult. Consequently, it is absolutely
   imperative to discover all possible modes of manipulation through the
   development of new forensics detector tools. Although many solutions
   have been developed, tamper-detection performance is far from reliable
   and it leaves this problem widely open for further investigation. In
   particular, many types of multimedia fraud are difficult to detect
   because some evidences are not exploited. For example, the symmetry and
   asymmetry inconsistencies related to visual feature properties are
   potential when applied at multiple scales and locations. We explore here
   this topic and propose an understandable soft taxonomy and a deep
   overview of the latest research concerning multimedia forgery detection.
   Then, an in-depth discussion and future directions for further
   investigation are provided. This work offers an opportunity for
   researchers to understand the current active field and to help them
   develop and evaluate their own image/video forensics approaches.}},

Title = {{Phenolic Compounds Characterization and Antioxidant Properties of
   Monocultivar Olive Oils from Northeast Algeria}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In Algeria, the olive tree is one of the main fruit species and plays a
   very important socioeconomic role. The objective of this study was
   firstly, to identify and quantify the phenolics of some Algerian olive
   oils, and secondly, to assess the antioxidant activity of the samples.
   The olive oils used in this study were derived from Algerian cultivars,
   including Tefahi, Gelb Elfarroudj, Chemlal, and imported cultivar
   Manzanilla and Zebboudj. For this purpose, gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify olive oil fatty acids profile,
   while the individual phenolic compounds were assessed by
   ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray
   ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HESI-MS). To verify
   the antioxidant capacity, five in vitro free radical assays were used.
   Questionable values of particular physico-chemical parameters, such as
   the high value of free acidity and the low concentration of
   monounsaturated fatty acids in oil from the Zebboudj cultivar, indicate
   that improvements in olive cultivation and oil production practices are
   needed. Gelb Elfarroudj, Tefahi, and Manzanilla oils contain quantities
   of monounsaturated fatty acids in accordance with EU regulations. The
   oil obtained from the Zebboudj cultivar is not usable for food purposes
   due to the high value in free acidity and the low concentration of
   monounsaturated fatty acids. Tefahi and Manzanilla cultivars have given
   oils with the best antioxidant activity as compared to other studied
   cultivars; this is attributable to their composition in bioactive
   phenolic compounds, such as secoiridoids, which play an important role
   in human health as scavengers of free radicals. The results are
   interesting for producers and consumers to promote the culture of olive
   oils derived in particular from the Tefahi cultivar. However, in order
   to improve the health qualities of this oil, the agronomic techniques
   essentially linked to the time of harvesting of the olives destined for
   oil production must be improved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a dynamic political-economic model of total
   government obligations. Its focus is on the interplay between debt and
   entitlements. In our model, both are tools by which temporarily powerful
   groups can extract resources from groups that will be powerful in the
   future: debt transfers resources across periods; entitlements directly
   target the future allocation of resources. We prove the following
   results. First, the presence of endogenous entitlements dampens the
   incentives of politically powerful groups to accumulate debt, but it
   leads to an increase in total government obligations. Second, fiscal
   rules can have perverse effects: if entitlements are unconstrained, and
   there are capital market frictions, debt limits lead to an increase in
   total government obligations and to worse outcomes for all groups.
   Analogous results hold for entitlement limits. Third, our model sheds
   some lights on the influence of capital market frictions on the
   incentives of governments to adopt fiscal rules, and implement
   entitlement programs. Finally, we identify preference polarization as a
   possible explanation for the joint growth of debt and entitlements.}},

Title = {{Medical malpractice and meningiomas: an analysis of 47 cases}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Among medical practices, surgical fields, including
   neurosurgery, are at a high risk for medical malpractice litigation.
   With meningiomas contributing to 10\% of the total neurosurgery
   litigation cases, the aim of this study was to identify demographic
   characteristics, reasons for litigation, and surgical complications
   commonly reported in these cases. This analysis serves to increase
   neurosurgeons' awareness of factors associated with medical malpractice
   litigation.
   METHODS The online legal database Westlaw was utilized to query public
   litigation cases related to the medical management of meningiomas
   between December 1985 and May 2020. Variables extracted included the
   following: plaintiff and defendant demographics, litigation category,
   plaintiff medical complaints, and trial outcomes. The authors compared
   these characteristics between cases with decisions in favor of the
   defendant and those with decisions in favor of the plaintiff.
   RESULTS A total of 47 cases met the inclusion criteria. Failure to
   diagnose (68.1\%) was the most common type of malpractice claim, and
   surgical complications (19.1\%), motor weakness (33\%), and financial
   loss (33\%) were cited as the most common postoperative complaints.
   Individual specialties that most often required defense due to
   malpractice claims were radiology (21.7\%) and neurosurgery (19.6\%).
   The jury verdict was in favor of the defense in 51.1\% of cases and in
   favor of the plaintiff in 27.7\% of cases. A settlement was reached in
   19.1\% of cases. The mean payout for a verdict in favor of the plaintiff
   was \$3,409,650.22, while the mean payout for settlements was
   \$867,555.56. The greatest average payout for specialties was in
   neurosurgery at \$3,414,400, followed by radiology at \$3,192,960. Cases
   with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff were more likely to involve an
   internal medicine physician as a defendant (p = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS Over one-half of the cases resulted in a defendant's verdict
   with failure to diagnose cited as the most common reason for litigation.
   Radiology and neurosurgery were the most common specialties for legal
   cases and also had some of the largest average payouts based on
   specialty. Motor weakness and financial loss were the most common
   plaintiff postoperative complaints. These findings may inform surgeons
   on active measures to take, such as increasing focus on diagnostic
   accuracy and reducing specific postoperative complaints, such as motor
   weakness, through risk management and prophylactic measures, to reduce
   unfavorable legal outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropathic pain is a debilitating public health concern for which novel
   non-narcotic therapeutic targets are desperately needed. Using unbiased
   transcriptomic screening of the dorsal horn spinal cord after nerve
   injury we have identified that Gpr183 (Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene
   2) is upregulated after chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats.
   GPR183 is a chemotactic receptor known for its role in the maturation of
   B cells, and the endogenous ligand is the oxysterol 7
   alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7 alpha,25-OHC). The role of GPR183 in
   the central nervous system is not well characterized, and its role in
   pain is unknown. The profile of commercially available probes for GPR183
   limits their use as pharmacological tools to dissect the roles of this
   receptor in pathophysiological settings. Using in silico modeling, we
   have screened a library of 5 million compounds to identify several novel
   small-molecule antagonists of GPR183 with nanomolar potency. These
   compounds are able to antagonize 7 alpha,25-OHC-induced calcium
   mobilization in vitro with 1050 values below 50 nM. In vivo intrathecal
   injections of these antagonists during peak pain after CCI surgery
   reversed allodynia in male and female mice. Acute intrathecal injection
   of the GPR183 ligand 7 alpha,25-OHC in naive mice induced dose-dependent
   allodynia. Importantly, this effect was blocked using our novel GPR183
   antagonists, suggesting spinal GPR183 activation as pronociceptive.
   These studies are the first to reveal a role for GPR183 in neuropathic
   pain and identify this receptor as a potential target for therapeutic
   intervention.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
   We have identified several novel GPR183 antagonists with nanomolar
   potency. Using these antagonists, we have demonstrated that GPR183
   signaling in the spinal cord is pronociceptive. These studies are the
   first to reveal a role for GPR183 in neuropathic pain and identify it as
   a potential target for therapeutic intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)
   Report No. 151 is an essential document for bunker design commonly
   applied for radiotherapy treatment rooms. This document is used as a
   reference by several countries, including Brazil. The objective of this
   study is to evaluate the shielding dimensioning methodology recommended
   by NCRP 151, and compare it with the one adopted by the Brazilian
   regulatory authority. Radiotherapy rooms and respective doors were
   designed to use linear accelerators operating at 6, 10, 15, and 18 MeV
   under two different ways: (a) applying exclusively the methodology
   recommended by the NCRP 151, and (b) taking into consideration the
   complementary recommendations from the Brazilian authorities. The
   results suggest that designers in Brazil can count on at least 4 and
   11\% safety margin for dimensioning primary barriers in controlled and
   free areas respectively. Also 8\% for secondary barriers in controlled
   areas, 9.7\% for secondary barriers adjacent to the primary belt of free
   areas, and 6.6\% for the lead of the doors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To perform a stepwise development of the surgical method for
   robotics-assisted laparoscopy in donor hysterectomy for uterus
   transplantation (UTx), a unique treatment for absolute uterine-factor
   infertility.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patient(s): Eight donors, aged 38-62 years, underwent surgery for
   retrieval of the uterus and vasculature.
   Intervention(s): Robotics-assisted laparoscopy was performed in donors
   for 6-7 h with video recording. Conversion to laparotomy was performed
   for last parts of retrieval surgery.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Description, evaluation, and timing of 12
   specific surgical steps, as well as surgical outcomes and complications.
   Result(s): There was a progression during the course of eight surgeries.
   In the initial two cases, seven and six items were completed with
   robotics compared with all 12 items in the last three procedures. The
   passive surgical time decreased from similar to 20\% in the first four
   cases to similar to 8\% in the last three procedures. The estimated
   median (range) blood loss, total surgical time, and length of hospital
   stay were, respectively, 125 mL (100- 600), 11.25 h (10-13), and 5.5
   days (5-6). Two reversible complications occurred: One patient acquired
   pressure alopecia, and one developed pyelonephritis.
   Conclusion(s): The study demonstrates a clear evolution of a strategy
   toward fully robotic donor surgery in UTx. This is likely to become the
   main approach in donor surgery of live UTx donors. ((C) 2020 by American
   Society for Reproductive Medicine.)}},

Title = {{Control of the Photo-Isomerization Mechanism in 3H-Naphthopyrans to
   Prevent Formation of Unwanted Long-Lived Photoproducts}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the photochromic reactions of 3H-naphthopyrans, two colored isomers
   TC (transoid-cis) and TT (transoid-trans) are formed. In terms of
   optimized photo-switchable materials, synthetic efforts are nowadays
   evolving toward developing 3H-naphthopyran derivatives that would not be
   able to photoproduce the long-living transoid-trans, TT, photoproduct.
   The substitution with a methoxy group at position 10 results in
   significant reduction of the TT isomer formation yield. The TC
   photophysics responsible for TT suppression were revealed here using a
   combination of multi-scale time resolved absorption UV-vis spectroscopy
   and ab initio calculations. The substitution changes the TC
   excited-state potential energy landscape, the bicycle-pedal
   isomerization path is favored over the rotation around a single double
   bond. The bicycle-pedal path is aborted in halfway to TT formation due
   to S-1 -> S-0 internal conversion populating back the TC species in the
   ground electronic state. This is validated by a shorter TC S-1 state
   lifetime for methoxy derivative in comparison to that of the
   parent-unsubstituted compound (0.47 +/- 0.05 ps vs. 0.87 +/- 0.09 ps) in
   cyclohexane.}},

Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We develop a non-commutative integration method for the Dirac equation
   in homogeneous spaces. The Dirac equation with an invariant metric is
   shown to be equivalent to a system of equations on a Lie group of
   transformations of a homogeneous space. This allows us to effectively
   apply the non-commutative integration method of linear partial
   differential equations on Lie groups. This method differs from the
   well-known method of separation of variables and to some extent can
   often supplement it. The general structure of the method developed is
   illustrated with an example of a homogeneous space which does not admit
   separation of variables in the Dirac equation. However, the basis of
   exact solutions to the Dirac equation is constructed explicitly by the
   non-commutative integration method. In addition, we construct a complete
   set of new exact solutions to the Dirac equation in the
   three-dimensional de Sitter space-time AdS(3) using the method
   developed. The solutions obtained are found in terms of elementary
   functions, which is characteristic of the non-commutative integration
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, organizations are encouraging employees to be more creative in
   order to enhance organizational innovation. However, the potential
   negative coworker consequences stemming from employee creativity are
   widely unknown. Thus, we extend the creativity literature by drawing on
   social comparison theory and taking an interpersonal approach to
   investigate whether, when, and how employee relative creativity (an
   employee's creativity compared to the average creativity in his or her
   team) may lead to coworker envy, which then results in coworkers
   ostracizing the focal employee. The findings reveal that coworker envy
   (Time 2) mediates the relationship between employee relative creativity
   (Time 1) and coworker ostracism (Time 3). When an employee has a
   relatively higher quality leader-member exchange relationship with his
   or her team leader (Time 1), his or her relative creativity (Time 1) is
   more likely to trigger coworker envy (Time 2) and ostracism (Time 3). In
   contrast, an employee's relative creativity (Time 1) is more likely to
   fuel coworker envy (Time 2) and ostracism (Time 3) when he or she
   possesses relatively lower quality exchange relationships with coworkers
   (Time 1).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, yeasts were isolated from an indigenous starter culture
   for cachac a production (Brazilian spirit) and brewer's spent grain and
   characterized through a series of phenotypic assays: the killer profile,
   ascospore formation capacity, growth at high temperatures, resistance to
   natamycin and actidione, and exoenzyme production. One hundred
   thirty-four (n = 134) yeasts were isolated and identified as belonging
   to 6 genera and 10 different species. The ascospore formation in
   potassium acetate agar was observed in 86\% of the isolates (73
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 3 Torulaspora delbrueckii, and 1
   Wickerhamomyces anomalus) highlighting their potential for
   microencapsulation. Only S. cerevisiae LMQA SNR 70 expressed an
   effective killer factor (ability to destroy sensitive strains), while
   only 3 S. cerevisiae, 1 Clavispora lusitaniae, and 1 Pichia kudriavzevii
   isolates were able to grow up at 45 ?C. At 50 and 100 mg/L, actidione
   showed selectivity action for Candida parapsilosis, while natamycin
   inhibited the growth of all isolates. The non-Saccharomyces isolates
   stood out in the qualitative and quantitative tests for amylolytic,
   pectinolytic, cellulolytic, and xylanolytic activities. A predominance
   of the species W. anomalus and T. delbrueckii was observed. Besides,
   quantitative tests revealed that 23\% of the isolates exhibited
   exoenzymatic activity in a nutrient-poor environment, and W. anomalus
   LMQA CSC 5 e LMQA CSC 43 stood out for the multi-enzymatic in agar and
   liquid medium response. The phenotypic profile showed that 16\% of the
   isolates expressed two or more characteristics studied, with 2/3
   represented by the non-Saccharomyces species. These results highlight
   the importance of studying yeast species for new biotechnological
   purposes. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

   performance analysis conditions for uncertain linear positive impulsive
   systems in linear fractional form with norm-bounded uncertainties using
   a scaled small-gain argument involving time-varying D-scalings. Both
   range and minimum dwell-time conditions are formulated - the case of
   constant and maximum dwell-times can be directly obtained as
   corollaries. The conditions are stated as timer/clock-dependent
   conditions taking the form of infinite-dimensional linear programmes
   that can be relaxed into finite-dimensional ones using polynomial
   optimisation techniques. It is notably shown that under certain
   conditions, the scalings can be eliminated from the stability conditions
   to yield equivalent stability conditions on the so-called worst-case
   system, which is obtained by replacing the uncertainties by the identity
   matrix. These conditions are then applied to the special case of linear
   positive systems with delays, where the delays are considered as
   uncertainties, similarly to as in (Briat (2018a). Stability and
   performance analysis of linear positive systems with delays using
   input-output methods. International Journal of Control, 91(7),
   1669-1692). As before, under certain conditions, the scalings can be
   eliminated from the conditions to obtain conditions on the worst-case
   system, coinciding here with the zero-delay system - a result that is
   consistent with all the existing ones in the literature on linear
   positive systems with delays. Finally, the case of switched systems with
   delays is considered. The approach also encompasses standard
   continuous-time and discrete-time systems, possibly with delays and the
   results are flexible enough to be extended to cope with multiple delays,
   time-varying delays, distributed/neutral delays and any other types of
   uncertain systems that can be represented as a feedback interconnection
   of a known system with an uncertainty.}},

Title = {{RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL MORTALITY}},
Journal = {{NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1229-1318}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Racial disparities in maternal mortality have recently become a popular
   topic, with a host of media outlets devoting time and space to covering
   the appalling state of black maternal health in the country. Congress
   responded to this increased societal awareness by passing the Preventing
   Maternal Deaths Act at the tail end of 2018. The law provides states
   twelve million dollars annually, for five years, to fund maternal
   mortality review commissions-interdisciplinary collections of experts
   that evaluate and investigate the causes of every maternal death in a
   jurisdiction. Fascinatingly, although activists, journalists,
   politicians, scholars, and other commentators understand that the
   maternal health tragedy in the United States is a racial tragedy, the
   Preventing Maternal Deaths Act completely ignores race. Indeed, the term
   ``race{''} does not appear anywhere in the text of the statute. The
   irony is striking: An effort to address a phenomenon that has become
   salient because of its racial nature ignores race entirely.
   The racial irony embodied by the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act serves
   as an invitation to investigate not only the Act itself, but the
   national conversation that is currently taking place about racial
   disparities in maternal deaths. Indeed, in important respects, if the
   general discourse that surrounds racial disparities in maternal
   mortality is impoverished, then we should expect that the solutions that
   observers propose will be impoverished as well. This is precisely what
   this Article discovers. The analysis proceeds in four Parts.
   Part I provides an overview of racial disparities in maternal mortality,
   identifying the various elements that have made pregnancy, childbirth,
   and the postpartum period much more dangerous for black women than their
   white counterparts in the United States. Part II then offers critiques
   of the national conversation around racial disparities in maternal
   mortality and warns of both the marginalizing effects it may have on
   black women and the possibility that it will lead to blaming black women
   for dying on the path to motherhood.
   Part III describes the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act in some detail.
   Part IV follows with a critique of the Act, identifying three
   deficiencies. First, it notes the racial erasure contained in the
   Act-the fact that the Act nowhere mentions the racial dimensions of the
   nation's maternal health debacle. It then observes the predicament
   created by the fact that erasing race likely was essential to the very
   passage of the Act. Second, it notes that because the Act does not
   direct the state maternal mortality review commissions to investigate
   the structural and institutional forces that produce excess maternal
   deaths in the United States, it leaves space for maternal mortality
   review commissions to simply blame the dead for dying. Third, it notes
   that the Act does no more than fund the gathering of more data about
   pregnancy-related deaths. However, it observes that there is a strong
   argument to be made that we do not need more data. We already know why
   women are dying, and we already know how to save them. In this way, the
   tragedy of maternal mortality in the United States is not a problem of
   information; it is a problem of political will. To the extent that
   Congress chose to intervene in the maternal health debacle not with
   policy changes, but rather with an attestation that we need more
   information, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act demonstrates that we
   still lack the political will to make the concrete changes that will
   make pregnancy and childbirth safe.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY}},

Abstract = {{Hindbrain estrogen receptors (ER) impose sex-dimorphic control of
   counter-regulatory hormone and hypothalamic glucoregulatory transmitter
   and glycogen metabolic responses to hypoglycemia. A2 noradrenergic
   neurons are estradiol- and metabolic-sensitive. Estradiol controls
   dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) protein habituation to recurrent
   insulin-induced hypoglycemia (RIIH) in females. Current research
   investigated the premise that sexdimorphic patterns of A2 ER variant
   acclimation to RIIH correlate with differential A2 DBH and
   5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) adaptation to RIIH. A2 neurons
   were laser-catapult-microdissected from male and female rats after one
   or four insulin injections for Western blot analysis. A2 pAMPK and DBH
   levels were increased in males, but suppressed in females after single
   insulin dosing. ER-alpha (ER alpha) and -beta (ER beta) protein profiles
   were unaffected or decreased by acute hypoglycemia in each sex, whereas
   G protein-linked ER-1 (GPER) reactivity varied by sex. Antecedent
   hypoglycemia diminished basal A2 ER alpha/GPER and elevated ER beta
   content in each sex, yet reduced pAMPK and DBH levels in female rats
   only. Reintroduced hypoglycemia suppressed A2 ER beta levels in each
   sex, but altered DBH (down arrow), ER alpha (down arrow), and GPER (up
   arrow) levels in males only. Data document sex differences in A2 DBH
   adaptation to RIIH, e.g. a shift from positive-to-negative response in
   males versus loss of negative reactivity in females, as well as
   attenuated AMPK activation in both sexes. Between hypoglycemic episodes,
   A2 neurons in each sex likely exhibit diminished sensitivity to ER
   alpha/GPER signaling, but heightened receptivity to ER beta input.
   RIIH-induced changes in ER alpha and GPER expression in male but not
   female may contribute to DBH suppression (males) versus no change
   (females) relative to adapted baseline expression.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We address the problem of predicting edit completions based on a learned
   model that was trained on past edits. Given a code snippet that is
   partially edited, our goal is to predict a completion of the edit for
   the rest of the snippet. We refer to this task as the EDITCOMPLETION
   task and present a novel approach for tackling it. The main idea is to
   directly represent structural edits. This allows us to model the
   likelihood of the edit itself, rather than learning the likelihood of
   the edited code. We represent an edit operation as a path in the
   program's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), originating from the source of the
   edit to the target of the edit. Using this representation, we present a
   powerful and lightweight neural model for the EDITCOMPLETION task.
   We conduct a thorough evaluation, comparing our approach to a variety of
   representation and modeling approaches that are driven by multiple
   strong models such as LSTMs, Transformers, and neural CRFs. Our
   experiments show that our model achieves a 28\% relative gain over
   state-of-the-art sequential models and 2x higher accuracy than syntactic
   models that learn to generate the edited code, as opposed to modeling
   the edits directly.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven
   by false-positive and false-negative results.
   Methods: Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to
   identify infected patients and fight the severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To evaluate the test methods,
   sensitivity (percent positive agreement {[}PPA]) and specificity
   (percent negative agreement {[}PPA]) are the most common metrics
   utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value-the
   probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true
   positive or negative patient. The number, probability, and cost of false
   results are driven by combinations of prevalence, PPA, and PNA of the
   individual test selected by the laboratory.
   Results: Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the
   virus are relevant in the acute phase only Serologic assays detect
   antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the recovering and recovered phase. Each
   testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate the value of reporting probability of
   false-positive results, probability of false-negative results, and costs
   to patients and health care. These risk metrics can be calculated from
   the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence,
   cost, and Reff number (people infected by 1 positive SA RS-CoV-2
   carrier). (C) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To thematically describe parent-clinician communication during
   a child's first burn dressing change following emergency department
   presentation.
   Design and methods: An observational study of parent-clinician
   communication during the first burn dressing change at a tertiary
   children's hospital. Verbal communication between those present at the
   dressing change for 87 families, was audio recorded. The recordings were
   transcribed verbatim and transcripts were analysed within NVivo11
   qualitative data analysis software using qualitative content analysis.
   Findings: Three themes, underpinned by parent-clinician
   rapport-building, were identified. Firstly, knowledge sharing was
   demonstrated: Clinicians frequently informed the parent about the state
   of the child's wound, what the procedure will involve, and need for
   future treatment. Comparatively, parents informed the clinician about
   their child's temperament and coping since the accident. Secondly, child
   procedural distress management was discussed: Clinicians and parents had
   expectations about the likelihood of procedural distress, which was also
   related to communication about how to prevent and interpret procedural
   distress (i.e., pain/fear). Finally, parents communicated to clinicians
   about their own distress, worry and uncertainty, from the accident and
   wound care. Parents also communicated guilt and blame in relation to
   injury responsibility.
   Conclusions: This study provides a description of parent-clinician
   communication during paediatric burn wound care. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Reciprocal chains (RC) are a class of discreteindex, finite-state
   stochastic processes with a generalized Markov nearest-neighbour
   property. All Markov chains (MC) are RC but not conversely. It is well
   known that a sufficiently regular MC ``forgets{''} its initial
   distribution in a geometric manner. This article addresses the issues of
   forgetting for RC. Using the properties of inhomogeneous products of
   nonnegative matrices, this article establishes that a RC forget its
   endpoint distributions in a more complicated manner. In particular, this
   article shows that the forgetting function for the initial conditions is
   bounded by a superposition of increasing and decreasing geometric terms.
   Implications for modeling using RC are then discussed. The particular
   case of those RC that are MC with prescribed marginal distributions on
   the endpoints is considered. The tightness of the forgetting bounds is
   illustrated with numerical examples.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the construct validity of Psychomotor Vigilance
   Test performance for measuring fatigue in people with acquired brain
   injury. Design: Observational cross-sectional study.
   Participants: Fifty-four people with acquired brain injury and 61
   healthy controls.
   Methods: Participants performed the Psychomotor Vigilance Test and
   reported momentary fatigue before and after this test and general
   fatigue. Associations between performance and fatigue in patients were
   tested by correlational and hierarchical multiple linear regression
   analyses, controlling for sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and mood.
   Results: Patients performed worse on the test compared with controls.
   Within the patient group, worse test performance was associated with
   increases in momentary post-test fatigue and general fatigue, indicating
   convergent validity, but also with daytime sleepiness, and mood
   complaints, indicating a lack of divergent validity. When controlling
   for sleepiness and mood, the association between performance and general
   fatigue was no longer significant, whereas the association between
   performance and post-test fatigue remained.
   Conclusion: Performance on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test cannot be used
   as a specific measure for fatigue, but it appears to be a more general
   measure of severity of symptoms including fatigue, mood, and sleepiness.
   Therefore, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test may be a useful measure to
   examine the effects of interventions aimed at reducing these symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as Rapid Prototyping, is a set
   of production technologies used in the synthesis of a particular
   physical object by adding layers to form a part based on data generated
   by Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems. These technologies are widely
   used to quickly create prototypes of products and tools for commercial
   purposes. Over time, it has also been integrated with other areas, such
   as healthcare, since these tools have allowed health professionals to
   assist in diagnoses, surgical planning, and synthesis of orthoses and
   prostheses for patient rehabilitation.
   OBJECTIVE: To develop models for the construction of dilators for the
   treatment of vaginal agenesis.
   METHODS: Use CAD software and create a physical model using AM to
   analyze the viability of its production in the elaboration of customized
   dilators for each patient.
   RESULTS: The production through AM provides an advantage in the
   development, facilitating physical alterations just by adjusting the
   three-dimensional models made by the software in a quick way, thus
   making the customization process viable.
   CONCLUSION: The proposed procedure for the manufacture of dilators
   presented good results and technological feasibility, indicating that it
   can be a good solution for the production and customization of
   gynecological devices.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis of
   COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple,
   semi-quantitative method that can be used for identifying patients in
   need of subsequent intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and intubation.
   We retrospectively analyzed the initial CT scans of 28 patients who
   tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at our Level-I center. The extent of lung
   involvement on CT was classified both subjectively and with a simple
   semi-quantitative method measuring the affected area at three lung
   levels. Competing risks Cox regression was used to identify factors
   associated with the time to ICU admission and intubation. Their
   potential diagnostic ability was assessed with receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC)/area under the ROC curves (AUC) analysis. A 10\%
   increase in the affected lung parenchyma area increased the
   instantaneous risk of intubation (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.00) and the
   instantaneous risk of ICU admission (HR 1.73). The semi-quantitative
   measurement outperformed the subjective assessment diagnostic ability
   (AUC = 85.6\% for ICU treatment, 71.9\% for intubation). This simple
   measurement of the involved lung area in initial CT scans of COVID-19
   patients may allow early identification of patients in need of ICU
   treatment/intubation and thus help make optimal use of limited

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess survival rates and clinical outcomes
   in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and severe functional
   mitral regurgitation (FMR), treated with optimal guideline-directed
   medical therapy (GDMT).
   Materials and methods. After signing an informed consent, 84 patients
   with DCM and severe FMR were enrolled in the study. Concomitant
   tricuspid valve regurgitation was recorded in 82 (97.6 \%) cases. The
   median NT-proBNP level was 2530 pg/ml (2123-3000 pg/ml).
   Results. Hospital mortality was 5 (6.0 \%) cases. Heart transplantation
   was performed in 4 (5.1 \%) patients; therefore long-term results were
   analyzed in 75 patients. During the mean follow-up period of 45.9 +/-
   17.6 months, the occurrence of lethal outcomes (all-cause death) was
   60.0 \%. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rate was 84.0 \%,
   53.3 \% and 40.0 \%, respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction
   and systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery were independently
   associated with long-term all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions. The study results demonstrate that the short-term and
   long-term mortality rates in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and
   severe functional mitral regurgitation remain high despite the treatment
   with currently accepted pharmacological therapy. One possible method
   which would improve the treatment results is mitral valve surgery.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES This study evaluated spontaneous arrhythmias and clinical
   outcomes in the S-ICD System PAS (Subcutaneous Implantable
   Cardioverter-Defibrillator Post Approval Study) cohort.
   BACKGROUND The U.S. S-ICD PAS trial patient population more closely
   resembles transvenous ICD cohorts than earlier studies, which included
   many patients with little structural heart disease and few
   comorbidities. Early outcomes and tow peri-operative complication rates
   were demonstrated in the S-ICD PAS cohort, but there are no data
   detailing spontaneous arrhythmias and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS The S-ICD PAS prospective registry included 1,637 de novo
   patients from 86 U.S. centers. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier time
   to event, and multivariate logistic regression were performed using data
   out to 365 days.
   RESULTS Patients (68.5\% men; mean ejection fraction of 32.0\%; 42.9\%
   ischemic; 13.4\% on dialysis) underwent implantation for primary
   (76.6\%) or secondary prevention indication. The complication-free rate
   was 92.5\%. The appropriate shock (AS) rate was 5.3\%. A total of 395
   ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF) episodes were
   appropriately sensed, with 131(33.2\%) self-terminating. First and final
   shock efficacy (up to 5 shocks) for the 127 discrete AS episodes were
   91.3\% and 100.0\%, respectively. Discrete AS episodes included 67
   monomorphic VT (MVT) and 60 polymorphic VT (PVT)/VF, with first shock
   efficacy of 95.2\% and 86.7\%, respectively. There were 19 storm events
   in 18 subjects, with 84.2\% conversion success. Storm episodes were more
   likely PVT/VF (98 of 137).
   CONCLUSIONS In the first year after implantation, a predominantly
   primary prevention population with low ejection fraction demonstrated a
   high complication-free rate and spontaneous event shock efficacy for MVT
   and PVT/VF arrhythmias at rapid ventricular rates. (C) 2020 The Authors.

   Magnetic Nanoparticles Using Surface Acoustic Waves}},
Journal = {{CRYSTALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The surface acoustic waves (SAWs) were used to study the effect of
   magnetic nanoparticles on nematic liquid crystal (NLC) behavior in weak
   magnetic and electric fields. The measurement of the attenuation of SAW
   propagating along the interface between piezoelectric substrate and
   liquid crystal is showed as an effective tool to study processes of
   structural changes. The magnetic nanoparticles Fe3O4 of nanorod shape
   and different low volume concentration were added to the NLC (4-(trans-4
   `-n-hexylcyclohexyl)-isothiocyanatobenzene (6CHBT)) during its isotropic
   phase. In contrast to undoped liquid crystals the distinctive different
   SAW attenuation responses induced by both magnetic and also electric
   fields in studied NLC samples were observed suggesting both structural
   changes and the orientational coupling between both magnetic and
   electric moments of nanoparticles and the director of the NLC molecules.
   Experimental measurements including the investigation under linearly
   increasing and/or jumped magnetic and electrical fields, respectively,
   as well as the investigation of temperature and time influences on
   structural changes were done. The investigation of the SAW anisotropy
   gives supplemental information about the internal structure of
   nanoparticles in investigated NLCs. In addition, some magneto-optical
   investigations were performed to support SAW results and study their
   stability and switching time. The analysis of observed SAW attenuation
   characteristics confirmed the role of concentration of magnetic
   nanoparticles on the resultant behavior of investigated NLC compounds.
   Obtained results are discussed within the context of previous ones. The
   theoretical background of the presented SAW investigation is introduced,
   too.}},

Title = {{Effects of phytase-supplemented fermentation and household processing on
   the nutritional quality of Lathyrus sativus L. seeds}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is commonly consumed in cooked,
   fermented, and roasted forms in Ethiopia. However, the impacts of
   household processing practices on its nutrients, antinutrients, and
   toxic compounds have not been adequately studied. Therefore, the effects
   of household processing and fermentation in the presence and absence of
   a phytase on the contents of beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic
   acid (beta-ODAP), myo-inositol phosphates, crude protein, minerals and
   the in vitro bioaccessibility were investigated. Fermentation exhibited
   a significant decline in beta-ODAP (13.0-62.0\%) and phytate
   (7.3-90.5\%) irrespective of the presence of phytase. Pressure and pan
   cooking after discarding the soaking water resulted in a 27.0 and 16.2\%
   reduction in beta-ODAP. A 30\% reduction in phytate was observed during
   germination followed by roasting. In addition, germination resulted in a
   significant (p < 0.05) increase in crude protein. Germination and
   germination followed by roasting resulted in the highest Fe
   bioaccessibilities (more than 25 fold higher compared to untreated
   samples) followed by pressure cooking and soaking. Processing also
   improved Zn bioaccessibilities by 50.0\% (soaked seed without soaking
   water), 22.5\% (soaked seed with soaking water), and 4.3\%
   (germination). Thus, the processing technologies applied were capable of
   reducing the content of phytate (InsP6) and beta-ODAP with a concomitant
   increase in mineral bioaccessibilities. Processing of grass peas could
   therefore contribute to their more widespread utilization.}},

Title = {{Physical mechanisms for soil moisture effects on microbial carbon-use
   efficiency in a sandy loam soil in the western United States}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE) is defined as the portion of
   carbon (C) incorporated into biomass relative to the total carbon
   consumed and plays a pivotal role in regulating microbially-mediated C
   and nutrient transformations in soil. However, little is understood
   about how CUE is impacted by edaphic properties, like soil moisture.
   Soil moisture physically regulates microbial activity through its
   effects on both water potential and water content. Low water potential
   can result in high, compensatory intracellular solute concentrations
   that may inhibit biochemical functions through cytoplasmic desiccation,
   whereas low soil water content results in thin water films that can
   limit substrate diffusion, reducing microbial access to dissolved
   substrates. Because these two aspects of soil moisture may affect
   microbial respiration differently than C assimilation, they may have
   different effects on CUE. The purpose of this research was to evaluate
   the relative importance of water potential and water content in
   regulating CUE of soil microbial communities. Moist soil incubations of
   a sandy loam soil were used to determine the impact of both aspects of
   soil moisture on CUE, and soil slurries were used to determine the
   impact of water potential alone. Both C-13-acetate and N-15-ammonium
   were added to moist soils and slurries to quantify gross rates of C and
   N transformations. In moist soils, acetate assimilation and respiration
   rates and gross N mineralization and immobilization rates increased
   exponentially with increasing soil moisture (3.0 to 0.03 MPa). In
   contrast, acetate assimilation and respiration and gross N
   transformation rates remained constant in soil slurries across a similar
   water potential gradient, created by modifying solute concentrations.
   Similarly, values of CUE in moist soils increased exponentially with
   increasing soil moisture, whereas slurry values of CUE remained constant
   across the soil water potential gradient. Because no changes in rates
   and CUE were observed in slurries, changes observed in moist soils were
   attributed to limited substrate diffusion associated with low water
   contents rather than to adverse physiological effects associated with
   low water potentials. Results of this study demonstrate that limited
   substrate diffusion is the primary physical mechanism through which soil
   moisture regulates microbially-mediated C and N transformation rates and
   CUE in this sandy loam soil.}},

   In a prospective cohort design, we equipped an early intervention
   service (EIS) and a community mental health team (CMHT) with a POC blood
   testing device for 6 months. We compared rates of blood test and full
   physical health check completion in the intervention teams with a
   matched EIS and CMHT, historically and during the intervention. We
   explored attitudes to POC testing using thematic analysis of
   semi-structured interviews with patients and clinicians.
   Results
   Although the CMHT scarcely used the POC device and saw no change in
   outcomes, direct comparison of testing rates in the intervention period
   showed increased physical health check completion in the EIS with the
   device (rate ratio RR = 5.18; 95\% CI 2.54-12.44; P < 0.001) compared
   with usual care. The rate was consistent with the EIS's increasing rate
   of testing over time (RR = 0.45; 95\% 0.09-2.08; P = 0.32). Similar
   trends were seen in blood test completion. POC testing was acceptable to
   patients but clinicians reported usability, provision and impact on the
   therapeutic relationship as barriers to uptake.
   Conclusions
   POC testing was beneficial and acceptable to patients and may increase
   physical health check uptake. Further research, accounting for clinician
   barriers, is needed to evaluate its clinical and cost-effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a game
   show-based curriculum improves obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN)
   residents' confidence in and understanding of the principles of
   reproductive infectious disease (RID), clinical manifestations and
   sequelae of sexually transmitted infection (STI), and management of
   serious long-term consequences of STIs.
   Methods: A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic
   principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing
   between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term
   sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic
   infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory
   disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of
   perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster
   virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and
   infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of
   obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis
   and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and
   hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large
   urban academic training program were randomized to either a
   Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional
   didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum
   alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to
   all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process.
   Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed
   confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4
   weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied
   to analyze the data.
   Results: Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game
   show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional
   didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100\%)
   completed the pre- and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar
   between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of
   48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091).
   The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and
   posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P <= 0.001). The traditional didactic-based
   curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4
   compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly
   higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional
   didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P =
   0.002).
   Conclusions: A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents'
   confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical
   manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term
   consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest
   time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game
   show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents.}},

Title = {{Evolution of the Unique Anuran Pelvic and Hind limb Skeleton in Relation

Abstract = {{Anurans (frogs and toads) have a unique pelvic and hind limb skeleton
   among tetrapods. Although their distinct body plan is primarily
   associated with saltation, anuran species vary in their primary
   locomotor mode (e.g., walkers, hoppers, jumpers, and swimmers) and are
   found in a wide array of microhabitats (e.g., burrowing, terrestrial,
   arboreal, and aquatic) with varying functional demands. Given their
   largely conserved body plan, morphological adaptation to these diverse
   niches likely results from more fine-scale morphological change. Our
   study determines how shape differences in Anura's unique pelvic and hind
   limb skeletal structures vary with microhabitat, locomotor mode, and
   jumping ability. Using microCT scans of preserved specimens from museum
   collections, we added 3D landmarks to the pelvic and hind limb skeleton
   of 230 anuran species. In addition, we compiled microhabitat and
   locomotor data from the literature for these species that span 52 of the
   55 families of frogs and similar to 210 million years of anuran
   evolution. Using this robust dataset, we examine the relationship
   between pelvic and hind limb morphology and phylogenetic history,
   allometry, microhabitat, and locomotor mode. We find pelvic and hind
   limb changes associated with shifts in microhabitat ({''}ecomorphs{''})
   and locomotor mode ({''}locomorphs{''}) and directly relate those
   morphological changes to the jumping ability of individual species. We
   also reveal how individual bones vary in evolutionary rate and their
   association with phylogeny, body size, microhabitat, and locomotor mode.
   Our findings uncover previously undocumented morphological variation
   related to anuran ecological and locomotor diversification and link that
   variation to differences in jumping ability among species.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ectoparasite protozoan Amyloodinium ocellatum (AO) is the
   etiological agent of amyloodiniosis in European seabass (Dicentrarchus
   labrax) (ESB). There is a lack of information about basic molecular data
   on AO biology and its interaction with the host. Therefore, de novo
   transcriptome sequencing of AO tomonts was performed. AO trophonts were
   detached from infested ESB gills, and quickly becoming early tomonts
   were purified by Percoll(R) density gradient. Tomont total RNA was
   processed and quality was assessed immediately. cDNA libraries were
   constructed using TruSeq(R) Stranded mRNA kit and sequenced using
   Illumina sequencer. CLC assembly was used to generate the Transcriptome
   assembly of AO tomonts. Out of 48,188 contigs, 56.12\% belong to
   dinophyceae wherein Symbiodinium microadriaticum had 94.61\% similarity
   among dinophyceae. Functional annotations of contigs indicated that
   12,677 had associated GO term, 9005 with KEGG term. The contigs
   belonging to dinophyceae resulted in the detection of several
   peptidases. A BLAST search for known virulent factors from the virulence
   database resulted in hits to Rab proteins, AP120, Ribosomal
   phosphoprotein, Heat-shock protein70, Casein kinases, Plasmepsin IV, and
   Brucipain. Hsp70 and casein kinase II alpha were characterized
   in-silico. Altogether, these results provide a reference database in
   understanding AO molecular biology, aiding to the development of novel
   diagnostics and future vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{The field of infancy research faces a difficult challenge: Some
   questions require samples that are simply too large for any 1 lab to
   recruit and test. ManyBabies aims to address this problem by forming
   large-scale collaborations on key theoretical questions in developmental
   science, while promoting the uptake of Open Science practices. Here, we
   look back on the first project completed under the ManyBabies
   umbrella-ManyBabies 1-which tested the development of infant-directed
   speech preference. Our goal is to share the lessons learned over the
   course of the project and to articulate our vision for the role of
   large-scale collaborations in the field. First, we consider the
   decisions made in scaling up experimental research for a collaboration
   involving 100+ researchers and 70+ labs. Next, we discuss successes and
   challenges over the course of the project, including the following:
   protocol design and implementation, data analysis, organisational
   structures and collaborative workflows, securing funding, and
   encouraging broad participation in the project. Finally, we discuss the
   benefits we see both in ongoing ManyBabies projects and in future
   large-scale collaborations in general, with a particular eye toward
   developing best practices and increasing growth and diversity in infancy
   research and psychological science in general. Throughout the article,
   we include first-hand narrative experiences to illustrate the
   perspectives of researchers playing different roles within the project.
   Although this project focused on the unique challenges of infant
   research, many of the insights we gained can be applied to large-scale
   collaborations across the broader field of psychology.}},

Abstract = {{Across temperate North America, interannual variability (IAV) in gross
   primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and their
   relationship with environmental drivers are poorly understood. Here, we
   examine IAV in GPP and NEE and their relationship to environmental
   drivers using two state-of-the-science flux products: NEE constrained by
   surface and space-based atmospheric CO2 measurements over 2010-2015 and
   satellite up-scaled GPP from FluxSat over 2001-2017. We show that the
   arid western half of temperate North America provides a larger
   contribution to IAV in GPP (104\% of east) and NEE (127\% of east) than
   the eastern half, in spite of smaller magnitude of annual mean GPP and
   NEE. This occurs because anomalies in western ecosystems are temporally
   coherent across the growing season leading to an amplification of GPP
   and NEE. In contrast, IAV in GPP and NEE in eastern ecosystems is
   dominated by seasonal compensation effects, associated with opposite
   responses to temperature anomalies in spring and summer. Terrestrial
   biosphere models in the MsTMIP ensemble generally capture these
   differences between eastern and western temperate North America,
   although there is considerable spread between models.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The current pandemic crisis, caused by a novel human
   coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV2), has forced a dramatic change in our society. A key portion
   of the medical work force on the frontline is composed of resident
   physicians. Thus, it becomes imperative to create an adequate and
   effective action plan to restructure this valuable human resource amid
   the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We sought to describe a comprehensive approach
   taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic
   institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic
   focused in resident training and support.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery
   Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States
   of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused on resident training and
   support.
   RESULTS: A restructuring of the Neurosurgery Department at our academic
   institution was performed focused on decreasing their risk of
   infection/exposure and transmission to others, while minimizing negative
   consequences in the training experience. An online academic platform was
   built for resident education, guidance, and support, as well as continue
   channel for pandemic update by the department leadership.
   CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic constitutes a global health
   emergency full of uncertainty. Treatment, scope, duration, and economic
   burden forced a major restructuring of our medical practice. In this
   regard, academic institutions must direct efforts to diminish further
   negative impact in the training and education of the upcoming generation
   of physicians, including those currently in medical school. Perhaps the
   only silver lining in this terrible disruption will be greater
   appreciation of the role of current health care providers and educators,
   whose contributions to our society are often neglected or unrecognized.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We study the optimal control of a government stabilization fund, which
   is a mechanism to save money during good economic times to be used in
   bad economic times. The objective of the fund manager is to keep the
   fund as close as possible to a predetermined target. Accordingly, we
   consider a running cost associated with the difference between the
   actual fiscal fund and the fund target. The fund manager exerts control
   over the fund by making deposits in or withdrawals from the fund. The
   withdrawals are used to pay public debt or to finance government
   programs. We obtain, for the first time in the literature, the optimal
   band for the government stabilization fund. Our results are of interest
   to practitioners. For instance, we find that the higher the volatility,
   the larger the size of the optimal band. In particular, each country and
   state should have its own optimal fund band, in contrast to the
   ``one-size-fits-all{''} approach that is often used in practice.}},

Title = {{Global reliability sensitivity analysis by Sobol-based dynamic adaptive
   kriging importance sampling}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{87}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The stochastic uncertainties affecting the models used to describe the
   behavior of structural/mechanical systems may give rise to unfavorable
   scenarios leading to failures. In this framework, the quantification of
   the failure probability is a recognized fundamental task for structural
   safety and reliability analyses. Unfortunately, the estimation of the
   failure probability of structural/mechanical systems is a
   computationally demanding task, especially when the failure is a rare
   event and the computer codes used to model the system response require
   large computational efforts. One major issue further complicates the
   estimation process, i.e., the parameters of the probability
   distributions of the random variables used to describe the uncertainties
   involved can, in turn, be imprecise, since they are typically estimated
   by means of statistical inference based on observations and engineering
   judgment. In this context, reliability sensitivity analysis aims at
   estimating the influence of this additional source of uncertainty on the
   system failure probability in order to assess the robustness of the
   system to the modeling of uncertainties. Intuitively, reliability
   sensitivity analyses may easily become prohibitive by standard
   sampling-based methods (e.g., Monte Carlo method), since a nested,
   second level of uncertainties is involved. To overcome this issue, in
   this work we embed the efficient AK-IS algorithm for estimating small
   failure probabilities within an original computational framework that
   allows to perform a Sobol-based, global sensitivity analysis of the
   failure probability at an affordable number of computer model
   evaluations. The algorithm is demonstrated with reference to two case
   studies of literature of structural/mechanical reliability, often used
   in the literature as benchmark tests.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{9083-9092}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this article, an universal sensorless starting scheme considering
   magnetic saturation effects is proposed to control the switched
   reluctance motor (SRM) drives. In this approach, the full-cycle
   unsaturated inductance can be reconstructed by converting the saturated
   incremental inductance into the unsaturated inductance with a simple
   mathematical model in the conduction region. Based on the reconstructed
   three-phase full-cycle unsaturated inductance, the inductance vector
   coordinate transformation method and the linear region inductance model
   based method can be applied for estimating the rotor position even under
   high load starting case. To verify the validity of the proposed methods,
   experiments have been implemented in a 1-kW three-phase 12/8 structure
   SRM prototype. The experimental results verify that the unsaturated
   inductance reconstruction scheme can transfer the nonlinear magnetic
   saturation problem into an unsaturation problem, and thus the rotor
   position estimation at the sensorless starting state can be simplified.
   The method can realize the initial position estimation and reliable
   sensorless starting control even under load conditions with only very
   simple initial inductance data acquisition, position partition logics
   design, and mathematic modeling. In addition, as the back-electromotive
   force is eliminated indirectly in the inductance calculation process,
   the adaptable speed range can also be extended.}},

Abstract = {{The insufficient removal of pollutants and bioelectricity production
   have become a bottleneck for high-concentration saline wastewater
   treatment through microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. Herein, a novel
   supercapacitor MFC (SC-MFC) was constructed with carbon nanofibers
   composite electrodes to investigate pollutant removal ability, power
   generation, and electrochemical properties using real landfill leachate.
   The possible extracellular electron transfer and nitrogen element
   conversion pathways in the bioanode were also analyzed. Results showed
   that the SC-MFC had higher pollutant removal rates (COD: 59.4 +/- 1.2\%;
   NH4+-N: 78.2 +/- 1.6\%; and TN: 77.8 +/- 1.2\%), smaller internal
   impedance R-t (similar to 6 Omega), higher exchange current density i(0)
   (2.1 x 10(-4) A cm(-2)), and a larger catalytic current j(0) (704 mu A
   cm(-2)) with 60\% leachate than those with 10\% and 20\% leachate,
   resulting in a power output of 298 +/- 22 mW Ammonium could be
   incorporated by chemoautotrophic bacteria to produce organic compounds
   that could be further utilized by heterotrophs to generate power when
   biodegradable organic matters are depleted. Three conversion pathways of
   nitrogen might be involved, including NH4+ diffusion from anode to
   cathode chamber, nitrification, and the denitrification process.
   Additionally, cyclic voltammetry tests showed that both the direct
   electron transfer (DET) and the mediator electron transfer in bioanode
   were involved and dominated by DET. The microbial analysis revealed that
   the bioanode was dominated by salt-tolerant denitrifying bacteria
   (38.5\%), which was deduced to be the key functional microorganism. The
   electrochemically active bacteria decreased significantly from 61.7\% to
   4\% over three stages of leachate treatment. Overall, the SC-MFC has
   demonstrated the potential for wastewater treatment along with energy
   harvesting and provides a new avenue toward sustainable leachate

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim: No study elucidated the role of fasting blood glucose (FBG) level
   in the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods: This cohort study was conducted in a single center at Renmin
   Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Clinical laboratory, and
   treatment data of inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were
   collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without
   pre-existing diabetes were compared. The associations of diabetes
   history and/or FBG levels with mortality were analyzed. Multivariate cox
   regression analysis on the risk factors associated with mortality in
   patients with COVID-19 was performed.
   Results: A total of 941 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were
   enrolled in the study. There was a positive relationship between
   pre-existing diabetes and the mortality of patients who developed
   COVID-19 (21 of 123 {[}17.1\%] vs 76 of 818 {[}9.3\%]; P = 0.012). FBG
   >7.0 mmol/L was an independent risk factor for the mortality of COVID-19
   regardless of the presence or not of a history of diabetes (hazard
   ratio, 2.20 {[}95\% CI, 1.21-4.03]; P = 0.010).
   Conclusions: We firstly showed FBG >7.0 mmol/L predicted worse outcome
   in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independent of diabetes history.
   Our findings indicated screening FBG level is an effective method to
   evaluate the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel low-cost solar-powered wearable assistive
   technology (AT) device, whose aim is to provide continuous, real-time
   object recognition to ease the finding of the objects for visually
   impaired (VI) people in daily life. The system consists of three major
   components: a miniature low-cost camera, a system on module (SoM)
   computing unit, and an ultrasonic sensor. The first is worn on the
   user's eyeglasses and acquires real-time video of the nearby space. The
   second is worn as a belt and runs deep learning-based methods and
   spatial algorithms which process the video coming from the camera
   performing objects' detection and recognition. The third assists on
   positioning the objects found in the surrounding space. The developed
   device provides audible descriptive sentences as feedback to the user
   involving the objects recognized and their position referenced to the
   user gaze. After a proper power consumption analysis, a wearable solar
   harvesting system, integrated with the developed AT device, has been
   designed and tested to extend the energy autonomy in the different
   operating modes and scenarios. Experimental results obtained with the
   developed low-cost AT device have demonstrated an accurate and reliable
   real-time object identification with an 86\% correct recognition rate
   and 215 ms average time interval (in case of high-speed SoM operating
   mode) for the image processing. The proposed system is capable of
   recognizing the 91 objects offered by the Microsoft Common Objects in
   Context (COCO) dataset plus several custom objects and human faces. In
   addition, a simple and scalable methodology for using image datasets and
   training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is introduced to add
   objects to the system and increase its repertory. It is also
   demonstrated that comprehensive trainings involving 100 images per
   targeted object achieve 89\% recognition rates, while fast trainings
   with only 12 images achieve acceptable recognition rates of 55\%.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   After a vehicle rollover led to the death of a military member in
   Central Africa in 2018, it became apparent there was a significant gap
   in the capability to collect toxicology samples of Service Members
   involved in accidents and mishaps at remote Special Operations Forces
   locations in Africa. Multiple misconceptions surrounding sample
   collection, procedures for laboratory evaluation, and methods for
   shipment signaled the importance of establishing a procedure and a plan
   to provide the necessary medical inventory to properly collect and ship
   samples.
   Materials and Methods
   The Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA) Surgeon's Office
   gathered the appropriate supplies for collection of forensic toxicology
   samples, and simultaneously developed a step-by-step checklist to safely
   and correctly perform urine and blood collection. The procedures were
   further improved after the completion of cognitive interviews with a
   Navy corpsman and Army Civil Affairs medic. Multiple shipping iterations
   occurred to ensure safe movement and arrival of samples at Armed Forces
   Medical Examiner System Dover AFB. Two Separate Specimens for Accident
   Forensic Toxicology Investigation Kits were generated to accommodate
   personnel typically associated with accidents involving vehicles and
   aircraft.
   Results
   SOCAFRICA's toxicology kit supports legal and medical chain of custody
   requirements for investigations, and provides deployed forces in Africa
   with a mechanism to collect and ship samples from Africa to Dover AFB.
   The kits are provided to ensure these samples are successfully analyzed,
   thereby removing any ambiguity surrounding an accident or mishap.
   Conclusion
   SOCAFRICA established a prepared kit with all of the materials for
   sample collection, accompanied by step-by-step descriptions of the
   procedure, and clear guidance on the proper completion of the requisite
   paperwork that meets medicolegal requirements.}},

Title = {{A Two-Step Energy Management Method Guided by Day-Ahead Quantile Solar

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The research work hereby presented, emerges from the urge to answer the
   well-known question of how the uncertainty of intermittent renewable
   sources affects the performance of a microgrid and how could we deal
   with it. More specifically, we want to evaluate what could be the impact
   in performance of a microgrid that is intended to serve a smart-building
   (powered by photovoltaic panels and with battery energy storage), when
   the uncertainty of the photovoltaic-production forecasts is considered
   in the energy management process through the use of quantile forecasts.
   For this, several objectives (or services) are targeted based in a
   two-step (double-objective) energy management framework, which combines
   optimization-based and rule-based algorithms. The performance is
   evaluated based on some particular services, namely: energy cost, carbon
   footprint, grid peak power, and grid commitment; with the latter being a
   novel service proposed in the domain of microgrids. Simulations are
   performed whlie using data of a study-case microgrid (Drahi-Xnovation
   center, Ecole Polytechnique, France). The use of quantile forecasts
   (obtained with an analog-ensemble method) is tested as a mean to deal
   with (i.e., decrease) the uncertainty of the solar PV production. The
   proposed energy management framework is compared with basic reference
   strategies and the results show the superior performance of the former
   in almost all of the proposed services and forecasting scenarios. The
   fact of how optimizing for some services during the scheduling (i.e.,
   grid commitment) can be highly detrimental for the performance of the
   non-targeted services, is an interesting finding of this work. The
   differences regarding the optimal forecasting eccentricity (i.e., the
   forecasting quantile) required when optimizing for the different
   services and seasons of the year is also considered an important
   conclusion of the study. This fact highlights the usefulness of the
   quantile forecasting approach in an energy management system, as a tool
   to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty of PV power production.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease
   (SCD) in pediatric and young adult patients, pain remains a significant
   cause of disease-related morbidity. Physical therapy has been shown to
   be useful for the treatment of pain in young patients with chronic
   illnesses, however, limited data exists regarding potential benefits of
   physical therapy in patients with SCD. Materials and Methods: We
   conducted a web-based survey of health care providers and support staff
   in the New England area to identify potential benefits of and barriers
   to outpatient physical therapy in this patient population. Results:
   Nearly 92\% of survey participants felt that physical therapy had the
   potential to be beneficial in pediatric and young adult patients with
   SCD. A majority of physicians reported having referred patients with SCD
   for physical therapy. Perceived potential benefits included improved
   functional mobility, improved chronic pain symptoms, decreased opiate
   use, improved mood symptoms, improved acute pain symptoms, and improved
   adherence with medications and clinic visits. Significant perceived
   barriers identified included lack of transportation, time constraints,
   patient lack of understanding, and difficulty with insurance coverage.
   Conclusions: Health care providers have a positive view of the use of
   physical therapy in the management of this patient population.
   Significant barriers exist which need to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{We compare dense clumps and cores in a numerical simulation of molecular
   clouds (MCs) undergoing global hierarchical collapse (GHC) to
   observations in two MCs at different evolutionary stages, the Pipe and
   the G14.225 clouds, to test the ability of the GHC scenario to follow
   the early evolution of the energy budget and star formation activity of
   these structures. In the simulation, we select a region that contains
   cores of sizes and densities similar to the Pipe cores and find that it
   evolves through accretion, developing substructure similar to that of
   the G14.225 cloud after similar to 1.6Myr. Within this region, we follow
   the evolution of the Larson ratio L = sigma(v)/R-1/2, where sigma(v) is
   the velocity dispersion and R is the size; the virial parameter a; and
   the star formation activity of the cores/clumps. In the simulation, we
   find that as the region evolves, (i) its clumps have. and a values first
   consistent with those of the Pipe substructures and later with those of
   G14.225; (ii) the individual cores first exhibit a decrease in a
   followed by an increase when star formation begins; (iii) collectively,
   the ensemble of cores/clumps reproduces the observed trend of lower a
   for higher-mass objects; and ( iv) the star formation rate and star
   formation efficiency increase monotonically. We suggest that this
   evolution is due to the simultaneous loss of externally driven
   compressive kinetic energy and increase of the self-gravity-driven
   motions. We conclude that the GHC scenario provides a realistic
   description of the evolution of the energy budget of the clouds'
   substructure at early times, which occurs simultaneously with an
   evolution of the star formation activity.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolite was investigated as a potential component in the production of
   medium-density fiberboard (MDF). A mixture of beech (40\%), oak (30\%),
   and pine (30\%) wood chips was used for fiber production. Chips were
   cooked for 4 min in an Asplund defibrator with a vapor pressure of 8
   bar, and a temperature of 180 degrees C. Chemicals were added on fibers
   in the blow line. The resins were added at 11 wt\% based on oven-dried
   wood fibers. Ammonium sulphate was added at 0.72 wt\% based on resins.
   Paraffin wax was added as 1.8 wt\% based on resin. Zeolite was prepared
   in a separate tank for its use instead of lignocellulosic fibers in the
   production of 1 m(3) MDF. The fibers were dried to 12\% moisture. A
   temperature of approximately 190 degrees C and a pressure of
   approximately 32 kg.m(-2) were applied to the mixture for 280 s to make
   MDF panels (500 x 490 x 14 mm). Mechanical properties of MDF boards were
   significantly increased for bending (MOE) and elastic modulus (MOR), but
   a little negatively affected on internal bond (16), physical properties
   were negatively increased thickness swelling (ThS) and water absorption
   (WA). Consequently, increasing zeolite minerals in MDF boards showed
   best results of formaldehyde emission properties of MDF.}},

Title = {{How are frames generated? Insights from the industry lobby against the
   sugar tax in Ireland}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{264}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a causal link between the consumption of ultra-processed foods
   and a range of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, type 2
   diabetes and cancers. Despite this, no country in the world has reduced
   its obesity levels because the factors that drive obesity continue
   unchanged (Swinburn et al., 2019). One systemic driver is corporate
   influence on the public policy process. The world's largest food and
   beverage manufacturers engage public relations firms to create a
   narrative which speaks of corporate cooperation with public health
   policy, while simultaneously influencing policy making in ways that are
   favorable to industry.
   We sought to examine framing as a key strategy in the corporate
   political activity of food industry actors attempting to resist the
   introduction of a public health policy. Specifically, we analyzed
   industry submissions for an Irish government consultation for the
   proposed introduction of a sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) tax in 2018.
   We describe how a food product like sugar is framed positively by
   corporate actors who rely on it as their principal ingredient. Sugar is
   a good focus from a framing perspective because it is currently
   undergoing recalibration in the public's imagination - from a benign,
   nourishing treat in its heyday to a dangerous `substance' that can
   contribute to premature mortality.
   Framing is already well established as a corporate political activity
   (CPA) to influence public policy (Shelton et al., 2017; Nixon et al.,
   2015; Darmon et al., 2008). Our research expands this understanding by
   uncovering four underlying mechanisms used to generate frames
   dichotomizing, contesting, equating and cropping. Recognizing these
   mechanisms could help policy makers, public health professionals and
   business ethicists to deconstruct any given frame that becomes dominant
   in corporate discourse, such as `personal responsibility', `inadequate
   exercise', `freedom' and so on. These mechanisms may also apply to other
   industries such as alcohol, fossil fuels and tobacco, where hazards from
   interference in public health strategies are a concern.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The negative consequences of hearing loss go beyond difficulties with
   communication, having been identified as a major risk factor for injury
   and illness, social isolation, depression, overall quality of life, and
   mortality. Hearing loss affects the individual, their families and
   social network, the broader healthcare system, and the economy.
   Recognizing that there are multifactorial considerations associated with
   understanding and mitigating the consequences of hearing loss, great
   benefit is gained by taking an interdisciplinary, interprofessional,
   holistic approach to studying hearing loss in research and in developing
   holistic clinical strategies targeted at prevention, diagnosis,
   treatment, and social policy. Within the framework of this supplement
   focused on the role of ecological validity in hearing-related research
   and application, this article provides a general commentary on how
   ecological validity can be considered with a holistic perspective in
   mind. First, we consider how a holistic approach can be applied within
   clinical practice, how it can be applied to laboratory-based research to
   increase ecological validity, and how it can be applied to professional
   training and education within both research and clinical domains.
   Second, we discuss the associations between hearing loss and dementia as
   an example of how these holistic principles can be applied. The main
   goal of highlighting these approaches and principles is to motivate a
   change in the narrative about hearing loss from a focus in research and
   application on promoting healthy hearing, to a focus on living well.}},

Title = {{The burden of esophageal dilatations following repair of esophageal

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2329-2334}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim: To describe the burden of esophageal dilatations in patients
   following esophageal atresia (EA) repair.
   Method: A retrospective review was performed at The Royal Children's
   Hospital, Melbourne, of all neonates undergoing operative repair for EA
   over a 17-year period (1999-2015). Stricture was defined by radiological
   and/or intra-operative findings of narrowing at the esophageal
   anastomosis. Data recorded included EA type, perinatal details,
   operative approach, esophageal anastomosis outcome, dilatation
   requirement, and survival. Key endpoints were anastomotic leakage and
   tension, esophageal dilatation technique, dilatation frequency,
   fundoplication, and complications.
   Results: During the study period, 287 newborn EA patients were admitted,
   of which 258 underwent operative repair and survived to primary
   discharge. Excluding 11 patients with isolated tracheoesophageal
   fistula, 247 patients were included in the final analysis.
   Intra-operative anastomotic tension was documented in 41/247 (16.6\%),
   anastomotic leak occurred in 48/247 (19.4\%), and fundoplication was
   performed in 37/247 (15.0\%). Dilatations were performed in 149/247
   (60.3\%). Techniques included bougie-alone (92/149, 61.7\%), combination
   of bougie and balloon (51/149, 34.2\%), and balloon-alone (6/149,
   4.0\%). These patients underwent 1128 dilatations; median number of
   dilatations per patient was 4 (interquartile range 2-8). Long-gap EA and
   anastomotic tension were risk factors (p < 0.01) for multiple
   dilatations. Complications occurred in 13/1128 (1.2\%) dilatation
   episodes: 11/13 esophageal perforation, 2/13 clinically significant
   aspiration. Perforations were rare events in both balloon (6/287, 2.1\%)
   and bougie dilatations (4/841, 0.5\%); one patient had a perforation
   from guidewire insertion.
   Conclusions: Esophageal dilatation occurred in a majority of EA
   patients. Long-gap EA was associated with an increased burden of
   esophageal dilatation. Perforations were rare events in balloon and
   bougie dilatations. Type of study: Original article - retrospective

Title = {{Budgerigars have complex sleep structure similar to that of mammals}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Birds and mammals share specialized forms of sleep including slow wave
   sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), raising the question of
   why and how specialized sleep evolved. Extensive prior studies concluded
   that avian sleep lacked many features characteristic of mammalian sleep,
   and therefore that specialized sleep must have evolved independently in
   birds and mammals. This has been challenged by evidence of more complex
   sleep in multiple songbird species. To extend this analysis beyond
   songbirds, we examined a species of parrot, the sister taxon to
   songbirds. We implanted adult budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) with
   electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes to
   evaluate sleep architecture, and video monitored birds during sleep.
   Sleep was scored with manual and automated techniques, including
   automated detection of slow waves and eye movements. This can help
   define a new standard for how to score sleep in birds. Budgerigars
   exhibited consolidated sleep, a pattern also observed in songbirds, and
   many mammalian species, including humans. We found that REM constituted
   26.5\% of total sleep, comparable to humans and an order of magnitude
   greater than previously reported. Although we observed no spindles, we
   found a clear state of intermediate sleep (IS) similar to non-REM (NREM)
   stage 2. Across the night, SWS decreased and REM increased, as observed
   in mammals and songbirds. Slow wave activity (SWA) fluctuated with a
   29-min ultradian rhythm, indicating a tendency to move systematically
   through sleep states as observed in other species with consolidated
   sleep. These results are at variance with numerous older sleep studies,
   including for budgerigars. Here, we demonstrated that lighting
   conditions used in the prior budgerigar study-and commonly used in older
   bird studies-dramatically disrupted budgerigar sleep structure,
   explaining the prior results. Thus, it is likely that more complex sleep
   has been overlooked in a broad range of bird species. The similarities
   in sleep architecture observed in mammals, songbirds, and now
   budgerigars, alongside recent work in reptiles and basal birds, provide
   support for the hypothesis that a common amniote ancestor possessed the
   precursors that gave rise to REM and SWS at one or more loci in the
   parallel evolution of sleep in higher vertebrates. We discuss this
   hypothesis in terms of the common plan of forebrain organization shared
   by reptiles, birds, and mammals.}},

Title = {{The neuroprotective action of lenalidomide on rotenone model of
   Parkinson's Disease: Neurotrophic and supportive actions in the
   substantia nigra pars compacta}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{738}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Lenalidomide is a centrally active thalidomide analog that has potent
   anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic activities. Currently, it is
   primarily used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic
   syndromes. However, recent studies have revealed in addition to
   neuroprotection and neuromodulation of lenalidomide. Because of this
   combination of inflammation and neuro-immunogenic properties,
   lenalidomide is considered as a high potential compound for the
   treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite intensive research
   during the last decade, the role of neurotrophic elements in the effect
   of lenalidomide is still not well understood. Therefore, in the current
   study, the effects of lenalidomide on neurodegeneration were
   investigated in a rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model.
   The PD rat model was generated by rotenone injection into the substantia
   nigra pars compacta (SNpc). After validation of the PD model, the rats
   were treated with lenalidomide (100 mg/kg) for 28 days. Our data shows
   that lenalidomide alleviated rotenone-induced motor impairments and
   deficits in dopamine-related behaviors and resulted in increased levels
   of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and calcium-binding protein B in the
   SNpc. Moreover, chronic lenalidomide treatment resulted increase in
   transforming growth factor immunoreactivity and brain derived
   neurotrophic factor expression in the SNPc. In addition, chronic
   treatment mitigated tyrosine hydroxylase expression prevented the
   rotenone-induced decrease in dopamine levels, and consequently a
   decrease in caspase-3/9 immunoreactivity. This thus shows that chronic
   lenalidomide treatment improves neuronal survival. Together with our
   data demonstrate that lenalidomide, in addition to its anti-inflammatory
   and immunomodulatory actions, is also capable of increasing neurotrophic
   factors in the SNpc, thereby preventing rotenone-induced motor
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperlipidemia is closely associated with various liver diseases, and
   effective intervention for prevention and treatment is in great need.
   Here, we aim to explore the protective effects of punicalagin (PU), a
   major ellagitannin in pomegranate, on acute hyperlipidemia-induced
   hepatic lipid metabolic disorders. Male C57bl/6J mice were pretreated
   with 50 or 200 mg kg(-1) day(-1) PU for 9 days before the injection of
   poloxamer 407 to induce acute hyperlipidemia. PU significantly lowered
   lipids and liver damage markers in serum, reduced excessive lipid
   accumulation in the liver, attenuated hepatic oxidative stress by
   activating the NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant
   pathway, and enhanced hepatic mitochondrial complex activities and
   mitochondrial DNA copy number by promoting the peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1
   alpha)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis pathway. Moreover, the
   decreased mitochondrial fusion-related proteins were also restored by PU
   treatment. In vitro, PU effectively decreased triglycerides and total
   cholesterol levels, up-regulated Nrf2 and mitochondrial biogenesis
   pathways and partially restored the mitochondrial morphology in palmitic
   acid-treated HepG2 cells. These results suggest that PU could improve
   acute hyperlipidemia-induced hepatic lipid metabolic abnormalities via
   decreasing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function both in
   vivo and in vitro, indicating that PU might be a potential intervention
   for hyperlipidemia-related liver diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to assess implementation adherence (how well
   the patient's actual intake matches the prescribed dosing regimen) to
   non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC s) and to explore
   experiences with and beliefs about NOAC s in a real-world sample of
   long-term NOAC users.
   Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in
   home-dwelling adults who started taking a NOAC at least 1 year prior to
   inclusion. Pharmacy dispensing data were used to calculate the
   Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). Patients were recruited in 158
   community pharmacies in Flanders, Belgium. They completed a
   questionnaire collecting basic characteristics and exploring
   self-reported adherence to NOAC s (using the Medication Adherence Report
   Scale, MARS) and experiences with and beliefs about NOAC s (using the
   Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, BMQ).
   Results A total of 766 patients (mean age 76.2 +/- 8.8 years, median CHA
   2DS 2-VASc score 4 (IQR=3-4)) were included. The majority (93.5\%) used
   NOAC for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The median MPR was
   95.2\% (IQR=87.8-99.7) which corresponds with half of the study
   population not taking their NOAC on at least 17 cumulative days per
   year. Almost 21\% of participants reported non-adherence on the MARS
   (score <25), with unintentional non-adherence (forgetfulness) most
   frequently reported (15.4\%). Although two-thirds of NOAC users
   indicated to experience adverse drug reactions, the BMQ demonstrated a
   positive attitude towards NOAC therapy, where necessity beliefs outweigh
   the concerns.
   Conclusions Our data indicate that long-term NOAC users have high
   implementation adherence and a positive attitude towards NOAC therapy.
   However, taking into account patients' thromboembolic risk and NOACs'
   short half-lives, further optimisation of NOAC use seems warranted in
   this population.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Dietary Administration of Chestnut and Quebracho Tannins
   on Growth, Serum Metabolites and Fecal Parameters of Weaned Piglets}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   In pig livestock, alternatives to in-feed antibiotics are needed to
   promote health status and to control enteric infections. Plant extracts
   containing biologically-active molecules may influence animal metabolism
   and performance, therefore potentially reducing the use of antibiotics
   in pigs. Tannins have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial
   properties, and have been adopted to enhance growth performance,
   modulate intestinal microbiota, and decrease the incidence of diarrhea,
   particularly during the post-weaning period. Despite their functional
   properties, tannins are known to be astringent compounds due to their
   ability to complex and precipitate proteins, particularly proline-rich
   proteins. The common use of non-standardized plant extracts generates
   results that are often controversial and difficult to interpret. In this
   study, attention was focused on the evaluation of the inclusion of a
   mixture of tannins extracted from chestnut and quebracho in the diet of
   piglets.
   In pig livestock, alternatives to in-feed antibiotics are needed to
   control enteric infections. Plant extracts such as tannins can represent
   an alternative as a natural source of functional compounds. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the in vitro digestibility and in vivo
   effects of oral supplementation of combined chestnut (Ch) and quebracho
   (Qu) tannins in order to establish if they can induce a positive effect
   on weaned piglets' performance, metabolic status and fecal parameters.
   In vitro digestibility (dry matter, DM) of diets was calculated using a
   multi-step enzymatic technique. In vitro digested diet samples were
   further tested on an intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2).
   Weaned piglets (n = 120; 28 +/- 2 day old) were randomly allotted to two
   groups (12 pens in total with 10 pigs per pen): control (Ctrl) and
   treatment (Ch/Qu). After one week of adaptation (day 0), 35-day-old
   piglets in the Ctrl group were fed a Ctrl diet and the Ch/Qu group were
   fed with 1.25\% Ch/Qu for 40 days. Body weight and feed intake per pen
   were recorded weekly. At day 40, blood and fecal samples were collected.
   Principal metabolic parameters were evaluated from blood samples by
   enzymatic colorimetric analysis. Total phenolic compounds, urea, and
   ammonia in feces were analyzed (Megazyme International, Bray, Ireland).
   In vitro digestibility and cell viability assays showed that the
   inclusion of 1.25\% Ch/Qu slightly reduced diet digestibility compared
   with the Ctrl diet, while intestinal cell viability was not altered with
   low concentrations of Ch/Qu digesta compared with Ctrl. In vivo results
   did not show any adverse effects of Ch/Qu on feed intake and growth
   performance, confirming that dietary inclusion of Ch/Qu at a
   concentration of 1.25\% did not impair animal performance. The decreased
   diet DM digestibility in the Ch/Qu diet may cause increased serum
   concentration of albumin (Ctrl: 19.30 +/- 0.88; Ch/Qu: 23.05 +/- 0.88)
   and albumin/globulin ratio (Ctrl: 0.58 +/- 0.04; Ch/Qu: 0.82 +/- 0.04),
   but decreased creatinine (Ctrl: 78.92 +/- 4.18; Ch/Qu: 54.82 +/- 4.18)
   and urea (Ctrl: 2.18 +/- 0.19; Ch/Qu: 0.95 +/- 0.19) compared with Ctrl.
   Pigs in the Ch/Qu group contained higher (p < 0.05) concentrations of
   fecal phenolic compounds and nitrogen than the Ctrl group, while fecal
   ammonia and urea were not affected by tannins. In conclusion, Ch/Qu
   tannin supplementation did not influence growth performance.
   Although lower digestibility was observed in the diet supplemented with
   Ch/Qu tannins, Ch/Qu supplementation did not show any adverse effect on
   intestinal epithelial cell viability.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes represent a considerable nuisance and are actual/potential
   vectors of human diseases in Europe. Costly and labour-intensive
   entomological monitoring is needed to correct planning of interventions
   aimed at reducing nuisance and the risk of pathogen transmission. The
   widespread availability of mobile phones and of massive Internet
   connections opens the way to the contribution of citizen in
   complementing entomological monitoring. ZanzaMapp is the first mobile
   ``mosquito{''} application for smartphones specifically designed to
   assess citizens' perception of mosquito abundance and nuisance in Italy.
   Differently from other applications targeting mosquitoes, ZanzaMapp
   prioritizes the number of records over their scientific authentication
   by requesting users to answer four simple questions on perceived
   mosquito presence/abundance/nuisance and geo-localizing the records. The
   paper analyses 36,867 ZanzaMapp records sent by 13,669 devices from 2016
   to 2018 and discusses the results with reference to either citizens'
   exploitation and appreciation of the app and to the consistency of the
   results obtained with the known biology of main mosquito species in
   Italy. In addition, we provide a first small-scale validation of
   ZanzaMapp data as predictors of Aedes albopictus biting females and
   examples of spatial analyses and maps which could be exploited by public
   institutions and administrations involved in mosquito and mosquito-borne
   pathogen monitoring and control.}},

Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we give an explicit parametrisation of the moduli space of
   equivariant harmonic maps from a 2-torus to the 3-sphere. As Hitchin
   proved, a harmonic map of a 2-torus is described by its spectral data,
   which consists of a hyperelliptic curve together with a pair of
   differentials and a line bundle. The space of spectral data is naturally
   a fibre bundle over the space of spectral curves. For homogeneous tori
   the space of spectral curves is a disc and the bundle is trivial. For
   tori with a onedimensional invariance group, we enumerate the path
   connected components of the space of spectral curves and show that they
   are either `helicoids' or annuli, and that they densely foliate the
   parameter space. The bundle structure of the moduli space of spectral
   data over the annuli components is nontrivial. In the two cases, the
   spectral data require only elementary and elliptic functions
   respectively and we give explicit formulae at every stage. Homogeneous
   tori and the Gauss maps of Delaunay cylinders are used as illustrative
   examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   European Sea Bass Welfare through a Multi-Parametric Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Three groups of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were fed for
   seven months, with either a conventional diet or two different organic
   diets, which contain organic vegetables and a natural antioxidant
   compound. The two organic diets differed themselves in terms of raw
   proteins, fish oil, and lipid contents. Sea bass welfare condition was
   assessed in relation to these three diets, using 16 different
   indicators. These were: swimming activity (recovery test, muscle
   activity), haematological and serological stress indicators
   (haematocrit, haemoglobin, red-blood-cell count, cortisol, glucose,
   lactate), aspecific immunity parameter (lysozyme), indicators of
   exposure to organic contaminants (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and
   glutathione-S-transferase), and growth parameters (weight gain, specific
   growth rate, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and
   hepato-somatic index). Most of these parameters individually did not
   give consistent responses, but their integration can provide an accurate
   evaluation of the fish welfare conditions among the three diet
   experimental groups. The multiparametric approach outlined a
   comprehensive picture of sea bass physiological state. The principal
   component analysis and the multi-criteria-decision-analysis were found
   to be useful tools for an integrated fish welfare assessment,
   highlighting that the best welfare condition was achieved in the
   experimental group fed with the protein-rich organic diet.}},

Title = {{On a functional of Kobayashi for Higgs bundles}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We define a functional J(h) for the space of Hermitian metrics on an
   arbitrary Higgs bundle over a compact Kahler manifold, as a natural
   generalization of the mean curvature energy functional of Kobayashi for
   holomorphic vector bundles, and study some of its basic properties. We
   show that J(h) is bounded from below by a nonnegative constant depending
   on invariants of the Higgs bundle and the Kattier manifold, and that
   when achieved, its absolute minima are Hermite-Yang-Mills metrics. We
   derive a formula relating J(h) and another functional I(h), closely
   related to the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional, which can be thought of as
   an extension of a formula of Kobayashi for holomorphic vector bundles to
   the Higgs bundles setting. Finally, using 1-parameter families in the
   space of Hermitian metrics on a Higgs bundle, we compute the first
   variation of J(h), which is expressed as a certain L-2 -Hermitian inner
   product. It follows that a Hermitian metric on a Higgs bundle is a
   critical point of J(h) if and only if the corresponding Hitchin-Simpson
   mean curvature is parallel with respect to the Hitchin-Simpson
   connection.}},

Title = {{Canonical WNT pathway is activated in the airway epithelium in chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease}},
Journal = {{EBIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{61}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
   devastating lung disease, mainly due to cigarette smoking, which
   represents the third cause of mortality worldwide. The mechanisms
   driving its epithelial salient features remain largely elusive. We aimed
   to evaluate the activation and the role of the canonical,
   beta-catenin-dependant WNT pathway in the airway epithelium from COPD
   patients.
   Methods: The WNT/beta-catenin pathway was first assessed by WNT-targeted
   RNA sequencing of the air/liquid interface-reconstituted bronchial
   epithelium from COPD and control patients. Airway expression of total
   and active beta-catenin was assessed in lung sections, as well as WNT
   components in laser-microdissected airway epithelium. Finally, we
   evaluated the role of WNT at the bronchial epithelial level by
   modulating the pathway in the reconstituted COPD epithelium.
   Findings: We show that the WNT/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated in
   the COPD airway epithelium as compared with that of non-smokers and
   control smokers, in targeted RNA-sequencing of in vitro reconstituted
   airway epithelium, and in situ in lung tissue and laser-microdissected
   epithelium. Extrinsic activation of this pathway in COPD-derived airway
   epithelium inhibited epithelial differentiation, polarity and barrier
   function, and induced TGF-beta-related epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT). Conversely, canonical WNT inhibition increased
   ciliated cell numbers, epithelial polarity and barrier function, whilst
   inhibiting EMT, thus reversing COPD features.
   Interpretation: In conclusion, the aberrant reactivation of the
   canonical WNT pathway in the adult airway epithelium recapitulates the
   diseased phenotype observed in COPD patients, suggesting that this
   pathway or its downstream effectors could represent a future therapeutic
   target. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We study the impact of exchange rate misalignment on economic activity
   in nine Central and Eastern European economies. Exchange rate
   misalignments are computed from country-specific long-run exchange rate
   relationships with determinants suggested by open macroeconomic models

   There was a clear reduction in misalignments, but this has been reversed
   to some extent after 2008. Exchange rate overvaluation has a negative
   impact on economic activity. The effect of misalignments on economic
   activity seems to be nonlinear, as overvaluation has a stronger effect
   than undervaluation. Other factors of economic activity, including
   institutions, also show nonlinear effects.}},

Title = {{The Absence of a Validated English-Language Survey to Assess Prosthesis
   Satisfaction: A Prospective Cohort Using the Sexual Quality of Life
   After Penile Prosthesis}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prior assessments of sexual quality of life (SQoL) after
   penile prosthesis implantation have been performed without validated
   implant-specific tools. The Quality of Life and Sexuality with Penile
   Prosthesis (QoLSPP) questionnaire was designed and validated in Italian
   to specifically evaluate SQoL after a penile prosthesis is placed.
   Aim: We aim to better characterize prosthesis-specific SQoL after
   inflatable penile prosthesis placement using the English translation of
   the QoLSPP questionnaire.
   Methods: A total of 395 consecutive patients received an inflatable
   penile prosthesis between January 1, 2009 and November 27, 2017, and 270
   had functional emails to whom the QoLSPP questionnaire was sent. 90
   surveys were completed by 75 first-time implantees and 15 patients who
   underwent removal/replacement sur-gery. Responses were considered
   positive if 55 years, 55-65 years, and 1 year, 1-5 years, and 5 years),
   device model (Coloplast Titan, AMS 700 CX, and AMS LGX), history of a
   psychiatric diagnosis, etiology of erectile dysfunction, total device
   length > or < 21 cm, diabetes status, and body mass index < /> 30.
   Responses were analyzed in R using t-tests for continuous variables and
   Chi-squared tests (Fisher's for small counts) for categorical variables.
   Outcomes: The main outcome measure of this study was sexual quality of
   life assessed by QoLSPP.
   Results: Patients completed the survey on average 3.15 years from their
   most recent prosthesis placement. 84\% of first-time implantees had
   positive responses. Among them, there were no significant differences in
   the proportion of positive responses by device type, age, history of a
   psychiatric diagnosis, total implanted device length, etiology of
   erectile dysfunction, diabetes, or body mass index statuses (all P >
   .05). There was no difference in SQoL between first-time implantees and
   those who underwent removal/replacement surgery (P 1/4 1.0).
   Clinical Implications: Patients experience a positive impact on their
   SQoL following implantation of a penile prosthesis.
   Strengths \& Limitations: Our study is the first to apply the English
   language QoLSPP which demonstrates high prosthesis specific SQoL but is
   limited by size and a lack of a validated English language tool.
   Conclusions: The positive impact on patients' SQoL with penile
   prosthesis is 84\% when assessed by the English QoLSPP questionnaire.
   While these results mirror those reported from Italy, the
   English-speaking patient population is plagued with a lack of a
   validated tool to assess satisfaction, a void the academic and
   prosthetic community must fill to better understand the impact
   prostheses have on their patients. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf

Abstract = {{Research on American universities' involvement in slavery has primarily
   been historical We drew upon Critical Race Quantitative Inquiry, or
   QuantCrit, to devise a methodology to measure various ways Black college
   students respond to their institution's history of slavery, and to

   from 93 students of African descent at a Southern US institution
   historically involved in slavery. Multiple linear regression models
   accounted for 35.9\% of the variance in students' emotional responses,
   27.3\% in behavioral responses, and 13.6\% in psychological responses to
   the institution's enslavement history. Statistical results show the
   relevance of background characteristics and contemporary racialized
   experiences in predicting student responses. Based on the findings of
   this exploratory study, we recommend that as leaders of institutions
   with histories of slavery consider ways to address their respective
   histories through higher education reparations, that they consider the
   impact of this violent history on contemporary Black students. Next
   steps to expand the study and further explore the impact of university

   transformation of ookinetes into oocysts in the absence of Hsp70-1. The
   presence of this protein in micronemes suggests its participation in

Abstract = {{Objective
   To define headache characteristics and evolution in relation to COVID-19
   and its inflammatory response.
   Methods
   This is a prospective study, comparing clinical data and inflammatory
   biomarkers of COVID-19 patients with and without headache, recruited at
   the Emergency Room. We compared baseline with 6-week follow-up to
   evaluate disease evolution.
   Results
   Of 130 patients, 74.6\% (97/130) had headache. In all, 24.7\% (24/97) of
   patients had severe pain with migraine-like features. Patients with
   headache had more anosmia/ageusia (54.6\% vs. 18.2\%; p < 0.0001).
   Clinical duration of COVID-19 was shorter in the headache group (23.9
   +/- 11.6 vs. 31.2 +/- 12.0 days; p = 0.028). In the headache group, IL-6
   levels were lower at the ER (22.9 (57.5) vs. 57.0 (78.6) pg/mL; p =
   0.036) and more stable during hospitalisation. After 6 weeks, of 74
   followed-up patients with headache, 37.8\% (28/74) had ongoing headache.
   Of these, 50\% (14/28) had no previous headache history. Headache was
   the prodromal symptom of COVID-19 in 21.4\% (6/28) of patients with
   persistent headache (p = 0.010).
   Conclusions
   Headache associated with COVID-19 is a frequent symptom, predictive of a
   shorter COVID-19 clinical course. Disabling headache can persist after
   COVID-19 resolution. Pathophysiologically, its migraine-like features
   may reflect an activation of the trigeminovascular system by
   inflammation or direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2, a hypothesis supported
   by concomitant anosmia.}},

   ionic liquids versus commercial coatings}},
Journal = {{MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of bodies generates several types of polar volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs), whose types, patterns and ratios change during
   the various stages of decomposition and, therefore, their determination
   has huge potential to provide useful information to disclose events
   related to the time of death, or body surrounding environment. As sample
   preparation is a mandatory key-point in a method development, this
   research aims to develop a simple, accurate and rapid approach to study
   death-related polar VOCs based on headspace solid-phase microextraction
   (HS-SPME) combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas
   chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-ToFMS)
   analysis. The performance of zwitterionic PIL-based fibers (containing a
   {[}VIm(+)C(9)COO(-)] monomer and a {[}(VIm)(2)Cl-2(2)+]-2Br(-)
   crosslinker), tailored for polar compounds, was evaluated for a set of
   19 analytes associated with the unique odour created by decomposing
   bodies, and it was compared to the commercially-available fibers:
   divinylbenzene/carboxen/poly(dimethylsiloxane) - DVB/CAR/PDMS,
   poly(dimethylsiloxane)/divinylbenzene - PDMS/DVB and polyacrylate (PA).
   Fibers with absorptive-type mechanism, such as PA and PIL, showed the
   best results in the balance of the parameters studied, being able to
   detect analytes at ng level and providing a profile representative of
   the headspace composition, thus they may represent a useful tool to
   respond to current challenges in forensic taphonomy. The reproducibility
   (with relative standard deviation lower than 18\%, depending on the
   analyte) and relative recoveries (higher than 99.1\%) were similar and
   acceptable for both fibers. The zwitterionic PIL, with ca. 4 times
   smaller film thickness than PA, still has potential to have the best
   performance, supported by the efforts to obtain thicker sorbent
   coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are frequently used in
   critically ill neonates. UAC are convenient, reliable, and allow for
   caregiver convenience in performing painless arterial blood sampling. We
   hypothesized that UAC removal in extremely low birth weight (ELBW)
   neonates will result in significantly less phlebotomy blood loss (PBL)
   after correcting for severity of illness. Study Design and Methods: PBL
   was measured at a single center in 99 ELBW infants who survived to day
   28. Individual infant's paired daily PBL for the two 24-h periods before
   and after UAC removal were compared using the paired t test. Daily PBL
   up to 7 days before and 7 days after UAC removal were compared using a
   logistic regression with mixed model analysis for repeated measures.
   Cumulative 28-day phlebotomy loss was evaluated by multiple linear
   regression analysis. Results: PBL 24 h before and after UAC removal were
   1.7 mL (95\% CI 1.5-1.9) and 0.9 mL (95\% CI 0.8-1.0; p < 0.0001),
   respectively. Cumulative 28-day PBL increased by 2.2 mL (+/- 0.7) per
   day that a UAC was present with or without correction for severity of
   illness (p < 0.001). Conclusion: UAC removal is independently associated
   with a marked decline in PBL. We speculate the ease and convenience of
   UAC blood sampling lead to more frequent blood testing and greater PBL.}},

Title = {{Does angler willingness-to-pay for changes in harvest regulations vary
   by state? Results from a choice experiment in the Gulf of Mexico}},
Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Information on the economic value of changes in harvest regulations such
   as bag limits is necessary to understand the economic benefits and costs
   of recreational fishing policies. As fishery managers consider policies
   that vary across space, time, and angler groups we need information on
   the distribution of angler willingness-to pay (WTP) for regulations
   across these dimensions. In this paper we ask whether angler WTP for
   changes in bag limits varies by state of license. We estimated an angler
   choice model using data from a stated preference choice experiment in
   the Gulf of Mexico. The parameters of the model were used to calculate
   the distribution of WTP for changes in bag limits for dolphinfish,
   snapper, red snapper, grouper, and king mackerel. Using the bag limit
   WTP distributions for each species we examined whether WTP varied by
   state in a statistically significant and economically meaningful way. We
   found that anglers with a license to fish in Florida were willing to pay
   relatively more for grouper bag limits than anglers with a license to
   fish in Louisiana. We also found that anglers with a license to fish in
   Alabama or Mississippi were willing to pay relatively more for red
   snapper bag limits than anglers with a license to fish in Florida. There
   were not significant differences in the WTP for the bag limits among
   anglers with a license to fish in Louisiana and anglers with a license
   to fish in Alabama or Mississippi.}},

Abstract = {{Only in the last decade the long-term consequences of sepsis started to
   be studied and even less attention has been given to the treatment of
   psychological symptoms of sepsis survivors. It is estimated that 60\% of
   sepsis survivors have psychological disturbances, including depression,
   anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Although the causative factors remain
   largely poorly understood, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbances,
   neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress have been investigated.
   Therefore, we sought to explore if the immunomodulatory and antioxidant
   selenocompound 3-{[}(4-chlorophenyl)selanyl]-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI)
   would be able to ameliorate long-term behavioral and biochemical
   alterations in sepsis survivors male Swiss mice. CMI treatment (1 mg/kg,
   given orally for seven consecutive days) attenuated depression- and
   anxiogenic-like behaviors and cognitive impairment present one month
   after the induction of sepsis (lipopolysaccharide, 5 mg/kg
   intraperitoneally). Meantime, CMI treatment modulated the number of
   neutrophils and levels of reactive species in neutrophils, lymphocytes,
   and monocytes. In addition, peripheral markers of liver and kidneys
   dysfunction (AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine) were reduced after CMI
   treatment in post-septic mice. Notably, CMI treatment to non-septic mice
   did not alter AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine levels, indicating the
   absence of acute hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity following CMI
   treatment. Noteworthy, CMI ameliorated BBB dysfunction induced by
   sepsis, modulating the expression of inflammation-associated genes (NF
   kappa B, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IDO, COX-2, iNOS, and BDNF) and markers
   of oxidative stress (reactive species, nitric oxide, and lipid
   peroxidation levels) in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of mice.
   In conclusion, we unraveled crucial molecular pathways that are impaired
   in post-septic mice and we present CMI as a promising therapeutic
   candidate aimed to manage the longlasting behavioral alterations of
   sepsis survivors to improve their quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis-related
   cardiovascular diseases (CVD) share common metabolic pathways. We
   explored the association between three NAFLD-associated single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs738409, rs10401969, and rs1260326 with
   sub-clinical atherosclerosis estimated by the carotid intima-media
   thickness (c-IMT) and the inter-adventitia common carotid artery
   diameter (ICCAD) in patients free from clinically overt NAFLD and CVD.
   The study population is the IMPROVE, a multicenter European study (n =
   3711). C-IMT measures and ICCAD were recorded using a standardized
   protocol. Linear regression with an additive genetic model was used to
   test for association of the three SNPs with c-IMT and ICCAD. In
   secondary analyses, the association of the three SNPs with c-IMT and
   ICCAD was tested after stratification by alanine aminotransferase levels
   (ALT). No associations were found between rs738409, rs1260326,
   rs10401969, and c-IMT or ICCAD. Rs738409-G and rs10401969-C were
   associated with ALT levels (p < 0.001). In patients with ALT levels
   above 28 U/L (highest quartile), we observed an association between
   rs10401969-C and c-IMT measures of c-IMTmax and c-IMTmean-max (p = 0.018
   and 0.021, respectively). In conclusion, NAFLD-associated SNPs do not
   associate with sub-clinical atherosclerosis measures. However, our
   results suggest a possible mediating function of impaired liver function
   on atherosclerosis development.}},

   Nevertheless, no instrument has been developed to assess the quality of
   life in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus

   psychometrically test the ``Quality of Life of Patients with Lupus

   these patients. Finally, percentiles for interpreting scores of LEQoL in
   patients with LE are provided. This study is cross-sectional, with a
   sample of 158 patients recruited from a lupus association for the
   psychometric evaluation of the final version of LEQoL. The scale's
   reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability
   (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). Validity was examined
   through exploratory factorial analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factorial
   analyses (CFA). The definitive model, composed of 21 items grouped into
   five factors, presented good psychometric properties. Mean levels of
   quality of life were observed in patients with systemic LE, with higher
   values in patients with cutaneous LE. The LEQoL instrument is a useful
   tool for assessing the quality of life of patients with LE, allowing the
   evaluation of current clinical practices, the identification of

Abstract = {{Background: Interventions to support psychological recovery after
   critical illness, including information provision via an intensive care
   unit (ICU) diary or discharge summary, have been widely adopted in some
   regions, albeit without strong empirical evidence.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility
   and acceptability, for patients, family members, and clinicians, of
   information provision via an ICU diary or discharge summary to support
   psychological recovery for critical illness survivors.
   Methods: This was a pilot, partially randomised patient preference study
   in a mixed ICU in a tertiary hospital in Australia. Eligible patients
   were those in the ICU for >24 h and who were able to converse in
   English. Interventions were ICU diary or discharge summary compared with
   usual care. Feasibility was assessed throughout the study process, and
   acceptability assessed 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge, with
   data analysed descriptively and thematically.
   Results: Sixty-one patients were recruited; 45 completed 3-month
   follow-up (74\%), and 37 (61\%), 6 month follow-up. Participants were
   medical (39\%), surgical (30\%), and trauma (31\%) patients; aged 55
   {[}interquartile range (IQR): 36-67] years; and stayed in the ICU for 7
   {[}IQR: 3-13] days and hospital for 23 {[}IQR: 14-32] days. Within the
   partially randomised framework, 34 patients chose their intervention
   four chose usual care, 10 ICU diary, and 20 discharge summary. The
   remaining 27 patients were randomised nine usual care, 10 ICU diary, and
   seven discharge summary. The majority (>90\%) considered each
   intervention helpful during recovery; however, a significant proportion
   of patients reported distress associated with reading the ICU diary
   (42\%) or discharge summary (15\%). Clinicians reported they were
   hesitant to make diary entries.
   Conclusions: When given a choice, more patients chose a discharge
   summary over the ICU diary or usual care. Participants considered both
   interventions acceptable. Given the reports of distress associated with
   information provision, clear empirical evidence is required to determine
   effectiveness, optimal timing, support needed, and for whom they should
   be used. Clinical Trial Registration Number: ACTRN12615001079538 (c)

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess a large set of metadata made public by the
   Brazilian Ministry of Health on older subjects who visited outpatient
   mental health services in Brazil from 2008 to 2012.
   Methods: We extracted data from the Brazilian Unified Health System
   Information Technology Department (Departamento de Informatica do
   Sistema Unico de Saude, DATASUS), then calculated rates of visits per
   population in each of the five regions of Brazil, using census data for
   each year. Finally, logistic regressions were performed with depressive
   disorders or dementias as dependent variables, controlled by age and
   year of visit, stratified by region.
   Results: Mood disorders were the leading reason for visits to outpatient
   mental health services by older adults, followed by delusional
   disorders. The calculated rates were lower than the known prevalence of
   depressive disorders and dementias, but the regressions revealed typical
   patterns. Males were less likely to present with a depressive disorder,
   while older subjects were more likely to present with depression and
   dementia.
   Conclusions: Publicly available data from DATASUS may not enable
   inferences about the prevalence of mental disorders in elders, but
   inferential analyses match what is known about these conditions. This
   approach is supplemental to other more common ones and is of special
   importance for policymakers and health system managers.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{1484-1493}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Pharmacogenomics is a powerful tool to prevent adverse reactions caused
   by different response of individuals to drug administration. Single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent up to 90\% of genetic
   variations among individuals. Drug metabolizing enzymes are highly
   polymorphic therefore the kinetic parameters of their catalytic
   reactions can be significantly influenced. This work reports on the
   unfolding process of a phase I drug metabolizing enzyme, human
   flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (hFMO3) and its single nucleotide
   polymorphic variants (SNPs) V257M, E158K and E308G. Differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates that the thermal denaturation of
   the enzyme is irreversible. The melting temperature (T-m) for the (Wild
   Type) WT and its polymorphic variants is found to be in a range from 46
   degrees C to 50 degrees C. Also the activation energies of unfolding
   (E-a) show no significant differences among all proteins investigated
   (290-328 KJ/mol), except for the E308G variant that showed a
   significantly higher E-a of 412 KJ/mol. The presence of the bound
   NADP(+) cofactor is found to stabilize all the variants by shifting the
   main T-m by 4-5 degrees C for all the proteins, exception made for E308G
   where no changes are observed.
   Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to characterize the
   interaction of the protein with NADP(+) in terms of dissociation
   constant (K-d), enthalpy (Delta H) and entropy (Delta S). K-d values of
   1.6 and 0.7 mu M, Delta H of -13.9 Kcal/mol and -16.8 Kcal/mol, Delta S
   of -20.5 cal/mol/deg, and -28.5 cal/mol/deg were found for V257M and
   E158K respectively. E308G was found to be unable to bind the NADP(+)
   cofactor, a result that is in line with the T-m results. Circular
   dichroism also confirmed an overall lower stability of E308G, while
   NADP(+) was found to give a strong positive shift of the T-m stabilizing
   the structure of E158K (46.2 to 50.6 degrees C).
   Previous data highlighted significant differences in terms of activity
   among the SNPs of hFMO3. In this work a minor impact of the SNPs was
   found on the stability of the enzyme in the ligand free form, except for
   E308G, whereas the binding of NADP(+) reveals major differences among WT
   and polymorphic variants that are all measurable in terms of heat
   capacity, enthalpy and secondary structure content. These data provide
   the first direct evidence of ligand stabilization effects on hFMO3 that
   can explain the differences observed in catalytic efficiencies and serve
   as the starting point for the development of inhibitors of this enzyme.

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of functional appliance treatment on
   mandibular trabecular structure using fractal dimension (FD) analysis of
   dental panoramic radiographs.
   Materials and Methods: This study was conducted using digital panoramic
   radiographs of 45 patients with Class II malocclusion treated with
   functional appliances (treatment group, mean age: 11.39 +/- 0.97 years;
   23 girls, 22 boys) acquired before (T-0) and after (T-1) treatment and
   the panoramic radiographs of 45 control subjects who had undergone no
   orthodontic treatment (control group, mean age: 11.31 +/- 0.87 years; 23
   girls, 22 boys). FD values in the condylar process, mandibular corpus,
   and mandibular angle were analyzed from the panoramic radiographs of
   both groups.
   Results: Analysis of changes in FD between T-0 and T-1 revealed
   significant increases in the FD values of the right and left condylar
   processes and right mandibular corpus in the treatment group (P<.001)
   and in the right condylar process in the control group (P<.05).
   Between-group comparisons demonstrated that the treatment group showed
   greater changes in the condylar process (right, P<.001; left, P<.05) and
   right mandibular corpus (P<.05) compared to controls. Correlation
   analysis between the cephalometric and FD changes in the treatment group
   showed the right condylar process changes were negatively correlated
   with GoGn/SN angle (P<.05) and positively correlated with Co-Go (P<.05),
   although these correlations were weak.
   Conclusions: FD analysis demonstrated significant changes in
   trabeculation of the condyle and mandibular corpus in the treatment
   group compared to the control group. Functional appliance treatment may
   lead to skeletal correction by altering skeletal form and trabeculation
   of the mandibular bone.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of researchers in South Korea has grown, there is
   increasing dissatisfaction with the selection process for national
   research and development (R\&D) projects among unsuccessful applicants.
   In this study, we designed a system that can recommend the best possible
   R\&D evaluators using big data that are collected from related systems,
   refined, and analyzed. Our big data recommendation system compares
   keywords extracted from applications and from the full-text of the
   achievements of the evaluator candidates. Weights for different keywords
   are scored using the term frequency-inverse document frequency
   algorithm. Comparing the keywords extracted from the achievement of the
   evaluator candidates', a project comparison module searches, scores, and
   ranks these achievements similarly to the project applications. The
   similarity scoring module calculates the overall similarity scores for
   different candidates based on the project comparison module scores. To
   assess the performance of the evaluator candidate recommendation system,
   61 applications in three Review Board (RB) research fields (system
   fusion, organic biochemistry, and Korean literature) were recommended as
   the evaluator candidates by the recommendation system in the same manner
   as the RB's recommendation. Our tests reveal that the evaluator
   candidates recommended by the Korean Review Board and those recommended
   by our system for 61 applications in different areas, were the same.
   However, our system performed the recommendation in less time with no
   bias and fewer personnel. The system requiresrevisions to reflect
   qualitative indicators, such as journal reputation, before it can
   entirely replace the current evaluator recommendation process.}},

Abstract = {{Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are highly prevalent chronic
   conditions, and both are associated with systemic hypertension.
   Additionally, asthma and OSA reciprocally interact, mutually
   exacerbating each other. In this study, we tested the effect of
   allergen-induced lower airway inflammation and concurrent chronic
   intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on systemic blood pressure (BP), pulmonary
   function, and proinflammatory cytokines, in a rat model. Brown Norway
   rats were exposed to 43 days of normoxia (NORM) or CIH, concurrent with
   weekly house dust mite (HDM) challenges. BP was measured 1 day after the
   last HDM challenge. On day 44, pulmonary function was tested, and blood
   for Th-2 and Th-1 cytokine levels was collected. HDM significantly
   increased mean (P = 0.002), systolic (P = 0.003), and diastolic (P =
   0.004) BP compared with saline-challenged controls. Higher mean BP
   significantly correlated to increased total respiratory system
   resistance (R-2 = 0.266, P = 0.002), driven by an association with
   parenchymal tissue dampening (R-2 = 0.166, P = 0.016). HDM relative to
   saline-challenged controls increased the expression of serum IL-6 (P =
   0.008), but no relationships of systemic BP with IL-6 or any other
   cytokines were found. CIH did not alter the allergen-induced responses
   on BP, although it tended to increase the expression of serum IL-6 (P =
   0.06) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, P = 0.09),

Title = {{Sodium bisulfate feed additive aids broilers in growth and intestinal
   health during a coccidiosis challenge}},
Journal = {{POULTRY SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{99}},

Pages = {{5324-5330}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sodium bisulfate (SB) was evaluated on its ability to improve broiler
   growth and intestinal structure with(out) a coccidia challenge. One
   thousand two hundred Cobb500 day-old males were randomly assigned within
   4 experimental groups with a 2 x 2 factorial design, with (out) SB in
   the diet and with(out) a day 0 coccidia challenge using a 10 X dose of a
   commercial vaccine. At day 7, oocysts per gram of feces were determined.
   At day 0, 14, 28, and 41, BW and feed consumption were measured. At day
   21, 20 birds per treatment were subjectively scored for coccidia
   lesions, and jejunal histologic samples were collected for villi
   measurements. Twenty additional birds were given fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-dextran to determine gut permeability. At day 41, 10
   birds per treatment had histologic samples collected. Statistical
   analysis was conducted in JMP Pro 14 using GLM procedure to compare
   disease state and diet. Means were separated using Dunnett's test (P <=
   0.05) with the nonchallenged standard diet treatment that is considered
   the control. All parameters measured indicated an effect due to the
   coccidia inoculation. Therefore, effects of diet on (non)challenged
   treatments were determined using a Student t test (P <= 0.05). Limited
   differences due to diet were seen for the nonchallenged production data.
   Sodium bisulfate had a thinner villi base width (P = 0.04) on day 21 and
   greater villi height (P = 0.03), smaller base width (P = 0.04), thicker
   muscularis (P 5 0.03), and lower crypt: height ratio (P = 0.01) on day
   41. Challenged SB had similar gut permeability to the nonchallenged
   control (P = 0.94) on day 21. There was no difference in flock
   uniformity, feed intake, oocysts per gram of feces, or lesion scores
   between challenged treatments. Challenged SB had greater BW on day 14 (P
   < 0.0001), 28 (P < 0.0001), and 41 (P = 0.02). Feed conversion ratio
   from day 0 to 14 was also lower (P=0.0002). Challenged SB had smaller
   crypts (P = 0.02) and therefore a smaller crypt: height ratio (P = 0.03)
   on day 21. Challenged control had a larger apical width (P = 0.03) and
   thicker muscularis (P = 0.04) on day 41. Overall, the addition of SB
   during coccidial enteropathy aided in BW, feed conversion ratio, and
   villi health with no observed effects on parasite cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Surgical management of Hurley stage III hidradenitis
   suppurativa (HS) typically involves the excision of diseased tissue and
   subsequent reconstruction, potentially leading to complications or
   recurrence of the disease. This pilot case series sought to evaluate a
   decellularised ovine forestomach matrix (OFM) extracellular matrix (ECM)
   graft for soft tissue regeneration as part of surgical reconstruction of
   stage III HS of the axilla.
   Methods: The prospective pilot case series involved six participants and
   a total of eight defects. The ECM graft was used either as a dermal
   substitute for a staged reconstruction (n=3 defects) or as an implant
   under a fasciocutaneous flap (n=5 defects) following wide excision of
   the diseased tissue.
   Results: In all cases complete healing was achieved, with no major
   surgical complications. When used as a dermal substitute the OFM graft
   was completely granulated within 2-4 weeks, with defects closing by
   secondary intention or following placement of a split-thickness skin
   graft. When used as an implant beneath a fasciocutaneous flap, healing
   of the surgical sites was observed after 1-3 months. At the long-term
   follow-up (3-12 months), all participants had excellent range of motion
   and none had reported disease recurrences.
   Conclusion: This pilot case series explored the implementation of an ECM
   graft as part of the surgical management of axilla Hurley stage III HS.
   Although the study had a limited number of participants, long-term
   outcomes were promising and suggest further studies are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advancements in information processing and embedded systems
   require high selective and fast sensors. Conventional gas sensors are
   not suitable for the detection of isomers of organic compounds due to
   cross-sensitivity and the response time being limited by slow chemical
   kinetics. Amperometric gas sensors using conducting polymers modified
   with metal catalysts are a suitable and robust system due to many
   tunable properties. In this paper, conducting polymer polyaniline was
   electrochemically decorated with clusters containing precisely defined
   number of gold atoms to function as an electro-catalyst. The modified
   polymer composite showed fast reaction rate for the electro-oxidation of
   alcohols in both liquid and gas phases. The number of gold atoms
   affected the catalytic activity. Cyclic voltammograms were measured and
   results showed discriminable patterns between n-propanol and
   iso-propanol even at different gas concentrations. Thus, it was
   demonstrated that gas sensor arrays can be realized by decorating
   different number of gold atoms on polyaniline electrodes, to yield
   defined and different selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{CNN and LSTM have proven their ability in feature extraction and natural
   language processing, respectively. So, we tried to use their ability to
   process the language of RNAs, i.e., predicting sequence of microRNAs
   using the sequence of mRNA. The idea is to extract the features from
   sequence of mRNA using CNN and use LSTM network for prediction of miRNA.
   The model has learned the basic features such as seed match at first 2-8
   nucleotides starting at the 50 end and counting toward the 30 end. Also,
   it was able to predict G-U wobble base pair in seed region. While
   validating on experimentally validated data, the model was able to
   predict on average 72 percent of miRNAs for specific mRNA and shows
   highest positive expression fold change of predicted targets on a
   microarray data generated using anti 25 miRNAs compare to other
   predicted tools. Codes are available at

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Among the preventive and therapeutic options available for
   dental caries, sugar alcohols (xylitol and sorbitol) have been widely
   promoted as oral healthcare products due to its perceived anticariogenic
   effect. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these sugar alcohols
   against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans in a sucrose
   supplemented environment, as found in disease-prone conditions in the
   oral cavity, has not been adequately investigated.
   Methods: Single and mixed-species biofilm formation was evaluated in
   medium with different concentrations of xylitol, sorbitol with or
   without sucrose supplementation. Biofilm quantification methods such as
   crystal violet assay, XTT assay, CFU counting complemented with confocal
   and electron microscopic techniques were used.
   Results: Under sucrose-free conditions, xylitol and sorbitol
   demonstrated a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect on S. mutans
   biofilms, whereas inhibitory effect on C. albicans biofilm was weak. The
   presence of 1 \% sucrose in the environment diminished the inhibitory
   effect of both xylitol and sorbitol on S. mutans and C. albicans
   mono-species biofilms. Sucrose supplementation on pre-formed S. mutans
   biofilms also reduced the inhibitory effect of xylitol. Xylitol and
   sorbitol presence reduced mixed-species biofilm formation and altered
   the biofilm architecture and glucan production. However, sucrose
   supplementation reduced the inhibitory effect of sugar alcohols and
   enhanced the mixed-species biofilm formation.
   Conclusions: Xylitol and sorbitol exerts an inhibitory effect on S.
   mutans and C. albicans biofilm formation and this inhibitory effect is
   repressed by the presence of sucrose.}},

Abstract = {{Amidst rising interest in non-dairy probiotic foods, and growing global
   coffee consumption patterns, it would be opportune to ferment coffee
   brews with probiotics, yet it remains unexplored. In this study, we
   aimed to develop a fermented coffee beverage rich in live probiotics, by
   supplementing nutrient-deficient coffee brews with glucose and
   inactivated yeast derivatives. This was followed by fermentation with
   single probiotic bacteria cultures (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L.
   paracasei Lpc-37, L. plantarum 299v, and L. acidophilus NCFM), and
   subsequent storage at 4 and 25 degrees C. We demonstrated that nutrient
   supplementation was essential in supporting probiotic growth and
   survival in coffee brews, as viabilities above 7 Log CFU/mL could not be
   sustained longer than 2 weeks in non-supplemented coffees. In contrast,
   viabilities above 7 Log CFU/mL were maintained for 10 weeks by L.
   rhamnosus GG and L. paracasei Lpc-37 in supplemented coffees stored
   under refrigeration. Probiotic metabolic activities led to consumption
   of glucose, glutamic acid, and alanine, with simultaneous formation of
   lactic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, and diacetyl. Nevertheless,
   endogenous coffee volatiles, bioactive components, and antioxidant
   capacities were retained. Overall, we illustrate the potential
   functionalities of probiotic fermented coffee brews, arising from high
   probiotic live counts and retention of major coffee bioactive
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Structural analysis of Dy@CdS quantum dots (QDs) were investigated by
   the XRD and TEM/HRTEM. The particle size of Dy@CdS QDs was varies from
   7.3 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 0.08 nm for 0.3\% and 1.2\% of Dy contents
   respectively. The vibrational spectra of pristine and Dy@CdS QDs exhibit
   the longitudinal phonon modes at 293 and 587 cm(-1). Optical band gap of
   2.5 eV was optimized at 0.6\% Dy doped CdS sample and found to be
   decreased on further increasing the Dy3+ content from 0.9 to 1.2\%. The
   peaks at 414 and 466 nm are attributed to excitonic and trapped emission
   in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Dy@CdS samples respectively.
   The red shifts in PL spectra were observed for Dy3+ content more than
   0.6\% in Dy@CdS QDs. The frequency dependent char-acteristics of
   dielectric constant, dielectric loss, tangent and ac conductivity of
   Dy@CdS QDs were investigated at 300 K. It was founded that lower
   frequency range is dominated by the space charge polarization whereas
   orientational polarization is dominant at higher frequencies by
   increasing the dielectric constant. The variation of ac electrical
   conductivity was carried out linearly in the frequency range 15 kHz-10
   MHz. The easy way of repeatability, tenability and scalability of Dy@CdS
   QDs are attributed for optoelectronics application.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study assessed the effects of probiotics on cecal
   microbiota, gene expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, and
   immune response in the cecal tonsil of broiler chickens challenged with
   Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica.
   Methods: One-day-old broiler chickens (n = 240) were randomly allocated
   to four treatments: negative control (Cont), multi-strain
   probiotic-treated group (Pro), Salmonella-infected group (Sal), and
   multi-strain probiotic-treated and Salmonella-infected group (ProSal).
   All chickens except those in the Cont and Pro groups were gavaged with
   1x10(8) cfu/mL of S. enterica subsp. enterica 4 days after hatching.
   Results: Our results indicated that body weight, weight gain, and feed
   conversion ratio of birds were significantly reduced (p<0.05) by
   Salmonella challenge. Chickens challenged with Salmonella decreased
   cecal microbial diversity. Chickens in the Sal group exhibited abundant
   Proteobacteria than those in the Cont, Pro, and ProSal groups.
   Salmonella infection downregulated gene expression of Occludin, zonula
   occludens-1 (ZO1), and Mucin 2 in the jejunum and Occludin and Claudin
   in the ileum. Moreover, the Sal group increased gene expression of
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1 beta, and
   lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF)
   and reduced levels of transforming growth factor-beta 4 and IL-10
   compared with the other groups (p<0.05). However, chickens receiving
   probiotic diets increased Lactobacillaceae abundance and reduced
   Enterobacteriaceae abundance in the ceca. Moreover, supplementation with
   probiotics increased the mRNA expression of Occludin, ZO1, and Mucin 2
   in the ileum (p<0.05). In addition, probiotic supplementation
   downregulated the mRNA levels of IFN-gamma (p<0.05) and LITAF (p =
   0.075) and upregulated IL-10 (p = 0.084) expression in the cecal tonsil.
   Conclusion: The administration of multi-strain probiotics modulated
   intestinal microbiota, gene expression of tight junction proteins, and
   immunomodulatory activity in broiler chickens.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a newly developed flexible laminated copper (FLC)
   coil for electromagnetic thermotherapy that has several advantages over
   traditional hard copper coils. We study the effect of pitch (the
   distance between coil turns) on the heating performance of the proposed
   FLC coil. The flexible coil can be wound into different shapes for
   various purposes. However, the output power of the heating system can be
   substantiality affected by the coil inductance. This study is aimed at
   reducing coil inductance by changing the original flexible coil diameter
   and pitch in order to enhance the output power of a high-frequency
   machine, improve treatment, and meet the actual heating requirements.
   The results of the experiments show that the temperature is six times
   better when using the flexible coil compared with when using the
   traditional hard copper coil, where adjusting the coil pitch can
   increase the needle temperature by a maximum of 48.3 degrees C in pork
   liver tissue. In addition, this study simulates the distribution of the
   magnetic field of the flexible coil via a finite element analysis and
   explores the coil design and heating effect of metal needle heating and
   liver tissue ablation. The improved features of this proposed method are
   threefold: 1) the flexible coil can be used to treat different zones of
   the human body; 2) the flexible coil exhibits better heating performance
   than a hard copper coil; and 3) the coil inductance is lowered, and the
   power is improved, which, in turn, leads to better treatment and meets
   the actual heating requirements.}},

Title = {{Fine air pollution particles trapped by street tree barks: In situ
   magnetic biomonitoring}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{266}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Particulate air pollution in cities comprises a variety of harmful
   compounds, including fine iron rich particles, which can persist in the
   air for long time, increasing the adverse exposure of humans and living
   things to them. We studied street tree (among other species, Cordyline
   australis, Fraxinus excelsior and F. pensylvanica) barks as biological
   collectors of these ubiquitous airborne particles in cities. Properties
   were determined by the environmental magnetism method, inductively
   coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and scanning electron
   microscopy, and analyzed by geostatistical methods. Trapped particles
   are characterized as low-coercivity (mean +/- s.d. value of remanent
   coercivity H-cr = 37.0 +/- 2.4 mT) magnetite-like minerals produced by a
   common pollution source identified as traffic derived emissions. Most of
   these Fe rich particles are inhalable (PM2.5), as determined by the
   anhysteretic ratio chi(ARM)/chi (0.1 -1 mu m) and scanning electron
   microscopy (<1 mu m), and host a variety of potentially toxic elements
   (Cr, Mo, Ni, and V). Contents of magnetic particles vary in the study
   area as observed by magnetic proxies for pollution, such as mass
   specific magnetic susceptibility chi (18.4-218 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1)) and
   in situ magnetic susceptibility kappa(is) (0.2-20.2 x 10(-5) SI). The
   last parameter allows us doing in situ magnetic biomonitoring, being
   convenient because of species preservation, measurement time, and fast
   data processing for producing prediction maps of magnetic particle
   pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   focusing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Thick diffractive optical elements offer a promising way to achieve
   focusing or imaging at a resolution approaching 1 nm for x-ray
   wavelengths shorter than about 0.1 nm. Efficient focusing requires that
   these are fabricated with structures that vary in period and orientation
   so that rays obey Bragg's law over the entire lens aperture and give
   rise to constructive interference at the focus. Here the analysis method
   of ray-tracing of thick diffractive optical elements is applied to such
   lenses to optimise their designs and to investigate their operating and
   manufacturing tolerances. Expressions are provided of the fourth-order
   series expansions of the wavefront aberrations and transmissions of both
   axi-symmetric lenses and pairs of crossed lenses that each focuses in
   only one dimension like a cylindrical lens. We find that aplanatic
   zone-plate designs, whereby aberrations are corrected over a large field
   of view, can be achieved by axi-symmetric lenses but not the crossed
   lenses. We investigate the performance of 1 nm-resolution lenses with
   focal lengths of about 1 mm and show their fields of view are mainly
   limited by the acceptance angle of Bragg diffraction, and that
   aberrations can limit the performance of lenses with longer focal
   lengths. We apply the ray-tracing formalism for a tolerancing analysis
   of imperfect lenses and examine some strategies for the correction of
   their aberrations.}},

Abstract = {{Pilomatrixoma, an uncommon, usually benign cutaneous appendageal tumor,
   shows differentiation toward the hair follicle matrix cell. It undergoes
   various histopathologic stages, early on displaying epithelial and
   shadow cells along with granulomatous inflammation. In later stages,
   illustrated by this unusual case, epithelial cells disappear and are
   replaced by calcification and ossification. Immunohistochemistry in the
   current case showed transitional cell reactivity for beta-catenin,
   probably linking the tumor to a mutation in the beta-catenin gene
   CTNNB1. There was also transitional cell positivity for cyclin D1, a
   marker found in matrical cells of the human hair follicle. While
   pilomatrixoma occurs occasionally in the eyelid, the ossified eyelid
   variant in the current case is very rare, with only one preceding
   description in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Total contents of metals in soil and sediments on the Tibetan Plateau of
   China have been widely analyzed, but existing information is
   insufficient to effectively evaluate metal ecological risk because of a
   lack of metal bioavailability data. In this study, distribution,
   potential risk, mobility and bioavailability of metals in sediments of
   Lake Yamdrok Basin in Tibet of China were explored by combined use of
   total digestion, sequential extraction and the diffusive gradient in
   thin-films (DGT). Average concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and
   Pb in surface sediments were 31.25, 30.31, 22.00, 45.04, 31.32, 0.13 and
   13.39 mg/kg, respectively. Higher levels of metals were found near the
   inflowing rivers. Residual form was dominant in Cr, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb,
   and reducible form was dominant in As and Cd. Metals in surface
   sediments showed a low enrichment degree overall, but Cd and As had
   higher ecological risk levels than the other metals. Furthermore, there
   was a larger average proportion of exchangeable form of As (20.4\%) and
   Cd (9.0\%) than the other metals (1.7\%-3.3\%), implying their higher
   mobility and release risk. Average DGT-labile concentrations of Cr, Ni,
   Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb were 0.5, 4.5, 0.7, 25.1, 60.0, 0.22 and 1.0 mu
   g/L, respectively. The DGT-labile As was significantly correlated with
   extractable As forms (p<0.01), suggesting that extractable As in
   sediments acts as a ``mobile pool{''} for bioavailable As. These results
   suggest potential risks of As and Cd, especially As, deserve further
   attention in Lake Yamdrok Basin. (C) 2020 The Research Center for

Abstract = {{Signal transduction utilizing membrane-spanning receptors and
   cytoplasmic regulator proteins is a fundamental process for all living
   organisms, but quantitative studies of the behavior of signaling
   proteins, such as their diffusion within a cell, are limited. In this
   study, we show that fluctuations in the concentration of the signaling
   molecule, phosphorylated CheY, constitute the basis of chemotaxis
   signaling. To analyze the propagation of the CheY-P signal
   quantitatively, we measured the coordination of directional switching
   between flagellar motors on the same cell. We analyzed the time lags of
   the switching of two motors in both CCW-to-CW and CW-to-CCW switching (
   increment tau(CCW-CW) and increment tau(CW-CCW)). In wild-type cells,
   both time lags increased as a function of the relative distance of two
   motors from the polar receptor array. The apparent diffusion coefficient
   estimated for increment tau values was similar to 9 mu m(2)/s. The
   distance-dependency of increment tau(CW-CCW) disappeared upon loss of
   polar localization of the CheY-P phosphatase, CheZ. The
   distance-dependency of the response time for an instantaneously applied
   serine attractant signal also disappeared with the loss of polar
   localization of CheZ. These results were modeled by calculating the
   diffusion of CheY and CheY-P in cells in which phosphorylation and
   dephosphorylation occur in different subcellular regions. We conclude
   that diffusion of signaling molecules and their production and
   destruction through spontaneous activity of the receptor array generates
   fluctuations in CheY-P concentration over timescales of several hundred
   milliseconds. Signal fluctuation coordinates rotation among flagella and
   regulates steady-state run-and-tumble swimming of cells to facilitate
   efficient responses to environmental chemical signals.}},

Abstract = {{Covariance Based - Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) is often used
   to investigate moderation and latent interaction effects. This study
   illustrates and compares the application of constrained, uncon-strained
   and orthogonalized CB-SEM approaches to latent variable interaction
   analysis using AMOS. Although all three techniques provided similar
   parameter estimates, the orthogonalized approach provided reduced
   standard errors resulting in identifying a significant latent
   interaction, suggesting the orthogonalized approach may be better suited
   for exploratory research.
   The illustrated example demonstrates three CB-SEM techniques, and the
   simplicity of the three approaches to test for interaction effects. The
   three approaches can be comfortably implemented in available software
   programs. Guidelines and recommendations for the use of the three
   approaches are identified with a step-wise process of assessing the
   latent interaction effect in CB-SEM.
   As far as we are aware this is the first investigation comparing and

Abstract = {{Geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures are mostly used to retain
   subgrade slope of highway and railway. For the design and performance
   analyses of geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures under repeated
   loading, such as those induced by compaction, traffic and earthquakes,
   the understanding of cyclic soil-geosynthetic interface behaviour is of
   great interest. Nevertheless, experimental data concerning this type of
   behaviour are very scarce. A laboratory study was carried out and is
   described in this paper. This paper presents the behaviour of an
   interface between a coarse-grained soil and a geogrid under cyclic
   loading conditions. A large-scale direct shear test device able to
   perform displacement-controlled cyclic tests was used. The results
   obtained are presented and discussed, especially the effects of the
   displacement amplitude and normal stress on the shear stiffness and
   damping ratio are investigated. The dynamic response parameters of the
   soil-geosynthetic interface are greatly affected by the number of
   cycles, and the variations in the two parameters with the number of
   cycles are related to the normal stress and the shear displacement
   amplitude. when at large displacements, the damping ratio decreases
   first and then stabilizes with the number of cycles. However, at small
   displacement, the shear stiffness and damping ratio are all decrease
   somewhat at the initial stage of cyclic shearing. As the experimental
   materials used in this study are relatively single, and further
   experimental research should be carried out in the future. The shear
   parameters of interface in this study can provide reference for the
   design of reinforced soil structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction remains a major
   determinant of the duration of stay after complex abdominal surgery.
   This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of heated fennel
   therapy in accelerating the recovery of gastrointestinal function.
   Methods: This surgeon-blinded, prospective randomized controlled study
   included 381 patients with hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and gastric tumors
   who were divided into 2 groups. The patients in the experimental groups
   received heated fennel therapy, and those in the control groups received
   heated rice husk therapy. We compared the baseline characteristics, time
   to first postoperative flatus and defecation, fasting time, duration of
   postoperative hospital stay, grading of abdominal pain, classification
   of abdominal distension, inflammatory markers, and nutritional status
   indicators.
   Results: The time to first flatus and first defecation and the fasting
   time were statistically significantly less in the heated fennel therapy
   group than those in the control groups (P < .05 each); and abdominal
   distension was also relieved in the experimental groups (P < .001).
   Heated fennel therapy had no obvious beneficial effect on inflammatory
   markers but improved the serum albumin (ALB) level of the patients at
   postop day 9 (P < .001). Among the patients with alimentary tract
   reconstruction, those in the heated fennel therapy group had a
   clinically important, lesser hospital stay than those in the control
   group (9.2 +/- 5 5.1 versus 11.1 +/- 6.4; P < .023).
   Conclusion: Heated fennel therapy facilitated the gastrointestinal
   motility function of patients early postoperatively. (C) 2020 The

Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{474}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{We theoretically analyze the performance of gyroscope sensor near
   exceptional point (EP), consisting of two coupled micro-ring resonators.
   Distinct thermal behaviors, due to different gains in these two rings,
   could bring about an extra resonance shift between them, which places a
   great impact on EP sensor including its sensitivity, visibility and
   stability. Our simulations demonstrate that, such thermal-induced noise
   can be amplified around EP simultaneously as well as the frequency
   splitting generated from Sagnac effect we should detect, giving rise to
   the difficulty of sensing comparatively weak rotation-induced
   perturbations, and a limited detection range while utilizing the
   superiority of EP in such a gyroscope system. Our tolerance analysis in
   this paper may have a profound referential meaning to the future

Abstract = {{Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational
   modifications, and many biological processes are related to
   phosphorylation, such as DNA repair, transcriptional regulation and
   signal transduction and, therefore, abnormal regulation of
   phosphorylation usually causes diseases. If we can accurately predict
   human phosphorylation sites, this could help to solve human diseases.
   Therefore, we developed a kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction
   system, GasPhos, and proposed a new feature selection approach, called
   Gas, based on the ant colony system and a genetic algorithm and used
   performance evaluation strategies focused on different kinases to choose
   the best learning model. Gas uses the mean decrease Gini index (MDGI) as
   a heuristic value for path selection and adopts binary transformation
   strategies and new state transition rules. GasPhos can predict
   phosphorylation sites for six kinases and showed better performance than
   other phosphorylation prediction tools. The disease-related
   phosphorylated proteins that were predicted with GasPhos are also
   discussed. Finally, Gas can be applied to other issues that require
   feature selection, which could help to improve prediction performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we first propose a new hydrodynamically-coupled
   phase-field model for the diblock copolymer melt that is derived based
   on the Allen-Cahn dynamics where the volume fraction of two composing
   monomers is conserved by using a nonlocal Lagrange multiplier. Formally,
   the system is a highly nonlinear system that consists of the
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and a nonlocal-type Allen-Cahn
   type equation. Then, to solve the model, we develop a linear and
   second-order time-marching scheme via the Invariant Energy
   Quadratization approach with the stabilization technique for the
   nonlinear potentials, as well as the projection method for the
   Navier-Stokes equations. The unconditional energy stability of the
   numerical method is proved, and several experiments of 2D and 3D are
   performed to validate the accuracy and energy stability of the developed
   numerical scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Preparation and properties of Al2O3-reinforced Cu-Ni-Sn metallic matrix
   for applications in diamond-cutting tools}},
Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{109}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A Cu-Ni-Sn matrix reinforced by Al2O3 particles (referred as
   CuNiSn/Al2O3) has been developed as a potential substitute for cobalt to
   fabricate diamond-cutting tools. CuNiSn/Al2O3 powder was first prepared
   through high energy ball milling, which was consolidated by hot pressing
   at 880 degrees C to a virtually pore-free matrix and diamond tools
   containing 10 vol\% diamond grits separately. For comparison, a cobalt
   matrix and cobalt diamond tools were also prepared. The friction and
   wear behaviors of the matrixes and the diamond tools were investigated
   against ZrO2 balls under dry sliding in air on a ball-on-disk tester.
   The hardness, bending strength and bending elastic modulus of the
   CuNiSn/Al2O3 matrix are 99 HRB, 1308 MPa and 75.6 GPa, respectively,
   which are close to those of the cobalt matrix. However, the CuNiSn/Al2O3
   matrix exhibits a more stable friction coefficient and higher wear
   resistance than the cobalt matrix, and ZrO2 can be more effectively
   grinded off by CuNiSn/Al2O3 diamond tools than cobalt diamond tools.
   With detailed microstructural analyses, the possible friction and wear
   mechanism are discussed. The new CuNiSn/Al(2)O(3 )matrix is promising
   for fabricating diamond tools with low cost, high processing efficiency
   and long service life.}},

Abstract = {{Realizing the layouts of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits
   (ICs) is a complicated task due to the high design flexibility and
   sensitive circuit performance. Compared with the advancements of digital
   IC layout automation, analog IC layout design is still heavily manual,
   which leads to a more time-consuming and error-prone process. In recent
   years, significant progress has been made in automated analog layout
   design with emerging of several open-source frameworks. This paper
   firstly reviews the existing state-of-the art AMS layout synthesis
   frameworks with focus on the different approaches and their individual
   challenges. We then present recent research trends and opportunities in
   the field. Finally, we summaries the paper with open questions and
   future directions for fully-automating the analog IC layout.}},

Abstract = {{Optical vector network analyzers (OVNAs) based on swept-wavelength
   interferometry are applied widely in optical metrology and sensing to
   measure the complex transfer functions of optical components, devices,

   measurement quality as the distance increases and limits the usage of
   the OVNA in characterizing systems with long impulse responses as
   required in space-division multiplexing links with a high mode count or
   in the presence of large modal differential group delay (DGD). In this
   Letter, we use a densely distributed broadband ultra-weak fiber Bragg
   grating array to directly measure the distortion due to phase noise at a
   5-m increment up to 400 m and use this measured data to directly
   eliminate the distortion. We experimentally extend the measurement range
   of the swept-wavelength OVNA over 400 m and successfully characterize a
   2-km six-mode multimode fiber link with an accumulated impulse response

Abstract = {{Fish nocardiosis is a widespread chronic granulomatous disease in
   aquatic environment, which was particularly caused by Nocardia seriolae.
   The phage shock protein A (PspA) and tellurium resistance protein D
   (TerD) were identified to be the immunodominant antigens of the
   wild-type N. seriolae strain ZJ0503 in our previous study. In an attempt
   to develop effective DNA vaccines against this pathogen, PspA and TerD
   were used as candidates to ligate with pcDNA3.1-Flag plasmids,
   respectively. In addition, the abilities of these two DNA vaccines to
   elicit various immune responses in hybrid snakehead and supply
   protective efficacy against artificial challenge with N. seriolae were
   determined in the present study. The results showed that intramuscular
   injection with pcDNA-PspA and pcDNA-TerD did not exhibit cytotoxic
   activities in hybrid snakehead via histopathological examination.
   Besides, hybrid snakehead immunization with pcDNA-PspA and pcDNA-TerD
   could increase several non-specific immune paraments in serum, including
   LYZ, POD, ACP, AKP and SOD activities. Meanwhile, the pcDNA-TerD DNA
   vaccine could induce strongly specific antibody (IgM) titer in hybrid
   snakehead with a relative percent of survival (RPS) value of 83.14\%
   against N. seriolae, while that of pcDNA-PspA DNA vaccine was displayed
   comparably low IgM titer with RPS value of 57.83\%. Furthermore,
   quantitative real-time PCR assays presented that the expression of
   immune-related genes (MHCI alpha, MHCII alpha, CD4, CD8 alpha, IL-1 beta
   and TNF alpha) were up-regulated to various degrees after vaccination
   with pcDNA-PspA or pcDNA-TerD, indicating that these two DNA vaccines
   were able to boost humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in hybrid
   snakehead. Taken together, both the pcDNA-PspA and pcDNA-TerD DNA
   vaccines were proved to be safe, immunogenic and effective in protecting
   hybrid snakehead against N. seriolae infection, which can promote the
   development and application of DNA vaccines to control fish nocardiosis
   in aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on testing for individual and time effects in
   the two-way error component model with time-invariant regressors. We
   present the so-called FEF estimators when time-invariant regressors are
   exogenous and the FEF-IV estimators when one or more of time-invariant
   variables are endogenous, and obtain their asymptotic properties under
   some mild conditions. In the light of the moment-based test methods of
   Wu and Li (2014), we construct several tests for the existence of
   individual and time effects in the two-way error component model with
   time-invariant regressors. The resulting tests can be shown to have some
   desired properties as follows: they do not need any distributional
   assumptions on the error components; they do not require any assumptions
   on the correlation among the two random effects and the time-varying
   regressors; they are robust to the presence of one effect when the other
   one is tested. Simulation study and real data analysis are carried out
   for illustration of the above.}},

Journal = {{CHILDREN-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Research into early screen exposure has raised growing concerns about
   its impact upon children's neuropsychological well-being. However,
   possible pathways remain unclear. This study therefore aimed not only to
   evaluate the association between screen exposure during the ages of 0-3
   years and preschoolers' autistic-like behaviors, but also the mediating
   roles of the frequency of caregiver-child interaction, sleep duration
   and level of participation in outdoor activities. Based on the 2017
   survey of the Longhua Child Cohort Study, data of 29,595 child-caregiver
   dyads were obtained via a caregiver-reported questionnaire, with the
   data from 29,461 dyads included in the data analysis. Multiple linear
   and logistic regression models were employed to estimate the
   associations between screen exposure, caregiver-child interaction, sleep
   duration, outdoor activities, and children's autistic-like behaviors.
   The results indicated that screen exposure during 0-3 years of age was
   associated with the presence of autistic-like behaviors at preschool
   age, and the strength of the association was enhanced with the increase
   of average daily screen time (Odds Ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.358 to
   4.026). The frequency of caregiver-child interaction and sleep duration
   mediated 5.32\% and 1.19\% of the variance of the association
   respectively, but outdoor activities did not mediate the association.
   Our findings indicate that preschoolers who are exposed to screens at
   aged 0-3 years might have an increased risk of autistic-like behaviors,
   and that, the frequency of caregiver-child interaction and sleep
   duration might function as potential mediators of this association.}},

Abstract = {{Background.
   Graft rejection continues to be a major barrier to long-term engraftment
   after transplantation. Autophagy plays an important role in cardiac
   injury pathogenesis. The bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitor
   (S)-tert-butyl2-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3,9-trimethyl-6H-thieno{[}3,2-f]{[
   }1,2,4]triazolo{[}4,3-a]{[}1,4]diazepin-6-yl)acetate (JQ1) inhibits
   inflammatory responses. However, the beneficial effect of JQ1 on
   transplant and the potential role of autophagy in the protective effect
   of graft survival are yet to be investigated.
   Methods.
   Syngeneic or allogeneic heterotopic heart transplantation was performed
   using C57BL/6 or BALB/c donors for C57BL/6 recipients through different
   treatments. Some mice were used to observe the survival of the grafts.
   The other mice were euthanized on the third, fifth, and seventh days
   after surgery. The graft samples were taken for cytokines and autophagy
   pathway analyses.
   Results.
   Our study revealed that JQ1 treatment prolonged cardiac allograft
   survival. JQ1 increased the expression levels of liver kinase beta 1,
   autophagy-specific gene 5, and microtubule-associated protein light
   chain3-II (LC3-II) and potentiated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated
   protein kinase, unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), and autophagy-specific gene
   14 in allografts. A conditional autophagy-specific gene 5 deletion donor
   was utilized to abrogate the effect induced by JQ1. The combined use of
   JQ1 with bafilomycin A1 partially reversed the effect of JQ1, suggesting
   that autophagy is involved in the signaling pathway in graft survival.
   JQ1 downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as
   interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and
   interferon-gamma, which was abrogated when autophagy was inhibited.
   Conclusions.
   JQ1 prolonged cardiac allograft survival by potentiating myocardial
   autophagy through the liver kinase beta 1-AMP-activated protein
   kinase-ULK1 signaling pathway and inhibiting the subsequent release of
   inflammatory cytokines. This result might provide novel insights for
   extending transplant survival.}},

Title = {{Gtsf1 is essential for proper female sex determination and transposon
   silencing in the silkworm, Bombyx mori}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sex determination pathways are astoundingly diverse in insects. For
   instance, the silk moth Bombyx mori uniquely use various components of
   the piRNA pathway to produce the Fem signal for specification of the
   female fate. In this study, we identified BmGTSF1 as a novel piRNA
   factor which participates in B. mori sex determination. We found that
   BmGtsf1 has a distinct expression pattern compared to Drosophila and
   mouse. CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutation in BmGtsf1 resulted in partial sex
   reversal in genotypically female animals by shifting expression of the
   downstream targets BmMasc and Bmdsx to the male pattern. As levels of
   Fem piRNAs were substantially reduced in female mutants, we concluded
   that BmGtsf1 plays a critical role in the biogenesis of the feminizing
   signal. We also demonstrated that BmGTSF1 physically interacted with
   BmSIWI, a protein previously reported to be involved in female sex
   determination, indicating BmGTSF1 function as the cofactor of BmSIWI.
   BmGtsf1 mutation resulted in piRNA pathway dysregulation, including
   piRNA biogenesis defects and transposon derepression, suggesting BmGtsf1
   is also a piRNA factor in the silkworm. Furthermore, we found that
   BmGtsf1 mutation leads to gametogenesis defects in both male and female.
   Our data suggested that BmGtsf1 is a new component involved in the sex
   determination pathway in B. mori.
   Author summary
   Sex determination is a fundamentally important process in most sexually
   reproducing metazoan. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of sex
   determination are highly diverse. In B. mori, piRNAs derived from the
   W-chromosome-linked Fem precursor serve as the primary female
   determining signal. However, we still know little about the initiation
   of B. mori sex determination and its relationship with piRNA pathway.
   Here, we provided evidence that BmGTSF1 is a novel piRNA factor which is
   indispensable for B.mori female sex determination. Mutations in BmGtsf1
   resulted in dysregulation of the piRNA pathway and caused partial
   female-male sex reversal. We also detected dramatic diminution of Fem
   piRNA in female mutant, indicating BmGTSF1 regulates B. mori sex
   determination via piRNA pathway. More importantly, we showed that
   BmGTSF1 interacted with BmSIWI, which protein had been reported to be
   involved in piRNA pathway and sex determination in B. mori, supporting
   the conclusion that BmGTSF1 is a novel factor for piRNA pathway and sex
   determination.}},

Title = {{Experimental study on seismic behavior of double-skin composite wall
   with L-shaped connectors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{174}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors' research group propose a novel double-skin
   composite wall (DSCW), which is composed of boundary columns, steel
   faceplates, L-shaped connectors and infill concrete. To further study
   the seismic performance of DSCW specimens, six high shear-span ratio
   DSCWs were designed and manufactured for a quasistatic test. In the
   experiment, the welding spacing, welding forms, and the thickness of the
   steel faceplate are used to set forth parameters; moreover, the failure
   mode, deformation performance and energy dissipation capacity of the
   DSCWs are analyzed. Test results show that the failure mode of each
   specimen was flexural failure, as shown by the fractured steel plate at
   the bottom of the boundary columns, the crushed infill concrete at the
   tear, and the specimens' buckled steel faceplates in different degrees.
   The average value of the yield drift ratio was 1/177; the average value
   of ultimate drift ratio was 1/39, and the average value of displacement
   ductility coefficient was 4.46. A good energy dissipation capacity was
   shown by the specimens as it increased gradually during the testing
   process. The results show that the local buckling of the steel faceplate
   can be delayed by reducing the welding spacing and adopting the
   blossom-form or dense bottom welding arrangement; thus, improve the
   ductility and energy dissipation capacity of the specimens. When the
   thickness of the steel faceplate is increased, the local buckling of the
   steel faceplate is less likely to occur, and the bearing capacity is
   improved. Based on the theoretical analysis, a buckling stress
   calculation model is proposed to calculate the buckling stress of the
   steel faceplate at the bottom of the specimen. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The association between two event times is of scientific importance in
   various fields. Due to population heterogeneity, it is desirable to
   examine the degree to which local association depends on different
   characteristics of the population. Here we adopt a novel quantile-based
   local association measure and propose a conditional quantile association
   regression model to allow covariate effects on local association of two
   survival times. Estimating equations for the quantile association
   coefficients are constructed based on the relationship between this
   quantile association measure and the conditional copula. Asymptotic
   properties for the resulting estimators are rigorously derived, and
   induced smoothing is used to obtain the covariance matrix. Through
   simulations we demonstrate the good practical performance of the
   proposed inference procedures. An application to age-related macular
   degeneration (AMD) data reals interesting varying effects of the
   baseline AMD severity score on the local association between two AMD

Title = {{Driver Fatigue Detection via Differential Evolution Extreme Learning
   Machine Technique}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fatigue driving (FD) is one of the main causes of traffic accidents.
   Traditionally, machine learning technologies such as back propagation
   neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are popularly
   used for fatigue driving detection. However, the BPNN exhibits slow
   convergence speed and many adjustable parameters, while it is difficult
   to train large-scale samples in the SVM. In this paper, we develop
   extreme learning machine (ELM)-based FD detection method to avoid the
   above disadvantages. Further, since the randomness of the weight and
   biases between the input layer and the hidden layer of the ELM will
   influence its generalization performance, we further apply a
   differential evolution ELM (DE-ELM) method to the analysis of the
   driver's respiration and heartbeat signals, which can effectively judge
   the driver fatigue state. Moreover, not only will the Doppler radar and
   smart bracelet be used to obtain the driver respiration and heartbeat
   signals, but also the sample database required for the experiment will
   be established through extensive signal collections. Experimental
   results show that the DE-ELM has a better performance on driver's
   fatigue level detection than the traditional ELM and SVM.}},

Title = {{Augmenting CO2 Absorption Flux through a Gas-Liquid Membrane Module by
   Inserting Carbon-Fiber Spacers}},
Journal = {{MEMBRANES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the insertion of eddy promoters into a parallel-plate
   gas-liquid polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane contactor to
   effectively enhance carbon dioxide absorption through aqueous amine
   solutions (monoethanolamide-MEA). In this study, a theoretical model was
   established and experimental work was performed to predict and to
   compare carbon dioxide absorption efficiency under concurrent- and
   countercurrent-flow operations for various MEA feed flow rates, inlet
   CO2 concentrations, and channel design conditions. A Sherwood number's
   correlated expression was formulated, incorporating experimental data to
   estimate the mass transfer coefficient of the CO2 absorption in MEA
   flowing through a PTFE membrane. Theoretical predictions were calculated
   and validated through experimental data for the augmented CO2 absorption
   efficiency by inserting carbon-fiber spacers as an eddy promoter to
   reduce the concentration polarization effect. The study determined that
   a higher MEA feed rate, a lower feed CO2 concentration, and wider
   carbon-fiber spacers resulted in a higher CO2 absorption rate for
   concurrent- and countercurrent-flow operations. A maximum of 80\% CO2
   absorption efficiency enhancement was found in the device by inserting
   carbon-fiber spacers, as compared to that in the empty channel device.
   The overall CO2 absorption rate was higher for countercurrent operation
   than that for concurrent operation. We evaluated the effectiveness of
   power utilization in augmenting the CO2 absorption rate by inserting
   carbon-fiber spacers in the MEA feed channel and concluded that the
   higher the flow rate, the lower the power utilization's effectiveness.
   Therefore, to increase the CO2 absorption flux, widening carbon-fiber
   spacers was determined to be more effective than increasing the MEA feed
   flow rate.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical oxidation of reverse osmosis concentrates using enhanced
   TiO2-NTA/SnO2-Sb anodes with/without PbO2 layer}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{399}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The traditional dimensional stable anodes (Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/PbO2) have
   poor electrochemical properties for further practical application. In
   this study, we fabricated two types of anodes for the treatment of
   reverse osmosis concentrates (ROCs). These two anodes were fabricated
   based on the enhanced nanotube array (ENTA) as internal structure. One
   anode is only coated by SnO2-Sb layer on the ENTA (Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb),
   while the other one is coated by SnO2-Sb layer and plus PbO2 layer
   (Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2). It was found that the ENTA improved the
   electrochemical properties (e.g., oxygen evolution potential, HO center
   dot production) of the anodes. The conversion service lifetime of novel
   anodes were enhanced greatly than the traditional one. Then, we found
   that Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb anode has superior electro-catalytic than
   Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2. In the range of current density of 5-20 mA cm(-2),
   the COD removal rate of ROCs for Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb anode and
   Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2 anode were 0.12-0.23 mg min(-1) and 0.11-0.19 mg
   min(-1), respectively. Finally, we comprehensively compared the current
   efficiency and cost of ROCs degradation among various anodes. It was
   mentioned that novel anodes require lower energy cost (similar to 6.1
   \$/kg COD) during electrochemical process. Overall, electrochemical
   process is a cost-effective process and a very promising technology for
   practical application.}},

Title = {{Microstructures of the pulsed laser welded TiZrBeCuMo composite
   amorphous alloy joint}},
Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous alloys have great potential in industrial applications.
   However, metallurgical characteristics of those materials during laser
   welding are still unclear. In this research, pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding
   was performed on the beta-Ti dendrite reinforced amorphous alloy plates.
   The microstructures of the welding joints were specially observed and
   analyzed. Results show that no metallurgical defects were found in the
   joints. There is no obvious heat affected zone between the fusion zone
   and base material. The microstructure in the fusion zone (FZ) consists
   of beta-Ti grains and amorphous matrix. Due to the fast cooling speed
   and the shock effect from the laser pulse during welding, the spherical
   shape beta-Ti grains in the FZ are in nanometer scales, which are much
   smaller than the dendrite beta-Ti grains in the base materials (BM).
   Element distribution analysis showed that the Mo atoms trend to enter
   the beta-Ti lattice to form a solid solution. Therefore, the Mo element
   has the similar distribution with the Ti element in the joint. The
   hardness in FZ is higher than that in BM.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of
   dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Several
   brain-gut peptides are able to exert neuroprotective effects on the
   nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Apelin-13 is a neuropeptide,
   conveying potential neuroprotective activities. However, whether, and
   how, apelin-13 could antagonize rotenone-induced neurotoxicity has not
   yet been elucidated. In the present study, rotenone-treated SH-SY5Y
   cells and rats were used to clarify whether apelin-13 has protective
   effects on dopaminergic neurons, both in vivo and in vitro. The results
   showed that apelin-13 could protect SH-SY5Y cells from rotenone-induced
   injury and apoptosis. Apelin-13 was able to activate autophagy, and
   restore rotenone induced autophagy impairment in SH-SY5Y cells, which
   could be blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine. Apelin-13
   activated AMPK/mTOR/ULK-1 signaling, AMPK alpha inhibitor compound C, as
   well as apelin receptor blockage via siRNA, which could block
   apelin-13-induced signaling activation, autophagy activation, and
   protective effects, in rotenone-treated SH-SY5Y cells. These results
   indicated that apelin-13 exerted neuroprotective properties against
   rotenone by stimulating AMPK/mTOR/ULK-1 signaling-mediated autophagy via
   the apelin receptor. We also observed that intracerebroventricular
   injection of apelin-13 could alleviate nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron
   degeneration in rotenone-treated rats. Our findings provide new insights
   into the mechanism by which apelin-13 might attenuate neurotoxicity in
   PD.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we prove spectral multiplier theorems for abstract
   self-adjoint operators on spaces of homogeneous type. We have two main
   objectives. The first one is to work outside the semigroup context. In
   contrast to previous works on this subject, we do not make any
   assumption on the semigroup. The second objective is to consider
   polynomial off-diagonal decay instead of exponential one. Our approach
   and results lead to new applications to several operators such as
   differential operators, pseudo-differential operators as well as Markov
   chains. In our general context we introduce a restriction type estimates
   a la Stein-Tomas. This allows us to obtain sharp spectral multiplier
   theorems and hence sharp Bochner-Riesz summability results in some
   situation. Finally, we consider the random walk on the integer lattice
   Z(n) and prove sharp Bochner-Riesz summability results similar to those
   known for the standard Laplacian on R-n. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Title = {{How Does Rural-Urban Migration Experience Affect Arable Land Use?
   Evidence from 2293 Farmers in China}},
Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Return migrants play an increasingly important role in agricultural
   production in China and other developing countries. However, the effect
   of rural-urban migration experience on farmers' arable land use remains
   unclear. This study aims to fill this gap using data from a survey of
   2293 farmers consisting of 586 return migrants and 1707 non-migrants in
   China. We employ the treatment effects model to account for the
   self-selectivity of rural-urban migration experience arising from
   observable and unobservable factors. The results show that after
   accounting for the self-selectivity bias, the rural-urban migration
   experience significantly increases farmers' arable land use by 22\%.
   Meanwhile, the positive effect of rural-urban migration experience on
   arable land use differs by farmers' age group and region. While
   rural-urban migration experience increases arable land use for farmers
   aged below 65 years old by 29\%, it shows no significant effect on
   arable land use for farmers aged 65 years old and above. In addition,
   there is a positive relationship between rural-urban migration
   experience and arable land use in Shaanxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang.
   However, there is no significant effect of rural-urban migration
   experience on arable land use. On such a basis, we discuss several
   important implications for policies related to arable land use in China.}},

Title = {{The experimental study of fluorine-leaching ability of granite with
   different solutions: A new insight into the dynamic of groundwater
   fluorine levels along coastal zones}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{235}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Drinking-water fluorosis is universal along coastal zones, and the
   seawater or brine water intrusion is occasionally supposed to enrich
   groundwater fluorine levels. However, there is no conclusive proof, and
   the laws and mechanisms remain ambiguous. Granite, the common
   fluorine-bearing rock, is selected and experimented upon to reveal the
   characteristics and laws of fluorine's leaching ability during the
   intrusion of seawater. The fluorine-leaching ability increases with the
   increasing ratios of seawater or brine water, the increasing levels of
   NaCl or NaHCO3, and the decreasing levels of CaCl2. Such results
   directly confirm that seawater or brine water intrusion, as well as the
   conditions of higher Na+, HCO3- and lower Ca2+, promotes
   fluorine-leaching ability from granite. The intensities of Si-O-Si,
   Si-O-Fe, Si-O-Al bonds decrease but those of OH bonds increase with a
   higher ratio of seawater or brine water, the higher levels of NaCl or
   NaHCO3, and the lower levels of CaCl2. This indicates the more silicate
   dissolution and stronger OH-F exchange evoked by seawater or brine water
   intrusion are responsible for the higher fluorine-leaching from granite.
   Therefore, the process of seawater or brine water intrusion should be
   important for the groundwater enrichment dynamics along coastal zones.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND High-power, short-duration ablation for pulmonary vein
   isolation (PVI) in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) facilitates
   the procedure and improve effectiveness; however, esophageal injury
   remains a safety concern.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of
   luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring during high-power
   ablation for PVI in terms of endoscopic esophageal lesion.
   METHODS Patients with symptomatic AF underwent ablation index-guided
   high-power (AI-HP) PVI (50 W; AI anterior wall/posterior wall: 550/400).
   In the first consecutive set of patients, an insulated esophageal
   temperature probe was used for LET monitoring (cutoff LET >39 degrees C)
   (group A). In the second consecutive set of patients, the probe was not
   used (group B). All patients were scheduled to undergo esophageal
   endoscopy 1-3 days after ablation.
   RESULTS A total of 120 patients (60 group A; 60 group B) were included
   in the study (mean age 67.8 years; 64\% male). Baseline characteristics
   and procedural outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. Procedural
   PVI was achieved in all patients. First-pass PVI rate was 96.6\%. Mean
   procedural radiofrequency (RF) time was 11.5 minutes, mean procedural
   time was 55.5 minutes, and fluoroscopic time was 5.6 minutes. Mean
   contact force at the LA posterior wall was 23 g, and mean RF ablation
   time at the LA posterior wall was 3.2 minutes. Two patients in group A
   and 1 patient in group B had endoscopic small esophageal lesions (P =
   .99). No serious procedural adverse events were observed.
   CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing AI-HP (50 W) PVI, the incidences of
   ablation-related endoscopic esophageal lesion in patients with and those
   without use of a temperature probe for LET monitoring (cutoff 39 degrees
   C) were comparably low.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment plays a significant
   role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
   However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present
   study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory relationship between the
   Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
   (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, microRNA (miR)-181b and its target genes
   in sepsis in vivo and in vitro.
   Methods: Four rat models (sham, sepsis, sepsis plus STAT3 inhibitor
   (Stattic), and sepsis plus miR-181b inhibitor {[}sepsis +
   anta-miR-181b]) were established. For the in vitro experiments, rat
   brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMECs) and rat brain astrocytes
   (rAstrocytes) were cultured with 10\% serum harvested from sham, sepsis,
   and sepsis + anta-miR-181b rats. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-QPCR)
   analysis was carried out to detect the binding and enrichment of the
   JAK/STAT3 signal core transcription complex in the miR-181b promoter
   region. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to test
   miR-181b and its target genes. The cell adhesion rate of rBMECs was also
   measured.
   Results: During our investigations, the expression levels of miR-181b,
   p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and C/EBP beta were found to be significantly increased
   in the septic rats compared with the sham rats. STAT3 inhibitor halted
   BBB damage by downregulating the expression of miR-181b. In addition,
   miR-181b targeted sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) and
   neurocalcin delta (NCALD). The up-regulated miR-181b significantly
   decreased the cell adhesion rate of rBMECs. The administration of
   miR-181b inhibitor reduced damage to the BBB through increasing the
   expression of S1PR1 and NCALD, which again proved that miR-181b
   negatively regulates SIPR1 and NCALD to induce BBB damage.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway
   induced expression of miR-181b, which promoted BBB impairment in rats
   with sepsis by downregulating S1PR1 and decreasing BBB cell adhesion.
   These findings strongly suggest JAK2/STAT3/miR-181b axis as therapeutic
   target in protecting against sepsis-induced BBB damage.}},

   UCB samples by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS),
   chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing
   (RNA-seq), respectively.
   Findings: We revealed that H3K4me3 was the most profoundly impacted by
   ICSI and freeze-thawing operation compared with the other three types of
   histone modifications. IVF-ET seemed to introduce less disturbance into
   infant epigenomes than IVF-FET or ICSI-ET did. ARTs also decreased the
   similarity of DNA methylome within twin pairs, and we confirmed that ART
   per se would introduce conservative changes locally through removal of
   parental effect. Importantly, those unique and common alterations
   induced by different ART procedures were highly enriched in the
   processes related to nervous system, cardiovascular system and
   glycolipid metabolism etc., which was in accordance with those findings
   in previous epidemiology studies and suggested some unexplored health
   issues, including in the immune system and skeletal system.
   Interpretation: Different ART procedures can induce local and functional
   epigenetic abnormalities, especially for DNA methylation and H3K4me3,
   providing an epigenetic basis for the potential long-term health risks
   in ART-conceived offspring. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that tungsten (W) and other refractory metals with
   body-centered cubic (bcc) structures exhibit certain novel behavior when
   their grain size, d, is refined into the ultrafine (UFG, 100 nm < d <
   1000 nm) or nanocrystalline (NC, d < 100 nm) regime. For example, it has
   been shown that bcc refractory metals with such microstructures show
   decreased strain rate sensitivity besides their elevated strength and
   vanishing strain hardening response. Consequently, under both
   quasi-static and high-strain-rate loading, plastic instability in the
   form of shear banding becomes the dominant mode of plastic deformation.
   Such behavior is long sought-after in certain applications. However, due
   to the technology used to refine the grain size (primarily severe
   plastic deformation), the inability to scale the dimensions of the
   material may limit wider use and application of UFG/NC bcc refractory
   metals. In this work, the feasibility was demonstrated of production of
   large-scale W parts using a diffusion bonding method. The
   microstructure, preliminary mechanical properties, and issues and
   challenges associated with the fabrication procedures were examined and
   discussed. It is envisioned that diffusion bonding may serve as a
   promising technology for scaled-up fabrication of UFG bcc refractory
   metals for the targeted application.}},

Abstract = {{Telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) plays an important role in
   protecting telomeres from being recognized as DNA breaks. TRF2 performs
   its telomere protecting functions partially by recruiting a number of
   accessory proteins to telomeres through its TRF homology (TFRH) domain.
   Identification of small molecular compounds which can bind to the TRFH
   domain of TRF2 and block the interactions between TRF2 and its
   associated proteins is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms
   of these protein-protein interactions. Using a previously identified
   peptidic mimetic of ApolloTBM as a lead compound, we designed and
   synthesized a series of novel TRF2 inhibitors by non-peptidic
   modifications of the N-terminal residues. These compounds can maintain
   the binding affinities to TRF2 but have much reduced peptidic
   characteristics compared to the lead compound.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease characterized by
   cartilage destruction. It is the fourth most disabling disease worldwide
   and is currently incurable. Inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM)
   degradation are considered to be substantial reasons for accelerating
   the progression of OA. beta-Hydroxyisoamylshikonin (beta-HIVS) is a
   natural naphthoquinone compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
   activity. However, the effect of beta-HIVS on OA is still unclear. In
   this study, we found that beta-HIVS can down-regulate the expression of
   NO, PEG2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS, suggesting its
   anti-inflammatory effects in chondrocytes; we also found that beta-HIVS
   may down-regulate the expression of ADAMTS5 and MMP13 and up-regulate
   the expression of aggrecan and collagen II to inhibit the degradation of
   ECM. Mechanistically, beta-HIVS inhibited the NF kappa B pathway by
   activating the Nrf2/HO-1 axis, thereby exerting its anti-inflammatory
   and inhibitory effects on ECM degradation. In vivo experiments also
   proved the therapeutic effects of beta-HIVS on OA in mice, and Nrf2 is
   the target of beta-HIVS. These findings indicate that beta-HIVS may
   become a new drug for the treatment of OA.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ambient temperature self-blowing tannin-furanic foams have been prepared
   by substituting a great part-even a majority-of furfuryl alcohol with
   humins, a polyfuranic material derived from the acid treatment at high
   temperature of fructose. Closed-cell foams were prepared at room
   temperature and curing, while interconnected-cell foams were prepared at
   80 degrees C and curing, this being due to the more vigorous evaporation
   of the solvent. These foams appear to present similar characteristics as
   other tannin-furanic foams based only on furfuryl alcohol. A series of
   tannin-humins-furfuryl alcohol oligomer structures have been defined
   indicating that all three reagents co-react. Humins appeared to react
   well with condensed tannins, even higher molecular weight humins
   species, and even at ambient temperature, but they react slower than
   furfuryl alcohol. This is due to their high average molecular weight and
   high viscosity, causing their reaction with other species to be
   diffusion controlled. Thus, small increases in solvent led to foams with
   less cracks and open structures. It showed that furfuryl alcohol appears
   to also have a role as a humins solvent, and not just as a co-reagent
   and self-polymerization heat generator for foam expansion and hardening.
   Stress-strain for the different foams showed a higher compressive
   strength for both the foam with the lowest and the highest proportion of
   humins, thus in the dominant proportions of either furfuryl alcohol or
   the humins. Thus, due to their slower reactivity as their proportion
   increases to a certain critical level, more of them do proportionally
   participate within the expansion/curing time of the foam to the
   reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient spectrum utilization of non-orthogonal multiple access
   (NOMA) and flexible mobility of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enable
   NOMA UAV to become a prospective approach for future wireless networks.
   However, its secure transmission remains a great challenge. in this
   article, we summarize several potential solutions to mitigate
   adversarial eavesdropping toward aerial-ground transmission in NOMA-UAV
   networks, and propose three effective security schemes accordingly.
   First, a power allocation scheme is proposed at the UAV to ensure the
   privacy of a specific user with the sum transmission rate of others
   maximized. A closed-form solution is derived. Then, beamforming is
   leveraged to provide efficient privacy protection for multiple users in
   the network via jointly optimizing the precoding vectors to avoid
   eavesdropping and to maximize the spectrum efficiency. Finally, we
   perform artificial jamming together with beamforming to protect all the
   users in the network. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the
   superiority of the proposed schemes. Some future research issues and
   challenges of this direction are also pointed out.}},

Title = {{An Unsupervised Urban Extent Extraction Method from NPP-VIIRS Nighttime
   Light Data}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An accelerating trend of global urbanization accompanying various
   environmental and urban issues makes frequently urban mapping. Nighttime
   light data (NTL) has shown great advantages in urban mapping at regional
   and global scales over long time series because of its appropriate
   spatial and temporal resolution, free access, and global coverage.
   However, the existing urban extent extraction methods based on nighttime
   light data rely on auxiliary data and training samples, which require
   labor and time for data preparation, leading to the difficulty to
   extract urban extent at a large scale. This study seeks to develop an
   unsupervised method to extract urban extent from nighttime light data
   rapidly and accurately without ancillary data. The clustering algorithm
   is applied to segment urban areas from the background and multi-scale
   spatial context constraints are utilized to reduce errors arising from
   the low brightness areas and increase detail information in urban edge
   district. Firstly, the urban edge district is detected using spatial
   context constrained clustering, and the NTL image is divided into urban
   interior district, urban edge district and non-urban interior district.
   Secondly, the urban edge pixels are classified by an adaptive direction
   filtering clustering. Finally, the full urban extent is obtained by
   merging the urban inner pixels and the urban pixels in urban edge
   district. The proposed method was validated using the urban extents of
   25 Chinese cities, obtained by Landsat8 images and compared with two
   common methods, the local-optimized threshold method (LOT) and the
   integrated night light, normalized vegetation index, and surface
   temperature support vector machine classification method (INNL-SVM). The
   Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.687 to 0.829 with an average of 0.7686
   (1.80\% higher than LOT and 4.88\% higher than INNL-SVM). The results in
   this study show that the proposed method is a reliable and efficient
   method for extracting urban extent with high accuracy and simple
   operation. These imply the significant potential for urban mapping and
   urban expansion research at regional and global scales automatically and
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Internal jugular vein (IJV) and axillary vein/subclavian
   vein (AxV/SCV) are commonly used for implantable venous access port
   (IVAP) implantation in breast cancer (BC) patients with chemotherapy.
   Previous studies focused on complications between these different
   approaches and ignored patient comfort. In this study, we aim to compare
   patient comfort between IJV and AxV/SCV approaches, as well as surgery
   duration and complications.
   Methods: This is a single- center prospective randomized controlled
   clinical trial. A total of 200 patients diagnosed with invasive BC will
   be enrolled in this study. After signing written informed consent,
   patients schedule to undergo IVAP implantation will be randomized at a
   1:1 ratio to receive central venous catheters (CVC) with either IJV or
   AxV/SCV approaches. Baseline as well as demographic data and procedure
   time of port implantation will be recorded. All patients will receive
   assessment of comfort with a comfort scale table at days 1, 2 and 7
   after implantation surgery. Patients will be followed up and
   complications will be recorded until devices are removed at the end of
   the treatment period, or in case of complications. Patient comfort,
   procedure time of implantation and complications will be compared and
   analyzed between these two arms.
   Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
   compare patient comfort as primary outcome measure between IJV and
   AxV/SCV puncture. This study will further confirm the benefits of
   ultrasound guidance and may provide a better choice of IVAP implantation
   for BC patients.}},

Abstract = {{Iterative learning control (ILC) is a high-performance control design
   method for systems working in a repetitive manner. ILC has traditionally
   focused on tracking a reference defined at all points over a finite-time
   interval; recent developments have begun to exploit the design freedom
   unlocked by tracking only a finite number of distinct time instants
   driven by the needs of, e.g., robotic pick-and-place tasks. This paper
   proposes a generalized ILC paradigm, which extends and unifies the scope
   of existing design frameworks by amalgamating previous task descriptions
   and embedding system constraints on the input and output. A novel
   solution is then derived using a successive projection method, which
   provides well-defined convergence properties. The proposed design
   framework is illustrated by applying it to a spatial reference tracking
   problem with experimental results on a gantry robot testing platform
   demonstrating its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{A series of AlTiCN coatings with different carbon contents (0-0.7 at.\%)
   were deposited on YG10 (WC + 10 wt.\% Co) cemented carbide by cathodic
   arc-evaporation of Ti-Al/Ti-Al-C targets in a mixture of Ar and N-2
   gases. The influence of carbon doping on microstructure, mechanical
   properties, wear resistance and cutting performance was systematically
   investigated by comparing carbon-free coating and coatings with
   different carbon contents. The microstructure of the coatings has been
   changed significantly with the addition of C, and the amorphous domains
   appear when the doping amount of C is among 0.2-0.5 at.\%. Instead of
   forming bonds with other elements in the coating, carbon only acts as a
   growth inhibitor. When the carbon content is 0.2 at.\%, the hardness of
   the coating significantly decreased, but changes a little with the
   carbon content continue to rise. The addition of C significantly
   improves the wear resistance of the coating, which is mainly attributed
   to the transformation of the crystalline state and the formation of the
   dense Al2O3 oxide layer. Among them, the coating with a carbon content
   of 0.2 at.\% has both excellent wear resistance and cutting performance.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Based on the effective radiological responses, bevacizumab
   (BEV) has been widely used in the treatment of recurrent high-grade
   glioma. Although the current standard dose is 5 mg/kg/week, the optimal
   dosage of BEV is controversial, as few dose-response studies have been
   performed in recent years. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to
   explore the value of reduced-dose bevacizumab versus standard-dose
   bevacizumab in recurrent high-grade glioma treatment.
   Methods: Three major electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the
   Cochrane Library) were searched for eligible documents published before
   February 2020. Literature on low-dose bevacizumab versus conventional
   dose in progressive high-grade glioma was included, and the endpoints of
   eligible researches should be progression-free survival (PFS) and
   overall survival (OS). All available data were collected and then
   analyzed with Stata software.
   Results: Four cohort studies were evaluated, including 552 patients
   (reduced-dose BEV group: 257, standard-dose BEV group: 295). Low dose
   BEV seems to slightly improve survival compared to conventional dose as
   HR < 1 indicates a protective effect, but no significant differences in
   OS (HR 0.77; 95 \% CI 0.53-1.10; P = 0.151) and PFS (HR 0.66; 95 \% CI
   0.37-1.20; P = 0.175) were found between the two groups in this study.
   Conclusion: Reduced-dose bevacizumab schedule resulted in similar OS and
   PFS to standard-dose bevacizumab in recurrent high-grade glioma, with
   less side effects and less cost of treatment. Therefore, low-dose
   bevacizumab represents a promising therapeutic option for recurrent
   high-grade glioma patients. Further prospective randomized trials are
   needed to confirm our results.}},

Abstract = {{Spiral strands, galvanized steel wires, galvanized semiparallel wire
   strands, and steel tie rods in large-span building structures are
   inevitably corroded due to long-term exposure to corrosive atmospheres.
   However, research on different structural cables is rare, and lifetime
   safety evaluation of large-span building structures is urgently
   required. Therefore, three corrosion tests and static tensile tests
   after corrosion of four types of structural cables were conducted to
   determine the effects on corrosion behavior caused by plating, coating,
   twisting, and the environment. The corrosion behavior of a cable had
   different characteristics. A calculation method for the uniform
   corrosion depth of semiparallel wire strands and a three-parameter power
   function that effectively expresses the relationship between corrosion
   depth and exposure time were proposed and verified. The equivalent
   conversion relationship between the atmospheric exposure test and the
   standard laboratory accelerated corrosion test was established. The
   recommended 50-year corrosion depth for different structural cables was
   calculated, based on two corrosive environments in which long-span
   building structures often exist.}},

   Cathode Materials for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries}},

Abstract = {{P2-type sodium layered transition metal oxides have been intensively
   investigated as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
   (SIBs) by virtue of their high specific capacity and high operating
   voltage. However, they suffer from problems of voltage decay, capacity
   fading, and structural deterioration, which hinder their practical
   application. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the
   cationic/anionic redox activity and capacity fading is indispensable for
   the further improvement of electrochemical performance. Here, a
   prototype cathode material of P2-type Na0.6Mg0.3Mn0.7O2 is
   comprehensively investigated, which presents both cationic and anionic
   redox behaviors during the cycling process. By a combination of soft
   X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electroanalytical methods, we
   unambiguously reveal that only oxygen redox reaction is involved in the
   initial charge process, then both oxygen and manganese participate in
   the charge compensation in the following discharge process. In addition,
   a gradient distribution of Mn valence state from surface to bulk is
   disclosed, which could be mainly related to the irreversible oxygen
   activity during the charge process. Furthermore, we find that the
   average oxidation state of Mn is reduced upon extended cycles, leading
   to the noticeable capacity fading. Our results provide deeper insights
   into the intrinsic cationic/anionic redox mechanism of P2-type
   materials, which is vital for the rational design and optimization of
   advanced cathode materials for SIBs.}},

Title = {{Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium protects against isoproterenol-induced
   chronic heart failure via activation of PPAR gamma}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Accumulated clinical trials and animal studies showed that
   Qiliqiangxin (QLQX), a traditional Chinese medicine formula containing
   extracts of 11 herbs, exerts beneficial effects on chronic heart failure
   (HF). Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP), one herbal medicine in QLQX,
   has been widely used in treatment against digestive, respiratory and
   cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in China. However, the cardiac protective
   effects and mechanisms of CRP are still unclear.
   Methods: The effects of CRP were investigated in isoproterenol
   (ISO)-induced chronic HF mice model and neonatal rat ventricular
   cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) treated with ISO. Echocardiography was used to
   determine cardiac function. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and
   alpha-actinin immunofluorescent staining were used to measure
   cardiomyocyte size. Cardiac fibrosis was evaluated by Masson's trichrome
   staining. The expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) and
   brain natriuretic polypeptide (BNP) were determined by quantitative real
   time PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot was applied to examine the expression
   of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), PPAR
   gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), fibrosis-related and
   apoptosis-related proteins.
   Results: We found that CRP could significantly attenuate ISO-induced
   cardiac dysfunction, inhibit cardiac pathological hypertrophy and
   alleviate myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, the
   downregulation of PPAR gamma and PGC-1 alpha in ISO-injected mice hearts
   and ISO-treated NRVMs could be reversed by CRP treatment. The beneficial
   effects of CRP against ISO-induced HF were abolished by PPAR gamma
   inhibitor (T0070907), suggesting that CRP-mediated PPAR gamma
   upregulation was essential for the preventive effect of CRP on
   ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CRP attenuates
   ISO-induced cardiac remodeling via PPAR gamma activation, which
   represents a new application for CRP in the prevention of chronic HF.}},

Abstract = {{Direct regression methods have demonstrated their success on various
   multi-oriented benchmarks for scene text detection due to the high
   recall rate for small targets and the direct regression for text boxes.
   However, too many false positive candidates and inaccurate position
   regression still limit the performance of these methods. In this paper,
   we propose an end-to-end method by introducing position-sensitive
   segmentation into the direct regression method to overcome these
   shortcomings. We generate the ground truth of position-sensitive
   segmentation maps based on the information of text boxes so that the
   position-sensitive segmentation module can be trained synchronously with
   the direct regression module. Besides, more information about the
   relative position of text is provided for the network through the
   training of position-sensitive segmentation maps, which improves the
   expressiveness of the network. We also introduce spatial pyramid of
   position-sensitive segmentation into the proposed method considering the
   huge differences in sizes and aspect ratios of scene texts and we
   propose position-sensitive COI(Corner area of Interest) pooling into the
   proposed method to speed up the inference. Experiments on datasets
   ICDAR2015, MLT-17 and COCO-Text demonstrate that the proposed method has
   a comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods while it is more
   efficient. We also provide abundant ablation experiments to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of these improvements in our proposed method.}},

Title = {{DESTIN: A new method for delineating the boundaries of crop fields by
   fusing spatial and temporal information from WorldView and Planet
   satellite imagery}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{178}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The digital boundaries of crop fields represent a prerequisite for
   designing parcel-based crop management platforms, implementing online
   site-specific agronomic practices and monitoring crop growth per field.
   Previous approaches on field boundary delineation were mostly developed
   with medium resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat) for the regions or
   countries with intensive agriculture and large-sized crop fields.
   However, suitable delineation methods are scarce for the regions in
   developing countries where the majority of arable land is cultivated by
   smallholder farmers and distributed in small and fragmented crop fields.
   This study proposed a comprehensive method, delineation by fusing
   spatial and temporal information (DESTIN), to derive the boundaries of
   crop fields from sub-meter WorldView-2/3 and 3-m Planet imagery. After
   extraction of spatial objects from very high resolution (VHR) WorldView
   imagery, this method performed recognition of crop field objects using
   high resolution (HR) Planet-derived temporal features specifically
   concerning soil preparation and harvesting stages for summer crops. The
   performance of DESTIN in crop field boundary delineation was evaluated
   with the reference polygons (0.4-1.0 ha in area on average) over four
   subset areas in eastern China's Jiangsu province, and further compared
   with a benchmark objection extraction approach.
   The results demonstrated that the integration of WorldView and Planet
   imagery as demanded by DESTIN yielded accurate recognition of crop
   fields with the classification overall accuracy (OA) ranging from
   94.98\% to 98.84\%, which was remarkably improved over the use of
   WorldView or Planet imagery alone with increases in OA from 12\% to
   17\%. The majority of crop field boudaries were successfully delineated
   with both methods, but DESTIN produced cleaner polygons than the
   benchmark appraoch and closer matches of field boundaries to the
   reference. DESTIN also yielded better one-to-one matches between
   delineations and reference (77\% as opposed to 54\%) and fewer
   one-to-many matches (1\% as opposed to 33\%) as a reflection of being
   less prone to over segmentation. The DESTIN method does not need
   subjective parameterization for image segmentation, and could be
   applicable to the areas with availability of bi-temporal VHR imagery
   over the soil preparation and harvesting stages and HR imagery over the
   peak growth stage of summer crops. It has great potential for
   delineating the crop field boundaries in smallholder farming systems
   with VHR imagery acquired from satellite, airborne or unmanned aerial
   vehicle platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology-mediated interruptions have become widespread and
   ubiquitous in the workplace. However, our understanding of how these
   interruptions and individuals' interruption processing mechanism impact
   individuals' performance, especially psychological performance, is still
   limited. Leveraging Conservation of Resources Theory, this study focused
   on two types of IT-mediated information interruptions (congruent and
   incongruent) and examined the moderating effects of different process
   mechanisms on the relationship between information interruptions and
   individuals' interruption overload. A multi-methods research design was
   conducted in this study: a qualitative study with 20 interviews in Study
   1 and a quantitative study with 345 surveys in Study 2. The results show
   a positive indirect effect of IT-mediated information interruption on
   emotional exhaustion through interruption overload. Results also review
   the moderation effects of different processing mechanisms. The findings
   of this study advance the current understanding of the ``dark side{''}
   of online information behavior. Additionally, this study provides
   practical and theoretical implications for both employers and employees
   on how to process IT-mediated information interruptions in the
   workplace.}},

   Speciation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Robertsonian (centric-fusion) translocation is the form of chromosomal
   translocation in which two long arms of acrocentric chromosomes are
   fused to form one metacentric. These translocations reduce the number of
   chromosomes while preserving existing genes and are considered to
   contribute to speciation. We asked whether hypomorphic mutations in
   genes that disrupt the formation of pericentromeric regions could lead
   to centric fusion. TBP-related factor 2 (Trf2) encodes an alternative
   general transcription factor. A decrease of TRF2 expression disrupts the
   structure of the pericentromeric regions and prevents their association
   into chromocenter. We revealed several centric fusions in two lines of
   Drosophila melanogaster with weak Trf2 alleles in genetic experiments.
   We performed an RNAi-mediated knock-down of Trf2 in Drosophila and S2
   cells and demonstrated that Trf2 upregulates expression of D1-one of the
   major genes responsible for chromocenter formation and nuclear integrity
   in Drosophila. Our data, for the first time, indicate that Trf2 may be
   involved in transcription program responsible for structuring of
   pericentromeric regions and may contribute to new karyotypes formation
   in particular by promoting centric fusion. Insight into the molecular
   mechanisms of Trf2 function and its new targets in different tissues
   will contribute to our understanding of its phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Injuries to the acromioclavicular (AC) joint disrupting the
   AC and Coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments could lead to loss of clavicular
   strut function. A High-grade AC joint injury remain challenging because
   of highly variety of treatment and limited evidence exists comparing
   clinical outcomes and complications after surgery.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and
   radiological outcome after arthroscopic assisted acromioclavicular Joint
   fixation and anatomic acromioclavicular joint reconstruction. Study
   design: Retrospective Clinical Cohort Study.
   Methods: Twenty-nine patients with a high grade (Rockwood Type III-V)
   Acromioclavicular Joint Injury, operatively treated with arthroscopic
   assisted acromioclavicular joint fixation and anatomic acromioclavicular
   joint reconstruction from 2012 to 2018. The clinical assessment consists
   of Specific AC Score (SACS) and Nottingham Score. The radiographic
   evaluations were performed to evaluate the stability of reduction and
   the complications are assessed.
   Results: There were a significant different between groups with AC joint
   reconstruction and fixation group (20 vs. 8, p < 0.005) and (19 vs. 10,
   p < 0.005) in SAC score and Nottingham score, respectively. There were
   no significant different in CC dstance between two groups. At the last
   follow up 6 patient develop loss of reduction with CC percentage 50\% in
   AC joint fixation. Complication developed in 5 patients (17\%) including
   2 mild osteolysis, 1 superficial infection, 1 implant failure, and 1
   clavicle fracture.
   Conclusion: Anatomic AC joint reconstruction was associated with
   functional and radiologic benefits and better restored the stability.}},

Abstract = {{In the mid-19th century, the French Academy of Sciences was one of the
   oldest and most prominent scientific institutions in the world.
   Individuals seeking credit for the discovery of surgical anaesthesia
   contacted the French academy to achieve recognition from this
   prestigious body of scientists and to spread news of the discovery
   throughout continental Europe. The French Academy of Sciences was
   established under the reign of King Louis XIV in 1666 with the goal of
   supporting and advancing scientific research. Membership was limited to
   the most accomplished French scientists, who presented their research at
   weekly meetings and advised the French government on scientific matters.
   The academy began their deliberations on the discovery of anaesthesia in
   January 1847. Since anaesthesia had already been tested in the United
   States and Great Britain, the main contributions of the French academy
   deliberations included refining administration techniques and
   documenting the effects of anaesthesia on animals and humans.
   Recognition of surgical anaesthesia by the French Academy of Sciences
   and the swift adoption of its use in surgical practice throughout the
   country lent credibility to this new discovery and enabled the
   discipline of surgery to progress. Nevertheless, the academy was not
   able to solve the initial problem for which they may have been
   contacted-the dispute about which individual deserved credit for the
   discovery of anaesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the synthesis of fixed-order output feedback
   controllers for stability and performance of continuous-time switched
   linear systems with dwell time constraints or arbitrary switching.
   Specifically, this article starts by considering the stabilization
   problem, which is addressed by searching for a family of homogeneous
   polynomial Lyapunov functions parameterized polynomially by the sought
   controller. In order to conduct this search, polynomials are introduced
   for approximating the matrix exponential and for quantifying the
   feasibility of the Lyapunov inequalities. It is shown that a stabilizing
   controller exists if and only if a condition built solving three convex
   optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities holds for
   polynomials of degree sufficiently large. Analogous conditions for the
   existence of a controller ensuring desired upper bounds on the H-2 norm
   and on the rms gain of the closed-loop system are derived by searching
   for a family of homogeneous rational Lyapunov functions parameterized
   rationally by the sought controller.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Investigate the effect of distal nail diameter on proximal
   femoral shortening (PFS) after cephalomedullary nailing of hip
   fractures.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 80 patients aged 50 years and
   older with pertrochanteric hip fractures treated with a 10 or 11 mm
   short cephalomedullary nail (CMN) was performed. We measured abductor
   lever arm shortening, femoral height shortening, and PFS.
   Results: There was no difference in abductor lever arm shortening (p =
   0.09), femoral height shortening (p = 0.86), and PFS (p = 0.34) between
   the 10 and 11 mm groups.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that distal nail diameter does not
   affect PFS.}},

Abstract = {{There are known limitations in methods of detecting positive selection.
   Common methods do not enable differentiation between positive selection
   and compensatory covariation, a major limitation. Further, the
   traditional method of calculating the ratio of nonsynonymous to
   synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) does not take into account the 3D
   structure of biomacromolecules nor differences between amino acids. It
   also does not account for saturation of synonymous mutations (dS) over
   long evolutionary time that renders codon-based methods ineffective for
   older divergences. This work aims to address these shortcomings for
   detecting positive selection through the development of a statistical
   model that examines clusters of substitutions in clusters of variable
   radii. Additionally, it uses a parametric bootstrapping approach to
   differentiate positive selection from compensatory processes. A
   previously reported case of positive selection in the leptin protein of
   primates was reexamined using this methodology.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of Industry 4.0, localization of materials and factory
   items will play important roles in factory automation. Since GPS signals
   are not available in indoor environments, a lot of indoor localization
   technologies have been proposed based on inertial sensors, audio
   signals, visible light, wireless signals, etc. In this research, we
   consider using magnetic fields, which usually exhibit high uniqueness at
   different locations especially in factories where a lot of stacks,
   machineries, materials, and metal partitions may coexist. These factors
   allow us to incorporate deep learning neural networks to learn
   location-related features. Existing works try to collect magnetic field
   data by human and leverage interpolation to augment dataset. However,
   our experiments show that the data generated by interpolation is usually
   different from the ground truth because magnetic fields may not be
   linear. Therefore, to collect a large enough dataset without human
   intervention, we dispatch a robot carrying a smartphone to collect
   dataset at a fine resolution. We use these collected data to train two
   localization models: deep neural network (DNN) and recurrent neural
   network (RNN). Besides, we augment our RNN training dataset by combining
   multiple single-point magnetic values to synthesize fake magnetic
   trajectories. We conduct field trials, which validate that our approach
   outperforms previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Bronchomotor tone is regulated by contraction and relaxation of airway
   smooth muscle (ASM). A weakened ASM relaxation might be a cause of
   airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a characteristic feature of bronchial
   asthma. Pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is
   known as a mediator that causes ASM relaxation. To date, whether or not
   the PACAP responsiveness is changed in asthmatic ASM is unknown. The
   current study examined the hypothesis that relaxation induced by PACAP
   is reduced in bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) of allergic asthma. The
   ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized mice were repeatedly challenged with
   aerosolized OA to induce asthmatic reaction. Twenty-four hours after the
   last antigen challenge, the main bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) tissues
   were isolated. Tension study showed a BSM hyperresponsiveness to
   acetylcholine in the OA-challenged mice. Both quantitative RT-PCR and
   immunoblot analyses revealed a significant decrease in PAC(1) receptor
   expression in BSMs of the diseased mice. Accordingly, in the
   antigen-challenged group, the PACAP-induced PAC(1) receptor-mediated BSM
   relaxation was significantly attenuated, whereas the relaxation induced
   by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was not changed. These findings
   suggest that the relaxation induced by PACAP is impaired in BSMs of
   experimental asthma due to a downregulation of its binding partner
   PAC(1) receptor. Impaired BSM responsiveness to PACAP might contribute
   to the AHR in asthma.}},

Abstract = {{Tool health monitoring and maintenance scheduling are crucial to empower

   efficiently. An empirical study is conducted for validation in a leading
   thin film transistor liquid crystal displays manufacturing company. The
   results have shown practical viability of the proposed approach to
   provide an early detection of abnormal tool status, prolong the
   maintenance cycles for enhancing capacity utilization and productivity,
   and thus reduce the cost. Indeed, the developed solution is implemented

Abstract = {{This article argues, from the perspective of third-world approaches to
   international law (TWAIL), that the limitations of the Guiding
   Principles on Shared Responsibility (hereinafter `Guiding Principles')
   stem from the very fact that their drafters did not contest the Articles
   on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA).
   Therefore, before advancing a critique of the Guiding Principles, this
   article questions certain aspects of ARSIWA. It argues that ARSIWA tends
   to overlook the distinction between primary and secondary rules; does
   not take into account the thick and structured relations between
   corporations and the state in formulating the rule on attribution;
   completely neglects the principle of special and differential treatment
   (SDT) in framing secondary rules of state responsibility; and gives a
   negative connotation to the erga omnes principle. As a result, ARSIWA
   cannot do justice to weak states. Since the Guiding Principles merely
   seek to supplement ARSIWA, they fail to address key issues, including
   the shared responsibility of state and non-state actors, such as
   multinational corporations, for the violation of human rights and
   environmental norms and the application of SDT principles in determining
   shared responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of emerging mobility services has quickly received attention
   from scholars and media in recent years. Mobility services employing
   autonomous buses in transport systems is one such example. Mobility
   services using emerging technologies are expected to create social,
   economic, and environmental benefits. However, the potential benefits of
   emerging mobility services using autonomous technology will not be
   realized unless self-driving vehicles are accepted and used by many
   passengers. The recent worldwide pandemic caused us to recognize the
   benefits of autonomous technologies. This pretest-and-posttest designed
   research examines the predictors of willingness to ride autonomous buses
   in a closed environment. The results of this study indicate that a
   combination of factors, such as societal benefits, attitude and
   technology adoption, directly and indirectly influence an individual's
   acceptance of autonomous buses. This study finds that passengers'
   willingness to use emerging mobility services after a sample riding
   experience is higher than before having a sample riding experience.}},

Abstract = {{Mono-allelic dominant mutations in the desmoplakin gene (DSP) have been
   linked to known cardiac disorders, such as arrhythmogenic right
   ventricular cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. During the course
   of DSP cardiomyopathy, episodes of acute myocardial injury may occur.
   While their mechanisms remain unclear, myocarditis has been postulated
   as an underlying cause. We report on an adolescent girl with
   arrhythmogenic biventricular cardiomyopathy and three acute
   myocarditis-like episodes in whom we found a novel truncating DSP
   variant accompanied by a known low penetrance R490K variant in the
   NLRP3. Upon family screening, other carriers of the DSP variant have
   been identified in whom only mild cardiac abnormalities were found. We
   hypothesized that the uncommon course of cardiomyopathy in the proband
   as well as striking discrepancies in the phenotype observed in her
   family may be explained by the co-existence of her low penetrance
   genetic autoinflammatory predisposition.}},

Title = {{Comparing Rubber Bearings and Eradi-Quake System for Seismic Isolation
   of Bridges}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Seismic isolation systems have been used worldwide in bridge structures
   to reduce vibration and avoid collapse. The seismic isolator, damper,
   and Shock Transmission Unit (SUT) are generally adopted in the seismic
   design of bridges to improve their seismic safety with economic
   efficiency. There are several seismic isolation systems, such as Natural
   Rubber Bearing (NRB), Lead Rubber Bearing (LRB), and the Eradi-Quake
   System (EQS). EQS as a new technology is expected to effectively reduce
   both seismic force and displacement, but there is still some need to
   verify whether it might provide an economical and practical strategy for
   a bridge isolation system. Moreover, it is important to guarantee
   consistent performance of the isolators by quality control. A
   comparative evaluation of the basic properties of the available seismic
   isolators is thus necessary to achieve a balance between
   cost-effectiveness and the desired performance of the bridge subjected
   to extreme loading. Accordingly, in this study, the seismic response
   characteristics of the seismic isolation systems for bridges were
   investigated by conducting compressive test and compressive-shear test
   on NRB, LRB, and EQS.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro anti-inflammatory and skin moisturizing activities of Pilea
   martini (Levl.) Hand.-Mazz. were investigated on lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and human immortalized
   keratinocytes. Chromatographic analysis was performed to identify the
   chemical composition of the extracts. Pilea martini extracts
   significantly suppressed LPS-induced nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2,
   interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in
   dose-dependent manners. In addition, the extracts inhibited LPS-induced
   inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 proteins and their
   mRNA expression through causing a downregulation of nuclear factor-kappa
   B, activator protein 1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
   cascades. The extracts increased the production of hyaluronic acid
   levels and enhanced the expression levels of both filaggrin and serine
   palmitoyltransferase regulation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy
   analysis showed that the extracts contained 6 different compounds (malic
   acid, tryptophan, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and
   isoquercetin) that may contribute to their bioactivities. Taken
   together, Pilea martini extract showed remarkable promise as an
   anti-inflammatory and moisturizing agent.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility, technology, personal and political circumstances provide
   enhanced opportunities for contact with new or different spaces, people,

   photographs, written artifacts, material objects, and interview data
   from two Japanese International students' self-initiated project on
   undoing deeply ingrained cultural discourses and practices during their
   one-year study abroad program in Sydney. Using a narrative inquiry
   approach and drawing on ideas from translanguaging theory, I illustrate
   an accumulation of learning experiences that happened during the
   students' out-of-classroom translanguaging practices that eventually led
   them to a transformational understanding of the importance of activating
   all of their meaning-making resources for meaningful self-development.
   Finally, I discuss the transformative value in enacting translanguaging
   practices in relation to language learning.}},

Title = {{Analysis of the Risk Factors Associated with Hearing Loss of Infants
   Admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A 13-Year Experience in a
   University Hospital in Korea}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Early detection of hearing loss in neonates is important for normal
   language development, especially for infants admitted to the neonatal
   intensive care unit (NICU) because the infants in NICU have a higher
   incidence of hearing loss than healthy infants. However, the risk
   factors of hearing loss in infants admitted to the NICU have not been
   fully acknowledged, especially in Korea, although they may vary
   according to the circumstances of each country and hospital. In this
   study, the risk factors of hearing loss in NICU infants were analyzed by
   using the newborn hearing screening (NHS) and the diagnostic auditory
   brainstem response (ABR) test results from a 13-year period. A
   retrospective chart review was performed using a list of NICU infants
   who had performed NHS from 2004 to 2017 (n = 2404) in a university
   hospital in Korea. For the hearing loss group, the hearing threshold was
   defined as 35 dB nHL or more in the ABR test performed in infants with a
   `refer' result in the NHS. A four multiple number of infants who had
   passed the NHS test and matched the age and gender of the hearing loss
   group were taken as the control group. Various patient factors and
   treatment factors were taken as hearing loss related variables and were
   analyzed and compared. From the 2404 infants involved, the prevalence of
   hearing loss was 1.8\% (n = 43). A comparison between the hearing loss
   group (n = 43) and the control group (n = 172) revealed that history of
   sepsis, peak total bilirubin, duration of vancomycin use, days of
   phototherapy, and exposure to loop-inhibiting diuretics were
   significantly different, and can be verified as significant risk factors
   for hearing loss in NICU infants.}},

   Methods: Eighty adults with ID (men 36 women 44 age 43 +/- 13 years)
   provided data on falls history, health problems or limitations in daily
   life, physical activity (PA), and physical performance. We conducted
   independent-samples t-tests, and Chi-square (chi(2)) tests to examine
   the difference between fallers and non-fallers. Multivariate logistic
   regressions were performed to identify the independent effects of risk
   factors for falls in adults with ID.
   Results: Fallers had significantly lower SPPB, mobility, and moderate PA
   than non-fallers (p < .05). Fallers were more likely to be older, need
   support with activities of daily living (ADLs), and have arthritis or
   rheumatism, walking problem, and limitations to participating in PA than
   nonfallers (p < .05). Among these variables, only needing support with
   ADLs remained a significant independent predictor of falls in a
   multivariate model.
   Conclusion: Support need for ADLs can predict falls in individuals with
   ID. Caregivers may need to closely monitor adults with ID who need
   support for ADLs.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the installation of a cutting pin in front of a
   cylindrical rod was analyzed. Different cutting pin heights were
   compared through numerical simulations. The numerical simulations were
   conducted using ANSYS CFX (Ver. 17.2). The cutting pin heights were
   h(p)/H = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. The results revealed that the cutting pin
   with h(p)/H = 0.25 increased the strength of the horseshoe vortex, which
   occurred at the leading edge of the cylindrical rod. Therefore, the heat
   transfer distributions between the cutting pin and the cylindrical rod
   increased. Moreover, the area-averaged heat transfer distributions
   increased to up to a factor of 22 \% when the cutting pin was installed.
   Therefore, choosing an appropriate height for the cutting pin will be
   helpful when it is installed in front of the pin-fin array of the
   internal passage of a gas turbine blade.}},

   purposes with a tradeoff between power loss density and heating
   performance as well as microwave absorption for low observable
   performances. To investigate the microwave heating properties of the
   designed MHAHC, which exhibited a -10 dB microwave absorption
   performance from 1 to 18 GHz, a microwave heating test and a numerical
   simulation were conducted for a detailed analysis of the heating
   properties of the MHAHC. The experiments demonstrated that the designed
   MHAHC can be heated up to 43 degrees C within 1800 s at 5.8 GHz of

Journal = {{ENDOCRINE PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To understand osteoporosis screening practices, particularly
   in men, by a diverse cohort of physicians, including primary care
   physicians, endocrinologists, and geriatricians.
   Methods: We surveyed randomly selected members of the American Academy
   of Family Practice, Endocrine Society, and American Geriatrics Society.
   Respondents were asked to rate how often they would screen for
   osteoporosis in four different clinical scenarios by ordering a bone
   density scan. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted
   to determine factors associated with offering osteoporosis screening in
   men in each clinical scenario. Physicians were also asked to note
   factors that would lead to osteoporosis screening in men.
   Results: Response rate was 63\% (359/566). While 90\% respondents
   reported that they would always or frequently screen for osteoporosis in
   a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman, only 22\% reported they would screen
   a 74-year-old man with no significant past medical history.
   Endocrinologists were more likely to screen a 74-year- old man compared
   to primary care physicians (odds ratio, 2.32; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.10 to 4.88). In addition to chronic steroid use (94\%), history of
   nontraumatic fractures (88\%), and androgen-deprivation therapy for
   prostate cancer (82\%), more than half the physicians reported
   suppressive doses of thyroid hormone (64\%) and history of falls (52\%)
   as factors leading to screening for osteoporosis in men.
   Conclusion: Our survey results highlight heterogeneity in osteoporosis
   screening in men, with underscreening in some scenarios compared to
   women, and identify factors that lead to screening in men. These
   findings can help design interventions to improve osteoporosis screening
   in men.}},

   during ripening of cheddar cheeses manufactured from unpasteurized raw
   milk}},
Journal = {{LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cheese products may serve as vehicles for transmission of foodborne
   pathogens, causing disease outbreaks, particularly when unpasteurized
   raw milk is used for cheese production. Therefore, the adequacy of a
   60-day aging period for raw milk Cheddar cheese to eliminate Escherichia
   coliO157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes was evaluated. The changes in
   cheese components and characteristics of pH, Aw, coliform, and LAB were
   examined during the ripening process. Cheddar cheese was manufactured
   from raw milk artificially spiked with 1, 3, or 5 log CFU/mL L.
   monocytogenes or E. coliO157:H7. When compared with the pasteurized
   samples, the unpasteurized samples exhibited slightly lower pH values
   and similar aw values. No coliform were observed in the pasteurized
   cheese, whereas over 5-log CFU/g of coliform were found in the cheese
   made from unpasteurized milk during the early phases of ripening.
   However, coliform were completely eliminated from the cheese made from
   unpasteurized milk within five weeks. In contrast, while the level of
   LAB was initially 2-log lower in the cheese made from pasteurized milk
   than that derived with unpasteurized milk, the number of LAB between the
   two cheese preparations equalized within five weeks. Although L.
   monocytogenes numbers decreased significantly to below the detection
   limit (1-log CFU/g) during ripening, viable cells were isolated from all
   the inocula. E. coliO157:H7 cells also significantly decreased to below
   the detection limit during ripening at all the inoculation levels.
   However, viable cells were still detected. Thus, a 60-day ripening
   process alone may not be sufficient for elimination of contaminating
   pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of near-peer teaching experiences in
   the ophthalmology branch of the East Harlem Health Outreach Program
   (EHHOP), a student-run clinic, on teaching skills of fourth-year medical
   student Teaching Seniors (TS).
   DESIGN: Mixed-methods observational study, including online survey and
   telephone interview.
   SETTING: Student-run ophthalmology clinic affiliated with the Icahn
   School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Mount Sinai Hospital, a
   tertiary-care center in New York, NY.
   PARTICIPANTS: All EHHOP TS alumni from 2014 to 2019 were eligible for
   inclusion in our study. All 14 alumni participated in the survey, and 8
   participated in the follow-up interview.
   METHODS: EHHOP ophthalmology TS alumni were surveyed via an online
   survey and subsequent, optional, individual telephone interview. The web
   survey queried former TS on the impact of EHHOP ophthalmology
   experiences on self-reported teaching skills and comfort with teaching.
   Quantitative analysis of survey questions and qualitative analysis of
   telephone responses was performed and analyzed for themes.
   RESULTS: Majority of participants reported increased comfort teaching
   ophthalmology concepts, teaching the slit-lamp exam, and serving as
   mentors as a result of their experience. Qualitative analysis of
   telephone interviews revealed 4 major themes: (1) TS were a
   self-selected group of individuals with prior interest in teaching, (2)
   Teaching experiences in EHHOP had a positive impact in many
   teaching-related domains, (3) TS perceptions of teaching skills gained
   did not necessarily align with junior students' perceptions of teaching
   received, and (4) despite increased confidence and satisfaction with
   teaching experiences, TS desired more formal instruction in teaching.
   CONCLUSIONS: While TS perceptions of teaching skills gained in EHHOP
   ophthalmology were overwhelmingly positive, TS still desired formal
   instruction in teaching. Additionally, the effectiveness of near-peer
   education in a subspecialty like ophthalmology, with limited formal
   curricular time, may be more effective later in training, when a more
   solid foundation of knowledge is acquired. (C) 2020 Association of

Abstract = {{Background. Tracheobronchomalacia and airway obstruction from severely
   dilated pulmonary arteries in tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary
   valve (TOF-APV) has been associated with high rates of respiratory
   failure and mortality (15\% to 25\%). It is not known whether aggressive
   pulmonary artery (PA) or direct airway intervention during early
   definitive cardiac repair improves outcomes.
   Methods. A retrospective observational study was made of all patients
   undergoing surgical repair for TOF-APV at our center between 2006 and
   2018.
   Results. Twenty patients underwent repair at a median age of 51 days and
   PA Z-scores of 8.1. Twelve patients had a valve implanted, 6 of whom
   required reoperation for valve replacement at a median of 9 months
   (range, 3 to 28) compared with 8 who had initial transannular patch, and
   only 1 patient required subsequent valve replacement (P < .05). Seven
   patients had central PAs replaced with thin-walled Gore-Tex (WL Gore,
   Flagstaff, AZ) grafts; none of these required PA reoperation during a
   median follow-up of 26.5 months, whereas 3 of 13 patients who did not
   have PA replacement with Gore-Tex required subsequent PA reoperation (P
   < .05). Concomitant airway interventions (eg, tracheobronchopexy/plasty)
   were performed in 4 patients and none required subsequent airway
   interventions, whereas 2 patients not having initial airway intervention
   required subsequent tracheopexy (P < .05). Three patients in the cohort
   eventually required tracheostomy (15\%), and 2 patients died (10\%; on
   postoperative days 30 and 326); none had received initial airway
   intervention.
   Conclusions. Pulmonary artery replacement and aggressive direct airway
   management at initial definitive repair of cardiac TOF-APV can be
   performed safely with acceptable survival outcomes and low rates of
   airway and PA reintervention. (C) 2020 by The Society of Thoracic

Title = {{A Prospective Audit of Airway Code Activations and Adverse Events in Two
   Tertiary Hospitals}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Airway management outside the operating room can be
   challenging, with an increased risk of difficult intubation, failed
   intubation and complications. We aim to examine airway practices,
   incidence of difficult airway and complications associated with airway
   code (AC) activation.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective audit of AC activations and adverse
   events in two tertiary hospitals in Singapore. We included all adult
   patients outside the operating room who underwent emergency intubation
   by the AC team after AC activation. Adult patients who underwent
   emergency intubation without AC activation or before the arrival of the
   AC team were excluded. Data were collected and documented by the
   attending anaesthetists in a standardised survey form shortly after
   their responsibilities were completed.
   Results: The audit was conducted over a 20-month period from July 2016
   to March 2018, during which a total of 224 airway activations occurred.
   Intubation was successful in 218 of 224 AC activations, giving a success
   rate of 97.3\%. Overall, 48 patients (21.4\%) suffered an adverse event.
   Thirteen patients (5.8\%) had complications when intubation was carried
   out by the AC team compared with 35 (21.5\%) by the non-AC team.
   Conclusion: Dedicated AC team offers better success rate for emergency
   tracheal intubation. Non-AC team attempted intubation in the majority of
   the cases before the arrival of the AC team. Increased intubation
   attempts are associated with increased incidence of adverse events.
   Equipment and patient factors also contributed to the adverse events. A
   multidisciplinary programme including the use of supraglottic devices
   may be helpful to improve the rate of success and minimise
   complications.}},

   photocatalysis: An experimental and theoretical study}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{338-348}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Photocatalysis is a facile and eco-friendly approach for the removal of
   dyes and organic compounds, water splitting, and CO2 reduction and
   fixation. Herein we report the first use of P,S,O-co-doped graphitic
   carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to produce a photocatalyst hydrogel. The
   hydrogels are generated by photo-initiated crosslinking of
   N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide) with modified
   g-C3N4 materials and the photocatalytic activity is evaluated by
   monitoring the degradation of methyl blue (MB) solutions. S- or O-doping
   creates C-S or C-O bonds, respectively, by replacement N atoms, while
   Pdoping produces P-N bonds by substitution of C in the heptazine rings
   of g-C3N4. Based on a combination of theoretical calculations and
   experimental analyses, phosphorus, sulfur, and oxygen doping
   considerably facilitates charge separation across the heptazine rings
   and attracts photoexcited electrons, thus contributing to enhanced
   photocatalytic activity of doped g-C3N4 . The P,S,O-co-doped g-C3N4
   hydrogel exhibited high photocatalytic activity for MB removal under
   simulated solar irradiation and could be easily isolated and cleaned for
   reuse. Thus, this study reports the formation of a state-of-the-art
   photocatalyst hydrogel from P,S,O-co-doped g-C3N4 with enhanced
   photocatalytic activity and demonstrated reusability. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Use of C7 Slope as a Surrogate Marker for T1 Slope: A Radiographic Study
   in Patients with and without Cervical Deformity}},
Journal = {{WORLD NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{E516-E522}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: T1 slope has emerged as an impor-tant radiographic parameter
   in the evaluation and surgical management of adult cervical spinal
   deformity. Given the high rates of nonvisualization of T1 slope on
   pright cervical radiographs, however, this study examined the evaluation
   of C7 slope as a potential surrogate marker.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective review in adult patients with and
   without cervical deformity to examine the correlation of C7 and T1
   slopes on routine upright cervical radiographs. In secondary analysis,
   correlations of C7 and T1 slopes were made amongst various demographic
   variables, different surgical groups, and various measures of cervical
   alignment. Cervical deformity was defined as sagittal vertical axis >40
   mm, coronal Cobb angle >10 degrees, and sagittal Cobb >10 degrees in
   kyphosis.
   RESULTS: C7 slope was visualized in 93\% of patients as opposed to T1
   slope in 68\% of patients, leading to a final study population of 129
   patients. Mean values of C7 and T1 slopes were 26.5 degrees and 28.1
   degrees, respectively. Significant correlation was found in patients
   with and without cervical deformity (r = 0.9, P < 0.01). This
   correlation remained significant amongst demographics, surgical groups,
   and measures of cervical alignment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated that C7 and T1 were in direct
   correlation in a variety of different cohorts regardless of deformity
   status or prior fusion. This study indicates that C7 slope may be
   reliably used a surrogate marker especially when visualization of T1
   slope is not possible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper represents a novel method to suppress the thermal effects of
   flexure mechanism-based nanopositioning system by fluid (air or water)
   flow under certain pressure conditions through the internal fluidic
   channels of the compliant structure. The nanopositioning system made of
   stainless steel was additively manufactured, and the rectangular fluidic
   channels were formed on each side of the double compound type flexure
   mechanism-based compliant structure. The motion behavior was
   characterized by measuring the stiffness and frequency responses of the
   compliant structure with the hammering test while filling compressed air
   or the water through the fluidic channels. The thermal behavior was
   characterized by measuring the temperature distribution over the
   compliant structure and thermal displacement under the various
   compressed air pressure and water flow-rate conditions. Dynamic
   behaviors of the nanopositioning system under various fluid-fed
   conditions were also characterized by the Finite Element Method and were
   validated with experimental results. As a result, the compressed air- or
   water-fed mechanisms have the following characteristics: (1) the damping
   may increase when the fluid exists in the channels, (2) the compressed
   air-fed mechanism can move the stage with nanometer precision with fast
   response time, and (3) the media filled in the fluidic channels
   significantly lower the temperature increase and reduce thermal
   displacement error. Interestingly, two-fluid flows of the compressed air
   and water showed a similar tendency in suppressing the temperature
   increase. The proposed method is expected to meet the increasing needs
   for nanometer motion accuracies and the efforts achieving high precision
   in the thermally stable environments requiring from semiconductor
   industries and precision machine tool industries.}},

   M\&A evaluation and perceived values is stronger when the acquiring
   brand is from a lower luxury tier. However, the moderating effect on the
   relationship between perceived values and brand loyalty is stronger when

Abstract = {{The international governance of artificial intelligence (AI) is at a
   crossroads: should it remain fragmented or be centralised? We draw on
   the history of environment, trade, and security regimes to identify
   advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some
   considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak for
   centralisation. The risk of creating a slow and brittle institution, and
   the difficulty of pairing deep rules with adequate participation, speak
   against it. Other considerations depend on the specific design. A
   centralised body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy
   coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial, and fragmented
   institutions could self-organise. In sum, these trade-offs should inform
   development of the AI governance architecture, which is only now
   emerging. We apply the trade-offs to the case of the potential
   development of high-level machine intelligence. We conclude with two
   recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a
   central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set
   of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate
   structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second,
   fragmentation will likely persist for now. The developing landscape
   should be monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply
   inadequate.}},

Abstract = {{Tuz Lake is a shallow, perennial, inland hypersaline lake located at the
   center of the Turkey. Microbial populations developing in the
   sedimentary layers of the lake were investigated by using 16S rRNA
   gene-targeted Illumina MiSeq sequencing and cloning. A total of 11
   samples were taken from three sampling points. Here we report the
   relative abundance of microbial taxa distributed across the sediment
   samples. Abundant, rare and region-specific prokaryotic taxa were also
   examined and compared. The majority of high-throughput sequences were
   associated with the classes Halobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria,
   Bipolaricaulia, Desulfovibrionia, candidate division MSBL-1,
   Bacteroidia, and Desulfobacteria. Gemmatimonadota\_c, Rhodothermia,
   Alphaproteobacteria, Methanonatronarchaeia, Thermoplasmata,
   Halanaerobiia, Desulfobulbia, and Bacilli were other notable taxa with
   low abundance. A genus belonging to Bipolaricaulia was the most abundant
   taxon, accounting for 11.5\% of all MiSeq reads. Reads affiliated with
   the genera Halomonas, Desulfovermiculus, MSBL-1\_g1, and
   Halodesulfurarchaeum were also detected at high abundance.
   Bipolaricaulota, Bacteroidales, Desulfosalsimonas, Desulfobulbales,
   Gemmatimonadota, Lentisphaeria, Halobacteriales, MSBL-1, Thermoplasmata,
   and DHVEG-1 related phylotypes were also frequently represented in the
   clone libraries.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of malnutrition comparing the GLIM criteria, ESPEN definition
   and MST malnutrition risk in geriatric rehabilitation patients: RESORT}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3504-3511}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background \& aims: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition
   (GLIM) has developed new criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition.
   This study aimed 1) to determine and compare malnutrition prevalence and
   risk using the GLIM criteria, European Society for Clinical Nutrition
   and Metabolism (ESPEN) definition of malnutrition and the Malnutrition
   Screening Tool (MST) in patients admitted to subacute geriatric
   rehabilitation wards, 2) to explore the agreement of malnutrition
   prevalence determined by each definition, and 3) to determine the
   accuracy of the MST against the GLIM criteria and ESPEN definition as
   references.
   Methods: Geriatric rehabilitation patients (n = 444) from the
   observational, longitudinal REStORing health of acutely unwell adulTs
   (RESORT) cohort in Melbourne, Australia were included. The GLIM
   criteria, ESPEN definition and MST were applied. Accuracy was determined
   by the sensitivity, specificity and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
   Results: According to the GLIM criteria, the overall prevalence of
   malnutrition was 52.0\%. The ESPEN definition diagnosed 12.6\% of
   patients as malnourished and the MST identified 44.4\% of patients at
   risk for malnutrition. Agreement was low; 7\% of patients were
   malnourished and at risk for malnutrition according to all three
   definitions. The accuracy of the MST compared to the GLIM criteria was
   fair (sensitivity 56.7\%, specificity 69.0\%) and sufficient (AUC 0.63);
   MST compared to the ESPEN definition was fair (sensitivity 60.7\%,
   specificity 58.0\%) and poor (AUC 0.59).
   Conclusions: According to the GLIM criteria, half of geriatric
   rehabilitation patients were malnourished, whereas the prevalence was
   much lower applying the ESPEN definition. This highlights the need for
   further studies to determine diagnostic accuracy of the GLIM criteria
   compared to pre-existing validated tools. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and

Title = {{The Multidimensional Workaholism Scale: Linking the Conceptualization

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Scholarly interest in workaholism has increased dramatically in recent
   years. This research has underscored the detrimental effects of
   workaholism for employees, their families, and the organizations that
   employ them. Despite drastic improvements in the quality of studies
   examining workaholism over the past several decades, researchers
   continue to almost exclusively rely on older measures of workaholism or
   new measures derived from these original measures. In the present study,
   we outline why a new measure is needed and propose a multidimensional
   conceptualization of workaholism that encompasses motivational,
   cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. We then develop and
   validate a new multidimensional measure of workaholism: the
   Multidimensional Workaholism Scale (MWS). Evidence from 5 samples
   representing individuals working in a wide variety of occupations and
   industries throughout the United States (total N = 1,252) provides
   support that (a) our proposed 4-factor structure replicates and fits
   better than alternative models; (b) the measure demonstrates high
   reliability and content validity; (c) the measure demonstrates evidence
   for convergent and discriminant validity with constructs in
   workaholism's nomological network; (d) the measure demonstrates
   incremental validity in the prediction of important outcomes over and
   above prior measures of workaholism; and (e) the different dimensions
   demonstrate incremental validity in the prediction of specific outcomes
   over and above other dimensions of the MWS. Overall, results from the
   present study suggest that the MWS is a reliable and valid measure that
   can advance a more nuanced approach to research and practice relating to
   workaholism.}},

Journal = {{NURSING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Incorporating a patient's personal narrative into the electronic health
   record is an opportunity to more fully integrate the patient's values
   and beliefs into care, thus creating opportunities to deliver
   high-quality/high-value, person-centered care. Objectives
   The aim of the study was to present a study protocol of a narrative
   intervention to (a) compare the effects of the narrative intervention to
   usual care on primary outcome of person's (patient) perceptions of
   quality of communication, (b) compare the effects of the narrative
   intervention on secondary outcomes of biopsychosocial well-being, and
   (c) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the narrative
   intervention from the perspective of both persons: the patient and the
   acute care bedside nurse. Methods
   A randomized control trial is being conducted with a targeted enrollment
   of 80 patient participants and 80 nurse participants. The patient
   participants include individuals who are admitted to the acute care
   hospital for either heart failure or end-stage renal disease. An acute
   care beside nurse who has cared for the patient participant is also
   enrolled. Through a 1:1 random allocation scheme, stratified by illness,
   we will enroll 40 in the narrative intervention group and 40 in the
   usual care group. Patient participants will be assessed for
   patient-reported outcomes of patient's perception of quality of
   communication and biopsychosocial well-being. Results
   The study began in October 2019; 53 potential patient participants have
   been approached, 21 have enrolled, and 20 have completed the data
   collection process. Discussion
   The testing and integration of a person-centered narrative into the
   electronic health record is a novel approach to provide opportunities
   for improvement in communication between patients and nurses. The
   results from this study will provide important preliminary knowledge to
   inform future randomized clinical trials of narrative interventions
   leading to advances in how to best provide high-value, high-quality,
   person-centered care for persons living with serious illness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple and rapid
   technique to measure body composition (BC). Validity of BIA in patients
   with low body mass index (BMI) remains controversial. We assessed the
   validity of several BIA equations to evaluate fat-free mass (FFM), fat
   mass (FM) and muscle mass in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) by
   using dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference. Methods: Sixteen BIA
   equations developed for FFM and appendicular lean mass (ALM) were
   applied on electrical data measured by BIA in AN patients with BMI <16
   kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. BIA and DXA were done the same day after overnight
   fasting. Results were compared with the Bland-Altman method, Pearson
   correlation and a Lin concordance test. Results: Data from 115 female AN
   patients (14.6 +/- 1.2 kg/m<SUP><SUP>2</SUP></SUP>; 32.3 +/- 14.5 years)
   were included. FM and FFM assessed by DXA were, respectively, 4.2 +/-
   2.4 kg and 35.5 +/- 3.8 kg. The best results were obtained with Sun's
   equation: respectively for FM and FFM, Bland Altman bias at 0.548 and
   0.706 kg, Pearson correlation r at 0.86 and 0.86 and Lin concordance
   coefficient at 0.81 and 0.84. However, confidence intervals (CI) at 95\%
   were high (-2.73-3.83 kg for FM; -4.55-3.13 kg for FFM). Other equations
   also showed high 95\% CI. Accuracy was acceptable for Sun and Bedogni
   equations for FFM (approximately 66\%) but very low for FM prediction
   considering all equations (<15\%). Concerning ALM evaluated at 14.88 +/-
   2.04 kg by DXA, only Scafoglieri and Yoshida equations showed acceptable
   values: bias (-0.2 and 2.8\%), Pearson r (0.89 and 0.86), Lin
   concordance coefficient (0.82 and 0.82) and accuracy (83.5 and 82.6\%).
   Confidence intervals at 95\% were high for both equations (-2.1-2.0 for
   Scafoglieri equation and -1.6-2.4 for Yoshida equation). Conclusion: In
   AN patients with BMI < 16 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, no BIA equation tested was
   adapted to evaluate BC at the individual level.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Universal depression screening in youth typically focuses on strategies
   for identifying current distress and impairment. However, these
   protocols also play a critical role in primary prevention initiatives
   that depend on correctly estimating future depression risk. Thus, the
   present study aimed to identify the best screening approach for
   predicting depression onset in youth.
   Methods
   Two multi-wave longitudinal studies (N = 591, Age(M) = 11.74; N = 348,
   Age(M) = 12.56) were used as the `test' and `validation' datasets among
   youth who did not present with a history of clinical depression. Youth
   and caregivers completed inventories for depressive symptoms, adversity
   exposure (including maternal depression), social/academic impairment,
   cognitive vulnerabilities (rumination, dysfunctional attitudes, and
   negative cognitive style), and emotional predispositions (negative and
   positive affect) at baseline. Subsequently, multi-informant diagnostic
   interviews were completed every 6 months for 2 years.
   Results
   Self-reported rumination, social/academic impairment, and negative
   affect best predicted first depression onsets in youth across both
   samples. Self- and parent-reported depressive symptoms did not
   consistently predict depression onset after controlling for other
   predictors. Youth with high scores on the three inventories were
   approximately twice as likely to experience a future first depressive
   episode compared to the sample average. Results suggested that one's
   likelihood of developing depression could be estimated based on
   subthreshold and threshold risk scores.
   Conclusions
   Most pediatric depression screening protocols assess current
   manifestations of depressive symptoms. Screening for prospective first
   onsets of depressive episodes can be better accomplished via an
   algorithm incorporating rumination, negative affect, and impairment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: As adolescent suicide rates continue to rise, innovation in
   risk identification is warranted. Machine learning can identify suicidal
   individuals based on their language samples. This feasibility pilot was
   conducted to explore this technology's use in adolescent therapy
   sessions and assess machine learning model performance. Method: Natural
   language processing machine learning models to identify level of suicide
   risk using a smartphone app were tested in outpatient therapy sessions.
   Data collection included language samples, depression and suicidality
   standardized scale scores, and therapist impression of the client's
   mental state. Previously developed models were used to predict suicidal
   risk. Results: 267 interviews were collected from 60 students in eight
   schools by ten therapists, with 29 students indicating suicide or
   self-harm risk. During external validation, models were trained on
   suicidal speech samples collected from two separate studies. We found
   that support vector machines (AUC: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.69-0.81) and
   logistic regression (AUC: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.70-0.82) lead to good
   discriminative ability, with an extreme gradient boosting model
   performing the best (AUC: 0.78; 95\% CI: 0.72-0.84). Conclusion: Voice
   collection technology and associated procedures can be integrated into
   mental health therapists' workflow. Collected language samples could be
   classified with good discrimination using machine learning methods.}},

   lives}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bone metastases are common in breast cancer and may cause considerable
   morbidity including fractures, severe pain, nerve compression and
   hypercalcaemia. Alongside developments in the multidisciplinary
   management for patients with metastatic breast cancer, the use of
   bisphosphonates, and more recently denosumab, has transformed the course
   of advanced breast cancer for many patients resulting in a major
   reduction in skeletal complications, reduced bone pain and improved
   quality of life. Additionally, because the bone marrow microenvironment
   is so intimately involved in the metastatic processes required for
   cancer dissemination, the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates has been
   studied extensively over the past 25 years in many randomised trials. We
   now have clear evidence that bisphosphonates significantly reduce both
   metastasis to bone and mortality in postmenopausal women with early
   breast cancer. Efficacy seems similar across different biological
   subgroups of postmenopausal breast cancer with the use of either a
   nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate such as intravenous zoledronate or
   daily oral ibandronate as well as the non-nitrogen containing agent,
   daily oral clodronate. In this overview of evolving role of
   bisphosphonates in breast cancer, focussing particularly on pamidronate
   and zoledronate, the long winding development road from the 1970s
   through to the present day is described and some of the serendipitous
   findings, ``lucky breaks{''} and regulatory decisions along the way
   outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To evaluate the relationships between pulmonary transit time (PTT),
   cardiac function, and pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with heart
   failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and to explore how PTT
   performs in detecting pulmonary hypertension (PH).
   Methods and results In this prospective study, 57 patients with advanced
   HFrEF {[}49 men, 51 years +/- 8, mean left ventricular (LV) ejection
   fraction 26\% +/- 8] underwent echocardiography, right heart
   catheterization, and cardiac computed tomography (CT). PTT was measured
   as the time interval between peaks of attenuation in right ventricle
   (RV) and LV and was compared between patients with or without PH and 15
   controls. PTT was significantly Longer in HFrEF patients with PH (21 s)
   than in those without PH (11 s) and controls (8 s) (P < 0.001) but not
   between patients without PH and controls (P = 0.109). PTT was positively
   correlated with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) (r= 0.74), mean
   pulmonary artery pressure (r= 0.68), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
   peptide (r= 0.60), mitral (r= 0.54), and tricuspid (r=0.37)
   regurgitation grades, as well as with LV, RV, and left atrial volumes (r
   from 0.39 to 0.64) (P < 0.01). PTT was negatively correlated with
   cardiac index (r = -0.63) as well as with LV (r = -0.66) and RV (r =
   -0.74) ejection fractions. PAWP, cardiac index, mitral regurgitation
   grade, and RV end-diastolic volume were all independent predictors of
   PTT. PTT value >= 14 s best-detected PH with 91\% sensitivity and 88\%
   specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve:
   0.95).
   Conclusion In patients with HFrEF, PTT correlates with cardiac function
   and pulmonary haemodynamics, is determined by four independent
   parameters, and performs well in detecting PH.}},

Abstract = {{Astrocytes greatly participate to inflammatory and neurotoxic reactions
   occurring in neurodegenerative diseases and are valuable pharmacological
   targets to support neuroprotection. Here we used human astrocytes
   generated from reprogrammed fibroblasts as a cellular model to study the
   effect of the compound Laquinimod and its active metabolite
   de-Laquinimod on astrocyte functions and the astrocyte-neuron
   interaction. We show that human iAstrocytes expressed the receptor for
   the inflammatory mediator IL1 and responded to it via nuclear
   translocation of NF kappa B, an event that did not occur if cells were
   treated with Laquinimod, indicating a direct anti-inflammatory activity
   of the drug on the human astrocyte. Similarly, while exposure to IL1
   downregulated glial glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT1, treatment
   with Laquinimod supported maintenance of physiological levels of these
   proteins despite the inflammatory milieu. Laquinimod also induced
   nuclear translocation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), suggesting
   that drug action was mediated by activation of the AHR pathway. However,
   the drug was effective despite AHR inhibition via CH223191, indicating
   that AHR signaling in the astrocyte is dispensable for drug responses.
   Finally, in vitro experiments with rat spinal neurons showed that
   laquinimod did not exert neuroprotection directly on the neuron but
   dampened astrocyte-induced neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that
   fibroblast-derived human astrocytes represent a suitable model to study
   astrocyte-neuron crosstalk and demonstrate indirect, partial
   neuroprotective efficacy for laquinimod.}},

Abstract = {{We consider various versions of the obstacle and thin-obstacle problems,
   we interpret them as variational inequalities, with non-smooth

   apply and we have to exploit a better understanding on the constraint
   itself. We then apply this inequality to two associated problems. First
   we combine it with an abstract result on parabolic variational
   inequalities, to prove the convergence at infinity of the strong global
   solutions to the parabolic obstacle and thin-obstacle problems to a
   unique stationary solution with a rate. Secondly, we give an abstract
   proof, based on a parabolic approach, of the epiperimetric inequality,
   which we then apply to the singular points of the obstacle and

Abstract = {{A new Time Interleaved Block Windowed Burst OFDM (TIBWB-OFDM)
   transceiver scheme is studied in this paper, where adjacent OFDM
   sub-blocks are allowed to overlap in time. This leads to a smaller
   overall block, increasing the spectral efficiency and decreasing the
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals, when
   compared with standard TIBWB-OFDM. These efficiency gains are obtained
   at the expense of interference between sub-blocks, which deteriorates
   the performance. Thus, we propose several receiver embodiments that
   include frequency domain equalizers and time domain interference
   cancellation algorithms to cope with channel effects and interference
   introduced by the overlapping operation.}},

Abstract = {{In pursuit of a more systematic and comprehensive framework for
   personality assessment, we introduce procedures for assessing
   personality traits at the lowest level: nuances. We argue that
   constructing a personality taxonomy from the bottom up addresses some of
   the limitations of extant top-down assessment frameworks (e.g., the Big
   Five), including the opportunity to resolve confusion about the breadth
   and scope of traits at different levels of the organization, evaluate
   unique and reliable trait variance at the item level, and clarify
   jingle/jangle issues in personality assessment. With a focus on
   applications in survey methodology and transparent documentation, our
   procedures contain six steps: (1) identification of a highly inclusive
   pool of candidate items, (2) programmatic evaluation and documentation
   of item characteristics, (3) test-retest analyses of items with adequate
   qualitative and quantitative properties, (4) analysis of cross-ratings
   from multiple raters for items with adequate retest reliability, (5)
   aggregation of ratings across diverse samples to evaluate
   generalizability across populations, (6) evaluations of predictive
   utility in various contexts. We hope these recommendations are the first
   step in a collaborative effort to identify a comprehensive pool of
   personality nuances at the lowest level, enabling subsequent
   construction of a robust hierarchy - from the bottom up.}},

Title = {{``The best flood I ever had{''}: Contingent resilience and the
   (relative) success of adaptive technologies}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The practical operationalisation of resilience within cities is strongly
   linked to technology, such as better construction materials or
   redesigning urban form. Institutional and private sector actors often
   focus on issues relating to the technological innovation journey, such
   as `pathways' to implementation or `barriers' to market uptake, rather
   than whether adaptive technologies are the most appropriate resilience
   solution. These discourses frame urban resilience from the perspective
   of an innovation journey where technologies are perceived to succeed if
   there is high uptake. However, given the multi-perspective and
   multi-scale nature of urban resilience, the idea of `success' inevitably
   has complex spatial, temporal and scalar dimensions. The paper uses the
   case of property level flood resilience (PFR) technologies in the United
   Kingdom to introduce the notion of `contingent resilience' as a means to
   understand the trade-offs that are part of assessing and evaluating
   climate resilient technologies. We reveal that there are fundamental
   contradictions in what is deemed as a `success' depending on who is
   framing the problem, when the judgement is made, or where the scale of
   analysis lies. Above all, the paper highlights the importance of
   illuminating the struggles that do not just define success, but that
   spatially and temporally redistribute climate resilience in a hidden
   manner.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The search for innovative solutions that reduce the need for
   exploitation of natural resources and make use of residues to produce
   alternative construction materials is a necessity. Eggshell residues are
   a solid waste material rich in calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The present
   research investigates quicklime and hydrated lime produced from eggshell
   residues and blended with ground waste glass, analyzing their possible
   usage as a binder material for soil stabilization. The quicklime and
   hydrated lime studied herein are produced from the calcination of
   eggshell residue. Eggshell quicklime (EQL) and eggshell hydrated lime
   (EHL) were characterized for their physical properties (grain-size
   distribution, specific surface area, photo microscopy, and X-ray
   spectroscopy), mineralogy (X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric
   analysis), and chemical composition (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry).
   EQL and EHL consist predominantly of calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium
   hydroxide {[}Ca(OH)(2)], respectively. Increasing the amount of eggshell
   quicklime/hydrated lime resulted in the increase of the blend's
   mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness. In general, the
   results show that both EQL and EHL retain outstanding physical,
   mineralogical, and chemical characteristics suitable for soil
   stabilization with an alternative pozzolanic material. (c) 2020 American

Title = {{Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal-Induced Outer Membrane Vesicles Enhance
   Biofilm Dispersion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa}},
Journal = {{MSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to chronic infections in
   humans. Because they are recalcitrant to conventional therapy, they
   present a particularly difficult treatment challenge. Identifying
   factors involved in biofilm development can help uncover novel targets
   and guide the development of antibiofilm strategies. Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa causes surgical site, burn wound, and hospitalacquired
   infections and is also associated with aggressive biofilm formation in
   the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. A potent but poorly understood
   contributor to P. aeruginosa virulence is the ability to produce outer
   membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMV trafficking has been associated with
   cell-cell communication, virulence factor delivery, and transfer of
   antibiotic resistance genes. Because OMVs have almost exclusively been
   studied using planktonic cultures, little is known about their
   biogenesis and function in biofilms. Several groups have shown that
   Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) induces OMV formation in P.
   aeruginosa. Our group described a biophysical mechanism for this and
   recently showed it is operative in biofilms. Here, we demonstrate that
   PQS-induced OMV production is highly dynamic during biofilm development.
   Interestingly, PQS and OMV synthesis are significantly elevated during
   dispersion compared to attachment and maturation stages. PQS
   biosynthetic and receptor mutant biofilms were significantly impaired in
   their ability to disperse, but this phenotype was rescued by genetic
   complementation or exogenous addition of PQS. Finally, we show that
   purified OMVs can actively degrade extracellular protein, lipid, and
   DNA. We therefore propose that enhanced production of PQS-induced OMVs
   during biofilm dispersion facilitates cell escape by coordinating the
   controlled degradation of biofilm matrix components.
   IMPORTANCE Treatments that manipulate biofilm dispersion hold the
   potential to convert chronic drug-tolerant biofilm infections from
   protected sessile communities into released populations that are
   orders-of-magnitude more susceptible to antimicrobial treatment.
   However, dispersed cells often exhibit increased acute virulence and
   dissemination phenotypes. A thorough understanding of the dispersion
   process is therefore critical before this promising strategy can be
   effectively employed. Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) has been
   implicated in early biofilm development, but we hypothesized that its
   function as an outer membrane vesicle (OMV) inducer may contribute at
   multiple stages. Here, we demonstrate that PQS and OMVs are
   differentially produced during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm
   development and provide evidence that effective biofilm dispersion is
   dependent on the production of PQSinduced OMVs, which likely act as
   delivery vehicles for matrix-degrading enzymes. These findings lay the
   groundwork for understanding OMV contributions to biofilm development
   and suggest a model to explain the controlled matrix degradation that
   accompanies biofilm dispersion in many species.}},

Title = {{Influence of teeth anatomical characteristics on the efficacy of manual
   toothbrushing manoeuvres}},
Journal = {{SAUDI DENTAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{337-342}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of two
   toothbrushing tech-niques on the amount of plaque accumulation and to
   evaluate how the changes were correlated to the anatomical
   characteristics of the anterior maxillary arch.
   Methods: Thirty subjects of both genders were included, they were asked
   not to brush for 12 h. Afterwards, they were asked to manually brush the
   left side of their maxillary arch with the modified Bass technique and
   the right side adopting the roll technique. The comparison of
   photographs taken before and after the manoeuvres, using a plaque
   disclosing agent, allowed the researchers to measure the changes in
   plaque accumulation measured using the Quigley and Hein plaque scoring
   classification. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the
   correlation between such changes and the teeth and arch anatomical
   characteristics.
   Results: A mean reduction of 9.6 +/- 5.2\% considering both arches after
   brushing was observed. The changes in plaque accumulation were not
   different between the two techniques. The length of the line obtained
   joining the contact point between the central incisors and the contact
   point between the second premolar and the first molar on the left side
   and the distance between that line and the lateral incisor on the same
   side positively correlated to the decrease in the plaque scores (P =
   0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively).
   Conclusion: Both tested techniques were effective in plaque removal in
   the anterior maxillary arches. However, the research for the anatomical
   factors influencing the amount of efficacy of the toothbrushing
   manoeuvres was inconclusive. We can hypothesise that the adoption of one
   adequate technique could be more important than the teeth
   characteristics. (c) 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by

Title = {{Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation and morphine transiently inhibit
   trigeminal pain signaling in a chronic headache model}},
Journal = {{PAIN REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:Chronic headache conditions are characterized by persistent
   sensitization of the trigeminal system, which involves dysfunction of
   descending pain modulation. We previously reported that noninvasive
   vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) inhibits trigeminal nociception in models
   of episodic migraine through a mechanism involving enhanced serotonergic
   and GABAergic descending pain signaling.Objectives:The analgesic
   effectiveness of nVNS and morphine were investigated in an animal model
   of chronic headache mediated by the combination of the 3 migraine risk
   factors of neck muscle tension, paradoxical sleep deprivation, and
   pungent odors.Methods:Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with complete
   Freund's adjuvant in the trapezius and sleep deprived for 1 night to
   promote trigeminal sensitization. After 7 days, animals were exposed to
   a pungent odor, and mechanical nocifensive head withdrawal responses
   were determined using von Frey filaments. Beginning on day 3 after odor
   exposure, animals were treated daily with either nVNS or morphine for 7
   days.Results:Exposure of animals sensitized by neck inflammation and
   sleep deprivation to a pungent odor resulted in a prolonged state of
   trigeminal nociception. Daily administration of nVNS or morphine
   significantly repressed the nocifensive response; however, cessation
   resulted in a return to heightened pretreatment nocifensive
   levels.Conclusions:The combination of reported migraine risk factors
   promotes a state of sustained trigeminal hypersensitivity characteristic
   of chronic headache. Daily nVNS was similarly effective as morphine in
   inhibiting nociception and may represent a safer, opioid-sparing
   therapeutic option for other chronic pain disorders involving
   sensitization of the trigeminal system by promoting descending pain
   modulation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the response surface methodology was applied to the
   production ofCaulobacter crescentus(strain NA1000) beta-xylosidases
   using corn cob. The components of the medium that presented the greatest
   influence on the enzyme production were chosen for optimization
   including the concentration of the corn cob residue and temperature
   variation. Optimal concentrations were determined by a central composite
   rotational design and a combination of 3.5\% (w/v) corn cob
   concentration and 27 degrees C temperature was found to be optimal.
   WhenC. crescentuswas cultivated using the optimized conditions, a
   maximum activity of 393.36 U/mL of beta-xylosidases was achieved in 24-h
   cultures with a yield of 95\% in real test conditions compared to the
   predicted one. In parallel, there was an increase of 3.6 times in the
   production of intracellular xylanases when compared to cultures without
   statistical application. In theC. crescentusgenome, 5 genes that encode
   beta-xylosidases are present. In order to evaluate which of them would
   be induced in the optimized conditions, the quantitative expression
   (qPCR) of thexynB1-xynB5genes was evaluated in the presence of 1 or
   3.5\% corn cob (w/v) and surprisingly, all showed a constitutive
   expression in relation to the control. Assays of Western Blot performed
   with a polyclonal antiserum againstC. crescentus beta-xylosidase II in
   the optimized condition also did not show mass variation of the referred
   protein. These data strongly suggest that post-transcriptional controls
   are operating in the induced condition to increase the activity ofC.
   crescentus beta-xylosidases I-V, but beta-xylosidase II. To our
   knowledge, this is the first time that these data are reported in

   Sections Strengthened with FRCM Materials}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The strengthening intervention strategies that exist for masonry
   buildings are based on the use of thin composites and are a recent
   activity used in structural engineering. Nowadays, mortar matrices are
   frequently found instead of epoxy resins, since the fiber reinforced
   cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites are more compatible with masonry
   than fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) ones. The mortar matrix in FRCM
   composites is not comparable to the epoxy resin, and therefore its
   contribution is different not only in traction but above all on the
   compression side. Due to its larger thickness, if compared to the epoxy
   resin, the impact of the mortar matrix on the flexural response of
   strengthened cross sections is not negligible. This paper aimed to
   investigate the influence of the contribution of the mortar matrix on
   the compression side on the flexural capacity of strengthened cross
   section. As such, p-m interaction domains and bending moment-curvature
   diagrams were evaluated to understand the influence of several
   mechanical properties of fiber and mortar matrices on FRCM efficiency,
   typical of real applications. Hence, the impact of several constitutive
   relationships of composites (linear and bilinear behavior) was
   considered for the structural analysis of the strengthened cross
   section. The presented results are all completely in a dimensionless
   form; therefore, independent of geometry and mechanical parameters can
   be the basis for developing standardized design and/or verification
   methodologies useful for the strengthening systems for masonry elements.}},

Title = {{Using deep learning to generate synthetic B-mode musculoskeletal
   ultrasound images}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective: Deep learning approaches are common in image
   processing, but often rely on supervised learning, which requires a
   large volume of training images, usually accompanied by hand-crafted
   labels. As labelled data are often not available, it would be desirable
   to develop methods that allow such data to be compiled automatically. In
   this study, we used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate
   realistic B-mode musculoskeletal ultrasound images, and tested the
   suitability of two automated labelling approaches.
   Methods: We used a model including two GANs each trained to transfer an
   image from one domain to another. The two inputs were a set of 100
   longitudinal images of the gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and a set of
   100 synthetic segmented masks that featured two aponeuroses and a random
   number of `fascicles'. The model output a set of synthetic ultrasound
   images and an automated segmentation of each real input image. This
   automated segmentation process was one of the two approaches we
   assessed. The second approach involved synthesising ultrasound images
   and then feeding these images into an ImageJ/Fiji-based automated
   algorithm, to determine whether it could detect the aponeuroses and
   muscle fascicles.
   Results: Histogram distributions were similar between real and synthetic
   images, but synthetic images displayed less variation between samples
   and a narrower range. Mean entropy values were statistically similar
   (real: 6.97, synthetic: 7.03; p = 0.218), but the range was much
   narrower for synthetic images (6.91-7.11 versus 6.30-7.62). When
   comparing GAN-derived and manually labelled segmentations,
   intersection-over-union values-denoting the degree of overlap between
   aponeurosis labels-varied between 0.0280-0.612 (mean +/- SD: 0.312 +/-
   0.159), and pennation angles were higher for the GAN-derived
   segmentations (25.1 vs. 19.3; p < 0.001). For the second segmentation
   approach, the algorithm generally performed equally well on synthetic
   and real images, yielding pennation angles within the physiological
   range (13.8-20).
   Conclusions: We used a GAN to generate realistic B-mode ultrasound
   images, and extracted muscle architectural parameters from these images
   automatically. This approach could enable generation of large labelled
   datasets for image segmentation tasks, and may also be useful for data
   sharing. Automatic generation and labelling of ultrasound images
   minimises user input and overcomes several limitations associated with
   manual analysis. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This

   difficulties on waste sorting intention in Beijing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{272}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Waste sorting is the most crucial step in the success of waste
   management. Recently in Beijing, a series of regulations have been
   introduced to promote the household's adoption of waste sorting. While
   these regulations matter, it is necessary for policymakers to better
   understand why and why not people intend to adopt waste sorting. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of residents'
   awareness of benefits and difficulties on the waste sorting intention
   and how policy plays a role in determining residents' intention to adopt
   waste sorting. Drawing upon the Theory of Reasoned Action, a conceptual
   framework is tested on a sample of Chinese residents in Beijing (n =
   267) using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Results reveal
   that there is a positive relationship between resident's awareness of
   benefits and their waste sorting intention. However, there is a negative
   relationship between resident's perceived difficulties and their
   intention to engage in waste sorting. These findings are found to be
   contingent upon the extent of perceived policy effectiveness. The
   findings of this study provide environmental policymakers with not only
   insights into reasons behinds residential waste sorting intention but
   also several recommendations in promoting waste sorting among the
   residents. This study also suggests policymakers to carefully design
   effective waste sorting policies by highlighting the benefits and
   lessening the difficulties. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The motion of fully immersed granular materials, composed of two
   distinct particle sizes, flowing down rough inclined planes is studied
   through fluid-particle numerical simulations. We focus on the effect of
   ambient fluids, as well as their interplay with particle size
   segregation, on the steady-state kinematic and rheological profiles of
   the granular-fluid mixture flow. Simulation results are analyzed in the
   framework of a visco-inertial rheological model, which is first
   validated in monodisperse flows with a wide range of the ambient fluid
   viscosity (i.e., from air to water and slurry) and then generalized for
   size-bidisperse mixtures. It is found that the local effective friction
   and volume fraction of mixtures with different particle sizes can be
   approximated from the rheology of single-component flows. While the
   presence of viscous ambient fluids slows down size segregation
   (perpendicular to the flow) depending on the mixture composition and
   flow viscosity, the effective bulk friction is shown to be independent
   of the state and progress of segregation.}},

Title = {{The past is not the future in tobacco control}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we have attempted to identify missed opportunities to
   change the trajectory of smoking and smoking caused diseases in America
   over the past 100 years. Many of the missed opportunities identified are
   due to the actions of cigarette manufacturers who misled the public
   about the dangers of cigarette smoking, the addictiveness of nicotine,
   and the feasibility of providing lower risk alternative nicotine
   delivery products to addicted smokers. An important lesson learned from
   the past is that treating all tobacco/nicotine products as equivalently
   harmful is counterproductive to public health as it only serves to
   protect the most lethal nicotine product - cigarettes. Since 2000, the
   evolving marketplace of lower risk nicotine products combined with
   regulatory authority over tobacco products represents a new opportunity
   to dramatically transform the cigarette business in ways that were never
   imagined when the war on tobacco was raging decades ago. However, this
   requires embracing risk-proportionate regulation, taxation policies, and
   providing consumers with accurate public messaging on product relative
   risks. A regulatory framework based on sound science that encourages and
   rewards new or existing manufacturers to invest in consumer acceptable
   lower risk products to replace cigarettes needs to be encouraged. The
   past is indeed not the future in smoking control, but it may be
   difficult to escape the past unless a realignment of market forces and
   policies can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the application of stochastic technique allied to
   the constructal design (CD) method and computational modeling for the
   optimization of composed plates reinforced by stiffeners. More
   specifically, it seeks to determine the optimal geometric configuration
   of the stiffened plate that minimizes its maximum deflection. For this
   purpose, a simply supported rectangular plate (with no stiffeners) was
   adopted as a reference. Then, a set of geometric configurations was
   proposed, through the application of CD method, by transforming a volume
   fraction (phi) of the reference plate into longitudinal and transverse
   stiffeners, maintaining the total volume, in-plane dimensions, boundary
   conditions, and loading. Regarding the optimization procedure, the
   genetic algorithm (GA) was chosen as the optimization method, and the
   geometric parameters considered as degrees of freedom were as follows:
   the number of longitudinal (N-ls) and transverse (N-ts) stiffeners; the
   thickness of the longitudinal (t(ls)) and transverse (t(ts)) stiffeners;
   and longitudinal and transverse stiffeners' heights ratio (h(ts)/h(ls)).
   Moreover, several values of phi were considered. Results indicated a
   great influence of the geometry on the mechanical behavior of the
   stiffened plates, as the optimal geometric configuration obtained here
   led to a reduction of over 98\% in the maximum deflection in comparison
   with the reference plate.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In fractures where surface fluctuations are large compared to their
   aperture (narrow fractures), the flow is forced to move in tortuous
   paths that produce additional viscous friction and are subject to
   inertia effects. We consider the relation between the magnitude of
   surface roughness and the onset of inertial effects in the pressure
   driving the flow through a single open fracture. We performed
   experiments systematically varying the average aperture of the open
   fracture and covering a wide range of Reynolds numbers. For each
   aperture, we analyze the data in terms of the Forchheimer equation and
   show that the critical Reynolds number, defined as the Reynolds number
   at which inertial effects contribute 10\% of the total pressure losses,
   is highly correlated with the roughness of the surface. In particular,
   we show that significant inertial effects appear earlier as the relative
   importance of surface roughness increases. Finally, we present results
   showing that the magnitude of the deviations in the pressure field
   compared to a linear profile, taken at different points in the fracture
   along the flow direction, is directly related to the relative surface
   roughness of the fracture.}},

Title = {{Gender and mental health service use in bipolar disorder: national
   cohort study}},
Journal = {{BJPSYCH OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Despite evidence of gender differences in bipolar disorder
   characteristics and comorbidity, there is little research on the
   differences in treatment and service use between men and women with
   bipolar disorder.
   Aims
   To use routine data to describe specialist mental health service contact
   for bipolar disorder, including in-patient, community and support
   service contacts; to compare clinical characteristics and mental health
   service use between men and women in contact with secondary services for
   bipolar disorder.
   Method
   Cross-sectional analysis of mental health patients with bipolar disorder
   in New Zealand, based on complete national routine health data.
   Results
   A total of 3639 individuals were in contact with specialist mental
   health services with a current diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 2015. Of
   these 58\% were women and 46\% were aged 45 and over. The 1-year
   prevalence rate of bipolar disorder leading to contact with specialist
   mental health services was 1.56 (95\% CI 1.50-1.63) per 100 000 women
   and 1.20 (95\% CI 1.14-1.26) per 100 000 men. Rates of bipolar disorder
   leading to service contact were 30\% higher in women than men (rate
   ratio 1.30, 95\% CI 1.22-1.39). The majority (68\%) had a diagnosis of
   bipolar I disorder. Women were more likely to receive only out-patient
   treatment and have comorbid anxiety whereas more men had substance use
   disorder, were convicted for crimes when unwell, received compulsory
   treatment orders and received in-patient treatment.
   Conclusions
   Although the prevalence of bipolar disorder is equal between men and
   women in the population, women were more likely to have contact with
   specialist services for bipolar disorder but had a lower intensity of
   service interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanization and automation constitute an essential stage in the
   production and operation of any company, as one of the determinants of
   increase in labor productivity and decrease in product price, while
   significantly contributing to shortening of the lead time. Businesses
   are, therefore, able to quickly put projects into operation, improving
   economic efficiency, quality, and aesthetics, which speeds up the
   national economic growth. For the construction industry to be the most
   effective, modern construction equipment is a necessity. It is one of
   the five main resources of a construction project. Thus, effective
   construction equipment management contributes to the success of a
   project and benefits the relevant construction companies economically.
   This paper presents the critical risk factors affecting equipment
   management and proposes suitable solutions. The questionnaire-based
   survey with experienced experts in the construction sector on the
   management of the likelihood and consequence of risk factors revealed
   thirty-two risks for equipment management in construction companies.
   These factors fell into six groups: (i) site organization-related risks;
   (ii) management-related risks; (iii) owner-related risks; (iv)
   supplier-related risks; (v) legal risks, and (vi) site condition-related
   and external risks. The results showed that management-related factors
   contributed to the most significant risks and problems for equipment
   management in construction companies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an efficient methodology, allowing the controlled
   co-immobilization of two complementary biomolecules, is reported for the
   production of multifunctional antibacterial surfaces. To promote
   long-lasting covalent immobilization, metallic surfaces are first coated
   with a quinone-bearing poly(methacrylate)-based thin film by combining
   an atmospheric pressure liquid-assisted plasma polymerization and a
   controlled sodium periodate-induced catechol oxidation steps. The
   influence of the oxidation step on the film morphology and chemistry is
   investigated using an analytical multitool approach involving atomic
   force microscopy, ultraviolet, infrared, and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy techniques. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   monitoring (QCM-D) analyses allow the rapid determination of the optimal
   biomolecule immobilization conditions in terms of kinetics of grafting
   and biomolecule solution concentrations. In vitro functional assays
   combined with QCM-D analyses demonstrate promising, dual biologically

Abstract = {{Fibre-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites have been
   effectively used during the last ten years for the strengthening of
   existing concrete and masonry structures. These composite materials are
   made of medium- and high-strength fibre meshes embedded in inorganic
   matrices. Synthetic fibres are the ones that are currently the most
   used; however, natural fibres, such as basalt fibres, have recently been
   receiving growing attention. This work presents an extensive
   experimental study on the mechanical characterisation of a primed basalt
   fibre bidirectional grid. Fifty monotonic tensile tests on basalt grid
   strips were performed by varying different parameters, such as the
   dimension of the specimens, the clamping system, the measurement system
   and the test rate. Some of the tests were carried out using a
   video-extensometer to measure each specimen's strain. The aim of the
   study was to find the most suitable setup for the tensile
   characterisation of basalt textiles, in particular, to prevent slippage
   of the samples at the gripping area and fully exploit the tensile
   capacity of the grid.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to understand how high heels have been present for so
   long in the socio-cultural evolutionary process, addressing the
   consequences that this type of footwear produced, especially in the work
   environment, demystifying the power of fascination it causes in women
   and understanding the issue of the male fetish with respect to that
   object. As a methodology, a research was carried out in which historical
   facts, blogs and scientific articles were analyzed for theoretical
   development. As a result, it was found that the use of high heels in
   daily life can be very harmful to the spine and legs of women and that
   the use of these shoes is the result of a machoistic culture, based on
   the fetishism of the male imagination.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the properties of halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs) in
   solar cycles 23 and 24. We compare the HCME properties between the
   corresponding phases (rise, maximum, and declining) in cycles 23 and 24
   and compare those between the whole cycles. Despite the significant
   decline in the sunspot number (SSN) in cycle 24, which dropped by 46\%
   with respect to cycle 23, the abundance of HCMEs is similar in the two
   cycles. The HCME rate per SSN is 44\% higher in cycle 24. In the maximum
   phase, cycle 24 rate normalized to SSN increased by 127\%, while the SSN
   dropped by 43\%. The source longitudes of cycle 24 HCMEs are more
   uniformly distributed than those in cycle 23. We found that the average
   sky-plane speed in cycle 23 is similar to 16\% higher than that in cycle
   24. The size distributions of the associated flares between the two
   cycles and the corresponding phases are similar. The average speed at a
   central meridian distance (CMD) >= 60(0) for cycle 23 is similar to 28\%
   higher than that of cycle 24. We discuss the unusual bump in HCME
   activity in the declining phase of cycle 23 as being due to exceptional
   active regions that produced many CMEs during 2003 October-2005 October.
   The differing HCME properties in the two cycles can be attributed to the
   anomalous expansion of cycle 24 CMEs. Considering the HCMEs in the rise,
   maximum, and declining phases, we find that the maximum phase shows the
   highest contrast between the two cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Recursive definitions of predicates are usually interpreted either
   inductively or coinductively. Recently, a more powerful approach has
   been proposed, calledflexible coinduction, to express a variety of
   intermediate interpretations, necessary in some cases to get the correct
   meaning. We provide a detailed formal account of an extension of logic
   programming supporting flexible coinduction. Syntactically, programs are
   enriched bycoclauses, clauses with a special meaning used to tune the
   interpretation of predicates. As usual, the declarative semantics can be
   expressed as a fixed point which, however, is not necessarily the least,
   nor the greatest one, but is determined by the coclauses.
   Correspondingly, the operational semantics is a combination of standard
   SLD resolution and coSLD resolution. We prove that the operational
   semantics is sound and complete with respect to declarative semantics
   restricted to finite comodels.}},

Title = {{Soil water retention in alpine meadows under different degradation
   stages on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Alpine meadow degradation has become serious in recent decades due to
   the combined effects of overgrazing, human activities and rodents, but
   very few studies focus on the possible impact of alpine meadow
   degradation on soil water retention on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In
   this study, four degradation stages (non-degradation, ND; light
   degradation, LD; moderate degradation, MD; heavy degradation, HD) were
   selected. Results showed that (1) the aboveground biomass decreased with
   increasing degradation, while the belowground biomass first increased
   and then decreased with a maximum value in MD. (2) As the degree of
   degradation increased from ND to MD, the 0-10 cm soil bulk density (BD)
   and soil compaction (SC) decreased with the minimum values in MD (0.61 g
   cm(-3) for BD and 1619.51 kPa for SC), while soil organic matter (SOM)
   increased with maximum value in MD (247.36 g kg(-1)), the 0-10 cm SOM in
   MD was the 1.5 times of that in ND. However, the 0-10 cm particle size
   distribution did not change significantly with increasing degradation,
   while the 20-40 cm clay content in HD was significantly higher than
   those of the other three degradation stages, (3) The MD stage displayed
   a strong water holding capacity in 0-10 cm soil layer due to its higher
   soil organic matter induced by the thick mattic epipedon. Meanwhile, the
   water holding capacity in the HD stage was higher than that of the other
   three degradation stages in the 20-40 cm soil layer owing to its higher
   capillary porosity. Furthermore, the soil water retention was greatly
   affected by the mattic epipdon through its effects on soil properties
   such as reducing BD and increasing SOM. Our results suggested that the
   mattic epipdon may play a crucial role in water retention in alpine
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Across phyla, chemosignals are a widely used form of social
   communication and increasing evidence suggests that chemosensory
   communication is present also in humans. Chemosignals can transfer, via
   body odors, socially relevant information, such as specific information
   about identity or emotional states. However, findings on neural
   correlates of processing of body odors are divergent. The aims of this
   meta-analysis were to assess the brain areas involved in the perception
   of body odors (both neutral and emotional) and the specific activation
   patterns for the perception of neutral body odor (NBO) and emotional
   body odor (EBO). We conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE)
   meta-analysis on 16 experiments (13 studies) examining brain activity
   during body odors processing. We found that the contrast EBO versus NBO
   resulted in significant convergence in the right middle frontal gyrus
   and the left cerebellum, whereas the pooled meta-analysis combining all
   the studies of human odors showed significant convergence in the right
   inferior frontal gyrus. No significant cluster was found for NBOs.
   However, our findings also highlight methodological heterogeneity across
   the existing literature. Further neuroimaging studies are needed to
   clarify and support the existing findings on neural correlates of
   processing of body odors.}},

Abstract = {{New macrocycles derived from dibenzo-18-crown-6 and molecules derived

   for nucleophilic fluorination of alkyl mesylates with potassium fluoride
   by reliable computational methods. In addition, 3 known catalysts
   (18-crown-6, {[}2.2.2]-cryptand, and pentaethylene glycol) were also
   simulated. In the kinetic model, the solubilization of the salt by the
   macrocycle, the possible dimerization of the KF(cat) complex and the
   reaction of the solubilized KF(cat) complex were considered. The
   calculated free energy barriers for the known catalysts are in very good
   agreement with published experimental data. For the new designed
   catalysts, all of them were predicted to be effective in promoting
   fluorination. A novel macrocycle based on a thiourea-crown-ether
   structure, named TCEbut, was calculated to be the most effective
   catalyst, even overcoming {[}2.2.2]-cryptand. This catalyst works by
   complexing the potassium ion and making four hydrogen bonds provided by

Abstract = {{The UN Sustainable Development Goals to 2030 call for action by the
   globe to tackle some of the most pressing problems facing humanity.
   There is a key role for business in helping to meet the goals, and in
   particular, small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for
   over 90\% of global businesses. Many organisations that were already
   engaged in addressing sustainability prior to the release of the SDGs
   will need to shift their approach to accommodate the new framework,
   including SMEs like Sydney Theatre Company (STC). This paper explores
   the use of the SDG Compass as a tool for making that shift by revisiting
   a previous case study on STC's sustainability journey since 2008 to
   assess the efficacy of the SDG Compass as a guide to addressing the
   SDGs. It finds that the SDG Compass is prohibitively complex for SMEs
   which could impede engagement with the SDGs by SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of a newly
   developed steering unit with enhanced self alignment and deadband on
   mental workload (MW) during heavy vehicle operation. Fourteen
   participants performed two tasks consisting of a lane keeping and a
   double lane shift with two tractors equipped with 1) a conventional and
   2) an enhanced steering system. Physiological measurements, i.e.,
   electromyography, electrodermal activity and heart rate were recorded
   during the tasks. Furthermore, performance measurements and subjective
   perception of MW were collected. Present study demonstrated that
   participants perceived the enhanced steering system requiring less
   mental demands to operate. Participants improved their performance
   during the lane keeping task and tended to improve in the double lane

Abstract = {{Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), characterized by triglycerides (TG)
   permanently over 10 mmol/L, may correspond to familial chylomicronemia
   syndrome (FCS), a rare disorder. However, hypertriglyceridemic patients
   more often present multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS),
   characterized by highly variable TG. A few nonsense variants of LMF1
   gene were reported in literature in FCS patients. In this study, we
   described a woman with an intermittent severe HTG. NGS analysis and the
   sequencing of a long range PCR product revealed a homozygous deletion of
   6507 base pairs in LMF1 gene, c.730-1528\_898-3417del, removing exon 6,
   predicted to create an in-frame deletion of 56 amino acids,
   p.(Thr244\_Gln299del). Despite an exon 6 homozygous deletion of LMF1,
   the patient's highly variable lipid phenotype was suggestive of MCS
   diagnosis. (C) 2020 National Lipid Association. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Prior literature suggests after-hours delay
   leads to poor functional outcomes in stroke patients undergoing
   thrombectomy. We aimed to evaluate the impact of time of presentation on
   mechanical thrombectomy (MT) metrics and its association with long-term
   functional outcome in an Interventional Radiology (IR) suite equipped
   operating room (OR) setting. Methods: Retrospective review of
   prospectively maintained database on all stroke patients undergoing
   mechanical thrombectomy between January 2015 and December 2018 at our
   CSC. Work hours were defined by official OR work hours (Monday-Friday 7
   AM and 5 PM) and after-hours as between 5 PM and 7 AM during weekdays
   and weekends as well as official hospital holidays. Primary outcome was
   90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes included door to
   groin puncture time and procedural complications. Results: A total of
   315 patients were included in the analyses. 209 (66.4\%) received
   mechanical thrombectomy after hours and 106 (33.6\%) during work hours.
   There was no difference in the shift distribution of functional outcome
   on the mRS at 90 days (OR: 1.14, CI: 0.72-1.78, p=0.58) and the
   percentage of patients achieving functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90
   days (43.1\% vs. 41.3\%; p=0.83) between the after hour and work hour
   groups respectively. Similarly, there was no difference in median door
   to groin times and procedural complications among both groups, with
   significant year on year improvement in overall time metrics.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that undergoing MT during off-hours had
   similar functional outcomes when compared to MT during working hours in
   an OR setting. The after-hours deleterious effect might disappear when
   MT is performed in a system with 24-hours in-house Anesthesia and IR
   tech services.}},

Abstract = {{Security vulnerabilities in web traffic can directly lead to data leak.
   Preventing these data leaks to a large extent has become an important
   problem to solve. Besides, the accurate detection and prevention of
   abnormal changes in web traffic is of great importance. In this study, a
   hybrid approach, called C-NSA, based on the negative selection algorithm
   (NSA) and clonal selection algorithm (CSA) of artificial immune systems
   for the detection of abnormal web traffic on the network is proposed and
   a user-friendly application software is developed. The real and
   synthetic data in the Yahoo Webscope S5 dataset are used for web traffic
   and the data are split into windows using the window sliding. In the
   experimental studies, the abnormal web traffic data is detected by
   monitoring the changes in the number of activated detectors in the
   C-NSA. It is observed that the average accuracy performance of finding
   anomalies in real web traffic data is 94.30\% and the overall
   classification accuracy is 98.22\% based on proposed approach. In
   addition, false positive rate of the proposed approach using C-NSA is
   obtained as 0.029. In addition, the results in synthetic web traffic
   data using C-NSA are achieved as average 98.57\% classification
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-free secretory products (secretome) of human induced pluripotent
   stem cells (iPSCs) have been shown to attenuate tissue injury and
   facilitate repair and recovery. To examine whether iPSC secretome
   facilitates mechanically induced compensatory responses following
   unilateral pneumonectomy (PNX), litter-matched young adult female hounds
   underwent right PNX (removing 55\%-58\% of lung units), followed by
   inhalational delivery of either the nebulized-conditioned media
   containing induced pluripotent stem cell secretome (iPSC CM) or control
   cell-free media (CFM); inhalation was repeated every 5 days for 10
   treatments. Lung function was measured under anesthesia pre-PNX and 10
   days after the last treatment (8 wk post-PNX); detailed quantitative
   analysis of lung ultrastructure was performed postmortem. Pre-PNX lung
   function was similar between groups. Compared with CFM control,
   treatment with iPSC CM attenuated the post-PNX decline in lung diffusing
   capacity for carbon monoxide and membrane diffusing capacity,
   accompanied by a 24\% larger postmortem lobar volume and distal air
   spaces. Alveolar double-capillary profiles were 39\% more prevalent
   consistent with enhanced intussusceptive angiogenesis. Frequency
   distribution of the harmonic mean thickness of alveolar blood-gas
   barrier shifted toward the lowest values, whereas alveolar septal tissue
   volume and arithmetic septal thickness were similar, indicating septal
   remodeling and reduced diffusive resistance of the blood-gas barrier.
   Thus, repetitive inhalational delivery of iPSC secretome enhanced
   post-PNX alveolar angiogenesis and septal remodeling that are associated
   with improved gas exchange compensation. Results highlight the
   plasticity of the remaining lung units following major loss of lung mass
   that are responsive to broad-based modulation provided by the iPSC
   secretome.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY To examine whether the secreted products of human
   induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) facilitate innate adaptive
   responses following loss of lung tissue, adult dogs underwent surgical
   removal of one lung, then received repeated administration of iPSC
   secretory products via inhalational delivery compared with control
   treatment. Inhalation of iPSC secretory products enhanced capillary
   formation and beneficial structural remodeling in the remaining lung,
   leading to improved lung function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Qualitative and quantitative detection of nucleic acids of
   SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19), plays a significant role in COVID-19 diagnosis,
   surveillance, prevention, and control.
   Methods: A total of 117 samples from 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19
   and 61 patients without COVID-19 were collected. Reverse transcriptase
   quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were used for
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of these samples to evaluate the
   diagnostic performance and applicability of the two methods.
   Results: The positive detection rates of RT-qPCR and ddPCR were 93.3\%
   and 100\%, respectively. Among the 117 samples, 6 samples were tested
   single-gene positive by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR, and 3 samples
   were tested negative by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR. The viral load of
   samples with inconsistent results were relatively low (3.1-20.5
   copies/test). There were 17 samples (37\%) with a viral load below 20
   copies/test among the 46 positive samples, and only 9 of them were
   successfully detected by RT-qPCR. A severe patient was dynamically
   monitored. All 6 samples from this patient were tested negative by
   RT-qPCR, but 4 samples were tested positive by ddPCR with a low viral
   load.
   Conclusion: Qualitative analysis of COVID-19 samples can meet the needs
   of clinical screening and diagnosis, while quantitative analysis
   provides more information to the research community. Although both ddPCR
   and RT-qPCR can provide qualitative and quantitative results, ddPCR
   showed higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection than RT-qPCR, and
   it does not rely on the standard curve to quantify viral load.
   Therefore, ddPCR offers greater advantages than RT-qPCR.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of damage resistant nanostructured materials with high
   strength and fracture toughness is a challenging task. In this work,
   multi-scale interfaces were implemented into a hierarchical TiN/SiOx
   microstructure to mimic stepwise crack growth behaviour of the hard and
   damage resistant bivalve mollusc Saxidomus purpuratus shell. In situ
   micromechanical testing in scanning and transmission electron
   microscopes revealed multi-scale crack deflection events at grain
   boundaries of individual alternately-tilted TiN crystallites, at kinks
   of their repeatedly tilted columnar grains as well as crack interaction
   with perpendicular interfaces of elastic amorphous SiOx layers. These
   events induced an increase in the crack surface area, reduction of the
   crack driving force and dissipation of local stress and energy at the
   crack tip with subsequent crack slow-down or arrest, resulting in
   fracture toughness exceeding by similar to 200\% the toughness of
   monolithic TiN nanoceramics. By this perspective biomimetic
   microstructural design, catastrophic failure of brittle ceramics may be
   turned into a predictable and controllable process increasing
   reliability of strong materials in various challenging safety-critical
   engineering applications. It also shows potential paths for the
   development of strong and simultaneously tough materials with high
   mechanical and thermal stability. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Demand charge savings from solar PV and energy storage}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With an increasing number of jurisdictions considering alternatives to
   net metering policies to financially compensate behind-the-meter solar
   photovoltaics (PV), customer economics will increasingly depend on its
   ability to reduce demand charges. Understanding these demand charge
   savings from PV and how behind-the-meter storage can potentially enhance
   those savings is essential to understand PV market dynamics and adoption
   in the coming years. This article explores how these demand charge
   savings vary with demand charge designs and customer load profiles,
   modeled for a variety of residential and commercial customers. Our
   findings indicate that demand charge savings are lowest under a basic,
   non-coincident demand charge design where the demand charge is based on
   the maximum demand level over the month, regardless of timing, resulting
   primarily from the temporal mismatch between the timing of the PV host's
   demand peak and PV generation. PV provides greater demand charge
   savings, for both commercial and residential customers, when demand
   charge designs are based on predefined, daytime peak periods or longer
   averaging intervals. Demand charge savings from PV combined with storage
   are almost always greater than the sum of the savings attained through
   either technology separately. We also explore how well demand charge
   savings from PV align with corresponding utility savings.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report poorer
   quality of life (QOL) than do nonanxious controls. Further, although
   positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) have been shown to predict
   QOL, no previous literature has tested this relationship in the context
   of individuals with GAD. In the present study, we evaluated the unique
   and interactive contributions of PA and NA on QOL within a sample of
   individuals diagnosed with GAD (N = 50). Specifically, a hierarchical
   regression was conducted to evaluate the unique contributions of PA, NA,
   and their interaction on QOL, over and above symptoms of depression. PA
   and depression symptoms were both significant predictors of QOL, whereas
   neither the main effect for NA nor the PA x NA interaction was
   statistically significant. Results suggest that, for those with GAD, PA
   uniquely contributes to QOL. Strategies to upregulate PA may be a useful
   treatment target for increasing QOL in individuals with GAD.}},

Abstract = {{A new producer of fungal inulinase Penicillium amphipolaria KAS 2555,
   has been isolated from the soil area of dead mangroves litter in
   Herikudru island, followed by the production and optimization of
   inulinase enzyme by solid-state fermentation (SSF) utilizing a cheap
   substrate - hardy sugarcane (Saccharum arundinaceum) stems. During the
   screening process, only P.amphipolaria KAS 2555 displayed a zone of
   hydrolysis on the inulin media. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
   confirmed the action pattern and the exoinulolytic nature of the
   inulinase enzyme. After 4 days of fermentation, 2.45 U/gds activity was
   obtained. The inulolytic nature of the inulinase was proven by obtaining
   0.59 I/S ratio. The optimization of media was carried out to obtain a
   regression model using central composite design. Five media constituents
   viz., inulin, (NH4)(2)SO4, K2HPO4, KH2PO4, and, NaCl were used for
   optimization. The coefficient of determination (R-2) calculated was
   0.9490 for the inulinase activity. An inulinase activity of 7.59 U/gds
   (3.1 times higher than non-optimized medium) was observed at optimal
   conditions: (g/gds) inulin- 0.1, (NH4)(2)SO4- 0.002, K2HPO4- 0.1,
   KH2PO4- 0.02 and NaCl- 0.02.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ecotoxicological measurement is vital for unbeaten soil-based/soil-less
   amendment with bioenergy by-products like biochar and the germination
   experiment is a trustworthy method for different types of biochar
   phytotoxicity investigation. An experiment was conducted to study the
   ecotoxicological responses of four weed biochar on seed germination and
   seedling growth in acidic soil at three different level of application
   in maize and black gram. The weed derived biochar were prepared at 600
   degrees C followed by their characterization. With increase in biochar
   application rate the seed germination increased for both maize and
   black. The seedling growth parameter was significantly enhanced by low
   biochar application rate (5 t/ha) than high rate (10 t/ha). The
   Artemisia vulgaris (AVB) biochar performed better than all other biochar
   and it may be due to that the original biomass AV was medicinal in
   nature. The Bidens sp. (BB) and Neyraridia sp. (NB) biochar performed
   moderately and the worst performance observed by Chromolaena odorata
   (COB) biochar for both seed germination and seedling growth. At higher
   dose few seedling growth parameters were inhibited due to presence of
   toxic level elements selenium and chromium. The shoot/root ration (s/r)
   increased with augmentation in biochar application rate except NB for
   maize and irregular trend for black gram. Thus low cost biochar should
   be promoted for the welfare of agricultural production. (C) 2020

Title = {{Exploring the safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous autologous serum
   therapy versus conventional intramuscular autologous serum therapy in
   chronic urticaria: An observer-blind, randomized, controlled study}},
Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY VENEREOLOGY \& LEPROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Autologous serum therapy aims to supplement the existing
   pharmacotherapy in chronic urticaria by decreasing the antihistamine
   pill-burden and maintaining symptom-free interval. Subcutaneous
   autologous serum therapy further modifies the amount of serum (2 mL to 1
   mL) and gauge of a needle (24G to 31G) to improve compliance and
   facilitate ease of application. Objectives: To assess clinical
   effectiveness and safety of subcutaneous autologous serum therapy versus
   conventional intramuscular autologous serum therapy and to compare the
   quality of life in the two treatment arms.
   Methods: Institution-based, assessor-blind, prospective, randomized,
   parallel-group, active-controlled trial with 32 patients in each
   treatment arm and analyzed on a modified intention to treat principle.
   After baseline autologous serum skin test, autologous serum was injected
   as per randomization every week for 9 consecutive weeks.
   Results: Among the study population, conventional intramuscular
   autologous serum therapy and subcutaneous autologous serum therapy had a
   comparable duration of disease (P = 0.164, Mann-Whitney U test),
   autoreactive status (P = 0.796), urticaria total severity score (P =
   0.637) and urticaria activity score summed up over 7 days (P = 0.982).
   Both urticaria activity score summed up over 7 days and total severity
   score along with antihistamine pill-burden reduced significantly (P <
   0.001, Friedman's analysis of variance) in both subcutaneous autologous
   serum therapy and conventional intramuscular autologous serum therapy
   from first follow-up onwards (P < 0.05, Post hoc Dunn's test).
   Significant improvement was noted in patient's as well as physician's
   global assessment of disease activity improvement scale (P < 0.001,
   Friedman's analysis of variance). Intergroup analysis showed that there
   was no significant difference in urticaria activity score summed up over
   7 days either at baseline (P = 0.982, Mann-Whitney U test) or at study
   end (P = 0.398, Mann-Whitney U test). Similar comparable results were
   found in the total severity score at the end of the study (P = 0.345,
   Mann-Whitney U test). Dermatology life quality index showed marked
   improvement with both types of treatment (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon test),
   and the intergroup comparison showed comparable dermatology life quality
   index values (P = 0.994, Mann-Whitney U test).
   The pain score at the injection site was more with conventional
   intramuscular autologous serum therapy than subcutaneous autologous
   serum therapy (P = 0.0115, Mann-Whitney test). Younger age and lower
   baseline total severity scores were associated with a better therapeutic
   response. Baseline urticaria activity score added up over a period of 7
   days and total severity scores and the diameter of lesions showed a
   positive correlation with response pattern.
   Limitation: Basophil histamine release assay not done. Logistics could
   not support follow-up beyond the end of treatment.
   Conclusion: Subcutaneous autologous serum therapy is not inferior to
   conventional intramuscular autologous serum therapy with the additional
   advantage of less pain and operational feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, tackling Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES) has
   become a central dimension of early years, education, youth and family
   policy. In this Scottish Affairs special issue, we discuss why this
   public policy has galvanized so much attention in Scotland, and the
   possible consequence its popularity might have in theory, policy and
   practice. How, for example, has ACE research shaped how policy is
   responding to poverty and social inequality? What moral judgements are
   made by the ACE-agenda, and how might it obscure alternative ways of
   thinking about the problem of adversity, and cultivating lasting
   solutions. With contributions from academics and practitioners across
   different disciplines and practice settings, the collection points to an
   ongoing need for critical engagement in ACE-policy, and a greater
   commitment to understanding how ACE-policy is being translated into
   different practice settings. While theoretical debates are important,
   future research must prioritise the experiences of practitioners, and
   those with lived experience of adversity.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at investigating the potential role of 13-glucan in
   improving the immunity, anti-inflammatory and histopathology disorders
   induced by chlorpyrifos in Nile tilapia. Fish were allocated in four
   group where the control fed the basal diet without chlorpyrifos toxicity
   and chlorpyrifos group fed the basal diet and subjected to chlorpyrifos
   (15 mu g/L water). The third group fed dietary beta-glucan (1 g/kg diet)
   without chlorpyrifos toxicity and the fourth group fed dietary
   beta-glucan and exposed to chlorpyrifos (beta-glucan/chlorpyrifos).
   Results revealed that the exposure to chlorpyrifos tended to decrease
   final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR),
   and survival but increased the feed intake (FI) and feed conversion
   ratio (FCR). Administration of beta-glucan tended to increase FBW, WG,
   SGR, survival, and FI but did not change the FCR. Exposure to
   chlorpyrifos did not change the blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) but
   increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
   and cortisol levels whereas beta-glucan administration markedly
   decreased ALP, AST, ALT, and cortisol levels and
   beta-glucan/chlorpyrifos treatment declined the levels of these variable
   close to the baseline values. Compared to the control, chlorpyrifos
   administration tended to decrease the lysozyme and phagocytic index but
   no change was observed in phagocytic activity. beta-Glucan
   administration greatly increased the levels of lysozyme, phagocytic
   activity and phagocytic index, and beta-glucan tended to alleviate the
   negative effect of chlorpyrifos on the mentioned parameters. The
   chlorpyrifos exposure caused congestion and telangiectasia in gills,
   catarrhal enteritis followed by degeneration and sloughing of the apical
   part of the intestinal villi with diffused lymphocytic infiltration, and
   fatty degeneration and vacuolation of hepatocytes in addition to
   congestion of blood sinusoids in liver. However, the histopathological
   structure of these organs was normal with dietary beta-glucan. In
   conclusion, beta-glucan administration alleviated the adverse effects of
   chlorpyrifos on the immune and anti-inflammatory response as well as
   histopathology of gills, liver, and intestine of Nile tilapia.}},

Title = {{Stability and direction of Hopf bifurcations of a cyclical growth model
   with two-time delays and one-delay dependent coefficients}},
Journal = {{CHAOS SOLITONS \& FRACTALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the impact of two discrete-time delays on the
   basic Goodwin growth cycle model. The former concerns the existence of a
   finite time delay for building capital goods as suggested by Kalecki.
   The latter pertains to the wage lag hypothesis. This is because, taking
   the current change of the employment rate into account, workers and
   capitalists bargain new wage periodically. There are no examples in the
   literature on the Goodwin model of the use of both those lags in order
   to explore the GDP dynamics. From the analytical point-of-view, what we
   obtain is a delayed differential equation system with discrete-time
   delays and delay-dependent coefficients depending only on one of the
   time delays. Having chosen the time delays as bifurcation parameters, we
   study the stability-switching properties of the transcendental
   characteristic equation resulting from the stability analysis and the
   direction of the Hopf bifurcations. Although the system with no lag
   displays a stable focus, the introduction of the two lags preserves the
   stable solution only for particular combinations of parameters and
   length of the lags. In any other case, instability prevails and regular
   cycles or chaotic fluctuations emerge. Finally, we provide the
   analytical results with the necessary economic interpretations. (c) 2020

Pages = {{1896-1909}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Cultural competence is crucial for the successful provision of
   speech, language, and hearing services. The purpose of this study was to
   assess and describe gains in cultural awareness, cultural competence,
   and self-efficacy after service-learning study abroad experiences and to
   examine whether gains in these areas are related to higher clinical
   skills ratings in speech-language pathology and audiology students.
   Method: Sixteen speech-language pathology and audiology students
   participated in two international study abroad experiences (Nicaragua
   and Malawi). Students completed a survey on cultural awareness,
   competence, and selfefficacy beliefs and journal entries before, during,
   and after their trips. In addition, the supervisors assessed the
   clinical skills of the students by the end of the trip. The researchers
   applied a mixed-methods approach to analyze data from the survey,
   clinical ratings, and journals.
   Results: Students showed significant increases in cultural awareness,
   competence, and self-efficacy. Gains in self-efficacy and cultural
   awareness were highly correlated with students' clinical ratings in
   cultural competence as judged by their supervisors. Two main themes were
   identified from the journal entries: continuing community involvement
   and growth in cultural self-efficacy.
   Conclusion: Service-learning study abroad experiences help students
   develop cultural awareness and competence skills and increase their
   self-efficacy beliefs. Using a mixed-methods approach can help identify
   strengths and weaknesses in the training of speech-language pathology
   and audiology students with regard to cultural competence.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: Pediatric surgical specialists are often confronted
   with the difficult task of identifying, diagnosing and managing
   intra-abdominal gonads in children. Ranging from the intra-abdominal

   manage these patients. In addition, the ideal surgical management for
   each one of these patients is often debated.
   Methods: Descriptive literature review.
   Results/Conclusion: Herein, we reviewed gonadal formation, common

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: the COVID-19 pandemic, by restricting population mobility,
   may exacerbate the risk factors for weight gain associated with physical
   inactivity and increased consumption of calorie-dense foods. The aim of
   this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the risk factors related to
   self-reported body weight gain among obese subjects.
   Methods: the study involved a population of 284 adult obese subjects.
   After a 7-week confinement period starting on March 17, a telephone
   interview (May 4 through 7) was conducted. In this phone call,
   self-reported body weight gain and a number of factors were recorded. In
   order to obtain the baseline data of this population, biochemical and
   anthropometric parameters were collected from electronic medical
   records.
   Results: mean age was 60.4 +/- 10.8 years (range: 23-71) and mean body
   mass index (BMI) was 35.4 +/- 4.7 kg/m2 (range: 30.6-41.2). Gender
   distribution was 211 females (74.3 \%) and 73 males (25.7 \%).
   Self-reported body weight gain was 1.62 +/- 0.2 kg. Among patients who
   reported doing a lot of exercise self-reported body weight gain was
   lower (1.62 +/- 0.2 vs 1.12 +/- 0.3 kg; p = 0.02). Regarding eating
   habits, patients recognized snacking in 17 \% of the sample. Patients
   who reported snacking had higher self-reported body weight gains (2.60
   +/- 0.36 vs 1.30 +/- 0.17 kg; p = 0.001). The remaining variables did
   not influence self-reported body weight gain. In the multiple regression
   analysis with self-reported body weight gain as dependent variable,
   adjusted for age, sex, and physical activity, the snaking habit remained
   a risk factor: beta = 1.21 (95 \% CI: 1.11-2.13; p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: the lockdown decreed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has
   produced an increase in self-reported body weight among obese subjects,
   which was related to the habit of taking snacks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) polymorphisms in weight
   loss and serum lipid changes following different dietary interventions

   Objective: Our aim was to analyze the effects of a hypocaloric diet with
   a Mediterranean dietary pattern on the metabolic response and adiposity
   parameters, taking into account the 712 G/A rs3774261 polymorphisms in
   ADIPOQ. Design: A population of 135 obese patients was enrolled.
   Anthropometric and serum parameters (lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis
   model assessment for insulin resistance {[}HOMA-IR], glucose, C-reactive

   vs. AG+GG), total cholesterol (Delta = -15.7 +/- 3.9 vs. -4.9 +/- 2.9
   mg/dL; p = 0.02), LDL cholesterol (Delta = -15.3 +/- 3.8 vs. -1.7 +/-
   1.9 mg/dL; p = 0.01), triglyceride levels (Delta = -23.4 +/- 5.6 vs. 2.3
   +/- 2.3 mg/dL; p = 0.01), and CRP (Delta = -1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. -0.4 +/- 0.2
   mg/dL; p = 0.01) decreased. Adiponectin levels (Delta = 7.2 +/- 2.1 vs.
   -0.4 +/- 0.3 ng/dL; p = 0.02) increased. Notably, G-allele carriers did
   not show this improvement. Conclusion: Non-G-allele carriers of the
   ADIPOQ variant (rs3774261) showed significant improvement in serum
   levels of adiponectin, lipid profiles, and CRP in response to a
   hypocaloric diet with a Mediterranean dietary pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard
   surgical attitude in primary hyperparathyroidism. It requires precise
   preoperative lesion localization. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the performance of ultrasonography and 99mTc-sestamibi
   scintigraphy in minimally invasive surgery for primary
   hyperparathyroidism.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective study included all patients
   managed surgically for primary hyperparathyroidism between January 2008
   and November 2017 in the University Hospital of Brest (France). Two
   hundred and seventy-three patients underwent ultrasonography and
   99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. Results determined intrinsic (sensitivity
   and specificity) and extrinsic (positive and negative predictive values)
   performance on per-patient and per-gland analysis. Demographic,
   preoperative, interventional and cure data were compared according to
   ultrasonography and scintigraphy results, distinguishing 3 patient
   groups: concordant n =156, discordant n =99, negative n =18.
   Results: On per-gland analysis, sensitivity was 70\% for ultrasound,
   74\% for 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy and 81\% for associated
   ultrasound-scintigraphy; positive predictive values were 89\%, 91\% and
   96\%, respectively. Gland volume and concomitant thyroid pathology rates
   differed significantly ( both p = 0.003) between the 3 imaging results
   groups.
   Conclusion: The performance of associated
   ultrasound-99mTc-sestamibi-scintigraphy provided a positive predictive
   value of 96\%. Combining the two techniques reduced surgical morbidity.

Abstract = {{Microbiota is a term coined to describe the population of bacteria,
   viruses and fungi that inhabit in symbiosis within a living host. A
   connection between unbalanced microbiota and chronic kidney disease has

   to generate uremic toxins. Due to the high morbidity and mortality of
   this condition, a large number of therapeutic approaches to reduce
   inflammation and microbial uremic toxins have been proposed, with
   controversial results. A low protein diet, with a protein intake of
   0.6-0.8 g/kg of body weight, is a useful and historically pursued option
   with this regard. The aim of our study is to evaluate, among patients

Title = {{Mosquito genomes are frequently invaded by transposable elements through
   horizontal transfer}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   A large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes is derived from DNA
   fragments that can multiply by inserting themselves in other regions of
   the genome, generating genomic instability and variability. These
   fragments are called Transposable Elements (TEs). Since they are a
   constituent part of the eukaryote genomes, these DNA pieces are normally
   inherited vertically along with other genes to the host offspring. Host
   genomes have an arsenal of molecular mechanisms that were naturally
   selected to control TEs replication avoiding most deleterious damage to
   the genome and hence leading to long-term TEs inactivation and
   degeneration. However, TEs sometimes get out of control and invade other
   species through horizontal transfer, the transfer of genetic information
   through other means than sexual intercourse. This phenomenon is poorly
   studied in mosquitoes, a highly important Insect taxa that transmit many
   human pathogens. We characterized the whole TE content of 24 mosquito
   genomes and investigated the TE inheritance mode uncovering hundreds of
   horizontal transfer events among these species and distantly related
   ones. We also identify a mosquito parasitic filarial worm, that is
   involved as a transfer vector between many species of mosquitoes and
   that horizontally transferred TEs contributed significantly to
   mosquito's genome expansion and variation.
   Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that parasitize
   basically all eukaryotic species genomes. Due to their complexity, an
   in-depth TE characterization is only available for a handful of model
   organisms. In the present study, we performed a de novo and
   homology-based characterization of TEs in the genomes of 24 mosquito
   species and investigated their mode of inheritance. More than 40\% of
   the genome of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex
   quinquefasciatus is composed of TEs, varying substantially among
   Anopheles species (0.13\%-19.55\%). Class I TEs are the most abundant
   among mosquitoes and at least 24 TE superfamilies were found.
   Interestingly, TEs have been extensively exchanged by horizontal
   transfer (172 TE families of 16 different superfamilies) among
   mosquitoes in the last 30 million years. Horizontally transferred TEs
   represents around 7\% of the genome in Aedes species and a small
   fraction in Anopheles genomes. Most of these horizontally transferred
   TEs are from the three ubiquitous LTR superfamilies: Gypsy, Bel-Pao and
   Copia. Searching more than 32,000 genomes, we also uncovered transfers
   between mosquitoes and two different Phyla-Cnidaria and Nematoda-and two
   subphyla-Chelicerata and Crustacea, identifying a vector, the worm
   Wuchereria bancrofti, that enabled the horizontal spread of a
   Tc1-mariner element among various Anopheles species. These data also
   allowed us to reconstruct the horizontal transfer network of this TE
   involving more than 40 species. In summary, our results suggest that TEs
   are frequently exchanged by horizontal transfers among mosquitoes,
   influencing mosquito's genome size and variability.}},

Abstract = {{Technology innovation, market demand, and the potential impacts of a
   changing climate are driving the marine renewable energy (MRE) industry
   to develop market-ready systems to provide low-carbon electricity for
   emerging, off-grid markets. The advanced operational and information
   technology devices used in MRE systems create a pathway for a cyber
   threat actor to gain unauthorized access to data or disrupt operation.
   To improve the resiliency of MRE systems as a predictable, affordable,
   and reliable source of energy from oceans and rivers, guidance was
   developed for an end users' organization that describes a framework for
   identifying and managing cybersecurity risk. The development of the
   cybersecurity guidance is based on standards described in the Risk
   Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework developed by the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This paper is the
   first of a two-part series that describes an approach to determine the
   cybersecurity risk for MRE systems based on assessing potential cyber
   threats, identifying vulnerabilities (people, processes, and technology,
   including physical and operational environment), and evaluating the
   consequences a cyberattack would have on operation of the MRE system and
   impact on end users' mission and business objectives. MRE developers and
   stakeholders can use this approach to assess their current cybersecurity
   risk posture to incorporate appropriate cybersecurity controls to reduce
   the consequences and impacts from a cyberattack on MRE systems. This
   approach can be refined further as MRE systems are deployed and
   operational configurations are available.}},

Title = {{Growth curve, carcass traits and Kleiber ratio of Dorper crossbreed with
   hairless native Brazilian sheep breeds}},
Journal = {{SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In Brazil, much of the sheep farming is practiced with native breeds or
   crossbred with specialized breeds. The market is growing and to serve
   consumers it is necessary to regularly provide quality meat. Rearing
   these animals with lower production costs can be achieved using feed
   efficiency and growth information, useful to define the most appropriate
   crossbreed for both farm structures and breeder's objectives. Thus, the
   objective of the present work was to evaluate the growth, carcass traits
   and Kleiber ratio (KR) of, respectively, 44 and 39 animals slaughtered
   at 120 (120D) and 240 days (240D) of the following crosses: Dorper x
   Morada Nova females and males (F\_DMN, M\_DMN), Dorper x Santa Ines
   females and males (F\_DSI, M\_DSI), and Dorper x Rabo Largo females and
   males (F\_DRL, M\_DRL). The traits evaluated were: the weight of the
   rib, loin, left half carcass, shoulder, leg, Longissimus Dorsi muscle
   area (LDM), growth curve and KR. Univariate and multivariate analyses
   were used, and it was observed, at 120D, that DSI and M\_DRL had higher
   cut weights. There was the superiority of the M\_DSI in relation to the
   others for the cuts rib, loin (excerpt with DRL that was similar), half
   carcass and shoulder at 240D. At 240D all crossbreeds have a value
   greater than 100 \% of the percentage of their asymptotic weight, except
   the M\_DSI. At 240D the animals tended to lower values of KR compared to
   120D. Differences were observed between the crosses considering the
   variables simultaneously. In the grouping at 120D, an approximation
   between DSI and M\_DRL was observed. The DMN at 240D, have lower values
   for carcass traits and growth and superiority for KR and degree of
   maturity. The M\_DRL with F\_DRL and F\_DSI were characterized as
   intermediate for growth, carcass, and KR. In PCA1 at 120D, most of the
   explanation for differentiating crosses are concentrated in meat cuts.
   At 240D again, the carcasses contributed to differentiate the crosses,
   however sharing with the parameters of growth. It is concluded that
   animals should be slaughtered before 240D. If it is used to slaughter
   120D, the cattle rancher can choose, when economically feasible, to
   slaughter animals regardless of sex and crossing, however, the farmers
   must be attentive only to prioritize the DSI and M\_DRL as an
   alternative to serving the consumer market that prefers heavier cuts.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study compares outcomes for patients with displaced
   femoral neck fractures undergoing hemiarthroplasty (HA) or total hip
   arthroplasty (THA) by surgeons of different fellowship training. Design:
   Retrospective review of HEALTH trial data. Setting: Eighty clinical
   sites across 10 countries. Patients/Participants: One thousand four
   hundred forty-one patients >= 50 years with low-energy hip fractures
   requiring surgical intervention. Intervention: Patients were randomized
   to either HA or THA groups in the initial data set. Surgeons' fellowship
   training was ascertained retrospectively, and outcomes were compared.
   Main Outcome Measurements: The main outcome was an unplanned secondary
   procedure at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included death, serious
   adverse events, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), dislocation, discharge
   disposition, and use of ambulatory devices postoperatively. Results:
   There was a significantly higher risk of PJI in patients treated by
   surgeons without fellowship training in arthroplasty (P = 0.01),
   surgeons with unknown fellowship training (P = 0.03), and surgeons with
   no fellowship training (P = 0.02) than those treated by an
   arthroplasty-trained surgeon. There were significantly higher odds of
   being discharged to a facility rather than home in patients who
   underwent surgery by a surgeon with no fellowship training compared with
   arthroplasty-fellowship-trained surgeons (P = 0.03). Conclusions:
   Arthroplasty for hip fracture can be performed by all orthopaedic
   surgeons with equivalent reoperation rates. Infection prevention
   strategies and use of ``care pathways{''} by
   arthroplasty-fellowship-trained surgeons may account for the lower risk
   of PJI and higher rate of discharge to home. The authors advocate for
   the use of evidence-based infection prevention initiatives and
   standardized care pathways in this patient population.}},

   from a health care provider. Data were collected between 2013 and 2017
   in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Samples were compared using
   independent-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests. Smokers with SMI had
   higher CO, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamine exposure levels,
   greater cigarette dependence, higher craving, and higher scores on eight
   out of eleven smoking motives (p's < 0.05). Smokers with SMI reported
   more severe respiratory symptoms but lower perceived health risks of
   tobacco (p's < 0.05). These smokers were more likely to report having
   received advice to quit from a medical provider in the past 6 weeks (p <
   0.05). Affect, stress, and exposure to smoke/smokers did not differ
   across samples. Our findings advance the understanding of the elevated
   smoking rates of people with SMI by comparing smokers with and without
   SMI on validated biopsychosocial measures. There is a need for
   interventions that reduce craving, reduce smoking motives, and increase
   risk awareness among smokers with SMI.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid-peptide hydrogel arrangements are a promising alternative to
   obtaining biocompatible structures at the nanoscopic scale. In this
   work, a new class of hybrid hydrogels was obtained through the sol-gel
   process based on the reaction between an amyloid-like octapeptide
   sequence {[}RF](4) (where R = arginine and F = phenylalanine) covalently
   bonded with glycine-linked alkoxysilanes, and hybrid silylated
   polyethylene glycol (PEG). H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were used, resulting in synthesized
   precursor/intermediate molecules. The structure of hybrid hydrogel
   fibers was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS), where the existence of two regions in the
   Guinier plot was observed, one being predominantly formed by polymer
   while the other one by peptide chains. The rheological measurements
   showed that viscoelastic parameters depend on both the amount of silane
   peptide in the hydrogel matrix and increased temperature. Also, the FTIR
   spectra indicated the coexistence of antiparallel and parallel
   beta-sheet structure patterns into amyloid fibril hydrogels, which can
   be modulated by peptide-silane coupling in each formulation. The
   analyzed hydrogels showed thixotropic and shear-thinning rheology at
   physiological pH, leaving open the opportunity to topical drug delivery
   system applications in the future.}},

Title = {{An Economic Evaluation of Over 200,000 Revision Total Hip
   Arthroplasties: Is the Current Model Sustainable?}},
Journal = {{SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL-INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SURGERY
   AND SURGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs) are typically
   more complicated than primaries and may have a greater economic burden.
   To date, the current economic model supporting these procedures has not
   been evaluated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine
   the 10-year temporal changes in charges, reimbursement rates, and net
   losses in patients undergoing an rTHA utilizing a large, nationwide
   database.
   Materials and Methods: A query was performed from 2005 to 2014 to
   identify patients who underwent rTHA. Analyzed outcomes included trends
   in costs of care, reimbursement rates, and net losses per annum within
   the last 10 years. Charges are defined as those by the provider to the
   insurance company, whereas, reimbursements were those payments received
   from the insurance company. Net losses were calculated as the difference
   in charges from reimbursement rates.
   Results: Total charges increased from \$1,119,725,881 in 2005 to
   \$2,066,842,547 in 2014. Total reimbursements increased from
   \$287,461,852 in 2005 to \$478,430,569 in 2014. Per patient charges
   increased 67.4\% from 2005 to 2014 and from \$51,963.18 in 2005 to
   \$86,791.07 in 2014. There was an increase in reimbursement per patient
   of 61.4\% from \$12,450.70 in 2005 to \$20,090.31 in 2014. Net losses
   increased 68.80\%, from \$39,512.48 to \$66,700.76 from 2005 to 2014.
   Conclusion: This study indicates substantial increases in charges and
   reimbursements over a 10-year period for patients undergoing rTHA.
   However, reimbursement increased at a lower rate than that of charges,
   resulting in major net losses. This study highlights the need to
   reevaluate the economic models behind rTHA for longerterm sustainment.}},

Title = {{Variational Multiscale Nonparametric Regression: Algorithms and
   Implementation}},
Journal = {{ALGORITHMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many modern statistically efficient methods come with tremendous
   computational challenges, often leading to large-scale optimisation
   problems. In this work, we examine such computational issues for
   recently developed estimation methods in nonparametric regression with a
   specific view on image denoising. We consider in particular certain
   variational multiscale estimators which are statistically optimal in
   minimax sense, yet computationally intensive. Such an estimator is
   computed as the minimiser of a smoothness functional (e.g., TV norm)
   over the class of all estimators such that none of its coefficients with
   respect to a given multiscale dictionary is statistically significant.
   The so obtained multiscale Nemirowski-Dantzig estimator (MIND) can
   incorporate any convex smoothness functional and combine it with a
   proper dictionary including wavelets, curvelets and shearlets. The
   computation of MIND in general requires to solve a high-dimensional
   constrained convex optimisation problem with a specific structure of the
   constraints induced by the statistical multiscale testing criterion. To
   solve this explicitly, we discuss three different algorithmic
   approaches: the Chambolle-Pock, ADMM and semismooth Newton algorithms.
   Algorithmic details and an explicit implementation is presented and the
   solutions are then compared numerically in a simulation study and on
   various test images. We thereby recommend the Chambolle-Pock algorithm
   in most cases for its fast convergence. We stress that our analysis can
   also be transferred to signal recovery and other denoising problems to
   recover more general objects whenever it is possible to borrow
   statistical strength from data patches of similar object structure.}},

Title = {{Geochemical and Isotopic Signature of Pyrite as a Proxy for Fluid Source
   and Evolution in the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre Iron Oxide Copper-Gold
   District, Chile}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Pyrite is ubiquitous in the world-class iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG)
   deposits of the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district, documented from
   early to late stages of mineralization and observed in deep and shallow
   levels of mineralized bodies. Despite its abundance, the chemical and
   isotopic signature of pyrite from the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre
   district, and most IOCG deposits worldwide, remains poorly understood.
   We evaluated in situ chemical and isotopic variations at the grain scale
   in a set of pyrite-bearing samples collected throughout the district in
   order to characterize and further understand the nature of
   mineralization in this IOCG system. Our multianalytical approach
   integrated synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) mapping of
   pyrite grains with electron probe microanalysis and laser
   ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry data, and sulfur
   isotope determinations using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
   complemented with bulk sulfur isotope analyses of coeval pyrite,
   chalcopyrite, and anhydrite. Synchrotron mu-XRF elemental concentration
   maps of individual pyrite grains reveal a strong zonation of Co, Ni, As,
   and Se. The observed relationships between Ni and Se are interpreted to
   reflect changes in temperature and redox conditions during ore formation
   and provide constraints on fluid evolution. Co and Ni concentrations and
   ratios suggest contributions from magmas of mafic-intermediate
   composition. Pyrite chemical concentrations reflect potential
   stratigraphic controls, where the sample from the upper part of the
   stratigraphy diverges from trends formed by the rest of the sample set
   from lower stratigraphic levels. The SIMS delta S-34 values of pyrite
   (and chalcopyrite) range between -2 up to 10 parts per thousand, and
   bulk delta S-34 values of pyrite range between 4 up to 12 parts per
   thousand. The majority of the delta S-34 analyses, falling between -1
   and 2 parts per thousand, indicate a magmatic source for sulfur and, by
   inference, for the hydrothermal ore fluid(s). Variation in the delta
   S-34 signature can be explained by changes in the redox conditions,
   fluid sources, and/ or the temperature of the hydrothermal fluid. The
   Se/S ratio combined with delta S-34 values in pyrite is consistent with
   mixing between a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid and a fluid with a probable
   basinal signature. The results of this study are consistent with the
   hydrothermal fluids responsible for mineralization in the
   Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district being predominantly of magmatic
   origin, plausibly from mafic-intermediate magmas based on the Ni-Co
   content in pyrite. External fluid incursion, potentially from a basinal
   sedimentary source, occurred late in the evolution of the system, adding
   additional reduced sulfur as pyrite. There is no evidence to suggest
   that the late fluid added significant Cu-Au mineralization, but this
   cannot be ruled out. Finally, the data reveal that trace element ratios
   coupled with spatially resolved sulfur isotope data in pyrite are
   powerful proxies to track the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution of IOCG
   systems and help constrain the source of their contained metals.}},

Title = {{JCPyV T-Antigen Activation of the Anti-Apoptotic Survivin Promoter-Its
   Role in the Development of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy}},
Journal = {{VIRUSES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal
   demyelinating disease of the CNS, resulting from the lytic infection of
   oligodendrocytes by the human neurotropic polyomavirus JC (JCPyV),
   typically associated with severe immunocompromised states and, in recent
   years, with the use of immunotherapies. Apoptosis is a homeostatic
   mechanism to dispose of senescent or damaged cells, including virally
   infected cells, triggered in the vast majority of viral infections of
   the brain. Previously, we showed upregulation of the normally dormant
   anti-apoptotic protein Survivin in cases of PML, which-in vitro-resulted
   in protection from apoptosis in JCPyV-infected primary cultures of
   astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In the present study, we first
   demonstrate the absence of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and the lack of
   caspase activity in 16 cases of PML. We also identified the viral
   protein large T-Antigen as being responsible for the activation of the
   Survivin promoter. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay shows a direct
   binding between T-Antigen and the Survivin promoter DNA. Finally, we
   have identified the specific region of T-Antigen, spanning from amino
   acids 266 and 688, which binds to Survivin and translocates it to the
   nucleus, providing evidence of a mechanism that results in the efficient
   replication of JCPyV and a potential target for novel therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The Stopped-Flow apparatus (SF) tracks molecular events by mixing the
   reactants in sub-millisecond regimes. The reaction of intrinsically or
   extrinsically labeled biomolecules can be monitored by recording the
   fluorescence, F(t), anisotropy, r(t), polarization, p(t), or FRET,
   F(t)(FRET), traces at nanomolar concentrations. These kinetic
   measurements are critical to elucidate reaction mechanisms, structural
   information, and even thermodynamics. In a single detector SF, or
   L-configuration, the r(t), p(t), and F(t) traces are acquired by
   switching the orientation of the emission polarizer to collect the I-VV
   and I-VH signals however it requires two-shot experiments. In a
   two-detector SF, or T-configuration, these traces are collected in a
   single-shot experiment, but it increases the apparatus' complexity and
   price. Herein, we present a single-detector dual-channel SF to obtain
   the F(t) and r(t) traces simultaneously, in which a photo-elastic
   modulator oscillates by 90 degrees the excitation light plane at a 50
   kHz frequency, and the emission signal is processed by a set of
   electronic filters that split it into the r(t) and F(t) analog signals
   that are digitized and stored into separated spreadsheets by a
   custom-tailored instrument control software. We evaluated the
   association kinetics of binary and ternary biological complexes acquired
   with our dual-channel SF and the traditional methods; such as a single
   polarizer at the magic angle to acquire F(t), a set of polarizers to
   track F(t), and r(t), and by energy transfer quenching, F(t)(FRET). Our
   dual-channel SF economized labeled material and yielded rate constants
   in excellent agreement with the traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Graphical data is comprised of a graph with marks on its edges and
   vertices. The mark indicates the value of some attribute associated to
   the respective edge or vertex. Examples of such data arise in social
   networks, molecular and systems biology, and web graphs, as well as in
   several other application areas. Our goal is to design schemes that can
   efficiently compress such graphical data without making assumptions
   about its stochastic properties. Namely, we wish to develop a universal
   compression algorithm for graphical data sources. To formalize this
   goal, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, also called the
   objective method, which provides a technique to think of a marked graph
   as a kind of stationary stochastic processes, stationary with respect to
   movement between vertices of the graph. In recent work, we have
   generalized a notion of entropy for unmarked graphs in this framework,
   due to Bordenave and Caputo, to the case of marked graphs. We use this
   notion to evaluate the efficiency of a compression scheme. The lossless
   compression scheme we propose in this paper is then proved to be
   universally optimal in a precise technical sense. It is also capable of
   performing local data queries in the compressed form.}},

   on top-k n-gram match-up}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS \& MODELLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{100}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{DNA sequence similarity analysis is an essential task in computational
   biology and bioinformatics. In nearly all research that explores
   evolutionary relationships, gene function analysis, protein structure
   prediction and sequence retrieving, it is necessary to perform
   similarity calculations. As an alternative to alignment-based sequence
   comparison methods, which result in high computational cost,
   alignment-free methods have emerged that calculate similarity by
   digitizing the sequence in a different space. In this paper, we proposed
   an alignment-free DNA sequence similarity analysis method based on top-k
   n-gram matches, with the prediction that common repeating DNA
   subsections indicate high similarity between DNA sequences. In our
   method, we determined DNA sequence similarities by measuring similarity
   among feature vectors created according to top-k n-gram match-up scores
   without the use of similarity functions. We applied the similarity
   calculation for three different DNA data sets of different lengths. The
   phylogenetic relationships revealed by our method show that our trees
   coincide almost completely with the results of the MEGA software, which
   is based on sequence alignment. Our findings show that a certain number
   of frequently recurring common sequence patterns have the power to
   characterize DNA sequences. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: During the lockdown period, the fear about the risk of
   infection in hospital has reduced the admission to Emergency Services
   (ES) with possible negative health effects. We have investigated the
   changes in the emergency flow occurred during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an
   obstetrics and gynecological ES and the short-term adverse outcomes on
   women's and reproductive health.
   Study design: The study was conducted in the OBGYN ES of the Clinica
   Mangiagalli, the largest maternity clinic of Milan, Lombardy, Northern
   Italy. We analyzed retrospectively the records of all women
   consecutively admitted at the ES from February 23rd to June 24th 2019,
   and compared them with the admissions during the lockdown executive
   order from February 23rd to June 23rd, 2020. Patients were assessed in
   terms of demographic features, presentation times, triage classification
   (urgent/not urgent), reason for admission and outcome of the visit
   (discharge/admission to the ward). A total of 9291 data were retrieved
   from ES files and automation system, 5644 from 2019 and 3647 from 2020.
   Categorical variables were compared by the chi-square test calculating
   the p value and computed were percentage changes (with 95 \% Confidence
   interval, CI).
   Results: During the period February 24th - May 31th 2020 the admissions
   at the ES decreased by 35.4 \% (95 \% CI-34.1-36.6) compared with the
   corresponding period in 2019. The reduction was more marked for
   gynecological complaints (-63.5 \%, 95 \%CI -60.5 to -66.5): in
   particular we observed a reduction of admissions for genital
   infection/cystitis of 75.7 \% (95 \%Cl -71.4 to -80.1). The admission
   for complaints associated with pregnancy decreased by 28.5 \% (95 \%Cl
   -27.2 to-29.9). In the index period, five fetal deaths were diagnosed
   compared with one observed in the reference period in 2019 (chi square
   computed using as denominator all observed pregnancies = 4.29, p =
   0.04). The frequency of admission for elective caesarean section/labor
   induction increased from 47.5 \% in 2019 to 53.6 \% in 2020: this
   difference was statistically significant.
   Conclusion: The lockdown negatively influenced ES admissions and
   consequently the women's/ reproductive health. As possible short-term
   consequences, we observed an increase of intrauterine deaths and a
   decrease of natural births. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores Wyndham Lewis's experience of the First World War,
   and its influence on his varied artistic output. It interrogates how
   Lewis's initial ambivalence towards an emergent technological society
   shifted through direct encounters with mechanized warfare, and
   speculates on the effect of these upon his post-war writing and
   criticism. By contrasting Lewis's thought against that of his Italian
   Futurist contemporaries, I will demonstrate the centrality of their
   divergent conceptions of masculinity in accounting for this
   opposition-and how Lewis's critique of technological society prefigures
   contemporary opposition towards the post-humanist philosophy of
   Accelerationism.}},

Abstract = {{The study has been aimed at development of a new method of constructing
   a geotechnical barrier (enclosing structures) when excavating pits,
   being more rigid compared with a sheet pile and a wall made of
   bore-secant piles and having less labor content and less cost than a
   diaphragm wall. The method is mainly aimed at ensuring the stability of
   the walls of the pit and protecting the adjacent territory from surface
   settlement during its excavation. It is proposed to use two rows of
   piling walls connected by means of specialized expanding anchors. The
   resulted geotechnical barrier is a 3D shoring characterized by
   significant stiffness due to soil between the walls. The main advantages
   of the proposed method are its low complexity and fast speed of building
   compared with the diaphragm wall, the ability to retrieve the barrier
   after completion of work, as well as greater rigidity of the shoring
   structure compared with the sheet piling. Numerical simulation of the
   proposed method has been carried out in order to obtain geomechanical
   assessment of its efficiency. The calculations have been performed in
   the Plaxis software package. Initial data required for simulation have
   been described in details. Various options for the implementation of the
   geotechnical barrier with the change in the distance between the walls
   and different angles of inclination of the external wall have been
   considered. Their comparison allowed choosing the most rational option
   for specific conditions. The results of numerical modeling show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method for constructing a geotechnical
   barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the seismic resistance of reinforced concrete buildings
   after fire is difficult because of the lack of information regarding
   their strength and ductility under earthquake loads. In this study, four
   full-scale flexure-controlled reinforced precast concrete columns were
   subjected to quasi-static reversed cyclic lateral loading under constant
   axial load to examine the seismic response of reinforced precast.
   concrete columns damaged by 30, 60, and 90 minutes of fire. For the
   first time, the impact of fire damage on force-displacement behavior,
   moment-curvature relationship, stiffness, energy dissipation capacity,
   and residual displacements was investigated through posttire seismic
   tests. Test results clearly indicated that the fire exposure did not.
   significantly affect the lateral-load-bearing capacity, failure modes,
   and ductility of the columns, with the exception of the specimen
   subjected to 90 minutes of tire exposure. The analytical study
   consisting of thermal and fiber-based structural analysis demonstrated
   that conventional principles of structural mechanics are valid for
   estimation of the postfire seismic behavior of reinforced precast
   concrete columns when the deteriorations in materials are realistically

Abstract = {{The effects of whole grain highland barley (WGH) with rich phenolics on
   glucose metabolism, the insulin pathway, and microRNA (miRNA) expression
   in db/db mice were explored in the present study. Supplementation with
   WGH decreased the levels of blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein
   (GSP), insulin, and inflammatory cytokines in db/db mice. Furthermore,
   WGH administration triggered a remarkable amelioration of glucose
   intolerance and insulin resistance. The hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase
   (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) activities and the
   G6PC, PEPCK, and forkhead transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) mRNA levels in
   the WGH-treated group were also reduced. Moreover, WGH promoted the
   glycogen storage in the liver via up-regulating the activities of
   hexokinase (HK) and glycogen synthase (GS) and the phosphorylation of
   glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) protein, while
   down-regulating the GSK3 beta mRNA level. The protein expression of
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the phosphorylation of protein
   kinase B (Akt), and the mRNA levels of insulin receptor substrate-1
   (IRS-1), PI3K and Akt were also up-regulated by WGH treatment. Moreover,
   WGH significantly augmented the expression of miRNA-26a and miRNA-451,
   but reduced those of miRNA-126a and miRNA-29a. These results
   demonstrated that WGH exhibits a hypoglycemic effect through regulating
   the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway and related miRNAs, further modulating the
   expression of G6PC, PEPCK, and FOXO1 mRNAs and p-GSK3 beta protein, thus
   inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, improving glycogen synthesis and
   alleviating insulin resistance. Therefore, this study suggested WGH as
   an effective candidate to ameliorate the hyperglycemia of type 2
   diabetes mellitus.}},

Abstract = {{The small heat shock protein (sHsp) and Hsp40 are Hsp members that have
   not been intensively investigated but are functionally important in most
   organisms. In this study, the potential roles of a Hsp20 (StHsp20) and a
   Hsp40 (StHsp40) in dinoflagellates during adaptation to temperature
   fluctuation and alteration of different life stages were explored using
   the representative harmful algal blooms (HABs)-causative dinoflagellate
   species, Scrippsiella trochoidea. We isolated the full-length cDNAs of
   the two genes via rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and tracked
   their differential transcriptions via real-time qPCR. The results
   revealed StHsp20 and StHsp40 exhibited mRNA accumulation patterns that
   were highly similar in response to heat stress but completely different
   toward cold stress, which implies that the mechanisms underlying thermal
   and cold acclimation in dinoflagellates are regulated by different sets
   of genes. The StHsp20 was probably related to the heat tolerance of the
   species, and StHsp40 was closely involved in the adaptation to both
   higher and lower temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, significantly
   higher mRNA abundance of StHsp40 was detected in newly formed resting
   cysts, which might be a response to intrinsic stress stemmed from
   encystment. This finding also implied StHsp40 might be engaged in
   resting cyst formation of S. trochoidea. Our findings enriched the
   knowledge about possible cross-talk of different Hsp members in
   dinoflagellates and provided clues to further explore the molecular
   underpinnings underlying resting cyst production and broad temperature
   tolerance of this group of HABs contributors.}},

Abstract = {{Localization estimation and clock synchronization are important research
   directions in the application of wireless sensor networks. Aiming at the
   problems of low positioning accuracy and slow convergence speed in
   localization estimation methods based on message passing, this paper
   proposes a low-complexity distributed cooperative joint estimation
   method suitable for dynamic networks called multi-Gaussian variational
   message passing (M-VMP). The proposed method constrains the message to
   be a multi-Gaussian function superposition form to reduce the
   information loss in the variational message passing algorithm (VMP).
   Only the mean, covariance and weight of each message need to be
   transmitted in the network, which reduces the computational complexity
   while ensuring the information completeness. The simulation results show
   that the proposed method is superior to the VMP algorithm in terms of
   position accuracy and convergence speed and is close to the sum-product
   algorithm over a wireless network (SPAWN) based on non-parametric belief
   propagation, but the computational complexity and communication load are
   significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Projecting sound into navigational locks has been suggested as a
   promising way to block the upstream movement of invasive species of carp
   (family Cyprinidae). This possibility is promising because carp have a
   good sense of hearing compared to non-ostariophysian fishes. Although
   the broadband sound of an outboard motor has been shown to repel several
   species of carp in laboratory arenas, its efficacy in a navigational
   lock is unknown. This study tested whether wild-caught Common Carp
   Cyprinus carpio are repelled by this sound in a lock chamber in a
   similar manner to that observed in laboratory studies. We found that
   while the sound of a 40-hp outboard motor repelled Common Carp in a lock
   the first time it was tested, the fish stopped responding after that,
   suggesting that they had habituated. This result differed from that of a
   laboratory study that used the same sound at the same volume and found
   responses to persist for three exposures before dissipating. Many
   factors, including the use of wild Common Carp already familiar with
   outboard motor sounds and differences in background noise, may have been
   responsible for differences between laboratory and field results. There
   is a need for more field tests using other sounds and carp species.}},

Abstract = {{7q11.23 Microduplication (dup7q11.23) syndrome is a rare autosomal
   dominant disorder due to a recurring 1.5 to 1.8 Mb duplication of the
   Williams-Beuren Syndrome critical region. Dup7q11.23 has been associated
   with several neuro-behavioral characteristics such as low cognitive and
   adaptive functioning, expressive language impairment, anxiety problems
   and autistic features. In the present study, we analyze the clinical
   features of ten individuals in which array-CGH detected dup7q11.23,
   spanning from 1.4 to 2.1 Mb. The clinical characteristics associated
   with dup7q11.23 are discussed with respect to its reciprocal deletion.
   Consistent with previous studies, we confirm that individuals with
   dup7q11.23 syndrome do not have a homogeneous clinical profile, although
   some recurring dysmorphic features were found, including macrocephaly,
   prominent forehead, elongated palpebral fissures, thin lip vermilion and
   microstomia. Minor congenital malformations include patent ductus
   arteriosus, cryptorchidism and pes planus. A common finding is hypotonia
   and joint laxity, resulting in mild motor delay. Neuropsychological and
   psychodiagnostic assessment confirm that mild cognitive impairment,
   expressive language deficits and anxiety are recurring neurobehavioral
   features. New insights into adaptive, psychopathological and
   neurodevelopmental profiles are discussed.}},

Title = {{Metabolic contribution to salinity stress response in grains of two
   barley cultivars with contrasting salt tolerance}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Soil salinity is a major abiotic stressor and a serious threat to global
   food security. Biochemical compounds synthesised by plants ameliorate
   the effects of such stressors in characteristic ways. It is crucial to
   unravel the key components of the salt tolerance network to engineer
   salt-tolerant genotypes of crops. For the elucidation of the metabolic
   contribution to salinity response (long-term stress under 100 mM NaCl)
   in selected cultivars, we used a gas chromatography mass spectrometry
   approach. The metabolic profiling of grains yielded sixty-five
   metabolites. By comparing a salt-sensitive cultivar of barley (Scope) to
   a salt-tolerant one (GrangeR), we identified six and twenty significant
   metabolites in salt-stressed seeds of Scope and GrangeR, respectively.
   These included amino acids, sugars, sugar derivatives and organic acids.
   Whilst the concentrations of fructose reduced, glycine, glucitol and
   urea accumulated under salt stress in both varieties. Amino acids such
   as phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine, sugar acids such as
   galactaric acid and glucuronic acid, and several other key meta-bolites
   accumulated in GrangeR only. These metabolites are relevant to metabolic
   pathways of amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, carbohydrate
   metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, shikimate
   pathway, TCA cycle, inositol phosphate metabolism and galactose
   metabolism. Hence these com-pounds could be potentially used as
   biomarkers of abiotic stress responses and effects on grain quality and
   yield parameters. This work provides greater insights into functional
   metabolism in response to salinity stress and may help to dissect
   patterns associated with salt responses. Metabolites identified in this
   work could serve as accurate markers for salt-tolerant crop selection in
   breeding programs.}},

Title = {{Primary Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting Alone:
   Evaluation of Patient Satisfaction Using the BREAST-Q}},
Journal = {{AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autologous fat grafting (AFG) for primary aesthetic breast
   augmentation has grown in popularity over recent years but patient
   satisfaction has never been objectively evaluated.
   Objectives: The aim of the present study was to use the standardized
   BREAST-Q questionnaire to evaluate satisfaction in patients who had
   received primary aesthetic breast augmentation with AFG alone.
   Methods: All recipients of primary aesthetic breast augmentation by AFG
   performed between 2013 and 2017 in our plastic surgery department were
   included. The primary endpoint was assessment of patient satisfaction
   with the standardized breast augmentation BREAST-Q questionnaire. Three
   additional questionnaires were used to evaluate patient and surgeon
   satisfaction.
   Results: In total, 42 patients (84 breasts) underwent breast
   augmentation by AFG. Mean patient age was 34 years (range, 23-53 years).
   The mean volume of reinjected fat was 312.2 mL per breast (range,
   130-480 mL). We observed significant improvement in all BREAST-Q
   postoperative items (excluding physical well-being) with a mean increase
   of 39 points (95\% confidence interval: 28.97, 49.03; P < 0.001)
   regarding patient satisfaction with breasts. Overall, 82\% of patients
   were satisfied with the result of their liposuction. Minor complications
   were encountered in 6 of our patients (14\%).
   Conclusions: Breast augmentation by AFG enhances patient satisfaction as
   measured by the BREAST-O. This procedure has a high satisfaction rate
   and improves quality of life. Breast augmentation by AFG is a valid
   surgical option for moderate breast augmentation but is not an
   alternative to implants in large breast augmentation.}},

Title = {{The politics of domestic energy vulnerability in the Barcelona region,
   between deconfinement and reconfinement}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{201-210}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the diverse actions, interventions and strategies
   initiated to address rising energy vulnerability among low-income
   households in the Barcelona region over the last decade. Drawing upon
   recent conceptual work around the politics of energy and in-depth
   fieldwork conducted over more than two years, we trace the different
   processes and sites through which the basic socio-material conditions of
   domestic access to energy have become politicised. We show how this
   involves a two-stage movement of deconfinement and reconfinement. In a
   context marked by austerity, an energy inefficient urban fabric and a
   centralised and oligopolistic energy system, energy vulnerability
   emerged from the domestic and private sphere to become framed as a
   public problem through parliamentary debate, social protest and local
   authority initiatives. Yet, energy access and vulnerability have also to
   some extent been recontained in the space of the household through the
   focus of recent local policy intervention on `low cost' measurement,
   audit and equipment of domestic energy use. We argue that in
   reprivatizing what had become a public issue and thus redistributing
   responsibility for change to the household level, authorities and
   practitioners continue to ignore the systemic factors behind energy
   vulnerability situations and reproduce a status quo that benefits only
   energy utilities. The contribution of the paper is thus to show a
   politics of energy access that is increasingly constituted through
   entangled, fluid, blurred forms of relations between domestic and
   collective issues. This politics allows, for example, the need for
   systemic change to be framed as ostensibly a concern of households and
   to be met through fragmented, low-cost, metrological measures at that
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The relative incidence of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   (OSCC) seems to be increasing in young subjects and there is still no
   consensus regarding its pathogenesis, clinicopathological
   characteristics and prognosis in this population.
   Aim: The study aimed at evaluating the clinicopathological features of
   OSCC in younger patients and to determine any characteristic specific to
   this population in contrast to the older subjects.
   Materials and Methods: This was a single centre prospective study,
   conducted on 187 radical resection specimens of OSCC, between April 2015
   and April 2020, at MS Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals, Bengaluru.
   Of the study population 18.7\% were young patients (<= 40 years) and
   81.3\% were older patients. The clinical features and tumour
   characteristics were evaluated and the tumours were staged according to
   American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. The
   characteristics in young patients (<= 40 years) were compared to those
   of older patients. SPSS Version 18.0 software was used for statistical
   analysis. Chi-square test was used to determine any significant
   difference in the categorical variables.
   Results: Of the 187 patients, included in the study, 18.7\% were young
   with a mean age of 36.8 years and male: female ratio of 1.3:1. Risk
   factor usage was present in 85.7\% and family history of OSCC was
   present in 5.7\% of the patients. Buccal mucosa was the commonest tumour
   site (54.3\%) (significant p-value 0.031). Most patients presented at
   advanced TNM (Tumour Node Metastasis) stage (77.2\%) and lymph node
   metastasis, extranodal extension and Worst Pattern Of Invasion (WOPI)
   were respectively present in 40\%, 14.2\% and 8.6\% of the cases.
   Conclusion: Family antecedent of OSCC was higher in the young patients.
   Risk factor exposure and tumour characteristics like commonest anatomic
   site, morphology, differentiation and perineural invasion are relatively
   similar between the two age groups. Lymphovascular invasion, extranodal
   extension, WOPI, lymph node metastasis and presentation at advanced TNM
   stage were relatively more frequent, though not statistically
   significant, in the young suggesting a possibility of OSCC being more
   biologically aggressive in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Most industrial machinery and equipment used by the South African
   manufacturing sector is powered by either a direct current or an
   alternating current electricity supply. With the recent frequent power
   cuts caused by load shedding, operations managers have a difficult time
   trying to satisfy demand. Power cuts are a supplier-related operational
   disturbance that leads to production halts, increased downtime, and a
   significant compromise in delivery due date conformance. The paper
   presents heuristic rules of thumb that can be applied during the process
   planning and scheduling of orders during cases of frequent load shedding
   to maintain high levels of system reliability and productivity.
   Different load shedding scenarios are characterised, and an appropriate
   strategy for production planning and scheduling is outlined for each
   scenario. A knowledge engineering approach is employed in the study,
   with expert opinions derived from surveys and the literature employed to
   generate the strategies. These strategies are validated through a
   simulation study conducted in a small manufacturing firm.}},

Title = {{Over half of the WHO guidelines published from 2014 to 2019 explicitly

Volume = {{127}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate how and to what extent health equity
   considerations are assessed in World Health Organization (WHO)
   guidelines.
   Study Design and Setting: We evaluated WHO guidelines published between
   January 2014 and May 2019. Health equity consider-ations were assessed
   in relation to differences in baseline risk, importance of outcomes for
   socially disadvantaged populations, inclusion of health inequity as an
   outcome, equity-related subgroup analysis, and indirectness in each
   recommendation.
   Results: We identified 111 WHO guidelines, and 54\% (60 of 111) of these
   used the Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework. For the 60 guidelines
   using an EtD framework, the likely impact on health equity was supported
   by research evidence in 28\% of the recommendations (94 of 332).
   Research evidence was mostly provided as differences in baseline risk
   (23\%, 78/332). Research evidence less frequently addressed the
   importance of outcomes for socially disadvantaged populations (11\%,
   36/332), considered indirectness of the evidence for socially
   disadvantaged populations (2\%, 5/332), considered health inequities as
   an outcome (2\%, 5/332) and considered differences in the magnitude of
   effect in relative terms between disadvantaged and more advantaged
   populations (1\%, 3/332).
   Conclusion: The provision of research evidence to support equity
   judgements in WHO guidelines is still suboptimal, suggesting the need
   for better guidance and more training. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Quantitative video-fluoroscopic analysis of swallowing in infants}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To utilize objective, quantitative videofluoroscopic swallow
   measures to profile swallowing in infants and to determine the
   likelihood of objective swallow measures to predict risk of swallow
   impairments such as airway violation, reflux and post swallow residue.
   Study design: Our single center retrospective observational study used a
   cohort of 146 bottle-fed infants (0-9 months) referred for VFSS with any
   kind of feeding related concern. Frame-by-frame analysis of 20-s video
   loops of mid-feed sucking was completed to obtain quantitative timing,
   displacement and coordination measures as well as presence of other
   findings including aspiration, residue and naso-pharyngeal reflux (NPR)
   and esophago-pharyngeal reflux (EPR). Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney
   U test and binomial logistic regression were conducted to determine
   statistical associations between swallow measures and binary reporting
   of swallow impairments.
   Results: Videofluoroscopic data of 146 infants were reviewed and
   analyzed. 49\% of infants demonstrated at least one penetration or
   aspiration event. Total pharyngeal transit time (TPT) and suck-swallow
   ratio were associated with aspiration (p <.05). Infants with >3 sucks
   per swallow had significantly longer TPT and their risk of aspiration
   was greater than those with <3 sucks per swallow (RR 1.23, 95\% CI
   0.43-8.507, p =.03). Pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR) and bolus
   clearance ratio (BCR) were associated with residue, NPR and EPR (p
   <.05).
   Conclusion: Objective measures provide clinicians with reliable timing
   and displacement data even in the very young. These measures correlate
   with swallowing safety and may help to identify enhanced risk in some
   infants, which may influence management recommendations.}},

Title = {{14-3-3 zeta mediates an alternative, non-thermogenic mechanism in male
   mice to reduce heat loss and improve cold tolerance}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR METABOLISM}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{41}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Adaptive thermogenesis, which is partly mediated by
   sympathetic input on brown adipose tissue (BAT), is a mechanism of heat
   production that confers protection against prolonged cold exposure.
   Various endogenous stimuli, for example, norepinephrine and FGF-21, can
   also promote the conversion of inguinal white adipocytes to beige
   adipocytes, which may represent a secondary cell type that contributes
   to adaptive thermogenesis. We previously identified an essential role of
   the molecular scaffold 14-3-3 zeta in adipogenesis, but one of the
   earliest, identified functions of 14-3-3 zeta is its regulatory effects
   on the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the
   synthesis of norepinephrine. Herein, we examined whether 14-3-3 zeta
   could influence adaptive thermogenesis via actions on BAT activation or
   the beiging of white adipocytes.
   Methods: Transgenic mice over-expressing a TAP-tagged human 14-3-3 zeta
   molecule or heterozygous mice without one allele of Ywhaz, the gene
   encoding 14-3-3 zeta, were used to explore the contribution of 14-3-3
   zeta to acute (3 h) and prolonged (3 days) cold (4 degrees C) exposure.
   Metabolic caging experiments, PET-CT imaging, and laser Doppler imaging
   were used to determine the effect of 14-3-3 zeta over-expression on
   thermogenic and vasoconstrictive mechanisms in response to cold.
   Results: Transgenic over-expression of 14-3-3 zeta (TAP) in male mice
   significantly improved tolerance to acute and prolonged cold. In
   response to cold, body temperatures in TAP mice did not decrease to the
   same extent when compared to wildtype (WT) mice, and this was associated
   with increased UCP1 expression in beige inguinal white tissue (iWAT) and
   BAT. Of note was the paradoxical finding that cold-induced changes in
   body temperatures of TAP mice were associated with significantly
   decreased energy expenditure. The marked improvements in tolerance to
   prolonged cold were not due to changes in sensitivity to beta-adrenergic
   stimulation or BAT or iWAT oxidative metabolism; instead,
   over-expression of 14-3-3 zeta significantly decreased thermal
   conductance and heat loss in mice via increased peripheral
   vasoconstriction.
   Conclusions: Despite being associated with elevations in cold-induced
   UCP1 expression in brown or beige adipocytes, these findings suggest
   that 14-3-3 zeta regulates an alternative, non-thermogenic mechanism via
   vasoconstriction to minimize heat loss during cold exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Calcified canals present a challenge during endodontic
   treatments. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy and
   efficiency of a dynamic navigation system (DNS) to the freehand (FH)
   method for locating calcified canals in human teeth. Methods: Sixty
   human single-rooted teeth with canal obliteration were selected and
   mounted in dry cadaver jaws. Based on cone-beam computed tomographic
   scans of the jaws, the drilling path and depth were virtually planned to
   use X-Guide software (X-Nav Technologies, LLC, Lansdale, PA). Access
   preparation was made with navigation in the DNS group and without
   guidance in the FH group by 2 operators with different levels of
   experience. Postoperative cone-beam computed tomographic scans were
   taken of all teeth. Linear and angular deviations and reduced dentin
   thickness at 2 levels were measured. The time for locating the canal,
   the number of mishaps, and the unsuccessful attempts were determined and
   analyzed. Results: The mean linear and angular deviations, reduced
   dentin thickness (at both levels), the time for access cavity
   preparation, and the number of mishaps in the DNS group were
   significantly less than the FH group (P<.05). The unsuccessful attempts
   were not different between the 2 groups (P>.05). The time for access
   preparation was significantly shorter for the board-certified
   endodontist in the FH group (P<.05). Conclusions: The DNS was more
   accurate and more efficient than the FH technique in locating calcified
   canals in human teeth. This novel DNS can help clinicians avoid
   catastrophic mishaps during access preparation in calcified teeth.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean heat storage due to local addition of heat ({''}added'') and due
   to changes in heat transport ({''}redistributed'') were quantified in
   ocean-only 2xCO2 simulations. While added heat storage dominates
   globally, redistributionmakes important regional contributions,
   especially in the tropics. Heat redistribution is dominated by
   circulation changes, summarized by the super-residual transport, with
   only minor effects from changes in vertical mixing. While previous
   studies emphasized the contribution of redistribution feedback at high
   latitudes, this study shows that redistribution of heat also accounts
   for 65\% of heat storage at low latitudes and 25\% in the midlatitude
   (35 degrees-50 degrees S) Southern Ocean. Tropical warming results from
   the interplay between increased stratification and equatorward heat
   transport by the subtropical gyres, which redistributes heat from the
   subtropics to lower latitudes. The Atlantic pattern is remarkably
   distinct from other basins, resulting in larger basin-average heat
   storage. Added heat storage is evenly distributed throughout midlatitude
   Southern Ocean and dominates the total storage. However, redistribution
   stores heat north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Atlantic
   and Indian sectors, having an important contribution to the peak of heat
   storage at 45 degrees S. Southern Ocean redistribution results from
   intensified heat convergence in the subtropical front and reduced
   stratification in response to surface heat, freshwater, and momentum
   flux perturbations. These results highlight that the distribution of
   ocean heat storage reflects both passive uptake of heat and active
   redistribution of heat by changes in ocean circulation processes. The
   redistributed heat transportmust therefore be better understood for
   accurate projection of changes in ocean heat uptake efficiency, ocean
   heat storage, and thermosteric sea level.}},

Title = {{Sediment accumulation rates and vertical mixing of deep-sea sediments
   derived from C-14 and Pb-210 in the southern Gulf of Mexico}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{429}},

Abstract = {{Here we present new results on the sedimentation rates and vertical
   mixing in the deep-water region (966-3741 m) of the southern Gulf of
   Mexico, from a collection of 42 cores retrieved from the continental
   slopes and the abyssal plain. These cores were dated with the aid of
   accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 determinations on planktic
   foraminifera. We applied the Modified Mixing Box Model (MMBM) to
   evaluate the mean sedimentation rates (S-m), to estimate the age of
   surface sediments (T-0) that result from mixing processes. Sm range
   between 5 and 9 cm kyr(-1) in cores from the abyssal plain and the
   continental slopes, highest rates are consistently observed in specific
   locations on the slopes (17-24 cm kyr(-1)). T-0 values range between
   1000 and 2000 years, in cores from the abyssal plain and the continental
   slope sites, most probably as a result from the relatively low
   sedimentation rates and consequent mixing of older sediments. However,
   some cores from the continental slopes show consistently higher
   sedimentation rates, and T-0 values that are close to zero age. Here we
   further show Pb-210 profiles from 15 cores to evaluate the
   non-homogeneous mixing processes in surface sediments (0-10 cm).
   Biodiffusion coefficients (D-b) derived from the solution of
   advection-diffusion model range between 14 and 51 cm(2) kyr(-1) on the
   abyssal plain and between 42 and 158 cm(2) kyr(-1) on the continental
   slopes.
   Fluxes of Pb-210(ex) range between 60 and 111 Bq m(-2) yr(-1) on the
   abyssal plain, and higher values are consistently found on the
   continental slopes (158-247 Bq m(-2) yr(-1)). We find the age of surface
   sediments (T-0; derived from the MMBM of C-14) are linked with the
   transit time in the mixed layer through biodiffusion processes, derived
   from Pb-210 profiles. One of the implications of these results is the
   relative low importance of benthic macrofauna in respect to the meio-
   and microfauna bioturbation processes to explain sediment mixing
   patterns in the deep-sea sediments of the Gulf of Mexico, most probably
   reflecting a low export of organic carbon to the sediments controlled by
   the oligotrophic conditions of its surface waters.}},

Title = {{Incidence and survival rates and trends of skull Base chondrosarcoma: A
   Population-Based study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Chondrosarcomas are extremely rare, locally invasive, and
   potentially mortal malignant cartilaginous tumors. In this study, we
   aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival rates and trends of skull
   base chondrosarcomas (SBC).
   Methods: Data from SBC patients between 1975 and 2017 were extracted
   from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.
   The age-adjusted incidence rates (AAR) were calculated for the overall
   cases and based on gender, age, race, and histology. Furthermore, the
   relative survival rates for one, three, and five years, and the rates
   stratified to the aforementioned selected variables were computed.
   Besides, we conducted a joint point regression analysis to calculate the
   annual percent change (APC) and its associated standard error (SE) for
   AAR and mortality.
   Results: The AAR rate of SBC was 0.019 per 100,000. Higher AAR rates
   were observed in patients who were in the 65-74-year-age-group, females,
   Caucasians, and had none mesenchymal subtype. The relative one-year,
   three-year and five-year-survival rates were 99.58 \%, 93.67 \%, and
   89.10 \%, respectively. Lower survival rates were noted in patients who
   were males, African Americans, and had a mesenchymal subtype. The trend
   analysis has shown a significant yearly increase (P < 0.001) in AAR of
   SBC (APC +/- SE = 0.0005 \%+/- 0.0001), along with a significant yearly
   decline in mortality rates (APC +/- SE= -0.0202 \%+/- 0.0029).
   Conclusion: Despite the increase in AAR over time, there has been a
   significant decline in mortality rates over time, which might have been
   due to the advancement of treatment modalities, improvement in
   diagnostic imaging, and modification in disease grading.}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{307}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{FAU-type and MFI-type green hybrid zeolite coatings were developed for
   on-orbit molecular decontamination application by using a mixture of an
   organic binder (silicone resin) and an inorganic binder (suspension of
   colloidal silica nanoparticles). The zeolite content in the final dry
   coatings varies from 80 to 85 wt \% whereas the total amount of binders
   varies from 15 to 20 wt \%. This amount of binder was sufficient to give
   the zeolite coating interesting adhesion and cohesion properties. In
   fact, by using an equal amount of each binder, homogeneous films without
   significant cracks were obtained on an aluminum alloy substrate which is
   the main constituent of satellites. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption
   measurements revealed almost no loss of micropore volume of zeolite
   coatings. Adsorption experiments of an organic pollutant were carried
   out using n-hexane as probe molecule. The n-hexane adsorption capacities
   of FAU-type hybrid zeolite coatings (136-143 mg/g(anhydrous zeolite))
   are lower than that of pure FAU-type zeolite (180 mg/g(anhydrous
   zeolite)) due to water co-adsorption. The n hexane adsorption capacities
   of MFI-type zeolite coatings (103-106 mg/g(anhydrous zeolite)) are
   similar to that of pure MFI-type zeolite (110 mg/g(anhydrous zeolite)).}},

Title = {{Characteristics of Professional Physical Therapist Faculty and Doctor of

   First-Time National Physical Therapy Examination Pass Rates}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Graduation rates and first-time National Physical Therapy
   Examination (NPTE) pass rates among Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPI)
   programs have ranged from 30\% to 100\% and 0\% to 100\% between 2008
   and 2017, respectively. Prior studies on predictors of graduation rates
   and NPTE pass rates from DPT programs have used cross-sectional data and
   have not studied faculty data. This study sought to understand how
   trends in DPT faculty and program characteristics correlated with
   graduation rates and first-time NPTE pass rates.
   Methods. This study was a retrospective panel analysis of yearly data
   from 231 programs between 2008 and 2017. Random effects models estimated
   the correlations between faculty and program characteristics regarding
   graduation rates and first-time NPTE pass rates.
   Results. Graduation rates peaked when programs devoted 25\% of faculty
   time, on average, to scholarship. The number of peer-reviewed
   publications was positively correlated with graduation rates; however,
   the trend was logarithmic, indicating a diminishing rise in graduation
   rates as the number of publications exceeded 1 per faculty full-time
   equivalent. Tenure-track status, faculty of color, and part-time faculty
   were all negatively correlated with first-time NPTE pass rates. However,
   these 3 trends are likely not meaningful, because the predicted rates of
   decline in pass rates were minimal.
   Conclusions. Faculty engagement in scholarly activities can positively
   influence graduation rates, but only up to a certain level of faculty
   time devoted to scholarship.
   Impact. This is the first study to provide data on the influence of
   faculty on DPT student outcomes and will help education programs develop
   strategies to improve those outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We study with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation the
   stability of a discontinuity or piston, which separates an
   electron-positron cloud from a cooler electron-proton plasma. Such a
   piston might be present in the relativistic jets of accreting black
   holes separating the jet material from the surrounding ambient plasma
   and when pair clouds form during an x-ray flare and expand into the
   plasma of the accretion disk corona. We inject a pair plasma at a
   simulation boundary with a mildly relativistic temperature and mean
   speed. It flows across a spatially uniform electron-proton plasma, which
   is permeated by a background magnetic field. The magnetic field is
   aligned with one simulation direction and oriented orthogonally to the
   mean velocity vector of the pair cloud. The expanding pair cloud expels
   the magnetic field and piles it up at its front. It is amplified to a
   value large enough to trap ambient electrons. The current of the trapped
   electrons, which is carried with the expanding cloud front, drives an
   electric field that accelerates protons. A solitary wave grows and
   changes into a piston after it saturated. Our simulations show that this
   piston undergoes a collisionless instability similar to a
   Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The undular mode grows and we observe
   fingers in the proton density distribution. The effect of the
   instability is to deform the piston but it cannot destroy it.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers, parents and educators consistently observe a stark mismatch
   between biologically preferred and socially imposed sleep-wake hours in
   adolescents, fueling debate about high school start times. We contribute
   neural evidence to this debate with electroencephalogram data collected
   from high school students during their regular morning, mid-morning and
   afternoon classes. Overall, student alpha power was lower when class
   content was taught via videos than through lectures. Students' resting
   state alpha brain activity decreased as the day progressed, consistent
   with adolescents being least attentive early in the morning. During the
   lessons, students showed consistently worse performance and higher alpha
   power for early morning classes than for mid-morning classes, while
   afternoon quiz scores and alpha levels varied. Together, our findings
   demonstrate that both class activity and class time are reflected in
   adolescents' brain states in a real-world setting, and corroborate
   educational research suggesting that mid-morning may be the best time to
   learn.}},

Abstract = {{Victims of repeated incidents of abuse are often required to report
   incident-specific information about particular instances of the abuse.
   In the current study, we explored adults' capability of such a task by
   examining the difference in memory for single versus repeated events
   that were either stressful or nonstressful. One hundred and twenty-two
   female participants engaged in either a single event or four highly
   similar events over a 4-week period. During each event, participants
   read and imagined themselves partaking in a hypothetical relationship
   scenario that consisted of either a domestic violence encounter
   (stressful group) or a closely matched neutral relationship encounter
   (nonstressful group). One week after the final scenario, participants
   completed recall and recognition questions about the target scenario.
   The findings revealed that although emotional stress had an enhancing
   effect on long-term memory. it did not interact with event frequency
   (single, repeated) for most memory measures. However. regardless of
   emotional stress, repeated-event participants struggled to report
   particular details about the target scenario, and showed greater source
   monitoring issues than single-event participants. Conversely, when a
   broader definition of memory accuracy was used that encompassed all
   experienced details, repeated and single event groups performed
   similarly. Together, the findings indicate that the testimonies of adult
   female complainants of repeated abuse will mostly likely consist of
   details that occurred across multiple experienced events, and that this
   will be similar regardless of whether emotional stress was or was not
   experienced during the event(s). The findings are discussed in terms of
   theoretical and practical implications.}},

Title = {{Do Sex-Specific Differences Exist in ACL Attachment Location? An
   MRI-Based 3-Dimensional Topographic Analysis}},
Journal = {{ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Female sex is an independent risk factor for an anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) injury, as the incidence of an ACL rupture is 4- to
   6-fold higher in female athletes compared with their male counterparts.
   The ACL attachment location as a potential risk factor for the increased
   ACL rupture rate in women has never been reported in the literature.
   Purpose/Hypothesis
   The purpose of the present study was to investigate the 3-dimensional
   topographic anatomy of the ACL bundle attachment in female and male
   patients, with and without an ACL rupture, and identify potential
   sex-related differences. We hypothesized that the ACL attachment
   location would be significantly different between men and women, in both
   the intact- and ruptured-ACL states.
   Study Design:
   Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   Magnetic resonance images of the knee from 90 patients (55 men, 35
   women) with a ruptured ACL and 90 matched controls (55 men, 35 women),
   who suffered a noncontact knee injury without ACL rupture, were used to
   create 3-dimensional models of the femur and tibia. The ACL bundles'
   origin and insertion were outlined on each model, and their location was
   measured using an anatomical coordinate system. A 2-way analysis of
   variance was used to compare the ACL attachment location between male
   and female patients, with and without an ACL rupture.
   Results:
   No significant differences were found between female and male
   participants regarding ACL attachment location (femoral origin and
   tibial insertion). Patients with a ruptured ACL demonstrated a
   significantly different ACL origin compared with the participants with
   an intact ACL by an average difference of 8.9\% more posterior (P < .05)
   and 4.0\% more proximal (P < .05) in men and 13.0\% more posterior (P <
   .05) and 5.5\% more proximal (P < .05) to the flexion-extension axis of
   the knee in women.
   Conclusion:
   The ACL attachment location should not be considered a risk factor for
   the increased ACL rupture rates in female compared with male athletes.
   However, a more posterior and proximal location of the femoral ACL
   origin might be a predisposing factor to an ACL rupture regardless of
   sex.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Inorganic-polymer nanocomposites consisting of sulfur doped zinc oxide
   nanoparticles (ZOS\_nps) as fillers and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)
   as the polymer matrix were prepared via the solution casting method. The
   energy storage behaviors of PVDF/ZOS nanocomposites were studied. The
   results indicated that the incorporation of ZOS\_nps in the polymer
   matrix could effectively improve breakdown strength (E-b), resulting in
   greatly enhanced energy density (U-e) and discharge efficiency (eta).
   The nanocomposite with 1 vol\% of ZOS\_nps shows an outstanding
   discharge energy density of 11.5 J cm(-3) and maintains a high discharge
   efficiency of 68.7\% at 4800 kV cm(-1). This reason is that S-doped zinc
   oxide nanoparticles with isoelectronic hope traps suppress the
   interfacial polarization. The present work may offer a novel way to
   confine the movement of charges by introducing isoelectronic impurities
   in polymer nanocomposites. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{p53 Loss Mediates Hypersensitivity to ETS Transcription Factor
   Inhibition Based on PARylation-Mediated Cell Death Induction}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   ETS transcription factors are potent oncogenic drivers in several cancer
   types and represent promising therapeutic targets. However, molecular
   factors influencing response to ETS factor inhibition are widely unknown
   so far. Here, we uncover that sensitivity of cancer cells against ETS
   factor blockade by the small molecule inhibitor YK-4-279 is strongly
   promoted by p53 loss in a MAPK-driven background. Induction of a
   parthanatos-like cell death based on a deregulated MAPK/ETS1/p53/PARP1
   signal axis is identified as underlying molecular mechanism. Hence, this
   study suggests a novel and biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy for
   p53-deleted tumours, generally known for their profound therapy
   resistance.
   The small-molecule E26 transformation-specific (ETS) factor inhibitor
   YK-4-279 was developed for therapy of ETS/EWS fusion-driven Ewing's
   sarcoma. Here we aimed to identify molecular factors underlying YK-4-279
   responsiveness in ETS fusion-negative cancers. Cell viability screenings
   that deletion of P53 induced hypersensitization against YK-4-279
   especially in the BRAF(V600E)-mutated colon cancer model RKO. This
   effect was comparably minor in the BRAF wild-type HCT116 colon cancer
   model. Out of all ETS transcription factor family members, especially
   ETS1 overexpression at mRNA and protein level was induced by deletion of
   P53 specifically under BRAF-mutated conditions. Exposure to YK-4-279
   reverted ETS1 upregulation induced by P53 knock-out in RKO cells.
   Despite upregulation of p53 by YK-4-279 itself in RKOp53 wild-type
   cells, YK-4-279-mediated hyperphosphorylation of histone histone H2A.x
   was distinctly more pronounced in the P53 knock-out background.
   YK-4-279-induced cell death in RKOp53-knock-out cells involved
   hyperPARylation of PARP1, translocation of the apoptosis-inducible
   factor AIF into nuclei, and induction of mitochondrial membrane
   depolarization, all hallmarks of parthanatos. Accordingly,
   pharmacological PARP as well as BRAF(V600E) inhibition showed
   antagonistic activity with YK-4-279 especially in the P53 knock-out
   background. Taken together, we identified ETS factor inhibition as a
   promising strategy for the treatment of notoriously therapy-resistant
   p53-null solid tumours with activating MAPK mutations.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Substance use disorder (SUD) is on the rise globally, and nurses are not
   prepared to care for this population. Purpose
   The purpose was to determine if a 4-hour antistigma intervention
   improved prelicensure student nurse attitudes and perceived stigma
   toward people with SUD. Methods
   This was a nonrandomized quasi-experimental survey study. Participants
   completed the 20-item Drug and Drug Problems Perception Questionnaire
   (DDPPQ), the 8-item Perceived Stigma of Substance Abuse Scale (PSAS),
   and the 13-item Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale at baseline and
   repeated the DDPPQ and PSAS postintervention. Paired t tests were used
   to determine the mean differences in the total DDPPQ and total PSAS
   scores. Results
   After the antistigma intervention, there was a significant improvement
   in overall therapeutic attitudes (t = 8.4, df = 108, P < .001) and
   perceived stigma (t = -2.5, df = 108, P = .01) in undergraduate nursing
   students (n = 126). Conclusions
   Incorporating antistigma educational approaches may lead to more
   involvement and compassionate care for people with SUD.}},

Title = {{Novel hybrid intelligence models for flood-susceptibility prediction:
   Meta optimization of the GMDH and SVR models with the genetic algorithm
   and harmony search}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Floods are among the deadliest natural hazards for humans and the
   environment. Identifying the most flood-susceptible areas is a
   fundamental step in the development of flood mitigation strategies and
   for reducing flood damage. There is an ongoing global debate regarding
   the most suitable model for flood-susceptibility modeling and
   predictions. There is also a growing interest in the development of
   parsimonious and precise models for flood-susceptibility prediction.
   This study proposed several novel hybrid intelligence models based on
   the meta-optimization of the support vector regression (SVR) and group
   method of data handling (GMDH) using different meta-heuristic
   algorithms, i.e., the genetic algorithm (GA) and harmony search (HS). In
   contrast to the traditional models, in the SVR model computational
   complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space.
   GMDH model has also advantage of being appropriate to analyze
   multi-parametric data sets. The methodology was developed for the
   Haraz-Neka watershed, one of the most flood-prone areas in the coastal
   margins of the Caspian Sea. A total of nine geospatial parameters (slope
   degree, aspect, elevation, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance
   to the river, land use, lithology, and rainfall) were identified as the
   main flood-conditioning factors using information gain ratio (IGR)
   analyses. Based on existing reports, 132 flood locations were identified
   in the study area, 92 points (70\%) were used together with geospatial
   data for flood-susceptibility modeling, and the remaining 40 points
   (30\%) were used to validate the models. An initial flood-susceptibility
   model was constructed based on the SVR and GMDH models. The model
   parameters were optimized using the GA and HS to reproduce the
   flood-susceptibility maps. The prediction accuracy of the resultant maps
   was evaluated in terms of various statistical measures, i.e., mean
   square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The
   results showed that the SVR model had superior performance (AUC =
   0.70-0.75, RMSE = 0.29-0.36, MSE = 0.08-0.13) compared to the GMDH model
   (AUC = 0.67-0.74, RMSE = 0.32-0.39, MSE = 0.1-0.15). Both the GA and HS
   remarkably improved the SVR and GMDH performance, with the SVR-GA model
   performing the best (AUC = 0.75, RMSE = 0.29, MSE = 0.08) followed by
   the SVR-HS model (AUC = 0.75, RMSE = 0.33, MSE = 0.11). Our results
   verify the efficiency of the proposed hybrid models for spatial
   flood-susceptibility prediction. The proposed models can be adopted for
   use in other regions with similar hydro-environment characteristics.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW}},

Volume = {{85}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Addressing the characterization of social and economic determinants of
   health (SDH) properly is a key aspect in conducting a Health Impact
   Assessment (HIA). This article explores the level of knowledge on HIA
   environmental and public health professionals have as well as their
   perception regarding key concepts such as the definition of `health' and
   the relevance of SDH. With this purpose in mind, a survey was conducted
   among experts (n = 41) who attended a technical session on HIA within
   the framework of the most important conference on the Environment on a
   national level in Spain. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted
   to categorize groups of respondents depending on their working profile
   and professional expertise and a Friedman test was used to compare mean
   ranks so as to assess the importance given to SDH according to the
   target respondents' perception. Strong differences were found in the
   relevance given to diverse SDH according to their contribution to a good
   state of health, the block referring to `Habits and lifestyle' being the
   one perceived as more significant. SDH were ranked in a diverging order
   from that reported in the scientific evidence regarding the association
   between SDH and a wide range of health outcomes. Also, some diverging
   trends were illustrated between groups of respondents according to the

Abstract = {{What are the psychosocial support needs of prostate cancer (PCa)
   patients undergoing active surveillance (AS)? The preferred management
   strategy for low-risk PCa (LR-PCa) is AS. Patients remain under close
   surveillance to monitor disease progression. However, living with
   untreated disease has psychosocial implications. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the psychosocial support needs in PCa patients
   undergoing AS. According to Marzouk (2018) 30\% of patients risk
   developing anxiety during the first year of AS. Parker (2015) and Tan
   (2016) suggest approximately 10\% of AS-patients request a change to
   active treatment, often based on anxiety. Pickles (2007) states that
   psychosocial support can effectively reduce anxiety and uncertainty. A
   literature based interview guide was used to conduct 17 semi-structured
   interviews following an explorative qualitative approach. LR-PCa
   patients, eligible for AS, were enrolled from two participating Dutch
   urology clinics experienced with AS. Written informed consent was
   obtained. Inclusion ended after attaining data saturation. The
   interviews were transcribed verbatim. NVIVO 10 was used for open coding.
   Participants expressed recurring uncertainty and anxiety caused by
   medical examinations, lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile
   dysfunction. Various effective and ineffective coping strategies were
   adopted by participants. The use of specific strategies was associated
   with patient-physician relationship, locus-of-control and
   disease-acceptation. Ineffective coping strategies seemed to impede
   resilience during stressful situations. Satisfactory decision-making and
   disease-acceptation were promoted by immediate availability of relevant,
   reliable information regarding disease characteristics and treatment
   options. Early-stage reliable and relevant information, assessment and
   encouragement of effective coping strategies appear to be important
   psychosocial support needs during AS. Most participants in this study
   had spousal support and completed higher education. Future research
   should determine the generalizability of these findings in a more
   heterogeneous population.}},

Abstract = {{After the downfall of the Tang dynasty, the Khitan-Liao empire, the Five
   Dynasties, and Northern Song dynasty formed the second ``northern and
   southern dynasties{''} confrontation in the history of China. Also in
   this period, two systems appeared in the capital city planning: the
   ``Shangjing norm{''} of the Liao dynasty characterized by the boxed
   minus-shaped plan view and the ``Dongjing mode{''} of the Northern Song
   dynasty characterized by the boxed dot-shaped plan view. The ``Shangjing
   norm{''} is the materialization of the political system of ``ruling by
   the customs of the peoples being ruled{''} applied by the nomadic rulers
   from the northern steppes when they were managing the empire with the
   Han people as the majority. This seemingly reflected the ethnic
   discrimination of the nomadic ruling class at the beginning of the
   establishment of their empire. The capital designing ideas of the Jin,
   Yuan, and Qing dynasties were all following this noun at the beginnings
   of their rules. ``Dongjing mode{''} of the Northern Song dynasty is the
   materialization of the ``imperial sovereignty{''} idea emphasized by the
   empires founded by the Han rulers, which seems reflecting the bureaucrat
   system with the centralization as the characteristics. The designs of
   the Liao Zhongjing (Central Capital) and the Jin Zhongdu were both
   simulations of that of Dongjing, which showed the trends of ethnic
   convergence and unification. Moreover, Dadu of the Yuan dynasty and
   Beijing of the Ming and Qing dynasties were the symbols of the formation
   of the unified multiethnic empire of China.}},

Abstract = {{A voltammetric and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
   investigation was performed on an inherently chiral oligomer-coated gold
   electrode to establish its general properties (i.e., conductivity and
   topography), as well as its ability to discriminate chiral electroactive
   probe molecules. The electroactive monomer (S)-2,2 `-bis(2,2
   `-bithiophene-5-yl)-3,3 `-bibenzothiophene ((S)-BT2T4) was employed as
   reagent to electrodeposit, by cyclic voltammetry, the inherently chiral
   oligomer film of (S)-BT2T4 (oligo-(S)-BT2T4) onto the Au electrode
   surface (resulting in oligo-(S)-BT2T4-Au). SECM measurements, performed
   in either feedback or competition mode, using the redox mediators
   {[}Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) in aqueous solutions, and
   ferrocene (Fc), (S)-FcEA, (R)-FcEA and rac-FcEA (FcEA is
   N,N-dimethyl-1-ferrocenylethylamine) in CH3CN solutions, indicated that
   the oligomer film, as produced, was uncharged. The use of
   {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) allowed establishing that the oligomer film behaved as
   a porous insulating membrane, presenting a rather rough surface. This
   was inferred from both the approach curves and linear and bidimensional
   SECM scans, which displayed negative feedback effects. The oligomer film
   acquired semiconducting or fully conducting properties when the Au
   electrode was biased at potential more positive than 0.6 V vs.
   Ag|AgCl|KCl. Under the latter conditions, the approach curves displayed
   positive feedback effects. SECM measurements, performed in competition
   mode, allowed verifying the discriminating ability of the
   oligo-(S)-BT2T4 film towards the (S)-FcEA and (R)-FcEA redox mediators,
   which confirmed the results obtained by cyclic voltammetry. SECM linear
   scans indicated that the enantiomeric discriminating ability of the
   oligo-(S)-BT2T4 was even across its entire surface.}},

Title = {{Cooperative responses in rats playing a 2 x 2 game: Effects of opponent
   strategy, payoff, and oxytocin}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The present study tested cooperation in rats playing a 2 x 2 game (2
   players, 2 responses) in an operant chamber, where players choose to
   cooperate or defect without knowledge of their partner's choice. We
   evaluated cooperative responses in rats (Subjects) playing different
   games {[}iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), Stag Hunt] with a Stooge
   partner utilizing different response strategies {[}Tit-for-tat (TFT),
   Win-stay, Lose-shift (WSLS), Random], and we determined the effects of
   oxytocin (OT). IPD trial outcomes and payoffs included mutual
   cooperation (reward, R, 3 sugar pellets each), mutual defection
   (punishment, P, 1 pellet each), or unilateral defection (temptation, T,
   5 pellets) and cooperation (sucker, S, 0 pellets). Stag Hunt was
   similar, except that T = 2 pellets. We hypothesized that Subjects would
   make more cooperative responses when playing Stag Hunt vs IPD, when
   playing IPD with a Stooge using TFT vs WSLS or Random, and when treated
   with OT. At baseline, Subjects' overall likelihood of cooperation was
   unaffected by the game (IPD vs SH) or by the Stooges' response strategy
   (TFT, WSLS, Random). Cooperative responses earned Subjects more pellets,
   except when playing with a Stooge using a random strategy. Trial
   outcomes (R, T, S or P) also varied by game and strategy, although the
   mutual defection (P) was the most common. Systemic pretreatment with OT
   increased Subjects' cooperative responses, resulting in fewer P and more
   R outcomes. In particular, IPD-Random Subjects were more cooperative,
   even at the expense of earning fewer pellets. These results demonstrate
   that OT increases cooperative behavior in rats playing 2 x 2 games.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Mitochondrial Hsp70 (HSPA9, mtHsp70, mortalin) in conjunction with a
   complex set of other proteins is involved in the transport of
   polypeptides across the mitochondrial matrix. This observation allows us
   to hypothesize that HSPA9 might interact with membranes directly,
   similarly to other Hsp70s. Thus, we investigated whether human HSPA9
   could also get inserted into lipid membranes. Human HSPA9 was incubated
   with liposomes made of lipids found within the mitochondrial membrane,
   such as 1', 3'-bis {[}1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho]-glycerol
   (CL), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphocholine (POPC), palmitoyl-oleoyl
   phosphoserine (POPS), and palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoethanolamine (POPE).
   HSPA9 displayed a predilection for CL and POPS, and low affinity for
   POPC and POPE, suggesting that the proteins have high specificity for
   negatively charged phospholipids. Then, liposomes were made with a
   composition resembling either the outer or inner mitochondrial membrane
   (OMM or IMM, respectively). We observed that HSPA9 has a higher affinity
   for IMM than OMM, which is consistent with the higher content of CL in
   the IMM. A comparison for the incorporation into POPS or CL liposomes by
   HSPA9 or HSPA1 indicated that both proteins behaved very similarly when
   exposed to CL liposomes, but differently with POPS liposomes, which was
   further corroborated by their susceptibility to proteinase K digestion
   after incorporation into liposomes. The measurement of thermodynamic
   parameters also showed that the interaction of both proteins with CL and
   POPS liposomes was different. Overall, our data showed that HSPA9 is
   prone to interact with membranes resembling the IMM that may be
   important for its role in the translocation of proteins into the
   mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, the total production of table grapes and grapes grown for the
   production of wine, juice or raisins in 2018 was estimated at 1,386,579
   tons and the planted area was 73,195 hectares. The state of Sao Paulo
   stands out among the largest producers of this fruit, occupying third
   place among the producing states of Brazil. In this sense, the objective
   of the work was to verify the financial viability of Niagara grape
   growing in the state. The project was scaled to an area of one hectare
   based on the AGRIANUAL (2019) data. Cash flow was estimated over a
   period of 12 years, including costs for implementation, vineyard
   maintenance, bank financing, payment of taxes and taxes. The minimum
   rate of attractiveness (TMA) was set at 8.11\% and the economic
   indicators calculated were Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of
   Return (IRR), Internal Rate of Return (TIRM), Profitability Index ),
   Equivalent Annual Equivalent Value (VAUE), Benefit / Cost (B / C) and
   Discounted Payback (PD). Positive values of NPV were R \$ 24,004.89,
   cost-benefit ratio 2.24, IRR at 10\%, TIRM at 9\%, and Discounted
   Payback was 8.68 years, indicating that the time of return of the
   initial capital invested was lower than the project period. Negative
   values were obtained IL -1.17, VAUE of -R \$ 3,203.51. Thus, under the
   conditions that the study developed, it is concluded that, based on the
   financial feasibility analysis, that the investment in the production of
   one hectare of Niagara grapes on rural properties can not be considered
   a viable project, since the indicators: Profitability Index and
   Equivalent Uniform Annual Value (VAUE) presented negative results.}},

Abstract = {{Ophthalmoplegia following cosmetic facial filler injections is a rare
   but serious complication. The authors report 2 cases of ophthalmoplegia
   following filler injection. In the first case, a 54-year-old female
   presented with acute onset headache, vomiting, and diplopia during malar
   and temporal injection of hyaluronic acid. In the second case, a
   37-year-old female presented with binocular diplopia that developed
   following injection of an unknown filler to the upper face. Neither of
   the 2 patients had skin necrosis or ocular abnormalities other than
   motility deficits. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no other
   cases of isolated ophthalmoplegia without evidence of other ocular
   injuries following facial filler.}},

   micromelia}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{147}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Disruption of the minor spliceosome due to mutations in RNU4ATAC is
   linked to primordial dwarfism in microcephalic osteodysplastic
   primordial dwarfism type 1, Roffman syndrome, and Lowry-Wood syndrome.
   Similarly, primordial dwarfism in domesticated animals is linked to
   positive selection in minor spliceosome components. Despite being vital
   for limb development and size regulation, its role remains unexplored.
   Here, we disrupt minor spliceosome function in the developing mouse limb
   by ablating one of its essential components, U11 small nuclear RNA,
   which resulted in micromelia. Notably, earlier loss of U11 corresponded
   to increased severity. We find that limb size is reduced owing to
   elevated minor intron retention in minor intron-containing genes that
   regulate cell cycle. As a result, limb progenitor cells experience
   delayed prometaphase-to-metaphase transition and prolonged 5phase.
   Moreover, we observed death of rapidly dividing, distally located
   progenitors. Despite cell cycle defects and cell death, the spatial
   expression of key limb patterning genes was maintained. Overall, we show
   that the minor spliceosome is required for limb development via size
   control potentially shared in disease and domestication.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-type specific RNA-associated proteins are essential for development
   and homeostasis in animals. Despite a massive recent effort to
   systematically identify RNA-associated proteins, we currently have few
   comprehensive rosters of cell-type specific RNA-associated proteins in
   vertebrate tissues. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of determining
   the RNA-associated proteome of a defined vertebrate embryonic tissue
   using DIF-FRAC, a systematic and universal (Le., label-free) method.
   Application of DIF-FRAC to cultured tissue explants of Xenopus
   mucociliary epithelium identified dozens of known RNA-associated
   proteins as expected, but also several novel RNA-associated proteins,
   including proteins related to assembly of the mitotic spindle and
   regulation of ciliary beating. In particular, we show that the inner
   dynein arm tether Cfap44 is an RNA-associated protein that localizes not
   only to axonemes, but also to liquid-like organelles in the cytoplasm
   called DynAPs. This result led us to discover that DynAPs are generally
   enriched for RNA. Together, these data provide a useful resource for a
   deeper understanding of mucociliary epithelia and demonstrate that
   DIF-FRAC will be broadly applicable for systematic identification of
   RNA-associated proteins from embryonic tissues.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The film formation step of latexes constitutes one of the challenges of
   these environmentally friendly waterborne polymers, as the high glass
   transition (T-G) polymers needed to produce hard films to be used as
   coatings will not produce coherent films at low temperature. This issue
   has been dealt by the use of temporary plasticizers added with the
   objective to reduce the T-G of the polymers during film formation, while
   being released to the atmosphere afterwards. The main problem of these
   temporary plasticizers is their volatile organic nature, which is not
   recommended for the environment. Therefore, different strategies have
   been proposed to overcome their massive use. One of them is the use of
   hydroplasticization, as water, abundant in latexes, can effectively act
   as plasticizer for certain types of polymers. In this work, the effect
   of three different grafted hydroplasticizers has been checked in a
   (meth)acrylate copolymer, concluding that itaconic acid showed the best
   performance as seen by its low minimum film-formation temperature, just
   slightly modified water resistance and better mechanical properties of
   the films containing itaconic acid. Furthermore, film formation
   monitoring has been carried out by Differential Scanning Calorimety
   (DSC), showing that itaconic acid is able to retain more strongly the
   water molecules during the water losing process, improving its
   hydroplasticization capacity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{532}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ecological theory states that the resilience of ecosystem functions to
   environmental disturbance depends on the biodiversity that underpins
   them, but field validations of this are rare. In this study, we explore
   how shifts in the composition of an intertidal macrofauna assemblage
   following organic matter enrichment affect the representation and
   composition of functional groups (FG) underpinning sandflat
   biogeochemistry and stability. Slow-release organic fertiliser was
   incorporated into experimental plots (1.44 m(2)) in a gradient study
   design (treatments ranged from 0 to 2250 g dw m(-2)). Macrofaunal
   communities were sampled 70 d later, after changes in sediment
   conditions associated with organic matter decomposition (hypoxia,
   acidification and increased concentrations of reduced solutes) had taken
   effect. Taxa-specific sensitivities to organic enrichment resulted in a
   significant diversity of responses within FGs, and density compensation
   was observed in one FG as a result of the disturbance; this enabled FGs
   to persist even at high levels of enrichment. Despite this, total
   community abundance decreased by 80\% between low and high levels of
   enrichment and substantial declines in the abundance of dominant taxa
   reduced the viability of several FGs. Our study demonstrates a
   density-dependent relationship between macrofaunal biodiversity and
   ecosystem function, as declines in benthic primary production and
   nutrient recycling were significantly correlated with decreases in the
   abundance of key taxa. Despite the occurrence of stabilising mechanisms
   that provided resilience to FGs, taxonomic diversity was crucial for
   maintaining ecosystem function.}},

   LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-delta in intermediate temperature symmetrical solid oxide
   fuel/electrolysis cells}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{77}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A solid oxide cell (SOC) integrating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and
   solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) usually utilizes two different
   materials as the anode and cathode prepared by the costly multi-elements
   co-doping process. In this work, LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-delta (LCN) is employed
   as the contact material and the electrode for the symmetrical SOC and
   exhibits good catalytic activities towards the four typical reactions,
   i.e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction
   (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and CO2 reduction reaction
   (CO2RR). The LCN-GDC electrode has the low activation energies of 1.18
   and 0.55 eV as the cathode and anode of SOFC, respectively. High peak
   power densities (PPDs) of 1.896 and 0.562 W cm(-2) are obtained at 800
   degrees C for the Ni-YSZ (8 mol.\% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) anode-supported
   and YSZ (200 mu m)-supported symmetrical SOFCs, respectively. An
   electrolysis current density (ECD) of 2.316 A cm(-2) is obtained at 800
   degrees C and 2.0 V and a robust operation for over 120 h with a
   degradation rate of about 0.5 mV h(-1) is achieved with LCN as the
   current collector in air side at 750 degrees C for the symmetrical
   SOECs. Such a multi-functional material shows attractive competitiveness
   and successfully achieves fivefold applications in SOCs. The protocol
   described herein affords a new vision towards material development
   basing on the consideration of enhancing the chemical compatibility and
   lowering the cost of the whole SOC but not just one electrode.}},

   in Portugal. Using a quantitative approach, a semi-structured
   questionnaire was distributed online, and 1174 valid responses were
   obtained. The most consumed pulses were beans and peas, consumed at
   least once a week by 48.3\% and 44.4\% of the sample, respectively. When
   participants were asked about the possibility of replacement, even
   partially, of animal products for pulses, 15.0\% stated they would not
   substitute even in a food scarcity scenario. In the qualitative study,
   ten individuals involved at different steps of pulses' supply and value
   chain were interviewed in order to study individual behaviors and
   experiences linked knowledge and consumption of pulses. It was noticed
   that the lack of recognition of their nutritional value, the high
   cooking time and the effect of the anti-nutritional factors were
   commonly pointed out as barriers. The identification and understanding
   of perceived barriers for that low consumption will leverage the
   development of new strategies to promote this promising alternative.}},

Title = {{Are ACOs Ready to be Accountable for Medication Use?}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) have the potential to
   lower costs and improve quality through incentives and coordinated care.
   However, the design brings with it many new challenges. One such
   challenge is the optimal use of pharmaceuticals. Most ACOs have not yet
   focused on this integral facet of care, even though medications are a
   critical component to achieving the lower costs and improved quality
   that are anticipated with this new model.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ACOs are prepared to maximize the value
   of medications for achieving quality benchmarks and cost offsets.
   METHODS: During the fall of 2012, an electronic readiness
   self-assessment was developed using a portion of the questions and
   question methodology from the National Survey of Accountable Care
   Organizations, along with original questions developed by the authors.
   The assessment was tested and subsequently revised based on feedback
   from pilot testing with 5 ACO representatives. The revised assessment
   was distributed via e-mail to a convenience sample (n=175) of ACO
   members of the American Medical Group Association, Brookings-Dartmouth
   ACO Learning Network, and Premier Healthcare Alliance.
   RESULTS: The self-assessment was completed by 46 ACO representatives
   (26\% response rate). ACOs reported high readiness to manage medications
   in a few areas, such as transmitting prescriptions electronically
   (70\%), being able to integrate medical and pharmacy data into a single
   data-base (54\%), and having a formulary in place that encourages
   generic use when appropriate (50\%). However, many areas have
   substantial room for improvement with few ACOs reporting high readiness.
   Some notable areas include being able to quantify the cost offsets and
   hence demonstrate the value of appropriate medication use (7\%),
   notifying a physician when a prescription has been filled (9\%), having
   protocols in place to avoid medication duplication and polypharmacy
   (17\%), and having quality metrics in place for a broad diversity of
   conditions (22\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Developing the capabilities to support, monitor, and ensure
   appropriate medication use will be critical to achieve optimal patient
   outcomes and ACO success. The ACOs surveyed have embarked upon an
   important journey towards this goal, but critical gaps remain before
   they can become fully accountable. While many of these organizations
   have begun adopting health information technologies that allow them to
   maximize the value of medications for achieving quality outcomes and
   cost offsets, a significant lag was identified in their inability to use
   these technologies to their full capacities. In order to provide further
   guidance, the authors have begun documenting case studies for public
   release that would provide ACOs with examples of how certain medication
   issues have been addressed by ACOs or relevant organizations. The
   authors hope that these case studies will help ACOs optimize the value
   of pharmaceuticals and achieve the ``triple aim{''} of improving care,
   health, and cost. Copyright (C) 2014, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Title = {{Ultrasound frequency of sonication applied in microbiological
   diagnostics has a major impact on viability of bacteria causing
   periprosthetic joint infection}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Sonication of explanted prosthesis constitutes an element of
   microbiological diagnostics. The aim of performing this procedure is to
   remove biofilm and to increase sensitivity of diagnostics. Ultrasound
   used for medical purposes are low-frequency and low-intensity. With this
   wide range of frequency which can be used in sonication process it is
   necessary to find the golden mean between biofilm dislodging and
   planktonic bacteria sparing.
   Materials and methods: The aim of this study was to determine the least
   harming low-intensity ultrasound frequency (35 kHz, 40 kHz or 53 kHz)
   used during sonication process with other parameters constant. Four
   bacteria species were examined: S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, K.
   pneumoniae. Number of microbiological studies (n) for each group (g)
   counted 40 specimens (based on scheme 1 bacteria type - 4 groups, 40
   studies each).
   Results: A detailed analysis of gathered data was conducted. Based on
   study findings following conclusions were drawn. Sonication has a
   significant and negative impact on survival of sonicated planktonic
   bacteria. Part of bacteria in planktonic state are damaged/killed by
   ultrasound, which is demonstrated by lower CFU count in sonicated
   samples versus control group.
   Conclusions: Optimal ultrasound frequencies for sonication of S. aureus,
   P. aeruginosa and E. coli are 35 kHz and 40 kHz. Ultrasound frequencies
   used in sonication process (35 kHz, 40 kHz, 53 kHz) of E. coli showed
   same impact on bacteria survival. It is crucial to perform further
   assessment of ultrasound parameters on clinical effects of sonication
   used in PJI diagnostics. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd

Title = {{The relationship between the undergraduate clinical learning environment
   and work readiness in new graduate nurses: A pre-post survey study}},
Journal = {{NURSE EDUCATION TODAY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Due to projected nurse shortages, it is necessary that
   undergraduate programs optimise work readiness outcomes in new graduate
   nurses. Research that quantitatively evaluates characteristics of
   clinical nursing programs that predict increased work readiness is
   required.
   Objectives: To explore the relationship between the undergraduate
   clinical learning environment and nurse perceptions of work readiness
   prior to and following, commencement as a new graduate nurse.
   Design: A pre-post follow-up study. Undergraduates were surveyed at the
   end of their Bachelor's degree (baseline) and at 8-10 weeks after
   commencement as a graduate nurse (Time 1).
   Setting: A multi-site, metropolitan private hospital in Victoria,
   Australia.
   Participants: Nursing graduates who completed a university fellowship
   program (n = 26), or were undertaking their graduate year and had
   completed placement blocks within (n = 18) or outside (n = 31) the
   healthcare organisation.
   Methods: Participants self-completed the Clinical Learning Environment
   Inventory (CLEI) and Work Readiness Scale for Graduate Nurses (WRS-GN)
   at baseline and Time 1. Multiple regression analyses were performed.
   Results: CLEI scores significantly predicted work readiness outcomes
   (all p-values < .05), accounting for 16-36\% and 17-28\% of the variance
   of WRS-GN scores at baseline and Time 1, respectively. After adjusting
   for clustering due to clinical placement groups, CLEI Individualisation
   (p = .023) and Valuing Nurses Work (p = .01) predicted improved Time 1
   WRS-GN Organisational Acumen. CLEI Innovative and Adaptive Culture
   scores predicted poorer Time 1 Organisational Acumen (p = .001).
   Conclusions: Learning environments that offered high levels of
   individualised attention and valued nurses' work appeared to facilitate
   post-graduation engagement and identification with nursing practice.
   However, highly innovative and adaptive education may detract from
   optimal work readiness. Findings revealed that while important, the
   clinical learning environment only accounted for a small-to-moderate
   degree of nursing graduates' work readiness. To facilitate robust
   evidence-based improvement of clinical nursing education, future
   research should attempt to empirically establish the value of additional
   facilitators of work readiness.}},

Title = {{Population Based Birth Prevalence of Disease-Specific Perinatal Stroke}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The first population-based estimate of the birth prevalence of the 6
   subtypes of perinatal stroke.
   BACKGROUND: Perinatal stroke encompasses multiple disease-specific
   cerebrovascular syndromes that cause lifelong neurodevelopmental
   morbidity for millions worldwide. Acute presentations include neonatal
   arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS), neonatal cerebral sinovenous
   thrombosis, and neonatal hemorrhagic stroke (NHS). Delayed presentations
   include arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke, periventricular
   venous infarction, and presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke. Our
   objective was to define the birth prevalence of all subtypes of
   perinatal stroke by using a population-based cohort. METHODS: The
   Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project is a research cohort established in
   2008 in southern Alberta, Canada, with prospective (2008-2017) and
   retrospective (1990-2008) enrollment leveraging universal health care at
   a single tertiary care pediatric center. The primary outcome was the
   estimated birth prevalence of each perinatal stroke syndrome, secondary
   outcomes were birth prevalence over time, sex ratios, and change in age
   at diagnosis. Analysis included Poisson regression, Wilcoxon rank test,
   and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The overall estimated birth prevalence
   of term-born perinatal stroke was 1:1100. The estimated birth prevalence
   was 1:3000 for NAIS, 1:7900 for arterial presumed perinatal ischemic
   stroke, 1:6000 for periventricular venous infarction, 1:9100 for
   cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, 1:6800 for NHS, and 1:65000 for presumed
   perinatal hemorrhagic stroke. The apparent birth prevalence of NAIS and
   NHS increased over time. There were more males affected than females.
   The age at diagnosis decreased for late-presenting stroke types.
   CONCLUSIONS: The estimated birth prevalence of term perinatal stroke is
   higher than previous estimates, which may be explained by
   population-based sampling of disease-specific states. This emphasizes
   the need for further studies to better understand the disease-specific
   pathophysiology to improve treatment and prevention strategies.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{749-763}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Different aspects of perfectionism have been associated with an array of
   adaptive and maladaptive cognitive, affective, and behavioural
   correlates in sport. However, relatively little is known about the links
   between athletes' perfectionistic tendencies and their state-level
   thoughts and expectancies (i.e. mindset) in the lead up to competition.
   The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between
   perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and the
   future-oriented thoughts (i.e. worries) and expectancies (i.e. optimism)
   of athletes as they prepared to compete. A sample of 144 male youth
   high-performance Canadian football players (M age = 16.41 years, SD =
   1.48) completed domain-specific measures of perfectionism,
   pre-competitive worry, and optimism 24 h prior to the start of an
   important competition. Canonical correlation (R-C) analysis produced two
   interpretable canonical functions. In the first canonical function, a
   canonical variate resembling a maladaptive profile of perfectionism
   (i.e. high strivings combined with high concerns) was positively
   correlated (R-C1 = .66) with a canonical variate consisting of high
   worry and low optimism. In the second canonical function, a canonical
   variate resembling an adaptive profile of perfectionism (i.e. high
   strivings combined with low concerns) was positively correlated (R-C2 =
   .48) with a canonical variate consisting of low worry and high optimism.
   The results highlight the importance of treating perfectionism as a
   multidimensional construct and indicate that the pre-competitive mindset
   of athletes (as reflected by the degree to which athletes worry and feel
   optimistic) appears to be associated with athletes' perfectionistic
   orientations in sport.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of the study. - To design and validate a partnership charter
   between the various stakeholders in the Lyon metropolitan area involved
   in the development of an intervention aimed to promote return to work
   after breast cancer.
   Method. - This collaborative research tool was developed as part of the
   first phase of the FASTRACS project, according to the Intervention
   Mapping protocol. A strategic committee (SOC) has been set up with the
   researchers and the four categories of stakeholders: patients and
   associations, workplace actors, health professionals and organizations,
   and institutions. Based on the verbatim exchanges between the SOC
   members, a thematic qualitative analysis of the data collected enabled
   to develop proposals, which were validated using the e-Delphi consensus
   method.
   Results. - The charter included a preamble, 9 values and 4 commitments.
   It has enabled to initiate and structure the functioning of the SOC, and
   to build the loyalty of its members. Its development has met the needs
   of the various stakeholders, in terms of mutual knowledge,
   communication, and definition of roles.
   Discussion. - The development of a partnership charter between
   researchers and stakeholders is an innovative plan in work disability
   prevention strategy. It responds to current population health
   intervention research recommendations for the development of complex
   interventions, aimed at reducing the failures of their theory and
   implementation. The definition of a written commitment has generated
   concrete and authentic involvement from the first phase of the project.
   The benefits of this charter will be studied during the next stages of
   development, implementation and evaluation of the FASTRACS project.}},

   and Lutzomyia reburra (Fairchild and Hertig), were analyzed by
   trap/habitat/month/locality/altitude, through the Poisson generalized

   Altitude, proximity to the forest, and the river were the variables that
   determine the hypervolume of the spatial distribution of relative
   abundance, where the overlap of these two species increases the risk of
   translocation and circulation of the etiological agent of leishmaniasis
   in sylvatic environments to rural-tourist-biosphere reserve areas and

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Background: According to EMPA-REG OUTCOME, trial use of empagliflozin in
   patients with a history of cardiovascular disease improves
   hospitalization for heart failure and decreases cardiovascular morbidity
   and mortality. Recent studies have shown that a prolonged T-peak to
   T-end interval on the resting electrocardiography is associated with an
   increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Tp-e/corrected QT interval
   (QTc) ratio is a reliable index of prolonged ventricular repolarization.
   Objectives: In this study, we examined the effects of sodium glucose
   co-transporters 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as an add-on therapy to metformin
   on electrocardiographic indices of ventricular repolarization.
   Methods: Electrocardiographic recordings before combination therapy
   along with three months and six months follow-up of 141 consecutive
   patients who were switched from monotherapy to combination therapy with
   two oral agents due to inadequate glycemic control were derived. QT
   interval (QT), QTc, Tp-e intervals and Tp-e/QT, Tp-e/QTc ratios were
   calculated and analyzed.
   Results: After the six month follow-up, there was a significant decrease
   in the QT interval in patients who were using SGLT2 inhibitors as an
   add-on therapy to metformin compared to other glucose-lowering agents
   (373.4 +/- 9.9 ms vs. 385.4 +/- 12.5 ms, 382.9 +/- 11.2 ms; p < 0.001
   respectively). Furthermore, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were
   significantly lower in this patient population compared to control
   groups (0.186 +/- 0.023 vs. 0.196 +/- 0.021, 0.191 +/- 0.017; p < 0.001
   and 0.174 +/- 0.021 vs. 0.199 +/- 0.022, 0.195 +/- 0.016; p < 0.001
   respectively).
   Conclusion: Our data showed that using SGLT2 inhibitors as an add-on
   therapy to metformin favorably alters ventricular repolarization indices
   in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Pages = {{106+}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of recent studies of cognitive predictors of academic
   success in preschool and primary school children is carried out. The
   main subject and methodological tendencies of the studies are revealed:
   the trend to study basic cognitive processes, multilevel interactions of
   them in the context of environmental factors, cross-domain studies, the
   widespread use of regression statistical models and structural equation
   modeling, which makes it possible to determine media and moderation
   effects, as well as the direction of connections between various
   cognitive factors and educational outcomes. The greatest predictors of
   academic success in preschool children (in particular, in mathematics
   and reading) are executive functions. They result in pedagogical
   consequences: teaching specific academic skills should be largely
   focused on the development of these particular functions. At the same
   time, it is much more difficult to rely in the forecast on the level of
   development of the preschoolers' mental processes.
   It is argued that at primary school age, the possibility to predict
   further academic success based on assessing the level of intellectual
   development and other cognitive functions of children is quite high in
   general, however, compared to preschool age, the role of personal
   factors of learning increases. The cognitive functions of younger
   students to a greater extent ``predict{''} mathematical learning
   achievement. Compared to preschoolers, forecasting based on the
   developmental level of executive functions in younger students decreases
   while the predictive power of thought processes rises up. It was found
   that the predictive power of cognitive functions changes at early age
   stages. This pattern can be explained by the heterochronous nature of
   mental development and taking into account this feature by modern
   educational systems. For teaching children at a specific age stage, the
   pedagogical technologies and teaching methods are selected that rely on
   the leading mental functions of a certain age. According to this, the
   assessment system for academic success changes naturally and ultimately
   affects the predictive power of the cognitive functions of various aged
   children.}},

Title = {{5 ` Untranslated Region Elements Show High Abundance and Great
   Variability in Homologous ABCA Subfamily Genes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The 12 members of the ABCA subfamily in humans are known for their
   ability to transport cholesterol and its derivatives, vitamins, and
   xenobiotics across biomembranes. Several ABCA genes are causatively
   linked to inborn diseases, and the role in cancer progression and
   metastasis is studied intensively. The regulation of translation
   initiation is implicated as the major mechanism in the processes of
   post-transcriptional modifications determining final protein levels. In
   the current bioinformatics study, we mapped the features of the 5 `
   untranslated regions (5 ` UTR) known to have the potential to regulate
   translation, such as the length of 5 ` UTRs, upstream ATG codons,
   upstream open-reading frames, introns, RNA G-quadruplex-forming
   sequences, stem loops, and Kozak consensus motifs, in the DNA sequences
   of all members of the subfamily. Subsequently, the conservation of the
   features, correlations among them, ribosome profiling data as well as
   protein levels in normal human tissues were examined. The 5 ` UTRs of
   ABCA genes contain above-average numbers of upstream ATGs, open-reading
   frames and introns, as well as conserved ones, and these elements
   probably play important biological roles in this subfamily, unlike RG4s.
   Although we found significant correlations among the features, we did
   not find any correlation between the numbers of 5 ` UTR features and
   protein tissue distribution and expression scores. We showed the
   existence of single nucleotide variants in relation to the 5 ` UTR
   features experimentally in a cohort of 105 breast cancer patients. 5 `
   UTR features presumably prepare a complex playground, in which the other
   elements such as RNA binding proteins and non-coding RNAs play the major
   role in the fine-tuning of protein expression.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating correspondence between two shapes continues to be a
   challenging problem in geometry processing. Most current methods assume
   deformation to be near-isometric, however this is often not the case.
   For this paper, a collection of shapes of different animals has been
   curated, where parts of the animals (e.g., mouths, tails \& ears)
   correspond yet are naturally non-isometric. Ground-truth correspondences
   were established by asking three specialists to independently label
   corresponding points on each of the models with respect to a previously
   labelled reference model. We employ an algorithmic strategy to select a
   single point for each correspondence that is representative of the
   proposed labels. A novel technique that characterises the sparsity and
   distribution of correspondences is employed to measure the performance
   of ten shape correspondence methods. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Predicting stock market (SM) trends is an issue of great interest among
   researchers, investors and traders since the successful prediction of
   SMs' direction may promise various benefits. Because of the fairly
   nonlinear nature of the historical data, accurate estimation of the SM
   direction is a rather challenging issue. The aim of this study is to
   present a novel machine learning (ML) model to forecast the movement of
   the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 index. Modeling was performed by
   multilayer perceptron-genetic algorithms (MLP-GA) and multilayer
   perceptron-particle swarm optimization (MLP-PSO) in two scenarios
   considering Tanh (x) and the default Gaussian function as the output
   function. The historical financial time series data utilized in this
   research is from 1996 to 2020, consisting of nine technical indicators.
   Results are assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
   Percentage Error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient values to compare
   the accuracy and performance of the developed models. Based on the
   results, the involvement of the Tanh (x) as the output function,
   improved the accuracy of models compared with the default Gaussian
   function, significantly. MLP-PSO with population size 125, followed by
   MLP-GA with population size 50, provided higher accuracy for testing,
   reporting RMSE of 0.732583 and 0.733063, MAPE of 28.16\%, 29.09\% and
   correlation coefficient of 0.694 and 0.695, respectively. According to
   the results, using the hybrid ML method could successfully improve the
   prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The share of the foreign-born population in member countries of the OECD
   is increasing, and this article summarizes economics research on the
   effects of immigration in those nations. Four broad topics are
   addressed: labour market issues, fiscal questions, the political economy
   of immigration, and productivity and international trade. Extreme
   concerns about deleterious labour market and fiscal impacts following
   from new immigrants are not found to be warranted. However, it is also
   clear that government policies and practices regarding the selection and
   integration of new migrants affect labour market, fiscal, social and
   cultural outcomes. Policies that are well informed, well crafted and
   well executed beneficially improve population welfare.
   Resume Une introduction a l'economie de l'immigration dans les pays de
   l'OCDE. Les immigrants representent une part croissante de la population
   des pays de l'Organisation de cooperation et de developpement

   portant sur les effets de l'immigration dans ces pays. Quatre
   thematiques sont abordees: le marche de travail, la fiscalite,
   l'economie politique, et la productivite et le commerce international.
   Les grandes preoccupations concernant les effets nefastes de l'arrivee
   de nouveaux migrants sur le marche du travail et les incidences fiscales
   ne sont pas justifiees. Au contraire, il est clair que les politiques et
   pratiques gouvernementales en matiere de selection et d'integration des
   nouveaux migrants ont une incidence sur le niveau de reussite des
   nouveaux arrivants au marche du travail et financiere ainsi que sur leur
   integration culturelle et sociale. Des politiques eclairees, bien

Title = {{Taking the Leap Toward Cost-Conscious Education in Obstetrics and

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Residents have a professional obligation with respect to the
   stewardship of health care resources, yet there is a paucity of research
   on how to improve residents' cost-awareness. Rising health care
   expenditures highlight a critical need to improve education related to
   this competency. This study aimed to test if an educational module can
   teach residents to make cost-conscious decisions and reduce health care
   spending.
   Methods: All Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residents in 2017 were
   eligible to participate in this randomized controlled trial. The study
   was administered online via REDCap. Interested residents were enrolled,
   stratified by level of training, and block randomized. Residents
   completed a survey to determine their management of 4 obstetrical
   scenarios. The intervention group reviewed an educational module on
   cost-effective ordering prior to completing the survey; the control
   group was given the option to review the module afterward. The primary
   outcome was mean total expenditures, compared between the 2 groups using
   the t test.
   Results: Eighty-five residents were enrolled between August and November
   2017, and 63 residents from 13 Canadian residency programs completed the
   study requirements (33 control and 30 intervention). Mean total
   expenditure was CAD\$291.03 (95\% CI 259.38-322.68) versus CAD\$192.98
   (95\% CI 170.67-215.29) for the control and intervention groups,
   respectively. These figures corresponded to a 33.69\% or CAD\$98.05
   reduction in total expenditures (P = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This educational module decreased expenditures by Canadian
   obstetrics and gynaecology residents managing hypothetical obstetrical
   cases. This introduces a potential curriculum innovation to improve
   resident education in judicious use of health care resources. (C) 2020

Title = {{Consciousness and the rabbit holes of delirium}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL HYPOTHESES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{144}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Delirium is a common disorder in hospitalized older adults and the
   defining characteristic is a disturbance of consciousness.
   Unfortunately, there are currently no testable measures of consciousness
   as pertains to its disruption in delirium. Not surprisingly rates of
   recognition of delirium suffer. Arguably, a greater understanding of the
   quantum of consciousness may improve delirium diagnosis through better
   diagnostic tools. Candidate dimensions of consciousness derived from
   fields of psychology, psychiatry, and philosophy are discussed and
   relevance to delirium explored. Based upon existing literature in the
   field of consciousness we identify the pre-reflective state,
   experiential awareness, and functional networks as candidate sites that
   may be affected in delirium. Opportunities for clinical instrument
   development and how these tools can be tested are discussed. We conclude
   that consciousness content may not hold to a unitary measurement, but
   facets of its integrity that are impacted in delirium are open to
   further exploration. Disorders in pre-reflective status, experiential
   awareness, and functional networks may represent the measurable ``rabbit
   holes{''} of consciousness disturbance.}},

Title = {{Exposure to environmental chemical mixtures is associated with nasal
   colonization by Staphylococcus aureus: NHANES 2001-2004}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{190}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the health effects of exposure to chemical
   mixtures is critically important given the broad range of concurrent
   exposures throughout the life-course. While investigations of
   environmental chemicals and components of the human microbiome are
   becoming more common, few have examined associations with chemical
   mixtures. This study assesses the association between exposure to
   mixtures of 66 different environmental chemicals and nasal colonization
   of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin resistant SA (MRSA).
   Methods: Data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (NHANES) 2001-2004. The analytical sample consists of 10,312
   participants, age 6 years and older, subdivided into 8 groups with
   different chemical exposure mixtures. Within each of 6 chemical classes
   (metals, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polyfluorochemicals (PFCs), and
   phenols), weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was used to analyze the
   joint association of the component compounds and nasal SA colonization.
   WQS was also used to assess the joint association of 3 chemical mixtures
   (metals, metal and PAHs, and metal and triclosan) and nasal MRSA
   colonization. All regression models were adjusted for confounders.
   Results: The analytical sample was between ages 6-85, slightly more
   female, and predominantly non-smokers. Prevalence of SA carriage was
   29.2\%, and MRSA colonization prevalence was 1.2\%. Within each chemical
   class, odds of SA colonization increased statistically significantly
   with exposure to mixtures of metals (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.20),
   phthalates (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.14), and phenols (OR = 1.08,
   95\% CI = 1.01-1.15). Exposure to a mixture of metals combined with PAHs
   was also associated with increased odds of MRSA carriage (OR = 1.38,
   95\% CI = 1.02-1.86).
   Conclusion: Results indicate an association between multiple
   environmental chemical mixtures and SA colonization, including MRSA.
   These findings support the need for further analysis of associations
   between chemical mixtures and SA colonization, as well as other
   components of the human microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Moyamoya disease is a chronic but progressive obliterative
   cerebrovascular disease of bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICAs)
   causing hemorrhagic or ischemic cerebral strokes. Surgical
   revascularization has the potential for resolving the capillary vessels,
   but the effect on the occlusive ICA and the moyamoya vessels after a
   direct bypass remains unclear. Patient: A 2-year-old girl with a history
   of repeated transient ischemic attacks and direct bypasses but
   demonstrating improvement and associated anomaly is reported. A year and
   a half later, after a bilateral revascularization, an intracerebral
   capsulized hematoma growth was identified, and it was removed
   surgically. Neovascularization including many microvessels similar to
   capillary telangiectasia were identified by pathological investigation
   despite the reduction of moyamoya vessels on the repeated angiograms
   after the revascularization surgeries. In the present case,
   proliferation of capillary vessels was clearly confirmed by direct
   bypasses. Conclusion: There is no doubt that direct bypasses prevent
   further ischemic stroke by improving cerebral blood flow. However, they
   may result in failure in reducing the load of moyamoya vessels, albeit
   decreasing the potential risk of hemorrhagic strokes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of electricity consumption and
   generation on carbon emissions in 25 African countries for the 1980-2016
   period. Specifically, it examines the effects of diverse electricity
   sources (e.g. hydro, oil, natural gas, coal) and renewable electricity
   output on carbon emissions. It employs estimation techniques that are
   appropriate for cointegrated panels such as Dynamic Ordinary Least
   Squares (DOLS), Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and
   Augmented Mean Group (AMG). The panel cointegration tests reveal a
   cointegration relationship between the variables. The estimation results
   show that electricity consumption has a detrimental effect on carbon
   emissions, while renewable electricity output mitigates carbon emissions
   in African countries. Moreover, electricity generation from oil, natural
   gas and coal have detrimental effects on carbon emissions while
   electricity generation from hydro alleviates carbon emissions. This
   implies that electricity consumption and generation are significant
   determinants of carbon emissions in African countries, hence efforts to
   abate carbon emissions should incorporate them in order to achieve
   sustainable development. (C) 2020 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) graph is a popular and powerful data
   structure that is used in various areas of Data Science, but the high
   computational cost of obtaining it hinders its use on large datasets.
   Approximate solutions have been described in the literature using
   diverse techniques, among which Locality-sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a
   promising alternative that still has unsolved problems. We present
   Variable Resolution Locality-sensitive Hashing, an algorithm that
   addresses these problems to obtain an approximate kNN graph at a
   significantly reduced computational cost. Its usability is greatly
   enhanced by its capacity to automatically find adequate hyperparameter
   values, a common hindrance to LSH-based methods. Moreover, we provide an
   implementation in the distributed computing framework Apache Spark that
   takes advantage of the structure of the algorithm to efficiently
   distribute the computational load across multiple machines, enabling
   practitioners to apply this solution to very large datasets.
   Experimental results show that our method offers significant
   improvements over the state-of-the-art in the field and shows very good
   scalability as more machines are added to the computation.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines how recently graduated journeymen, vocational
   teachers, and workplace trainers view the integration between learning
   at school and at work in a dual vocational education and training (VET)
   system, and how these views might be influenced by the duration and the
   sequencing of school- and work-based learning periods. Research
   indicates that effective implementation of the dual VET system is
   contingent upon successful integration of learning experience at the two
   venues. Recent graduates, workplace trainers, and teachers in all 51
   certified trades answered an electronic questionnaire (667 participants,
   response rate 24\%). Factor analysis of responses to 22 statements
   resulted in the identification of five factors. Findings show that the
   learning venues were parallel rather than integrated. Communication and
   collaboration between teachers and workplace trainers were limited and
   recent graduates, in particular, did not experience the program as a
   coherent whole. The results also showed important variations in the
   perspectives of the three groups of participants. The duration of the
   workplace learning period was not found to be associated with
   perceptions of program integration. Some limited effects of sequencing
   were found, but no clear pattern emerged. This study adds to knowledge
   on learning and integration, and indicates possible ways of improving
   program coherence and integration in a dual VET system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of a
   pharmacist-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) intervention for
   diabetes medication adherence; the secondary objectives were to assess
   the changes in clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life
   (HRQoL).
   Methods: A quasi-experimental intervention study was conducted with
   baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up data collections. The study
   duration was 6 months. Pharmacists trained in MI delivered 3
   face-to-face encounters using MI-based semistructured conversation tools
   to address barriers or challenges to medication adherence. A diabetes
   worksite wellness program (WWP) at a 350-bed regional hospital in the
   southeastern United States was the setting, and the study participants
   were WWP employees or dependents (with type 1 diabetes or type 2
   diabetes). The primary outcome was a change in self-reported diabetes
   medication adherence; the secondary outcomes included the changes in
   clinical indicators (glycated hemoglobin {[}HbA1c], blood pressure, and
   depressive symptoms), and HRQoL. The measures included the Medometer,
   Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities-Medication Subscale (SDSCA-MS),
   Audit of Diabetes-Dependent QoL (ADDQoL-19), and the Short Form-12
   (SF-12) health survey.
   Results: Fifty-three WWP participants enrolled, and 36 completed the
   full intervention protocol. Medication adherence (through the Medometer)
   demonstrated statistically significant improvement after the
   intervention (P = 0.010); the SDSCA-MS score improved, but was not
   statistically significant. The change in diastolic blood pressure was
   statistically significant (P = 0.034), but the changes in HbA1c,
   systolic blood pressure, presence of depressive symptoms, and ADDQoL-19
   were not statistically significant. The SF-12 physical component summary
   (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were statistically
   significant: PCS, P = 0.003, and MCS, P = 0.025.
   Conclusion: The findings from this pilot study support the effectiveness
   of a pharmacist-delivered, semistructured MI-based intervention for
   medication adherence in persons with diabetes in a hospital-based WWP.
   Pharmacists can support patients' behavior change using MI communication
   skills to explore salient barriers to medication adherence and to
   facilitate goal setting to overcome these in encounters aimed at shared
   clinical and behavioral decision-making. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The first-principle calculations combined with the full-potential
   linearized augmented plane wave method with the help of density
   functional theory (DFT) implemented in WIEN2k within the
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof of generalized gradient approximations (GGA-PBE),
   LSDA, GGA+U (local spin density approximation (LSDA)+U) are used to
   investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of
   full-Heusler alloy Co2CrAl. We add the parameter, ``U{''} to GGA and
   LSDA approximations to improve certain physical parameters. We found
   that the structure Fm-3m is stable and we also determined the parameters
   of the equilibrium lattice using the optimizing method. The lattice
   constant, bulk modulo, energy gap, spin polarization and density of have
   been calculated. The LSDA, LSDA+U, GGA and GGA+U approximations are used
   to calculate the density of state and band structure analysis together
   with spin magnetic moments. It is found that Co2CrAl has a half metallic
   character for a wide range of lattice parameters. The exchange energy
   calculated confirms that the ground state ferromagnetic (FM) is more
   stable than the non-magnetic (NM) states of L2(1) phase. The magnetic
   moment of Co and Cr is obtained in Co2CrAl using LSDA+U and GGA+U
   approaches. The thermal magnetization, magnetic entropy change,
   adiabatic temperature change and relative cooling power are obtained via
   Monte Carlo simulation using the value of exchange couplings found by Ab
   initio calculations. The curie temperature has been established. The
   half metallic is one of the key properties of magnetic materials for the
   application of spintronics devices and magnetic refrigeration.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, three types of metal ions with different oxidation
   state as mercury(II) , cerium(III) thorium(IV) have been reacted with
   captopril drug (CAP). The isolated solid complexes were explained using
   elemental analysis, conductance measurements, infrared and H-1-NMR
   spectroscopy as well as the thermo gravimetric (TG/DTG) analysis. The
   micro analytical and spectroscopic results for all CAP complexes were
   agreement with the speculated structures. The stoichiometry for divalent
   Hg2+, trivalent Ce3+ and tetravalent Th4+ metal ions with CAP ligand was
   established with 1 : 2 (Mn+ : CAP) molar ratio. The qualitative analysis
   showed that in case of the mercury(II) complex, the chloride ions didn't
   involved in the complexity, suggesting formula {[}Hg(CAP)(2)] in neutral
   form. However, regarding both Ce(III) and Th(IV) complexes as {[}Ce
   (CAP)(2)(NO3)]center dot 3H(2)O and {[}Th(CAP)(2)(NO3)(2)( H2O)]center
   dot 3H(2)O formulas, the nitrate group is existed inside the
   coordination sphere. The infrared analysis data proved that CAP drug act
   as a bidentate ligand with the metal ions of Ce(III) and Th(IV) through
   oxygen carbonyl group C=O and oxygen of the deprotonated carboxylic COOH
   group, while for the Hg(II) complex, the CAP acts as a bidentate ligand
   through oxygen of C=O group and sulfur atom of the deprotonated -SH
   group. Thorium(VI) complex has a nine-coordinate geometry, while Hg(II)
   and Ce(III) have a four and six-coordination behaviors respectively. The
   H-1-NMR data of the CAP compound has a singlet sharp signal at 1. 90 ppm
   due to the proton of -SH group, this peak absent in the spectrum of the
   Hg(II) CAP complex upon the deprotonated of thiol group.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To study the clinical phenotypes, determined based on
   cumulative disease activity manifestations, and sociodemographic factors
   associated with depression and anxiety in SLE.
   Methods. Patients attending a single centre were assessed for depression
   and anxiety. SLE clinical phenotypes were based on the organ systems of
   cumulative 10-year SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), prior to
   visit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses for depression,
   anxiety, and coexisting anxiety and depression were performed to study
   associated SLE clinical phenotypes and other factors.
   Results. Among 341 patients, the prevalence of anxiety and depression
   was 34\% and 27\%, respectively, while 21\% had coexisting anxiety and
   depression. Patients with skin involvement had significantly higher
   likelihood of anxiety compared with patients with no skin involvement
   {[}adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.0]. Patients with
   skin involvement also had higher likelihood of having coexisting anxiety
   and depression (aOR =2.0, 95\% CI: 1.2, 3.9). Patients with
   musculoskeletal (MSK) (aOR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.5) and skin system
   (aOR = 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.04, 3.2) involvement had higher likelihood of
   depression compared with patients without skin or musculoskeletal
   involvement. Employment status and fibromyalgia at the time of the
   visit, and inception status were significantly associated with anxiety,
   depression, and coexisting anxiety and depression, respectively.
   Conclusion. SLE clinical phenotypes, specifically skin or MSK systems,
   along with fibromyalgia, employment and shorter disease duration were
   associated with anxiety or depression. Routine patient screening,
   especially among patients with shorter disease duration, for these
   associations may facilitate the diagnosis of these mental health
   disorders, and allow for more timely diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{This research proposes a procedure to retrofit existing structures using
   self-centring post-tensioned precast concrete (SC-PC) frames. The
   procedure utilises the initial stiffness of the un-retrofitted structure
   and predicts the required initial stiffness of the retrofitted one using
   the N2 method. A modified precast beam-end shape is proposed to double
   the re-centring moment capacity of the retrofit frame at the beam-column
   interface. Different retrofit cases for two-and three-dimensional
   structures utilising the proposed and conventional PC beams are
   investigated. The results of the proposed procedure are verified through
   non-linear time history analysis using two different sets of earthquake
   records compatible with the design-level response spectrum. The study
   results reveal that the SC-PC retrofit frames are quite effective in
   controlling the earthquake-induced storey drift of the retrofitted
   structures while eliminating the residual storey drift. The results also
   indicate the effectiveness of the proposed beam shape in mitigating the
   inter-storey drift demand of the analysis model structures.}},

Title = {{MemSZ: Squeezing Memory Traffic with Lossy Compression}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article describes Memory Squeeze (MemSZ), a new approach for lossy
   general-purpose memory compression. MemSZ introduces a low latency,
   parallel design of the Squeeze (SZ) algorithm offering aggressive
   compression ratios, up to 16:1 in our implementation. Our compressor is
   placed between the memory controller and the cache hierarchy of a
   processor to reduce the memory traffic of applications that tolerate
   approximations in parts of their data. Thereby, the available off-chip
   bandwidth is utilized more efficiently improving system performance and
   energy efficiency. Two alternative multi-core variants of the MemSZ
   system are described. The first variant has a shared last-level cache
   (LLC) on the processor-die, which is modified to store both compressed
   and uncompressed data. The second has a 3D-stacked DRAM cache with
   larger cache lines that match the granularity of the compressed memory
   blocks and stores only uncompressed data. For applications that tolerate
   aggressive approximation in large fractions of their data, MemSZ reduces
   baseline memory traffic by up to 81\%, execution time by up to 62\%, and
   energy costs by up to 25\% introducing up to 1.8\% error to the
   application output. Compared to the current state-of-the-art lossy
   memory compression design, MemSZ improves the execution time, energy,
   and memory traffic by up to 15\%, 9\%, and 64\%, respectively.}},

Title = {{A novel sustainable approach for the extraction of value-added compounds
   from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. calyces by natural deep eutectic solvents}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is widely acknowledged as an important source of
   value-added compounds as natural pigments and bioactive compounds whose
   isolation is of great interest in food industry. Due to the incessant
   demand of green extraction procedures, NADESs have emerged in the last
   years as new green solvents alternative to the conventional organic
   ones. The feasibility of NADESs for the extraction of value-added
   compounds of H. sabdariffa has been assessed in this work for the first
   time. An extraction technique based on microwave assisted extraction
   (MAE) and the use of NADESs was proposed testing different deep eutectic
   solvents based on choline chloride (ChCl). Among them, oxalic acid based
   NADES exhibited a great selectivity for anthocyanins in particular as
   well as higher extraction yields of bioactive compounds was also
   observed, even greater than those observed by methanol. The effect of
   extraction variables such as liquid-solid ratio, temperature and water
   percentage were studied by Box-Behnken design and a response surface
   methodology. The statistical program pointed out the liquid-solid ratio
   of 1:30 mL mg(-1), temperature of 75 degrees C and a water percentage of
   55\% as the conditions to maximize extraction within the experimental
   domain. Hence, NADES composed by oxalic acid and choline chloride
   resulted to be an effective green alternative tailor-made solvent to
   carry out selective extractions of value-added compounds from H.
   sabdariffa.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Calciphylaxis is a condition which involves ectopic
   deposition of calcium in arterioles of various organ systems. Here, we
   present a rare case of mammographic calcifications in a patient on
   long-standing renal dialysis. Case: This is a 57-year-old female who
   presented to breast clinic with unilateral severe pain and lumpiness of
   her breast. On mammography, calcifications were identified which were
   associated with focal lesions on ultrasound. An image-guided core biopsy
   showed numerous foci of histological calcification within a large area
   of fat necrosis. The location within arterioles was confirmed by CD31
   immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis of fat necrosis with benign
   calcifications due to mammary calciphylaxis was made. Conclusion: The
   hallmark of calciphylaxis is the deposition of calcium within small- to
   medium-sized vessel walls. This leads to ischaemia and necrosis of
   tissue. In the breast, only a few cases were reported in which patients
   presented with a necrotic lesion resembling carcinoma. These are
   reviewed in this report.}},

Journal = {{PHARMACEUTICALS}},

Abstract = {{Targeting of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has emerged as a powerful tool for
   therapeutic intervention because the overexpression of this enzyme is
   synonymous with inflammation, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Herein, a new series of 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases scaffold with aryl
   and heteroaryl systems 9a-12d were designed, synthesized, structurally
   elucidated, and biologically evaluated as a potent COX-2 blocker. The
   rationale beyond the current study is to increase the molecule bulkiness
   allowing a selective binding to the unique hydrophobic pocket of COX-2.
   Among the triazole-thiazole hybrids, the one with the para-methoxy
   moiety linked to a phenyl ring 12d showed the highest In vitro
   selectivity by COX-2 inhibition assay (IC50 of 0.04 mu M) and in situ
   anti-inflammatory activity when evaluated using the protein denaturation
   assay (IC50 of 0.88 mu M) in comparison with commercially available
   selective COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib (IC50 of 0.05 mu M). Towards the
   COX-2 selectivity, ligand-based three dimensional quantitative
   structures activity relationship (3D-QSAR) employing atomic-based and
   field-based approaches were performed and resulted in the necessity of
   triazole and thiazole/oxazole scaffolds for COX-2 blocking. Furthermore,
   the molecular modeling study indicated a high selectivity and promising
   affinity of our prepared compounds to COX-2, especially the hydrophobic
   pocket and the mouth of the active site holding hydrogen-bonding,
   hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. In Silico absorption,
   delivery, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) predictions showed that all
   the pharmacokinetic and physicochemical features are within the
   appropriate range for human use.}},

Abstract = {{Availability Rules for Web Content are part of a succession of
   guidelines published by the World Wide Web Association for Availability
   Access. It consists of a set of guidelines on making web content
   accessible, primarily for disabled web users, but also for all web
   users, and also for making it easier for any web browser to display the
   contents of web pages, and also for improving the display of web content
   on mobile phones. Many laws have been issued in many countries on the
   basis of rules for web content in the name of availability. Therefore,
   this research aims to demonstrate the phenomenon of repetition in the
   Qur'anic story and its artistic impact, as well as its availability on
   Internet sites, and that this repetition requires the intended meaning
   and contributes directly to crystallizing the Qur'anic connotation. It
   has a meaning, especially in the methods of Quranic storytelling, and
   the importance of the research is highlighted in that it clarifies this
   phenomenon in great detail as one of the phenomena of the Arabic
   language, one of its original rules, and its technical impact,
   especially in the Qur'anic stories, and how it is not inserted into a
   verse and its Surahs, and it has a direct relationship with the intended
   meaning It is closely linked to the Qur'anic Surahs in which the Qur'an
   story is mentioned. In this research the descriptive and analytical
   approach, which means describing the phenomenon in a precise description
   and then analyzing it with a technical analysis, and explaining its
   impact on highlighting and crystallizing the meaning, and one of the
   most important results of the research: that this phenomenon One of the
   phenomena of the authentic Arabic language, and His wisdom, may He be
   glorified and exalted be He, wanted the Qur'an to be Arabic. In the
   Qur'an there is nothing in the language, on top of which is the
   phenomenon of repetition that repetition in scenes of Qur'anic
   storytelling was a necessity The contexts of the verses, the difference
   in the angle of vision, and the different intended meaning of the
   narrative scene, so that it is repeated, and every time it adds a new
   meaning, the repetition of the story confirms the belief in the hearts
   of the followers, deters criminals, consoles the oppressed, gives hope
   to the faithful, and insists on any matter of repetition that
   establishes it in the souls And give him a strong warning.}},

Abstract = {{Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection with an extremely high morbidity
   and mortality. Data on the burden of the disease in the Arab world is
   lacking. The aim of this study is to highlight the incidence and outcome
   of this infection in a tertiary care center in the Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia (KSA).
   In this retrospective study we included all mucormycosis cases admitted
   to our center between January 2013 and December 2019. A total of 18
   proven patients with a median age of 43.5 years (range 13-72 years, 72\%
   males) were identified. The most common presentation was cutaneous and
   rhino-orbitocerebral, followed by gastrointestinal mucormycosis.
   Apophysomyces variabilisRhizopus oryzae) were the main fungal isolates
   on molecular testing.
   Trauma was the chief underlying etiology (41.0\%) with motor vehicle
   accident (MVCs) being the predominant type (43.0\%). For this reason,
   most of our patients were young with cutaneous disease and had a better
   prognosis.
   All patients received liposomal amphotericin B alone or in combination
   with other antifungal agents. Repeated aggressive debridement and
   reversal of the underlying factor was attempted in all patients. This
   underscores the lower mortality (27.8\%) seen in this group.
   The diagnosis of Mucorales infection is challenging. A high index of
   suspicion with prompt treatment is required to improve the high
   mortality of this aggressive disease. Further studies are needed to
   understand the epidemiology and outcome of this disease in Saudi Arabia.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Biophilic design is a popular form of sustainable building design
   because of its potential to contribute to human health and wellbeing.
   While many design processes are now mediated by computer technologies
   such as immersive virtual environments (IVEs), the reliability of IVEs
   to create the same benefits of biophilic designs as in-situ is yet to be
   determined. To this end, we conducted a comparative study to measure
   participants' mood, cognitive performance, and stress level in in-situ
   and IVE experiment settings. A within-subject experimental design with
   thirty-five college students was applied to both in-situ and IVE
   experiments. The positive and negative scale (PANAS), visual working
   memory performance, and the sympathetic nervous system index and
   parasympathetic nervous system index were used as measures for mood,
   cognitive performance, and stress level of a participant, respectively.
   We found that natural element exposure in IVEs reduced negative mood in
   the same way as natural element exposure in-situ. However, we did not
   find the same for positive affect, visual working memory, and stress
   level tests. Factors such as the experimental procedure, exposure time
   to nature in both in-situ and IVE settings, and characteristics of
   participants may contribute to the results. Future research is needed to
   further investigate the impact of such factors and develop reliable
   experimental protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of a three-media refrigerant/phase change material
   (PCM)/water heat exchanger (RPW-HEX) in the hot superheated section of a
   heat pump (HP) system is a promising approach to save energy for
   domestic hot water (DHW) generation in multi-family houses. The RPW-HEX
   works as a desuperheater and as a latent thermal energy storage in the
   system. The latent thermal energy storage is charged during heating and
   cooling operation and discharged for DHW production. For this purpose,
   the water side of the RPW-HEX is connected to decentralized DHW storage
   devices. DHW consumption, building standards and climate, energy prices,
   material costs, and production costs are the constraints for the
   selection of the optimal storage size and RPW-HEX design. This
   contribution presents the techno-economic analysis of the RPW-HEX
   integrated into an R32 air source HP. With the aid of experimentally
   validated dynamic computer models, the optimal sizing of the RPW-HEX
   storage is discussed to maximize energy savings and to minimize the
   investment costs. The results are discussed in the context of a return
   of investment analysis, practical implementation aspects and energetic
   potential of the novel technology.}},

Title = {{Impacts of platinum-based chemotherapy on subsequent testicular function
   and fertility in boys with cancer}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{874-885}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Children with cancer often face infertility as a long-term
   complication of their treatment. For boys, compromised testicular
   function is common after chemotherapy and currently there are no
   well-established options to prevent this damage. Platinum-based agents
   are used to treat a wide variety of childhood cancers. However, platinum
   agents are not currently included in the cyclophosphamide equivalent
   dose (CED), which is used clinically to assess the risks to fertility
   posed by combination chemotherapy in children with cancer.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This was a systematic search of the literature
   designed to determine the evidence for effects of platinum-based cancer
   treatment on the prepubertal human testis in relation to subsequent
   testicular function and fertility.
   SEARCH METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for articles published
   in English between 01 January 1966 and 05 April 2020 using search terms
   including `cancer treatment', `chemotherapy', `human', `prepubertal',
   `testis', `germ cells', `testosterone' and related terms. Abstracts were
   screened and full-text articles were obtained for those that met the
   three major inclusion criteria (age <= 12 years at treatment, exposure
   to platinum-based chemotherapeutic and measure of reproductive
   function). Screening of bibliographies for full-text articles was used
   to identify additional studies.
   OUTCOMES: Our initial search identified 1449 articles of which 20
   (1.3\%) studies (n = 13 759 males) met all inclusion criteria. A control
   group (healthy individuals or siblings) was included for 5/20 (25\%)
   studies. A total of 10/20 (50\%) studies provided sub-analysis of the
   relative gonadotoxicity of platinum-based agents.
   The primary outcome measures were: pregnancies and father-hood; semen
   analysis; and hormonal function. For pregnancies and fatherhood, three
   studies (n = 10 453 males) reported negative associations with
   platinum-agents, including the largest (n = 5640) controlled study
   (hazard ratio = 0.56, P= 0.0023), whilst two other studies (n= 1781)
   with platinum sub-analysis reported no association. For semen analysis
   (based on World Health Organization criteria), platinum-based
   chemotherapy was associated with azoospermia in one study (n = 129),
   whilst another (n = 44) found no association and the remainder did not
   perform platinum-based sub-analysis. For hormone analysis, conflicting
   results were obtained regarding potential associations between
   platinum-based agents and elevated FSH (a proxy for impaired
   spermatogenesis); however, the majority of these studies were based on
   low numbers of patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Overall, these results indicate that platinum-based
   chemotherapy should be included in clinical calculators, for example
   CED, used to determine gonadotoxicity for childhood cancer treatment.
   These findings have important implications for clinicians regarding
   counselling patients and their carer(s) on fertility risk, guiding
   requirements for fertility preservation strategies (e.g. testicular
   tissue cryopreservation) and modification of treatments to reduce or
   eliminate the risk of infertility in childhood cancer survivors.}},

Abstract = {{Background. This study was performed to develop and validate a cardiac
   surgical intensive care risk adjustment model for mixed cardiac surgery
   based on a few preoperative laboratory tests, extracorporeal circulation
   time, and measurements at arrival to the intensive care unit.
   Methods. This was a retrospective study of admissions to 5 cardiac
   surgical intensive care units in Sweden that submitted data to the
   Swedish Intensive Care Registry. Admissions from 2008 to 2014 (n =
   21,450) were used for model development, whereas admissions from 2015 to
   2016 (n = 6463) were used for validation. Models were built using
   logistic regression with transformation of raw values or categorization
   into groups.
   Results. The final model showed good performance, with an area under the
   receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 (95\% confidence
   interval, 0.83-0.89), a Cox calibration intercept of -0.16 (95\%
   confidence interval, -0.47 to 0.19), and a slope of 1.01 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.89-1.13) in the validation cohort.
   Conclusions. Eleven variables available on admission to the intensive
   care unit can be used to predict 30-day mortality after cardiac surgery.
   The model performance was better than those of general intensive care
   risk adjustment models used in cardiac surgical intensive care and also
   avoided the subjective assessment of the cause of admission. The
   standardized mortality ratio improves over time in Swedish cardiac
   surgical intensive care. (C) 2020 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Title = {{Deep learning diffusion by infusion into preexisting technologies -
   Implications for users and society at large}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{63}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of Deep Learning (DL)
   technology has diffused in the consumer domain in a unique way as
   compared to previous general-purpose technologies. DL has often spread
   by infusion, i.e., by being added to preexisting technologies that are
   already in use. We find that DL-algorithms for recommendations or
   ranking have been infused into all the 15 most popular mobile
   applications (apps) in the U.S. (as of May 2019). DL-infusion enables
   fast and vast diffusion. For example, when a DL-system was infused into
   YouTube, it almost immediately reached a third of the world's
   population. We argue that existing theories of innovation diffusion and
   adoption have limited relevance for DL-infusion, because it is a process
   that is driven by enterprises rather than individuals. We also discuss
   its social and ethical implications. First, consumers have a limited
   ability to detect and evaluate an infused technology. DL-infusion may
   thus help to explain why AI's presence in society has not been
   challenged by many. Second, the DL-providers are likely to face
   conflicts of interest, since consumer and supplier goals are not always
   aligned. Third, infusion is likely to be a particularly important
   diffusion process for DL-technologies as compared to other innovations,
   because they need large data sets to function well, which can be drawn
   from preexisting users. Related, it seems that larger technology
   companies comparatively benefit more from DL-infusion, because they
   already have many users. This suggests that the value drawn from DL is
   likely to follow a Matthew Effect of accumulated advantage online: many
   preexisting users provide a lot of behavioral data, which bring about
   better DL-driven features, which attract even more users, etc. Such a
   self-reinforcing process could limit the possibilities for new companies
   to compete. This way, the notion of DL-infusion may put light on the
   power shift that comes with the presence of AI in society.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the specific mechanisms that contribute
   to formalizing the rhetorical interpretation of interrogative sentences
   throughout the history of Spanish. To this end, data from a corpus of
   biblical translations from the 13th to the 20th centuries are analyzed.
   As Biblical Hebrew and Latin use explicit elements to signal direct
   polar questions, it is relatively easy to locate a large number of
   passages with interrogative sentences, and then, examine the
   distribution of the translation equivalents used in the Spanish
   versions. The interrogative particles of Hebrew and Latin thus
   articulate a grammaticalized procedural meaning for which Spanish does
   not have an equivalent explicit marker. The systematic examination of
   the strategies that Spanish translators use to adapt these structures to
   their vernacular is therefore a way of accessing the intuitions of
   speakers from different periods in the history of Spanish in regard to
   the formulation of the rhetorical interrogative.}},

Abstract = {{Oil field management is gaining significant importance with CO2
   injection. The application of a completion strategy and utilization of
   appropriate downhole equipment is a vital aspect of a prolific producing
   well. In recent applications, another aspect that has been gaining
   attention is an intelligent completion system. This study investigates
   the details of oil recovery utilizing horizontal wells with intelligent
   completion modeled in a professional reservoir simulation package. Three
   different patterns with varying geometries formed of a certain number of
   clusters are designed from a drilling completion perspective, and a
   reservoir simulation is conducted to investigate the influence of
   intelligent completions. Results reveal that oil recovery factors were
   improved in horizontal wells with CO2 injection. Implementation of
   intelligent completion scenarios resulted in preventing increased CO2
   velocity ranges in the middle parts of the horizontal wells, and in
   increasing recovery factors. It was observed that the beginning of CO2
   production was synchronized with rapid alteration in injection pressures
   and production rates. The findings showed that well configurations with
   lower cross-sectional pattern areas required earlier CO2 injection and
   hence, greater recovery factors in the early stages of the reservoir
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Background Hematological parameters like red cell distribution width
   (RDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV) were reported to be associated with
   inflammation, atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   progression. In this study, we evaluated RDW and MPV along with clinical
   features in patients with advanced CKD. We also aimed to detect clues
   for causative relations concerning these parameters, renal function and
   comorbiditics.
   Methods Stage 3-5 CKD patients (627 total) were included (mean age 63.1
   years, 48.3\% male). Patients with malignancies, cirrhosis, infections,
   severe anemia, and systemic inflammation were excluded. Patients were
   evaluated for clinical features and grouped for comparison using median
   RDW and MPV. Linear regression models were generated to predict
   potential influences on RDW and MPV.
   Results Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 27.3
   mL/min/1.73m(2). Mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score was 5.83
   +/- 2.06. Patients with high RDW (n = 303) were older with higher CRP
   and CCI, they also had lower eGFR, hemoglobin, and albumin (P < 0.001
   for all). Patients with low MPV (n = 311) had lower eGFR, and platelet
   counts (P = 0.015 and 0.017). eGFR was negatively correlated with RDW
   after adjusting for age, gender and comorbiditics. In a further adjusted
   model RDW was associated with CRP, CCI, hemoglobin and albumin (P < 0.05
   for all), not with eGFR. MPV was positively correlated with eGFR in our
   adjusted, and fully adjusted regression models (P = 0.003).
   Conclusion In this study, we found that high RDW is associated with
   comorbidity burden, anemia, and inflammatory status in patients with
   advanced CKD. Meanwhile, low MPV seems to be associated with worse renal
   function.}},

Abstract = {{This essay treats the contradictions that beset Samuel Hirsch's Die

   presents the contradiction in Hirsch's thought as evidence of the
   incompatible assumptions underlying dominant strands of modern
   philosophy and ``authentic{''} Jewish theology. Agreeing with Fackenheim
   that Hirsch's work is contradictory, this essay diverges on both the
   nature of this contradiction and its implications for Jewish thought. I
   claim that the argument of Die Religionsphilosophie der Juden founders
   as a result of Hirsch's refusal to choose between three different, and
   ultimately incompatible, strategies for articulating the relationship
   between God and human beings. I then conclude by exploring the
   implications of the collapse of Hirsch's position with regard to the
   dispute between theocentrists and ethical monotheists and for the field
   of modern Jewish thought more broadly.}},

Abstract = {{We present here a technology to microencapsulate drugs by the sol-gel
   process, and cryo-SEM methodology that allows the nanostructural
   characterization of the formed capsules in their native state without
   any artifacts, related to their drying prior to imaging. The methodology
   utilizes three signals generated by the electron beam scanning the
   specimen: Secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and x-rays. The
   first gives topographical information of the fracture-surface of the
   thermally-fixed specimen, the second gives contrast between elements of
   different atomic numbers, and the third allows the identification of
   those elements. Combined, the three signals provide full microstructural
   characterization of the studied specimen.
   Using this methodology, we were able to demonstrate that the sol-gel
   technology does indeed enable the encapsulation of two hydrophobic
   active molecules with a silica shell. This technology allows the active
   ingredient in the drug product to slowly migrate from the microcapsule
   onto the skin, thus obtaining the desired effect with minimal
   side-effects, as was exhibited in several clinical studies.
   The successful application of the cryo-SEM methodology in this case,
   demonstrates that it can be used to characterize a wide range of
   liquid-phase suspensions, in their native state, with minimal specimen
   preparation or imaging artifacts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The article focuses on the analysis of the existential meaning of
   testimony. A possible starting point for a consideration regarding the
   phenomenon of testimony in this direction is offered by Heidegger
   discussion of the attestation of authentic-existential possibility of
   Dasein in Being and Time. The ontological understanding of the witness
   and the testimony in particular prevents the reduction of the testimony
   to one of the forms of expression or communication, which Paul Ricoeur
   could not completely avoid in his hermeneutic project of attestation. As
   a special problem, there exists a lack of understanding, which always
   occurs in the situation of testimony and such also defines the
   conditions for the possibility of truth or untruth to testify to what
   the witness bears witness.}},

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients require a stable and sufficient supply of
   micronutrients. Since copper is an essential micronutrient for human
   development, a cross-sectional study was carried out to investigate the
   serum copper levels, serum copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) ratios, and their
   relationship with nutritional indicators in a group of CF patients.
   Anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary measurements, an abdominal
   ultrasound, and respiratory and pancreatic tests were conducted.
   Seventeen CF patients were studied (10 females, 59\%), 76.5\% of whom
   were increment F580. Their mean serum copper (113 +/- 23 mu g/dL) was
   normal, and there was only one teenager with hypocupremia (6\%) and two
   children with hypercupremia (18\%). A significant association between
   serum copper and zinc levels was discovered. The Cu/Zn ratio was higher
   than 1.00 for 94\% of patients, which is an indicator of an inflammation
   status. There was no significant correlation between the serum copper
   concentrations and respiratory and pancreatic function, respiratory
   colonization, and the results of the abdominal ultrasound. Linear
   regression analysis showed that serum copper had a positive association
   with both the Z-score body mass index (BMI) and mean bone conduction
   speed (BCS). Therefore, since 94\% of CF patients had a Cu/Zn ratio >
   1.00, this factor must alert us to consider the risk of zinc deficiency
   and high inflammatory response. The measurement of serum zinc alone does
   not show one's zinc status. However, the Cu/Zn ratio may be an indicator
   of zinc deficiency and the inflammatory status of CF patients.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental phenomena associated with the transport of rigid
   particles by the fluid flow in narrow ducts and tubes is the
   Segre-Silberberg effect. Experimental observations show that a spherical
   particle transported by the fluid flow in a long channel occupies a
   position of equilibrium between the wall and the centerline of the
   channel. In this study, this effect was numerically investigated using a
   novel semi-implicit immersed boundary method based on the discrete
   forcing approach. A uniform Cartesian mesh is used for the duct, whereas
   a moving Lagrangian mesh is used to track the position of the particle.
   Unlike previous studies, both cases of the duct geometry are considered:
   a round tube and a flat channel. Good agreement is shown to the
   available theoretical and numerical results of other studies. The
   problem is described by two dimensionless parameters, the channel
   Reynolds number, and the relative particle diameter. Parametric studies
   to these parameters were carried out, showing fundamental dependencies
   of equilibrium position on Reynolds number from 20 to 500 and on
   relative particle diameter from 0.2 to 0.7. It is demonstrated that the
   position of equilibrium becomes closer to the wall with the increase of
   Reynolds number, as well as with the decrease of particle diameter. In
   addition, the dependence of particle velocity on its diameter is
   investigated. The obtained results are of both theoretical and practical
   interest, with possible applications ranging from proppant transport to
   the design of microfluidic devices.}},

Title = {{First-generation vs. second-generation: A market incentives analysis for
   bioethanol supply chains with carbon policies}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Increasing demand for energy, the food versus fuel debate, and
   competitive market pressure for environmental sustainability are driving
   bioethanol supply chain decision-makers to use second-generation biomass
   feedstocks and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, most biomass supply
   chains use edible first-generation feedstocks to produce bioethanol,
   therefore incentivizing them to switch to a non-edible second-generation
   feedstock seems necessary and motivating in this context. Implementing
   various carbon policy mechanisms to curb carbon emissions plays a vital
   role in planning bioethanol supply chains. This research proposes a
   quantitative optimization model for designing and planning biomass
   bioethanol supply chains considering monetary incentives. The model is
   developed further by investigating the impact of four different carbon
   policies including carbon tax, carbon cap, carbon cap-and-trade, and
   carbon offset policy on the supply chain decisions. Also, the proposed
   model compares a first-generation (corn) and two different
   second-generation (corn stover and switchgrass) bioethanol supply chain
   networks to identify a better alternative for first-generation
   bioethanol producers. The presented methodology is implemented by
   applying a case study for the state of North Dakota to derive more
   realistic results and policies. The results show that switchgrass is a
   better alternative for corn rather than corn stover both economically
   and environmentally. A minimum incentive of \$0.204/liter and
   \$0.167/liter of bioethanol are needed to switch from corn-based to
   corn-stover-based and switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chains,
   respectively. Also, carbon cap-and-trade is the best carbon policy since
   it causes the lowest profit loss (31.5\%) and the highest reduction in
   emissions (up to 1.98\%) compared to other policies.}},

Title = {{Robust Decentralised Trust Management for the Internet of Things by
   Using Game Theory}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to the large scale of the typical deployments and the involvement of
   moving objects to the Internet of Things, participating nodes
   opportunistically establish data exchanging connections, spanning across
   multiple organizations and security domains. This opportunistic behavior
   causes the impossibility of defining valid security policies to rule
   node authorization, and the ineffectiveness of traditional static access
   control models based on roles or attributes. Trust management is a
   promising solution to complement these conventional rules and models by
   realizing a more dynamic security approach and regulating connection
   request acceptance or rejection based on monitored behaviors. As a
   centralized authority cannot be established within multi-tenant and
   large scale infrastructures, decentralized approaches have recently
   emerged, supported by the blockchain technology, and applied to the case
   of useful Internet of Things implementations. However, they are
   vulnerable to possible attacks aiming at discrediting honest nodes (by
   lowering their trust degree) and/or redeem malicious nodes (by
   increasing their trust degree). The widely-accepted protection consists
   of securing the communications by using SSL/TLS, and restricting the
   nodes allowed to update the trust degree. However, they are known to be
   ineffective against compromised nodes that, despite holding legitimate
   security claims and cryptographic material, they deviate from the
   correct behavior by sending false and mendacious scores.
   This work proposes to exploit on game theory to realize robust
   decentralized trust management able to tolerate malicious nodes sending
   mendacious scores. Explicitly, a signaling node has been formalized to
   model the interactions between the IoT and the edge nodes by refusing
   potentially untrue scores. Moreover, the evolutionary Dempster-Shafer
   theory is used to combine the collected scores to update nodes' trust
   degrees, by excluding diverging scores far from the majority. Such
   solutions have been implemented within the context of a
   blockchain-supported trust management solution for IoT, and an empirical
   assessment is provided to show the quality of the proposed approach.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT: Quality of life is significant in all stages of life, including
   within pregnancy. The hormonal, emotional, psychological, and physical
   factors specific to pregnancy can affect and threaten the quality of
   life of pregnant mothers.
   AIMS: This study sought to investigate the health-related quality of
   life (HRQoL) and related factors among pregnant women
   SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was performed on 300
   pregnant women who were in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy
   without any risk of high-risk pregnancy covered by a community health
   center in Yazd, Iran, between 2018 and 2019.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The required data were collected using demographic
   questionnaire and HRQoL (SF-12v2) questionnaire
   STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using SPSS 18 software and
   ANOVA statistical tests (P < 0.05).
   RESULTS: Physical dimension of quality of life of pregnant women had the
   mean and standard deviation of 43.7 +/- 7.3 and that psychological
   dimension had the mean and standard deviation of 31.5 +/- 11.8. Physical
   dimension of quality of life was significantly correlated with maternal
   age, gestational age, body mass index before 12 weeks of pregnancy,
   mother's education and job as well as spouse's level of education (P <
   0.05). Furthermore, the psychological dimension of quality of life was
   significantly correlated with gestational age, mother's education and
   occupation as well as spouse's level of education (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings, attention to physical and
   psychological aspects of quality of life of pregnant women and
   demographic factors affecting it is essential for improving maternal and
   child health during and after pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Optimizing Laboratory Investigations of Saline Intrusion by
   Incorporating Machine Learning Techniques}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Deriving saltwater concentrations from the light intensity values of
   dyed saline solutions is a long-established image processing practice in
   laboratory scale investigations of saline intrusion. The current paper
   presents a novel methodology that employs the predictive ability of
   machine learning algorithms in order to determine saltwater
   concentration fields. The proposed approach consists of three distinct
   parts, image pre-processing, porous medium classification (glass bead
   structure recognition) and saltwater field generation (regression). It
   minimizes the need for aquifer-specific calibrations, significantly
   shortening the experimental procedure by up to 50\% of the time
   required. A series of typical saline intrusion experiments were
   conducted in homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers, consisting of glass
   beads of varying sizes, to recreate the necessary laboratory data. An
   innovative method of distinguishing and filtering out the common
   experimental error introduced by both backlighting and the optical
   irregularities of the glass bead medium was formulated. This enabled the
   acquisition of quality predictions by classical, easy-to-use machine
   learning techniques, such as feedforward Artificial Neural Networks,
   using a limited amount of training data, proving the applicability of
   the procedure. The new process was benchmarked against a traditional
   regression algorithm. A series of variables were utilized to quantify
   the variance between the results generated by the two procedures. No
   compromise was found to the quality of the derived concentration fields
   and it was established that the proposed image processing technique is
   robust when applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous domains alike,
   outperforming the classical approach in all test cases. Moreover, the
   method minimized the impact of experimental errors introduced by small
   movements of the camera and the presence air bubbles trapped in the
   porous medium.}},

Title = {{Interannual, summer, and diel variability of CH4 and CO2 effluxes from
   Toolik Lake, Alaska, during the ice-free periods 2010-2015}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated warming in the Arctic has led to concern regarding the
   amount of carbon emission potential from Arctic water bodies. Yet,
   aquatic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements remain
   scarce, particularly at high resolution and over long periods of time.
   Effluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from Toolik Lake, a
   deep glacial lake in northern Alaska, were measured for the first time
   with the direct eddy covariance (EC) flux technique during six ice-free
   lake periods (2010-2015). CO2 flux estimates from the lake (daily
   average efflux of 16.7 +/- 5.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were in good agreement
   with earlier estimates from 1975-1989 using different methods. CH4
   effluxes in 2010-2015 (averaging 0.13 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) showed
   an interannual variation that was 4.1 times greater than median diel
   variations, but mean fluxes were almost one order of magnitude lower
   than earlier estimates obtained from single water samples in 1990 and
   2011-2012. The overall global warming potential (GWP) of Toolik Lake is
   thus governed mostly by CO2 effluxes, contributing 86-93\% of the
   ice-free period GWP of 26-90 g CO2,eq m(-2). Diel variation in fluxes
   was also important, with up to a 2-fold (CH4) to 4-fold (CO2) difference
   between the highest nighttime and lowest daytime effluxes. Within the
   summer ice-free period, on average, CH4 fluxes increased 2-fold during
   the first half of the summer, then remained almost constant, whereas CO2
   effluxes remained almost constant over the entire summer, ending with a
   linear increase during the last 1-2 weeks of measurements. Due to the
   cold bottom temperatures of this 26 m deep lake, and the absence of
   ebullition and episodic flux events, Toolik Lake and other deep glacial
   lakes are likely not hot spots for greenhouse gas emissions, but they
   still contribute to the overall GWP of the Arctic.}},

   both structure types, the transition metal and aluminum atoms form a

   of malbec grape juice concentrates (Vitis vinifera)}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The rheological behavior and thermophysical properties (density,
   specific heat, and thermal conductivity) were experimentally determined
   as function of temperature (1-66 degrees C) and solid soluble content
   (13.6-45.0 degrees Brix) for Malbec grape juice aiming at designing the
   unit operations involved in beverage industries. Mathematical modeling
   was performed to provide valuable information about the rheological
   behavior and thermophysical properties of Malbec grape juice at
   different concentrations and temperatures. The Ostwald-de Waele model
   fitted the concentrates rheological behavior with high accuracy. The
   consistency coefficients were significantly reduced by the temperature
   increase, following an Arrhenius relationship with activation energy
   ranging from 11.02 kJ/mol (45.0 degrees Brix) to 11.54 kJ/mol (21.0
   degrees Brix). In contrast, they were increased by the higher
   concentration levels, ranging from 0.2044 Pa.sn (13.6 degrees Brix, 6
   degrees C) to 20.9451 Pa.sn (45.0 degrees Brix, 1 degrees C). The flow
   behavior index was not influenced by temperature; however, it was
   strictly related to the concentration, assuming shear-thinning behavior
   (0.96 < n < 0.54), regardless of the solid soluble contents. Density,
   specific heat, and thermal conductivity were significantly correlated
   with both the temperature and concentration parameters by second-order
   polynomial models. The obtained results can be suitable for the
   potential use of Malbec juice concentrate as a chaptalization agent in
   winemaking and grape juice production.}},

Title = {{Natural variation in the sequestosome-related gene, sqst-5, underlies
   zinc homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Zinc is an essential trace element that acts as a co-factor for many
   enzymes and transcription factors required for cellular growth and
   development. Altering intracellular zinc levels can produce dramatic
   effects ranging from cell proliferation to cell death. To avoid such
   fates, cells have evolved mechanisms to handle both an excess and a
   deficiency of zinc. Zinc homeostasis is largely maintained via zinc
   transporters, permeable channels, and other zinc-binding proteins.
   Variation in these proteins might affect their ability to interact with
   zinc, leading to either increased sensitivity or resistance to natural
   zinc fluctuations in the environment. We can leverage the power of the
   roundworm nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a tractable metazoan model
   for quantitative genetics to identify genes that could underlie
   variation in responses to zinc. We found that the laboratory-adapted
   strain (N2) is resistant and a natural isolate from Hawaii (CB4856) is
   sensitive to micromolar amounts of exogenous zinc supplementation. Using
   a panel of recombinant inbred lines, we identified two large-effect
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the left arm of chromosome III and the
   center of chromosome V that are associated with zinc responses. We
   validated and refined both QTL using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and
   identified a naturally occurring deletion in sqst-5, a
   sequestosome-related gene, that is associated with resistance to high
   exogenous zinc. We found that this deletion is relatively common across
   strains within the species and that variation in sqst-5 is associated
   with zinc resistance. Our results offer a possible mechanism for how
   organisms can respond to naturally high levels of zinc in the
   environment and how zinc homeostasis varies among individuals.
   Author summary
   Zinc, although an essential metal, can be toxic if organisms are exposed
   to concentrations that are too high or too low. To prevent toxicity,
   organisms have evolved mechanisms to regulate zinc uptake from the
   environment. Here, we leveraged genetic variation between two strains of
   the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans with different responses to high
   exogenous zinc to identify genes that might be involved in maintaining
   proper zinc levels. We identified four loci that contributed to
   differential zinc responses. One of these loci was the
   sequestosome-related gene sqst-5. We discovered that targeted deletions
   of sqst-5 caused an increase in resistance to zinc. Although SQST-5
   contains a conserved zinc-binding protein domain, it has yet to be
   directly implicated in the C. elegans zinc response pathway. We
   identified two common forms of genetic variation in sqst-5 among 328
   distinct strains, suggesting that variation in sqst-5 must have emerged
   multiple times, perhaps in response to an environment of high zinc.
   Overall, our study suggests a natural context for the evolution of zinc
   response mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The cervical cancer burden in Lithuania has remained high, and there are
   no previous effectiveness studies of cervical cancer prevention
   programme in the country. We investigated the effect of a prevention
   programme on the risk of mortality from cervical cancer in Lithuania by
   conducting a mortality audit study. The register-based case-control
   study included 715 cervical cancer deaths that occurred during 2010-2015
   in Lithuania and their 2145 matched controls. Screening histories for
   cases and controls were obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund
   database. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
   estimated using conditional logistic regression and corrected for
   self-selection bias. Index screening was associated with a 56\%
   reduction in the cervical cancer death risk, OR: 0.44; 95\% CI
   0.26-0.74. The ORs for stage I and stage II+ cancers were 0.80; 95\% CI
   0.32-2.00 and 0.36; 95\% CI 0.21-0.62, respectively. The preventive
   effect was statistically significant for women aged >= 40 years, while
   nonsignificant for younger. In women who died of cervical cancer, 71\%
   were not invited and 88\% were not screened within the recommended 36
   months prior to index date. Among cases with index invitation, 32\% had
   index screening compared to 70\% in controls. In conclusion,
   participation in screening has been effective in reducing cervical
   cancer mortality in Lithuania. The study shows poor screening
   attendance, emphasizing the importance of greater efforts at the
   national level to improve the effectiveness of the screening.}},

Title = {{Sign tracking predicts cue-induced but not drug-primed reinstatement to
   methamphetamine seeking in rats: Effects of oxytocin treatment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1271-1279}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   The incentive sensitisation theory of addiction posits that
   drug-associated stimuli become imbued with incentive motivational
   properties, driving pathological drug seeking. However, pre-existing
   variability in the incentive salience to non-drug reward cues ('sign
   trackers' (STs); `goal trackers' (GTs)) is also predictive of the desire
   for and relapse to cocaine and opioids. Here, we asked whether variation
   in propensity to attribute incentive salience to a food cue is
   predictive of reinstatement to the highly addictive psychostimulant
   methamphetamine (METH), and whether treatment with the promising
   anti-addiction therapy oxytocin differentially reduces METH behaviour
   between STs and GTs.
   Methods:
   Rats were trained to associate a Pavlovian cue with delivery of a
   sucrose pellet over 8 days. They then received jugular vein catheters
   for intravenous METH self-administration, followed by behavioural
   extinction, and cue-induced and METH-primed reinstatement to
   METH-seeking behaviours. Oxytocin was administered prior to
   self-administration and reinstatement tests.
   Results:
   Despite the self-administration of similar amounts of METH, STs
   reinstated more to METH cues than did GTs, yet METH-priming reinstated
   STs and GTs similarly. Furthermore, oxytocin attenuated cue-induced
   reinstatement more so in STs than in GTs, and reduced METH-primed
   reinstatement to a greater extent in the top quartile of reinstaters,
   indicating that oxytocin treatment may be most effective for those at
   highest risk of addiction.
   Conclusions:
   This pre-existing bias towards reward cues presents a possible tool to
   screen for METH addiction susceptibility and may be useful for
   understanding the neurobiology of addiction and for pharmacotherapeutic
   discovery.}},

Journal = {{TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{416-422}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: In this paper, we characterize the nicotine delivery profile
   of a variable voltage, tank-style electronic nicotine delivery system
   (ENDS). Methods: Ten cigarette smokers (8 men, 2 women) completed this
   within-subject study assessing effects of 2 device power settings (15 W,
   45 W) and 3 liquid nicotine concentrations (0, 3, and 6 mg/ml) using a
   tank-style ENDS. Participants completed one directed (10 puffs) and one
   ad libitum use period for each condition, with blood sampled throughout.
   Results: Plasma nicotine concentration did not increase significantly at
   15 W regardless of liquid nicotine concentration. At 45 W, mean plasma
   nicotine increased (not significantly compared to 0 mg/ml) from 2.24
   ng/ml (SD = 0.2) at baseline to 3.4 ng/ml (SD = 0.6) in the 3 mg/ml
   condition. In the 6 mg/ml, 45 W condition, mean plasma nicotine
   increased significantly (compared to 0 mg/ml) from 2.0 ng/ml (SD=0) at
   baseline to 5.96 ng/ml (SD = 1.3) after 10 puffs. In general, puff
   duration and volume decreased as device power and nicotine concentration
   increased. Conclusions: Despite using a variable wattage, tank-style
   device, nicotine delivery was minimal. These results, when combined with
   results from other studies using tank-style devices, highlight ENDS
   performance heterogeneity. Regulation may play a role in standardizing
   ENDS nicotine delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To isolate the anti-cancer and anti-trypanosomal principles of
   Zanthoxylum leprieurii, a medicinally versatile wild tropical plant used
   for managing tumours, African trypanosomiasis, and inflammation in
   southeastern Nigeria.
   Methods: The pure compounds were isolated using chromatographic methods.
   The structural elucidation of the pure compounds was based on their NMR
   (1D and 2D) and mass spectral data as well as chemical test results.
   Structure-activity relationships were based on the structural
   differences among the compounds. The cytotoxicity of the extracts and
   compounds (1, 2, 3, and 4) was evaluated in HeLa (human cervix
   adenocarcinoma) cell line while the trypanocidal activities were
   evaluated on Trypanosoma brucei brucei.
   Results: Two acridone alkaloids, 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methylacridin-9
   (10H)-one, named fabiocinine (1), and
   1-hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxy-10-methylacridin-9 (10H)-one (arborinine, 2),
   together with a furoquinoline alkaloid, skimmianine (3), and a
   chelerythrine derivative, 6-acetonyl-5,6-dihydrochelerythrine (4) were
   isolated from the root bark of Zanthoxylum leprieurii. Skimmianine (3)
   exhibited cytotoxicity and anti-trypanosomal IC50 of 12.8 and 13.2 mu
   g/mL respectively (p < 0.05). Compound (1) and arborinine (2) were
   selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells with cytotoxicity IC50 of 28.49 and
   62.71 mu g/mL, respectively, while (4) did not show significant activity
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Zanthoxylum leprieurii root bark contains cytotoxic and
   trypanocidal compounds, and is thus a potential source of anti-cancer
   and anti-trypanosomal leads.}},

Title = {{Improving cooling load prediction reliability for HVAC system using
   Monte-Carlo simulation to deal with uncertainties in input variables}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable cooling load prediction is the basis for model
   predictive control (MPC) of HVAC systems. Cooling load prediction
   process is constrained by many input variables. These input variables
   contain different kinds of uncertainties that should not be ignored in
   pursuing a reliable prediction result. However, previous load prediction
   methods usually improve the prediction accuracy by optimizing model
   structure but fail to consider the influence of input variables
   uncertainties. To reduce the influence of uncertainty of input variables
   forecast data scientifically, this paper proposes an improved cooling
   load prediction reliability method in which the input variables are
   calibrated offline with Monte-Carlo simulations and stochastic treatment
   before inputting them into the prediction model. A machine learning
   algorithm (support vector machine, SVM) is used as the prediction model.
   Uncertainties in weather parameters, indoor heat gains, and historical
   cooling load were taken into consideration. Uncertainty analysis results
   showed that prediction accuracy with calibrated input variables was much
   better (R-2 = 0.9627) than those predicted with forecast input data
   directly (R-2 = 0.9488), which was closer to load prediction obtained by
   using measured input data (R-2 = 0.9632). The coefficient of variation
   (CV) value using the calibrated input data was less than 15\%. The
   reliable cooling load prediction results are beneficial for more
   informed, reliable decisions on MPC application, thereby promoting
   energy conservation potential of HVAC systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{With the rapid explosion of data volume from mobile networks, edge
   caching has received significant attentions as an efficient approach to
   boost content delivery efficiency by bringing contents near users. In
   this article, cache-enabled heterogeneous networks (HetNets) considering
   the limited backhaul are analyzed with the aid of the stochastic
   geometry approach. A hybrid caching policy, in which the most popular
   contents are cached in the macro BSs tier with the deterministic caching
   strategy and the less popular contents are cached in the helpers tier
   with the probabilistic caching strategy, is proposed. Correspondingly,
   the content-centric association strategy is designed based on the
   comprehensive state of the access link, the cache and the backhaul link.
   Under the hybrid caching policy, new analytical results for successful
   content delivery probability, average successful delivery rate and
   energy efficiency are derived in the general scenario, the
   interference-limited scenario and the mean load scenario. The simulation
   results show that the proposed caching policy outperforms the most
   popular caching policy in HetNets with the limited backhaul. The
   performance gain is dramatically improved when the content popularity is
   less skewed, the cache capacity is sufficient and the helper density is
   relatively large. Furthermore, it is confirmed that there exists an
   optimal helper density to maximize the energy efficiency of the
   cache-enabled HetNets.}},

Title = {{Co-upgrading of biomass and polyethylene -derived volatiles for organic
   liquid over Ru, Ti, Sn/HZSM-5 coupled with NTP technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{152}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Co-upgrading of biomass and polyethylene -derived volatiles was
   conducted over HZSM-5 and its metal-modified versions, and NTP was
   introduced to enhance the conversion. The effects of metal species on
   the active radicals, organic yields, properties and compositions were
   explored. The Ru and Ti species, especially the low-valence
   titanium-oxides, increased atomic radicals, relieved the bottleneck of
   hydrogen transfer, and induced more volatiles into the radicals scale.
   The synergy of acid sites, metal species and NTP contributed to the
   integration of volatiles and exhibited promising potential in lowering
   oxygen and increasing organic yield. Specifically, TiHZ5 yielded the
   organic liquid of 58.73 \% with the HHV of 38.73 MJ/kg, and RuHZ5
   produced 51.70 \% of organic liquid with the HHV of 36.96 MJ/kg. The
   synergy between SnHZ5 and NTP was so weak that it sacrificed partial
   yield to promote HHV. The Ru, Ti, and Sn modification increased the
   aromatic selectivity from 23.38 \%-48.9 \%, 72.14 \% and 35.66 \%,
   respectively, which caused the decrease of effective hydrogen to carbon
   ratios. Particularly, TiHZ5 gave the maximum MAHs selectivity of 64.19
   \% and minimum PAHs selectivity of 7.95 \%. Besides, Ru, Ti and Sn
   modification decreased coking rate from 16.97 \% to 7.04 \%, 4.62 \% and
   8.46 \%, respectively, and removal of coke became easier. This study
   provided a new waste-energy refinery way to reduce the disposal of waste
   plastics and relieve the dependence of fossil fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the promising results obtained with cryogenic treatment of tool
   steels, there are still contradictions regarding its benefits, and there
   is no consensus regarding its mechanisms in the steel microstructure.
   The goal of this work is to investigate the optimum heat treatment
   process parameters together with the cryogenic treatment. Samples of
   AISI M2 steel were austenitized at 1170, 1200 or 1230 degrees C and
   quenched in salt bath. The cryogenic treatment was performed through
   nitrogen nebulization with a cooling/heating rate of 0.3 degrees C/min,
   24-h holding time at -190 degrees C, before, after or between the double
   tempering. The influence of cryogenic treatment in AISI M2 steel was
   dependent on the previous austenitization temperature. No significant
   reduction in retained austenite was observed by deep cryogenic
   treatment. The benefits achieved in the resistance to abrasive wear and
   toughness are associated with lower amount of carbon in the martensite
   together with finer and more homogeneous carbide precipitation. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Exposure information is a critical element in various regulatory and
   non-regulatory frameworks in Europe and elsewhere. Exposure science
   supports to ensure safe environments, reduce human health risks, and
   foster a sustainable future. However, increasing diversity in
   regulations and the lack of a professional identity as exposure
   scientists currently hamper developing the field and uptake into
   European policy. In response, we discuss trends, and identify three key
   needs for advancing and harmonizing exposure science and its application
   in Europe. We provide overarching building blocks and define six
   long-term activities to address the identified key needs, and to
   iteratively improve guidelines, tools, data, and education. More
   specifically, we propose creating European networks to maximize
   synergies with adjacent fields and identify funding opportunities,
   building common exposure assessment approaches across regulations,
   providing tiered education and training programmes, developing an
   aligned and integrated exposure assessment framework, offering best
   practices guidance, and launching an exposure information exchange
   platform. Dedicated working groups will further specify these activities
   in a consistent action plan. Together, these elements form the
   foundation for establishing goals and an action roadmap for successfully
   developing and implementing a `European Exposure Science Strategy'
   2020-2030, which is aligned with advances in science and technology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The nurse faculty shortage is a well-documented problem. The
   future workforce is dependent upon qualified faculty who desire to teach
   students.
   Purpose: The purpose was to explore the relationship between nurse
   faculty life balance and quality of life.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through surveying nurse
   faculty (N = 108). The Life Balance Inventory measured health,
   relationships, identity, challenge/interest, and activities of daily
   living with scores ranging from 1 (unbalanced) to 3 (very balanced). The
   Professional Quality of Life scale measured compassion satisfaction,
   burnout, and secondary traumatic stress with scores ranging from 22 or
   less (low), 23-41 (average), and 42 or more (high). Descriptive
   statistics and correlations were calculated.
   Results: Nurse faculty had moderate life balance (Mean = 2.23), average
   compassion satisfaction (Mean = 40.17), average burnout (Mean = 24.86),
   and low secondary traumatic stress (Mean = 20.14). The moderate and
   weak, negative correlations between total life balance and both burnout
   (r = -0.461, p < .001) and secondary traumatic stress (r = -0.267, p =
   .008) respectively were significant, but the correlation with compassion
   satisfaction (r = 0.174, p = .078) was not.
   Conclusion: It is critical to create supportive work environments for
   nursing faculty that promote well-being and reduce burnout and stress.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant which
   affects the central nervous system. Therefore, this study was aimed at
   evaluating the efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of patients with
   MA dependence.
   Methods: A randomized parallel controlled trial study was designed to
   compare the effectiveness of take-home, self-administered modafinil
   treatment in the intervention group and the controlled group in three
   months. The primary outcome measurements were severity and duration of
   craving, and self-reported methamphetamine consumption, as confirmed by
   urine drug test.
   Results: The relapse rate was 40 and 75 \% in the intervention and
   controlled groups, respectively, indicating a decrease in relapse rate
   of MA in the intervention group (p < 0.05). During the three months, the
   severity and the duration of drug abuse craving in the intervention
   group were less than in the controlled group. Patients in the
   intervention group experienced an increase in retention rate and a
   decrease in slip rate (p < 0.05)
   Conclusion: The use of modafinil is not only effective on craving and
   relapse reduction, but also changes urine drug screens of patients with
   MA dependence to negative. Thus, modafinil is safely indicated as an
   effective medication to reduce withdrawal symptoms and the craving of
   patients with MA dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Ordinary kraft pulping of bagasse was adjusted by utilizing green liquor
   at the laboratory and research of Misr-Edfu Pulp, Writing and Printing
   Paper in a small pilot batch digester (Edfu, Aswan, Egypt) as an
   environmentally friendly method. Bagasse pulp was produced with and
   without green liquor, and the physical and mechanical properties of
   unbleached bagasse were assessed. The parameter states of cooking were
   completed utilizing antacid substance charge from 10\% to 13\%, cooking
   temperature from 160 to 170 degrees C, cooking time from 20 to 50 min,
   and solid to liquor ratio of 7:1 that was steady in all preliminaries.
   The results demonstrated the exploratory idea that green liquor can
   provide critical pulping advantages in comparison with customary kraft
   pulping. Screened pulp yield improved 2.6\%, rejects content decreased
   0.9\%, kappa number was reduced by 26.9\%, and brightness was increased
   by 3\%. There also was improved mechanical quality of bagasse pulp:
   increases of 14.3\% (tensile index), 8.7\% (tear index record), 4.6\%
   (burst index), and 15.4\% (double fold number) were observed compared
   with conventional kraft pulping. This process also saved money related
   to the expense of depleted vitality, lime consumed during causticizing
   process, and upkeep of the causticizing plant.}},

Abstract = {{Some teenagers are willing to bully, harass, and torment their
   schoolmates in order to achieve popularity and other goals. But whom do
   they bully? Here, we extend the logic of instrumental aggression to
   answer this question. To the extent that friendships are the currency of
   social status, we should expect social aspirants to target their own
   friends, their friends' friends, and other structurally equivalent
   schoolmates. This tendency, we argue, extends beyond what would be
   explained by propinquity, and we expect that victimization by friends
   will be particularly distressing. We test these hypotheses using panel
   social network data from 14 middle and high schools at two time points
   during a school year. Findings from temporal exponential random graph
   models suggest that our expectations are correct: the tendency to be
   cruel to friends is not significantly influenced by propinquity, and
   victimization by friends has adverse consequences for mental health.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is well-documented in the orthopedic literature that 1 in
   5 patients are dissatisfied following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
   However, multiple statistical models have failed to explain the causes
   of dissatisfaction. Furthermore, payers are interested in using
   patient-reported satisfaction scores to adjust surgeon reimbursement
   rates without a full understanding of the influencing parameters. The
   purpose of this study was to more comprehensively identify predictors of
   satisfaction and compare results using both a statistical model and a
   machine learning (ML) algorithm.
   Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive TKAs performed by 2
   surgeons was conducted. Identical perioperative protocols were utilized
   by both surgeons. Patients were grouped as satisfied or unsatisfied
   based on self-reported satisfaction scores. Fifteen variables were
   correlated with satisfaction using binary logistic regression and
   stochastic gradient boosted ML models.
   Results: In total, 1325 consecutive TKAs were performed. After
   exclusions, 897 TKAs were available with minimum 1-year follow-up.
   Overall, 85.3\% of patients were satisfied. Older age generation and
   performing surgeon were predictors of satisfaction in both models. The
   ML model also retained cruciate-retaining/condylar-stabilizing implant;
   lack of inflammatory conditions, preoperative narcotic use, depression,
   and lumbar spine pain; female gender; and a preserved posterior cruciate
   ligament as predictors of satisfaction which allowed for a significantly
   higher area under the receiver operator characteristic curve compared to
   the binary logistic regression model (0.81 vs 0.60).
   Conclusion: Findings indicate that patient satisfaction may be
   multifactorial with some factors beyond the scope of a surgeon's
   control. Further study is warranted to investigate predictors of patient
   satisfaction particularly with awareness of differences in results
   between traditional statistical models and ML algorithms. (C) 2020

Title = {{A Least Squares Solution to Regionalize VTEC Estimates for Positioning
   Applications}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A new approach is presented to improve the spatial and temporal
   resolution of the Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) estimates for
   regional positioning applications. The proposed technique utilises a
   priori information from the Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) of the Center
   for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), provided in terms of Spherical
   Harmonic (SH) coefficients of up to degree and order 15. Then, it
   updates the VTEC estimates using a new set of base-functions (with
   better resolution than SHs) while using the measurements of a regional
   GNSS network. To achieve the highest accuracy possible, our
   implementation is based on a transformation of the GIM/CODE VTECs to
   their equivalent coefficients in terms of (spherical) Slepian functions.
   These functions are band-limited and reflect the majority of signal
   energy inside an arbitrarily defined region, yet their orthogonal
   property is remained. Then, new dual-frequency GNSS measurements are
   introduced to a Least Squares (LS) updating step that modifies the
   Slepian VTEC coefficients within the region of interest. Numerical
   application of this study is demonstrated using a synthetic example and
   ground-based GPS data in South America. The results are also validated
   against the VTEC estimations derived from independent GPS stations (that
   are not used in the modelling), and the VTEC products of international
   centres. Our results indicate that, by using 62 GPS stations in South
   America, the ionospheric delay estimation can be considerably improved.
   For example, using the new VTEC estimates in a Precise Point Positioning
   (PPP) experiment improved the positioning accuracy compared to the usage
   of GIM/CODE and Klobuchar models. The reductions in the root mean
   squared of errors were similar to 23\% and 25\% for a day with moderate
   solar activity while 26\% and similar to 35\% for a day with high solar
   activity, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Development of a novel hierarchical Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) typing approach and characterization of MAP field
   cultures in Central Germany.
   Methods and Results By combining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem
   repeat, we developed a highly discriminating and phylogenetically
   accurate hierarchical MAP typing approach. Moreover, a novel stepwise
   workflow was employed to reduce the number of SNP reactions required
   making the typing approach more affordable. MAP field cultures (n = 142)
   from dairy herds in Central Germany were classified as cattle type and
   showed a high level of heterogeneity. Intra-herd multiple genotypes were
   evident in (13-25\%) of the investigated herds.
   Conclusions The hierarchical MAP typing approach proved to be useful in
   fine discrimination between MAP cultures within limited geographical
   regions. This could potentially be used in unravelling MAP transmission
   chains in the respective regions. The observed heterogeneity in some
   herds is assumed to be due to either multiple introductions through
   inter-herd trade or intra-herd evolution over time.
   Significance and Impact of the Study Future MAP epidemiological studies
   will benefit from the advantages of the novel hierarchical typing
   approach. The SNP number reduction approach employed here could be
   extrapolated for other analogous pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Using the eddy-permitting model, circulation in the Okhotsk Sea and in
   an adjacent area of the Pacific Ocean is retrospectively simulated from
   1991 to 2000. It is shown that the Sea has four types of circulation,
   each one for its own season with a strengthening of all currents in
   winter and a weakening in summer. We estimate and analyze the values of
   the simulated monthly-averaged volume transport of the main currents:
   the coastal branch of the East Sakhalin Current, the over-slope branch
   of the East Sakhalin Current, the coastal branch of the North Okhotsk
   Current, the over-slope branch of the North Okhotsk current, the Middle
   Current and the West Kamchatka Current. In contrast to the conventional
   circulation schemes, the North Okhotsk Current is found to consist of
   two branches, one over a continental slope and another along the
   northern shelf. The simulation results on the double-branch structure of
   this current are found to be in a reasonable agreement with instrumental
   measurements, CTD observations, satellite data and other oceanography

Abstract = {{The paper contains an overview of the history of Russian
   psycholinguistics, namely the core part of it, which studies the
   mechanisms of language production and language comprehension, as well as
   research on the structure of the ``mental lexicon{''}. The review is
   presented in the context of the history of worldwide psycholinguistics
   by W. Levelt. The paper describes in detail the emergence of Russian
   psycholinguistics in the early twentieth century, its formation in the
   second half of the twentieth century, the current state and the
   prospects for its further development in the first half of the
   twenty-first century. The main attention is paid to the description of
   two leading Russian psycholinguistic schools - the St. Petersburg
   school, which comes from the works of L. V. Shcherba, and the Moscow
   school, which is inextricably linked with the name of A. A. Leontiev.
   The key term of the study is the term ``experiment{''}. The paper shows
   how differently it is interpreted in the psycholinguistic research of
   different schools and directions. The paper provides a detailed
   description of two experimental studies. The first study, performed by
   American scholars using the eyetracking methodology, is devoted to the
   phenomenon of syntactic ambiguity, which plays an important role in
   testing models of syntactic analysis in the process of language
   comprehension. The second study, performed by Moscow scholars using the
   method of associative experiment, describes the linguistic consciousness
   of Russian speakers. The final part summarizes the results, concludes
   about the prevailing scientific paradigm in modem Russian
   psycholinguistics, and also discusses the prospects for Russian
   psycholinguistics in the light of T. Kuhn's concepts of ``scientific
   paradigms{''} and ``scientific revolutions{''}.}},

   device}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we use a spiral channel inertial focusing device for
   isolation and purification of chromosomes, which are highly asymmetric.
   The method developed is proposed as a sample preparation process for
   transchromosomic research. The proposed microfluidics-based chromosome
   separation approach enables rapid, label-free isolation of bioactive
   chromosomes and is compatible with chromosome buffer. As part of this
   work, particle force analysis during the separation process is performed
   utilizing mathematic models to estimate the expected behavior of
   chromosomes in the channel and the model validated with experiments
   employing fluorescent beads. The chromosome sample is further divided
   into subtypes utilizing fluorescent activated cell sorting , including
   small condensed chromosomes, single chromosomes, and groups of two
   chromosomes (four sister chromatids). The separation of chromosome
   subtypes is realized based on their shape differences in the spiral
   channel device under high flow rate conditions. When chromosomes become
   aligned in the shear flow, the balance between the inertial focusing
   force and the Dean flow drag force is determined by the chromosome
   projection area and aspect ratio, or shape difference, leading to
   different focusing locations in the channel. The achieved results
   indicate a new separation regime in inertial microfluidics that can be
   used for the separation of non-spherical particles based on particle
   aspect ratios, which could potentially be applied in fields such as
   bacteria subtype separation and chromosome karyotyping.}},

Abstract = {{EphA2 (EPH receptor A2) (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular
   receptor tyrosine kinase subtype A2) plays a crucial role in human
   cancers, and is a promising target for the development of new anticancer
   drugs. In this study, we showed that the interaction of Annexin A1
   (ANXA1) and EphA2 increased EphA2 stability by inhibiting its proteasome
   degradation in gastric cancer (GC) and colon cancer (CC) cells, and the
   amino acid residues 20-30 and 28-30 of ANXA1 N terminal were responsible
   for binding and stabilizing EphA2. Based on the amino acid residues of
   ANXA1 responsible for binding EphA2, we developed ANXA1-derived 3 amino
   acid-long (SKG) and 11 amino acid-long peptides (EYVQTVKSSKG) in fusion
   to cell-penetrating peptide, named as A1(28-30) and A1(20-30)
   respectively, and found that A1(28-30) and A1(20-30) blocked the binding
   of ANXA1 with EphA2, targeted EphA2 degradation, and suppressed the
   growth of GC and CC cellsin vitroand in mice. Our data demonstrated that
   ANXA1 was able to bind and stabilize EphA2 in GC and CC cells, and
   disruption of ANXA1-EphA2 interaction by the two ANXA1-derived peptides
   inhibited the growth of GC and CC cells by targeting EphA2 degradation,
   presenting a potential strategy for treating GC and CC with these
   peptides.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article addresses the problem of distributed state estimation on
   the infinite-time horizon for discrete-time systems with multiple
   sensors. The desired filter, referred to as distributed H-infinity
   Gaussian filter, reaching a tradeoff between optimality and robustness,
   constructs a local estimate based on its own observation and on those
   collected from its neighbors. A Nash game approach is used to deal with
   such a multiobjective distributed filtering problem, and causal bounded
   Nash equilibrium strategies, consisting of the optimal filter gains and
   the corresponding worst-case disturbance signals, are analytically
   conducted based on solutions to a set of cross-coupled algebraic Riccati
   equations. Moreover, to further improve the cohesiveness among local
   estimates, additional consensus objective is taken into consideration by
   exchanging prior estimates among neighboring nodes. A choice of the
   consensus term, with which the error dynamics are shown to be internally
   stable, is derived via a numerically tractable and efficient method.
   Finally, an application to speed monitoring through wireless sensor
   network is included to show the validity of the presented results.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was considered a
   safe and efficient method for removing kidney stones, with a low
   incidence of complications. This study aims to compare the success rate
   of PCNL based on guy's stone score (GSS) operating procedure and its
   complications. Methods: Data were collected from patients with kidney
   stones who underwent PCNL. A stone-free rate (SFR) was considered if the
   patient was either had no stone or had any stone that is <4 mm and
   asymptomatic residual fragment. Complications were assessed using the
   modified Clavien score, and SFR was assessed by abdominal radiography.
   Results: A total of 198 patients were included in this study. There was
   a significant difference in SFR between simple (GSS I and II) and
   complex stone (GSS III and IV) groups (P = 0.000). The operation
   procedure was longer in the complex group compared to the simple groups
   for both total operating time and stone fragmentation time (P = 0.000).
   X-ray time was not significantly different (P = 0.061). Almost all
   patients were classified as Clavien I, as there was no significant
   difference between the two groups for complication (P = 0.277) or blood
   loss (P = 0.176). Conclusion: The success rate of PCNL based on the GSS
   at Gunung Jati Regional Hospital is quite good. There was a difference
   in the SFR between the groups, and the operating procedure time was
   longer in the complex stone group. There was no difference between the
   simple stone and complex stone groups in PCNL complications, which
   indicated a good surgical practice.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This contribution aims to provide an in-depth outlook of the phase-out
   of coal-fired energy generation in Italy. In particular, this article
   analyzes the state-of-the-art with regard to both the current role of
   coal generation and the performance of the main legal and regulatory
   tools as implemented in Italy thus far to ensure the closure of all coal
   power plants by 2025 as announced in the Italian National Climate and
   Energy Plan. Based on existing data and scenarios on both electricity
   production and demand trends, this article unfolds the marginal role
   played by coal-fired generation in the Italian energy mix. In addition,
   this paper aims to highlight the outstanding technical uncertainties and
   regulatory hurdles in the way towards de-carbonization of energy
   generation in Italy. This paper argues that several remarkable
   improvements are needed in order to avoid over-generation (especially
   through natural gas), to upscale the penetration of renewable energy
   sources, and develop the necessary infrastructures to adequately deliver
   on the full phasing-out of coal within the expected timeframes.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure projects have great potential to impact the
   sustainability of cities due to typically being large-sized projects and
   having a high level of intervention. Thus, evaluating the sustainability
   of these projects through sustainability reports is highly relevant,
   mainly regarding their impacts on the environment, public health, and
   the local economy. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is the most
   widespread and internationally accepted Sustainability report tool.
   However, the GRI does not have an infrastructure sector disclosure. This
   research addresses this gap by providing a sustainability assessment
   instrument for infrastructure projects that interlocks with the Global
   Reporting Initiative (GRI). An extensive and detailed literature review
   was conducted, identifying 97 potential indicators to measure the
   sustainability of infrastructure projects. These indicators were
   evaluated following a top-down approach, conducting a survey of
   professionals experienced in the relevant field using Lawshe's content
   validity ratio. The results showed that 42 indicators were validated as
   essential, with 21 of them, not specifically related to infrastructure
   projects, already covered by the standard disclosure of the GRI. This
   assessment enabled the proposal of a sector disclosure formed by 21 new
   indicators related to the environmental, economic, and social
   dimensions. This study closes a gap in the evaluation of the
   sustainability of infrastructure projects and contributes to the
   discussion about sustainability indicators in infrastructure projects.}},

Abstract = {{Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) productivity is dependent on
   climatic and economic conditions. The goal of this research is to
   combine economic and agrometeorological modeling on sugarcane
   productivity in the 18 important sugarcane production microregions of
   the SAo Paulo state in Brazil from 1995 to 2012. Cluster analysis was
   used to identify two groups of microregions with similar sugarcane
   actual productivity (PR) within each group. Group 1 presented higher
   values compared to group 2 in all years. However, the sugarcane
   attainable productivity (PA), estimated by the agrometeorological model,
   of group 2 was higher than group 1 in 17 of the 18 years analyzed.
   Finally, a statistical model was used to quantify the influence of
   sugarcane price, rural credit concession and PA on PR in all
   microregions and in the two groups. For all microregions, sugarcane
   price was the most important explanatory variable for PR, followed by PA
   and the rural credit concession in third. PR of Group 1 was mainly
   affected by sugarcane prices and PR of group 2 was mainly affected by
   PA. Therefore, the group 1 sugarcane producers were able to respond to
   price changes regardless of PA in this group. This can occur due to a
   better management, bigger investments or smaller metereological
   adversity of group 1. In conclusion, the agrometereological (PA) and the
   economic (sugarcane price and rural credit concession) variables
   affected the PR in the analyzed regions. However, crop pathogens,
   meteorological adversities or human management have led to this
   situation (limiting and reducing factors).}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) models are becoming ubiquitous in
   today's society, supporting people with their day-to-day decisions. In
   this context, Explainable ML is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   that focuses on making predictive models and their decisions
   interpretable by humans, enabling people to trust predictive models and
   to understand the underlying processes. A counterfactual is an effective
   type of Explainable ML technique that explains predictions by describing
   the changes needed in a sample to flip the outcome of the prediction. In
   this paper, we introduce counterfactual sets, an explanation approach
   that uses a set of counterfactuals to explain a prediction rather than a
   single counterfactual, by defining a sub-region of the feature space
   where the counterfactual holds. A method to extract counterfactual sets
   from a Random Forest (RF), the Random Forest Optimal Counterfactual Set
   Extractor (RF - OCSE), is presented. The method is based on a partial
   fusion of tree predictors from a RF into a single Decision Tree (DT)
   using a modification of the CART algorithm, and it obtains a
   counterfactual set that contains the optimal counterfactual. The
   proposal is validated through several experiments against existing
   alternatives on ten well-known datasets by comparing the percentage of
   valid counterfactuals, distance to the factual sample, and
   counterfactual sets quality.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the influence of thermal and mechanical cycling on
   fracture load and fracture pattern of resin nanoceramic crowns and
   polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) crowns, both fabricated with
   CAD/CAM technology. Materials and Methods: A total of 90 premolar crowns
   bonded to titanium abutments were divided into three groups of 30 crowns
   each: 30 resin nanoceramic crowns (LU); 30 PICN crowns (VE); and 30
   metal-ceramic crowns (MC). The 30 specimens of each group were further
   divided into three subgroups of 10 each that underwent (1) no treatment,
   (2) thermocycling (2,000 cycles, 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C), and (3)
   thermocycling with subsequent mechanical cycling (120,000 cycles, 80 N,
   2 Hz). The specimens were loaded to failure, and two-way ANOVA and
   chi-square test were used to determine differences in fracture
   resistance and pattern. Results: Mechanical and thermal cycling
   significantly influenced the critical load to failure of the three
   materials; however, no significant differences were observed between the
   thermocycled materials and the materials that were thermocycled with
   subsequent mechanical cycling. The MC specimens experienced
   significantly higher fracture loads than those of the LU and VE
   specimens, which showed no differences from each other in fracture
   resistance. The fracture patterns showed chipping in MC crowns and
   partial or complete fracture in LU and VE crowns. The fracture pattern
   depended on the material and was unrelated to the type of treatment it
   underwent. Conclusion: All crowns showed adequate resistance to normal
   masticatory forces in the premolar area. The cyclic fatigue load
   negatively influenced all three materials.}},

Abstract = {{Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) was pulped by means of a kraft
   pulping process with reagent loads of 10 and 20\% on a dry matter basis
   to determine yield, rejects, kappa number, and ash. Fiber
   classification, brightness, opacity, and viscosity were measured in the
   brown pulp. Bleaching was performed by means of an O1O2D1(PO)D2HD3
   sequence. Yield, kappa number, pH, ash, brightness, opacity, and
   viscosity were evaluated in the bleached pulp. Finally, a microanalysis
   of inorganic elements was carried out in both the bleached and
   unbleached pulp ash. The highest kraft pulp yield was 26.4\%, with a
   10\% reagent load at 120 degrees C and 30 minutes cooking. It was
   determined that E. crassipes cellulosic pulp contains large amounts of
   fines. Results of the bleaching sequence indicate low brightness (58.0
   \%) and low viscosity (6.43 cP). The most abundant inorganic elements in
   the ash of both bleached and unbleached pulp were Ca, Mg, P, and Si.
   These results suggest that E. crassipes biomass might complement
   cellulosic fibers in pulping processes of low yield, such as the wood
   fibers used to produce handmade paper.}},

Abstract = {{Prostatitis is an inflammatory condition that is related to multiple
   infectious agents, including bacteria and fungi. Traditional herbal
   extracts proved efficacious in controlling clinical symptoms associated
   with prostatitis. In this context, the aim of the present study was to
   explore the efficacy of extracts from Solidago virga-aurea, Ononis
   spinosa, Peumus boldus, Epilobium angustifolium, and Phyllanthus niruri
   against bacterial (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus) and fungi strains (Candida
   albicans; C. tropicalis) involved in prostatitis. Additionally,
   anti-mycotic effects were tested against multiple species of
   dermatophytes (Trichophyton rubrum, T. tonsurans, T. erinacei,
   Arthroderma crocatum, A. quadrifidum, A. gypseum, A. currey, and A.
   insingulare). Antioxidant effects were also evaluated in isolated rat
   prostates challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and phytochemical
   analyses were conducted to identify and quantify selected phenolic
   compounds, in the extracts. Finally, a bioinformatics analysis was
   conducted to predict putative human and microbial enzymes targeted by
   extracts' phytocompounds and underlying the observed bio-pharmacological
   effects. The phytochemical analysis highlighted that rutin levels could
   be crucial for explaining the highest antibacterial activity of P.
   boldus extract, especially against E. coli and B. cereus. On the other
   hand, in the E. angustifolium extract, catechin concentration could
   partially explain the highest efficacy of this extract in reducing lipid
   peroxidation, in isolated rat prostates stimulated with LPS. Concluding,
   the results of the present study showed moderate antimicrobial and
   anti-inflammatory effects induced by water extracts of S. virga-aurea,
   P. boldus, E. angustifolium, P. niruri, and O. spinosa that could be
   related, at least partially, to the phenolic composition of the
   phytocomplex.}},

Title = {{A study of droplet deformation: The effect of crossflow velocity on jet
   fuel and biofuel droplets impinging onto a dry smooth surface}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The aeronautical sector has been, in the last decade, one of those that
   most invested in more efficient and ecological solutions in order to
   reduce significantly greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. The
   introduction of biofuels in fuel mixtures for aircraft engines is a
   promising alternative in this sector. The main objective of this
   experimental study is understanding the influence of crossflow variation
   on droplet deformation and consequent impact outcomes. An experimental
   facility was developed and validated to study the impact of single
   droplets onto a dry, smooth aluminium impact surface under the influence
   of several crossflow velocities. Different crossflow velocities of 4, 5,
   6, 7 and 8 m/s were tested. A combination of conventional jet fuel and a
   biofuel was considered to understand the behavior of jet fuel and
   biofuel mixtures, and three fluids were used: 100\% jet fuel, 75\% jet
   fuel/25\% biofuel and 50\% jet fuel/50\% biofuel. Several parameters,
   including velocity components, impact angle and eccentricity, were
   analysed for the different crossflow velocities, and the spread and
   splash regimes were also defined for the different fluids. The results
   display that, for each crossflow velocity, an increase in the droplet
   impact velocity causes a shift from the spread to the splash regime. The
   presence of a crossflow induces deformation on the droplet, altering its
   outcome. Ellipsoidal droplets promote the occurrence of spreading,
   whereas splashing tends to occur for spherical forms, corresponding to
   higher and lower eccentricity values, respectively. A substantial
   increase in the crossflow velocity leads to aerodynamic breakup of the
   droplet.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microplastics are omnipresent in the atmosphere, terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems, food and beverages. They may cause risks to biodiversity and
   the human population. The present study aims to assess the
   concentrations of microplastics in raw and drinking water of the Sinos
   River in Southern Brazil. The water was collected at eight locations
   along the Sinos River and in eight residences supplied with treated
   river water. The samples were processed by dying plastic particles with
   Nile Red and counting by fluorescence microscopy. River water showed an
   average of 330.2 particles L-1 and treated water 105.8 particles L-1.
   Fibers were the most abundant particles shapes in the samples. Particle
   abundance in the raw water did not follow the urbanization gradient in
   the Sinos River basin. The exact pathways of microplastic particles
   remain unidentified, but the predominance of fibers suggests that
   untreated sewage from washing machines may be a principal source of
   contamination, particularly in the headwaters. The microplastic in the
   drinking water is an additional factor to be considered in conservation
   efforts aiming at improving water quality in the Sinos River basin.}},

Title = {{On the Stable Resolution Limit of Total Variation Regularization for

Volume = {{66}},

Pages = {{7237-7252}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The stability of spike deconvolution, which aims at recovering point
   sources from their convolution with a point spread function (PSF), is
   known to be related to the separation between those sources. When the
   observations are noisy, it is critical to ensure support stability,
   where the deconvolution does not lead to spurious, or oppositely,
   missing estimates of the point sources. In this paper, we study the
   resolution limit of stably recovering the support of two closely located
   point sources using the Beurling-LASSO estimator, which is a convex
   optimization approach based on total variation regularization. We
   establish a sufficient separation criterion between the sources,
   depending only on the PSF, above which the Beurling-LASSO estimator is
   guaranteed to return a stable estimate of the point sources, with the
   same number of estimated elements as that of the ground truth. Our
   result highlights the impact of PSF on the resolution limit in the noisy
   setting, which was not evident in previous studies of the noiseless
   setting. Towards the end, we show that the same resolution limit applies
   to resolving two close-located sources in conjunction of other
   well-separated sources.}},

Title = {{Individual tree detection and species classification of Amazonian palms

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{475}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Information regarding the spatial distribution of palm trees in tropical
   forests is crucial for commercial exploitation and management. However,
   spatially continuous knowledge of palms occurrence is scarce and
   difficult to obtain with conventional approaches such as field
   inventories. Here, we developed a new method to map Amazonian palm
   species at the individual tree crown (ITC) level using RGB images
   acquired by a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Our approach is
   based on morphological operations performed in the score maps of palm
   species derived from a fully convolutional neural network model. We
   first constructed a labeled dataset by dividing the study area (135 ha
   within an old-growth Amazon forest) into 28 plots of 250 m x 150 m.
   Then, we manually outlined all palm trees seen in RGB images with 4 cm
   pixels. We identified three palm species: Attalea butyracea, Euterpe
   precatoria and Iriartea deltoidea. We randomly selected 22 plots (80\%)
   for training and six plots (20\%) for testing. We changed the plots for
   training and testing to evaluate the variability in the classification
   accuracy and assess model generalization. Our method outperformed the
   average producer's accuracy of conventional patch-wise semantic
   segmentation (CSS) in 4.7\%. Moreover, our method correctly identified,
   on average, 34.7 percentage points more ITCs than CSS, which tended to
   merge trees that are close to each other. The producer's accuracy of A.
   butyracea, E. precatoria and I. deltoidea was 78.6 +/- 5.5\%, 98.6 +/-
   1.4\% and 96.6 +/- 3.4\%, respectively. Fortunately, one of the most
   exploited and commercialized palm species in the Amazon (E. precatoria,
   a.k.a, Acai) was mapped with the highest classification accuracy. Maps
   of E. precatoria derived from low-cost UAV systems can support
   management projects and community-based forest monitoring programs in
   the Amazon.}},

Title = {{First Results from SMAUG: Uncovering the Origin of the Multiphase
   Circumgalactic Medium with a Comparative Analysis of Idealized and
   Cosmological Simulations}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{We examine the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) at low
   redshift in a range of simulated Milky Way mass halos. The sample is
   comprised of seven idealized simulations, an adaptive mesh refinement
   cosmological zoom-in simulation, and two groups of 50 halos with
   star-forming or quiescent galaxies taken from the TNG100 simulation. The
   simulations have very different setups, resolution, and feedback models,
   but are analyzed in a uniform manner. By comparing median radial
   profiles and mass distributions of CGM properties, we isolate key
   similarities and differences. In doing so, we advance the efforts of the
   Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand Galaxies project that
   aims to understand the inherently multiscale galaxy formation process.
   In the cosmological simulations, the CGM exhibits nearly flat
   temperature distributions, and broad pressure and radial velocity
   distributions. In the idealized simulations, similar distributions are
   found in the inner CGM (greater than or similar to 0.5 r(200c)) when
   strong galactic feedback models are employed, but the outer CGM (greater
   than or similar to 0.5 r(200c)) has a much less prominent cold phase,
   and narrower pressure and velocity distributions even in models with
   strong feedback. This comparative analysis demonstrates the dominant
   role feedback plays in shaping the inner CGM and the increased
   importance of cosmological effects, such as nonspherical accretion and
   satellite galaxies, in the outer CGM. Furthermore, our findings
   highlight that, while cosmological simulations are required to capture
   the multiphase structure of the CGM at large radii, idealized
   simulations provide a robust framework to study how galactic feedback
   interacts with the inner CGM, and thereby provide a reliable avenue to
   constrain feedback prescriptions.}},

Title = {{Performance Analysis of Hybrid MTS/MTO Systems with Stochastic Demand
   and Production}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive numerical approach with reasonably light
   complexity in terms of implementation and computation for assessing the
   performance of hybrid make-to-stock (MTS)/make-to-order (MTO) systems.
   In such hybrid systems, semi-finished products are produced up front and
   stored in a decoupling inventory. When an order arrives, the products
   are completed and possibly customised. We study this system in a
   stochastic setting: demand and production are modelled by random
   processes. In particular, our model includes two coupled Markovian
   queues: one queue represents the decoupling inventory and the other the
   order backlog. These queues are coupled as order processing can only
   occur when both queues are non-empty. We rely on matrix analytic
   techniques to study the performance of the MTO/MTS system under
   non-restrictive stochastic assumptions. In particular, we allow for
   arrival correlation and non-exponential setup and MTS and MTO processing
   times, while the hybrid MTS/MTO system is managed by an (s,S)-type
   threshold policy that governs switching from MTO to MTS and back. By
   some numerical examples, we assess the impact of inventory control,
   irregular order arrivals, setup and order processing times on inventory
   levels and lead times.}},

   organized through a news media regime. To understand the process, it
   emphasizes four dimensions: how the symbolic resources, material
   resources, formal rules and practices have defined the logics of
   government communication in the period studied (May 2015-May 2016). The
   analysis meets the call for more empirical investigation into the
   interplay between the traditional news logics and new digital logics.}},

Abstract = {{The illegal status of cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) post-World War II
   resulted in a lack of research on agricultural practices. However, there
   is a resurgence of interest in cannabis due to diverse uses such as a
   rich source of cellulosic/woody fiber and construction uses, seed oil,
   bioenergy and pharmaceutical properties. The principle of an integrated
   plant nutrition system (IPNS) is to enable adaptation of plant nutrition
   and soil fertility management to local site characteristics, attempting
   to optimize use of inorganic, organic and biological resources. This
   project investigated the individual and combined use of inorganic,
   organic and biological fertilizer resources on cannabis before and after
   a period of moderate water stress. We evaluated the individual and
   combined effects of commercial synthetic fertilizer, humic acid (HA),
   manure tea and bioinoculant as inorganic, organic and biological
   resources, respectively on cannabis growth and physiological parameters.
   Our hypothesis was that the synergetic effects of HA + biofertilizers
   would improve cannabis growth. When compared to the control, the
   application of HA and biofertilizer alone, or in combination, increased
   plant height, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency by 55, 8
   and 12\%, respectively, after water stress. Cannabis biomass of treated
   plants was rarely different from the control. The combined application
   of HA + biofertilizer resulted in additive, but not synergistic,
   increases in measured parameter. Future research should focus on the
   effects of biostimulants on CBD/THC content due to the potential impact
   on the production of secondary metabolites in plants under stress.}},

Journal = {{CLINICA TERAPEUTICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{171}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{E501-E508}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim. To evaluate the effectiveness of Human Patient Simulation method,
   as an additional method to theoretical lectures, on improving critical
   care knowledge of third course nursing students compared to only
   theoretical lectures. It was hypothesised that, the greater cognitive
   abilities used and trained around a specific subject, more strengthening
   of the subject contents is done by the students.
   Methods. A non-experimental pretest-post test study was carried out with
   a questionnaire created ad hoc. specifically for this study. Pretest
   questionnaire was administered after students received five weeks of
   theoretical lectures on critical care subjects. Post test was
   administered after students performed the theoretical classes and the
   simulation based learning activity on critical care subjects.
   Results. 60 nursing students of the Campus Docent Sant Joan de Dela,
   attending to critical care subjects, were enrolled in the study. The
   statistical analyses performed showed a significance of the intervention
   in the post-test: p value 0.01 and the students improved on average by 1
   point after the intervention, passing from 11.94 in the pre-test to
   12.94 in the post-test. Results of this study suggest that use of Human
   Patient Simulation method of zone two made a positive difference in
   nursing students' ability to answer questions about critical care when
   there was need to apply their cognitives abilities.
   Conclusion. We evidenced that is crucial to direct cognitive resources
   appropriately toward each section of the simulation activity. Choosing
   the quantity and the kind of cognitive abilities that will be used by a
   specific group of students in a simulation activity, facilitators can
   upgrade the student knowledges and avoid impaired learning.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the modified atmosphere parameters in the carbonation process
   for improved fiber-cement performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the relative
   humidity on the accelerated carbonation process of the fiber-cement
   composites reinforced with a high concentration of vegetable fibers. The
   samples were produced with 10\% of bleached eucalyptus pulp, in a method
   of fabrication similar to the commercial boards. The composites were
   submitted in an atmosphere with CO2 saturation, and relative humidity
   range of 60-90\% to evaluate the effect of this parameter on the
   development of carbonation reaction. X-ray diffraction and
   thermogravimetric analysis were accomplished at different times, for
   monitoring the formation of carbonates along the accelerated carbonation
   process. Microstructure, physical and mechanical properties, and
   degradation were also evaluated. The composites carbonated with 60\% of
   relative humidity presented a formation of CaCO3 significantly higher
   (37\%) than the other concentrations of relative humidity (70, 80 and
   90\%) in just 4 h of carbonation. The densification of the cementitious
   matrix increased by 17\%, and the modulus of rupture by 43\% compared to
   non-carbonated composites. There was no statistically significant
   difference between the relative humidity of 60 and 70\% for the physical
   and mechanical properties of the materials, and in general, the
   carbonation process preserved the reinforcement capacity of eucalyptus
   pulp in fiber-cement even after the accelerated aging cycles. In
   conclusion, this study demonstrated that the concentration of the
   relative humidity of the curing atmosphere is the main vehicle for
   diffusion and reactivity of the accelerated carbonation process. The use
   of the ideal relative humidity content can provide a faster and more
   effective carbonation reaction, in the production of fiber-cement
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the national transposition of the European
   Renewable Energy Directive into Austrian law. The objective is to
   estimate the economic viability for residential customers when
   participating in a renewable energy community (REC), focused on PV
   electricity sharing. The developed simulation model considers the
   omission of certain electricity levies as well as the obligatory
   proximity constraint being linked to grid levels, thus introducing a
   stepwise reduction of per-unit grid charges as an incentive to keep the
   inner-community electricity transfer as local as possible. Results show
   that cost savings in residential RECs cover a broad range from 9 EUR/yr
   to 172 EUR/yr. The lowest savings are gained by customers without
   in-house PV systems, while owners of a private PV system make the most
   profits due to the possibility of selling as well as buying electricity
   within the borders of the REC. Generally, cost savings increase when the
   source is closer to the sink, as well as when more renewable electricity
   is available for inner-community electricity transfer. The presence of a
   commercial customer impacts savings for households insignificantly, but
   increases local self-consumption approximately by 10\%. Despite the
   margin for residential participants to break even being narrow, energy
   community operators will have to raise a certain participation fee. Such
   participation fee would need to be as low as 2.5 EUR/month for customers
   without in-house PV systems in a purely residential REC, while other
   customers could still achieve a break-even when paying 5 EUR/month to
   6.7 EUR/month in addition. Those results should alert policy makers to
   find additional support mechanisms to enhance customers' motivations to
   participate if RECs are meant as a concept that should be adopted on a
   large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty exists regarding the results of treating basal cell
   carcinomas with a more aggressive growth pattern than nodular growth
   with cryosurgery. Over the years, some medium aggressive, well-defined
   basal cell carcinomas have been treated with cryosurgery at the combined
   ophthalmology-dermatology recipiency at Sahlgrenska University Hospital,
   Gothenburg in Sweden. The medical records of these patients were
   reviewed to analyse the results. A total of 53 cryosurgeries were
   performed in 52 patients during 2009 to 2016. None of these patients had
   a recurrence within the first 3 years. There were 2 recurrent tumours
   after 5 years and 1 after 9 years. It is concluded that cryosurgery is
   an effective treatment option for well-defined basal cell carcinomas

Title = {{Sedentariness and Back Health in Western Cape Primary School Students:
   Protocol for a Pragmatic Stepped-Wedge Feasibility Randomized Controlled
   Trial}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite growing evidence of deleterious health outcomes
   associated with sedentary behavior, prolonged static sitting in
   classrooms remains ubiquitous in primary schools. Sedentary behavior is
   associated with the development of cardio-metabolic conditions and poor
   back health. Preventative strategies to reduce sedentary behavior and
   its negative health effects may be required in a resource-constrained
   environment such as South Africa.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the
   feasibility of conducting a full trial to evaluate the effects of a
   multifaceted intervention comprising novel multifunctional classroom
   furniture and a video-based curriculum versus usual care on sedentary
   behavior among students aged 10-11 years in primary schools. The
   secondary objective is to assess the preliminary effects of the
   intervention on sedentary behavior and postural dynamism.
   Methods: Eighty grade 5 or 6 students, aged 10 and 11 years, in
   mixed-gender schools within the Western Cape metropolitan urban area in
   Cape Town, South Africa are eligible to participate in this pilot
   cluster stepped-wedge trial design with classroom as the unit of
   randomization. Data will be collected at the schools. The intervention
   will comprise multifunctional classroom furniture that allows for
   sitting and standing as well as a video based curriculum on sedentary
   behavior. Usual practice is the absence of the intervention. The primary
   outcomes assessed will be (1) adherence to the intervention and (2)
   project pragmatics. The secondary outcomes will be (1) sedentariness
   measured using activPAL3 microsensors and (2) postural dynamism measured
   using Noraxon Myomotion inertial measurement units. We randomized the
   school to the first or second start of the intervention. This is an
   open-label trial and therefore blinding will not be possible for any
   group. Descriptive analysis of the feasibility and physiological
   outcomes will be presented. We will report the preliminary estimates of
   the effects of the intervention on sedentariness and postural dynamism
   using the mean difference and 95\% CI.
   Results: At the time of submission, two classrooms have been recruited
   into the study. Baseline physical activity and postural dynamism data
   have been collected from 10 participants from each class.
   Conclusions: The results of this feasibility stepped-wedge cluster
   randomized controlled trial will be useful in informing the design of
   the main trial to assess whether this multifaceted intervention of
   multifunctional classroom furniture that allows for sitting and standing
   as well as a video-based curriculum versus usual care has any effect on
   sedentary behavior in low-resource-setting primary schools.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolites are materials with known sorption properties. The sorption is
   thought to progress mainly by ion exchange with Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ or
   H+ from the zeolite exchange sites. The aim of the study was to compare
   the sorption properties of natural and synthetic zeolites on the example
   of the removal of selected metals from aqueous acidic solutions. Uptake
   experiments for selected ions of chromium, manganese, selenium, nickel,
   cobalt, and iron were performed using the batch and kinetic column
   methods. The sorption of the individual metal ions in mg per 1g of
   sorbent was determined for each sorbent. The relative affinity sequence
   of the examined cations toward the various sorbent was presented. The
   Langmuir model was used to model the adsorption equilibrium. Vermiculite
   under 1 mm of diameter (SF), Na-X, and Na-A were proved to be the most
   suitable for the individual uptake of studied metal ions. It was
   observed that the behavior of selenium ions differed from the remaining
   ones which was interpreted that selenium undergoes adsorption in the
   anionic form. The fixed-bed column studies were performed using Na-A,
   ensuring the sorption of selenium in the presence of iron(III) ions. The
   experiments were conducted using Na-X zeolite pre-loaded by Fe(III) as
   well as unmodified sorbent eluted by an equimolar mixture containing 100
   ppm of Fe and Se. Obtained results prove that selenium sorption improves
   if other metal ions such as iron appear in the acidic solution. That
   efficient selenium sorption conditions can be applied to remove selenium
   which was recognized as toxic at higher levels.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{315}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effect of mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) on the resistome
   profile of manures from two different dairy farms was evaluated using a
   metagenomic approach. A total of 187 unique Antibiotic resistance genes
   (ARGs) for 17 different classes of antibiotics were detected in raw
   (undigested) manures. The results indicate that regardless of the origin
   of the dairy manure, mesophilic AD was capable of reducing or enriching
   the relative abundance of some ARGs. The main driver of these changes
   was strongly correlated with the evolution of the microbial community
   during the AD process. Putative ARG hosts were suggested by analyses of
   the co-occurrence of microbial groups and ARGs. Finally, network
   analyses revealed that mesophilic AD could also reduce the co occurrence
   of different groups of ARGs potentially located in the same genetic
   elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the microbial
   mechanisms driving the diversity and abundance of ARGs during mesophilic
   AD.}},

Abstract = {{Educational institutions are crucial environments to promote students'
   wellbeing. This introduces major challenges into the processes of
   executing and evaluating programmes such as the ones focused on
   achieving bullying-free schools. The concept of social wellbeing that is
   used throughout the present paper is associated to the subjective sense
   of action in the social construction and understanding of reality. The
   primary objective was to examine the relationship between Family Support
   (FS) and Social Wellbeing (SW) of high school education students in the
   state of Sonora, Mexico, as well as the effect of potential mediation of
   the School Environment (SE). This research was carried out with a
   cross-sectional sample of 265 teenagers (average age = 16 years old,
   SD=1.35), who responded to a self-report scale developed for this
   research study. The structural model has shown a high predictive power
   of SE as a mediating variable between FS and SW. Furthermore, both
   immediate contexts of students, i.e. family and school, were found to be
   relevant to their emotions and SW, which translates into a lower
   probability of being a victim of bullying. Therefore, we discuss a
   concept of SW seen from a perspective related to emotions, where
   material, economic, and/or monetary factors are not a priority.}},

Title = {{Accuracy of tidal volume delivery by five different models of
   large-animal ventilators}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{857-864}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To determine the accuracy of tidal volume (V-T) delivery among 5
   different models of large-animal ventilators when tested at various
   settings for V-T delivery, peak inspiratory flow (PIF) rate, and fresh
   gas flow (FGF) rate.
   SAMPLE
   4 different models of pneumatically powered ventilators and 1
   electrically powered piston-driven ventilator.
   PROCEDURES
   After a leak flow check, each ventilator was tested 10 times for each
   experimental setting combination of 5 levels of preset V-T, 3 PIF rates,
   and 4 FGF rates. A thermal mass flow and volume meter was used as the
   gold-standard method to measure delivered V-T. In addition, circuit
   systems of rubber versus polyvinyl chloride breathing hoses were
   evaluated with the piston-driven ventilator. Differences between preset
   and delivered V-T (volume error {[}Delta V-T]) were calculated as a
   percentage of preset V-T, and ANOVA was used to compare results across
   devices. Pearson correlation coefficient analyses and the coefficient of
   determination (r(2)) were used to assess potential associations between
   the Delta V-T and the preset V-T, PIF rate, and FGF rate.
   RESULTS
   For each combination of experimental settings, ventilators had Delta V-T
   values that ranged from 1.2\% to 22.2\%. Mean +/- SD Delta V-T was 4.8
   +/- 2.5\% for the piston-driven ventilator, compared with 6.6 +/- 3.2\%,
   10.6 +/- 2.9\%, 13.8 +/- 2.97\%, and 15.2 +/- 2.6\% for the 4 pneumatic
   ventilators. The. Delta(T) increased with higher PIF rates (r(2) =
   0.69), decreased with higher FGF rates (r(2) = 0.62), and decreased with
   higher preset V-T (r(2) = 0.58).
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Results indicated that the tested ventilators all had Delta V-T but that
   the extent of each of Delta V-T varied among ventilators. Close
   monitoring of delivered V-T with external flow and volume meters is
   warranted, particularly when pneumatic ventilators are used or when very
   precise V-T delivery is required.}},

   excavation. A statistical analysis applied to the case study of the
   Brenner Base Tunnel - BBT}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the analysis of overbreak in tunnels excavated
   with the drill-and-blast method. The overbreak phenomenon has many
   negative impacts on tunnelling organisation and economy and its precise
   assessment plays a fundamental role in the process of construction
   optimisation. The study proposes an operative methodology to estimate
   overbreak volumes and to distinguish so-called technical overbreak,
   mainly related to drill-and-blast design and execution, from geological
   overbreak, typically influenced by rock-mass characteristics. The
   approach was developed and implemented during the excavation of the
   Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT) and was based on the interpretation of tunnel
   laser scanning surveys and high-resolution images of the excavated
   surfaces. The analysis of more than 1,800 m of excavation from three
   different tunnels of the BBT system allowed to identify the main factors
   influencing the technical and the geological overbreak. An empirical
   model for overbreak prediction, based on the Rock Mass Rating index and
   the length of blast holes, is subsequently presented and validated in
   the last part of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The significance of external signs (EST) and signs or
   symptoms of trauma (SS) after ground level falls or found down (GLF/FD)
   is unclear. We hypothesized that EST and SS were associated with injury.
   Methods: Patients with GLF/FD were retrospectively studied. SS was
   defined as having any EST, tenderness, or subjective complaint. Outcomes
   were any significant finding (SF) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 8.
   Diagnostic accuracy of EST and SS were assessed with positive and
   negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-).
   Results: Of 578 patients, 66\% and 95\% had EST and SS respectively. For
   EST, LR+ and LR-were 1.14 and 0.76 (SF), and 1.21 and 0.64 (ISS>8). For
   SS, LR+ and LR-were 1.07 and 0.19 (SF), and 1.03 and 0.49 (ISS>8).
   Conclusion: EST lacked sufficient diagnostic accuracy for SF and ISS>8.
   Lack of SS was reasonably accurate in ruling out SF but not ISS>8.
   Triage utilizing EST alone for GLF/FD is not useful. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) comprises three main
   variants: logopenic (lv-PPA), non-fluent (nfv-PPA) and semantic variant
   (sv-PPA). Differentiating the language profiles of the PPA variants
   remains challenging, especially for lv-PPA and nfv-PPA. As such,
   diagnostic tools that do not rely on speech and language may offer some
   utility. Here, we investigated the short-term and working memory
   profiles of the PPA variants and typical Alzheimer's disease (AD), with
   a particular interest in the visuospatial system. We hypothesised
   visuospatial short-term and working memory would be more compromised in
   lv-PPA and AD than in the other PPA variants, and that this would relate
   to degeneration of posterior temporoparietal brain regions.
   Method: Thirty-three lv-PPA, 26 nfv-PPA, 31 sv-PPA and 58 AD patients,
   and 45 matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants
   completed the WMS-III Spatial and Digit Span tasks and underwent a
   structural brain MRI for voxel-based morphometry analyses.
   Results: Relative to Controls, Spatial Span Forward (SSF) performance
   was impaired in lv-PPA and AD but not in nfv-PPA or sv-PPA. In contrast,
   Digit Span Forward (DSF) performance was impaired in lv-PPA and nfv-PPA
   (to a similar level), and AD, but was relatively intact in sv-PPA. As
   expected, most backward span scores across both modalities were lower
   than forward span scores. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SSF and
   SSB performance in all patients combined correlated with grey matter
   intensity decrease in several clusters located in
   temporo-parieto-occipital brain regions. Post-hoc group comparisons of
   these regions showed that grey matter loss was more extensive in the
   lv-PPA and AD groups than in the nfv-PPA and sv-PPA groups.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that the visuospatial short-term and
   working memory profiles of the PPA variants are separable and likely
   reflect their distinct patterns of temporo-parieto-occipital brain
   atrophy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this contribution, we report a totally new and an unprecedented
   capability of producing nano-CeO2 evenly dispersed over reduced graphene
   oxide (rGO), enabling an extremely high dispersion of Pd at high loading
   (similar to 5\% wt) in the catalyst, in one-step hydrothermal synthesis.
   Morphology and thermal stability of the synthesized Pd/ CeO2-rGO system
   are compared with Pd/rGO counterpart. High-resolution transmission
   microscopy studies of synthesized samples combined with X-ray
   diffraction, Raman and thermal analyses showed the formation of
   subnanometer Pd clusters on nano-CeO2 dispersed over reduced graphene
   oxide (rGO). Notably, rGO had a decisive role over the stabilization of
   CeO2 as nano-structures, leading to the outstanding Pd dispersion on
   this catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterize the impact of obesity on disease severity in
   patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Design: This was a retrospective
   cohort study designed to evaluate the association between body mass
   index and risk of severe disease in patients with coronavirus disease
   2019. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record. The
   primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. Setting: Two
   hospitals in Massachusetts (one quaternary referral center and one
   affiliated community hospital). Patients: Consecutive patients
   hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted between
   March 13, 2020, and April 3, 2020. Interventions: None. Measurements and
   Main Results: A total of 305 patients were included in this study. We
   stratified patients by body mass index category: < 25 kg/m(2)(54
   patients, 18\%), >= 25 kg/m(2)to < 30 kg/m(2)(124 patients, 41\%), >= 30
   kg/m(2)to < 35 kg/m(2)(58 patients, 19\%), and >= 35 kg/m(2)(69
   patients, 23\%). In total, 128 patients (42\%) had a primary endpoint
   (119 patients {[}39\%] were intubated and nine died {[}3\%] without
   intubation). Sixty-five patients (51\%) with body mass index greater
   than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)were intubated or died. Adjusted Cox models
   demonstrated that body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)was
   associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of intubation or death (95\%
   CI, 1.2-4.3) compared with individuals with body mass index less than 25
   kg/m(2). Diabetes was also independently associated with risk of
   intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.7). Fifty-six out
   of 127 patients (44\%) with body mass index greater than or equal to 30
   kg/m(2)had diabetes, and the combination of both diabetes and body mass
   index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)was associated with a 4.5-fold
   increased risk of intubation or death (95\% CI, 2.0-10.2) compared with
   patients without diabetes and body mass index less than 25 kg/m(2).
   Conclusions: Among consecutive patients hospitalized with coronavirus
   disease 2019, obesity was an independent risk factor for intubation or

Abstract = {{Background
   Much remains unknown about the longitudinal health and well-being of
   individuals with intellectual disability (ID); thus, new methods to
   identify those with ID within nationally representative population
   studies are critical for harnessing these data sets to generate new
   knowledge. Objective
   Our objective was to describe the development of a new method for
   identifying individuals with ID within large, population-level studies
   not targeted on ID. Methods
   We used a secondary analysis of the de-identified, restricted-use
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)
   database representing 20,745 adolescents to develop a method for
   identifying individuals who meet the criteria of ID. The three criteria
   of ID (intellectual functioning, adaptive functioning, and disability
   originating during the developmental period) were derived from the
   definitions of ID used by the American Psychiatric Association and the
   American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. The
   ID Indicator was developed from the variables indicative of intellectual
   and adaptive functioning limitations included in the Add Health database
   from Waves I to III. Results
   This method identified 441 adolescents who met criteria of ID and had
   sampling weights. At Wave I, the mean age of this subsample of
   adolescents with ID was 16.1 years. About half of the adolescents were
   male and from minority racial groups. Their parents were predominately
   female, were married, had less than a high school education, and had a
   median age of 41.62 years. The adolescents' mean maximum abridged
   Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test standardized score was 69.6, and all
   demonstrated at least one adaptive functioning limitation. Discussion
   This study demonstrates the development of a data-driven method to
   identify individuals with ID using commonly available data elements in
   nationally representative population data sets. By utilizing this
   method, researchers can leverage existing rich data sets holding
   potential for answering research questions, guiding policy, and
   informing interventions to improve the health of the ID population.}},

Title = {{Effect of phase change microcapsules on the thermo-mechanical, fracture
   and heat storage properties of unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This work aims at producing and characterizing unidirectional
   carbon/epoxy composites containing different fractions of paraffin
   microcapsules (MC) for thermal management applications. The viscosity of
   the epoxy/MC mixtures increases with the MC content, thereby increasing
   the final matrix weight and volume fraction and reducing that of the
   fibers. This is at the basis of the decrease in mechanical properties of
   the laminates with high MC concentration (the elastic modulus decreases
   up to 53\% and the flexural strength up to 67\%), but the application of
   theoretical models shows that this decrease is only due to the lower
   fiber volume fraction, and not to a change in the properties of the
   constituents or the fiber/matrix interaction. The MC phase is
   preferentially distributed in the interlaminar zone, which leads to a
   thickening of this region and a decrease in matrix-related properties,
   such as the interlaminar shear strength, which decreases of up to 70\%.
   However, a modest MC fraction causes an increase in the mode I
   interlaminar fracture toughness of 48\%, due to the introduction of new
   toughening mechanisms. On the other hand, an excessive MC content lets
   the crack propagating through the matrix and not at the fiber/matrix
   interface, thereby reducing the toughening mechanism provided by fiber
   bridging. For the thermal properties, the phase change enthalpy
   increases with the MC fraction up to 48.7 J/g, and this is reflected in
   better thermal management performance, as proven by thermal imaging
   tests. These results are promising for the development of
   multifunctional polymer composites with thermal energy storage and

Journal = {{NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In numerical computations of response properties of electronic systems,
   the standard model is Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT). Here
   we investigate the mathematical status of the simplest class of
   excitations in KS-DFT, HOMO-LUMO excitations. We show that such
   excitations, i.e. excited states of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, exist for
   Z > N, where Z is the total nuclear charge and N is the number of
   electrons. The result applies under realistic assumptions on the
   exchange-correlation functional, which we verify explicitly for the
   widely used PZ81 and PW92 functionals. By contrast, and somewhat
   surprisingly, we find using a method of Glaser, Martin, Grosse, and
   Thirring (Glaser et al., 1976) that in case of the hydrogen and helium
   atoms, excited states do not exist in the neutral case Z = N when the
   self-consistent KS ground state density is replaced by a realistic but
   easier to analyze approximation (in case of hydrogen, the true
   Schrodinger ground state density). Implications for interpreting minus
   the HOMO eigenvalue as an approximation to the ionization potential are
   indicated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial simulations for crewed missions are critically important for
   testing technologies and improving methods and procedures for future
   robotic and human planetary exploration. In February 2018, AMADEE-18
   simulated a mission to Mars in the Dhofar region of Oman. During the
   mission, a field crew coordinated by the osterreichisches Weltraum Forum
   (OeWF) accomplished several experiments in the fields of astrobiology,
   space physiology and medicine, geology, and geophysics. Within the
   scientific payload of AMADEE-18, ScanMars provided geophysical radar
   imaging of the subsurface at the simulated landing site and was operated
   by analog astronauts wearing spacesuits during extra-vehicular
   activities. The analog astronauts were trained to operate a
   ground-penetrating radar instrument that transmits and then collects
   radio waves carrying information about the geological setting of the
   first few meters of the subsurface. The data presented in this work show
   signal returns from structures down to 4 m depth, associated with the
   geology of the investigated rocks. Integrating radar data and the analog
   astronauts' observations of the geology at the surface, it was possible
   to identify the contact between shallow sediments and bedrock, the local
   occurrence of conductive soils, and the presence of pebbly materials in
   the shallow subsurface, which together describe the geology of recent
   loose sediments overlying an older deformed bedrock. The results
   obtained by ScanMars confirm that subsurface radar sounding at martian
   landing sites is key for the geological characterization at shallow
   depths. The geologic model of the subsurface can be used as the basis
   for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and paleo-habitats, thus assisting
   scientific investigations looking for traces of present or past life on
   the Red Planet.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the diet of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) and the
   American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) in a fragmented habitat and natural
   surroundings in the arid ecosystem of the Baja California peninsula,
   Mexico. Both small-sized raptors are considered in the same trophic
   guild, and as keystone species, interactions between them could be of
   interest for wildlife management in fragmented landscapes for
   agricultural activities. The diet analysis of these top predators could
   be a good monitor of prey abundance, some of which may be considered
   detrimental for agricultural activities. Prey frequencies in owl pellets
   were higher for arthropods (53.1\%) and rodents (32.4\%), but rodents
   were the most abundant item in terms of biomass (34.5\%). Arthropods
   also showed higher relative frequencies in kestrel pellets (36.4\%), but
   reptiles were the second in order of importance (28.4\%) and contributed
   the most (64.7\%) to the total prey biomass. The biomass contribution
   (66.1\%) of vertebrates in the diet of the Burrowing Owl was lower than
   for the American Kestrel (95.6\%) in a fragmented habitat area. Most
   prey types were present in the diet of both raptors, but we found
   significant differences in the biomass contributions of each category.
   Reptiles and rodents were the prey items that contributed most to the
   differences in the raptors' diets, in terms of biomass (33\% and 20.3\%,
   respectively). Close nesting surroundings (0.5 km and 1 km radius)
   evidenced a higher proportion of natural vegetation in the kestrel's
   (50.6\% and 38.9\%, respectively) than in owl's potential home range
   (25.8\% and 16.4\%). The differences in diet suggest some degree of
   niche partitioning of these species likely due to the more flexible
   owl's nesting habitat requirements and to the extended nocturnal
   activity of the species. These results reflect the capability of being
   complementary species, both exploiting some pests that are harmful for
   agriculture, and evidencing the importance of both species as regulators
   of agro-ecosystems in the peninsula of Baja California.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) shows
   a constant increase, while the long-term outcome remains poor over the
   last decades. Radical oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) - initially
   released by carcinogens, such as alcohol and tobacco, and later
   maintained by the tumor microenvironment - appear to be strongly
   associated to chronic inflammation, tumor induction, progression, and
   metastatic spread. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of
   oxidative and nitrosative stress in primary OSCC compared to healthy
   tissue specimens and to identify their impact on tumor carcinogenesis.
   Materials and Methods: In this basic research study, tissue samples of
   30 patients with primary OSCC were evaluated for the expression of pAKT,
   pERK, 3-NT, NOS1, NOS3, MAPK1, and IP-8 by immunohistochemistry and
   RT-PCR and compared to those of a healthy control group (n = 30).
   Results: The results showed a significantly increased expression of pAKT
   (p < 0.001), pERK (p = 0.01), 3-NT (p = 0.039), NOS1 (p = 0.025), NOS3
   (p = 0.046), and MAPK1 (p = 0.032) in OSCC tissue samples compared to
   healthy controls. Conclusion: The results of this study prove the tested
   stable degradation products to be suitable for the detection of RONS in
   OSCC. Moreover, the significantly increased expression underlines the
   role of RONS in carcinogenesis of OSCC, suggests specific mechanisms of
   detection, and anticipates supplementary research.}},

Abstract = {{The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on
   March 11, 2020. SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has shown
   the ability to become aerosolized with a potential airborne route of
   transmission. Dentists and dental hygienists are listed as two of the
   occupations in a nonhospital setting with the greatest risk of
   contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as routine dental procedures involve
   aerosol generation. In a statement on interim guidance, WHO recommended
   that all routine dental procedures be delayed until COVID-19
   transmission rates decrease from community transmission to cluster cases
   and until the risk of transmission in a dental office can be studied and
   evaluated. This prospective study involves 2,810 patients treated over a
   6 month period (March 15 to September 15, 2020) in three different
   dental offices by two dentists and three hygienists during and shortly
   after the height of the pandemic in New York. By utilizing screening
   questionnaires, performing enhanced infection control, and having
   appropriate personal protective equipment, these dental offices were
   able to record no transmission of COVID-19 to the dental healthcare
   workers or patients during the study. In addition, 69\% of the patients
   treated in these dental offices were recorded as having one or more
   high-risk comorbidities related to COVID-19 severity.}},

Title = {{Oil-assisted extraction of polyphenols from press cake to enhance
   oxidative stability of flaxseed oil}},
Journal = {{LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cold-pressed flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids but also highly
   vulnerable to lipid oxidation. Polyphenols might improve the oxidative
   stability of oils. As common pressing processes are not sufficient to
   transfer polyphenols from seeds to oil, a customized screw extruder was
   developed. In addition, an oil-assisted extraction of polyphenols from
   press cake was applied. The effects of an open process were compared
   with a nitrogen-flushed and sealed process regarding polyphenols,
   peroxides and tocopherols in oil. Most polyphenols (492 +/- 49.6 mg
   GAE/100 g seed) remained in the cake and only a small amount was
   transferred into the oil (0.27 +/- 0.11 mg GAE/100 g seed) in the open
   process. To enhance the polyphenolic content in flaxseed oil, an
   optimized method using oil as an extraction solvent for polyphenols from
   press cake was developed by considering press cake/oil ratio, number of
   extractions and extraction time. Results showed that a threefold
   extraction for 30 min and a press cake/oil ratio of 1:2 led to a 12-fold
   increase (1109\%) of the polyphenol concentration in the oil whereby
   resistance to lipid oxidation increased by 38\%. The results represent a
   cost-effective method to enhance the oxidative stability of cold pressed
   oils.}},

Abstract = {{Objective African American women have a higher risk of spontaneous
   preterm birth than White and Latina women. Although Latina women are
   exposed to similar social determinants of health, they have lower rates
   of spontaneous preterm birth. One theory for this difference is the
   maternal stress biological pathway, whereby lifetime stressors, such as
   racial discrimination, lead to a premature activation of parturition. We
   investigated the prevalence of self-reported discrimination and its
   association with the prevalence of spontaneous preterm birth.
   Study Design Using data from the Community Child Health Research Network
   Study, a multisite cohort study from 2008 to 2012, we conducted a
   cross-sectional analysis of 1,154 African American women and 578 Latina
   women.
   Results Adjusting for multiple risk factors, African American and Latina
   women who experienced the highest tertile of discrimination had a higher
   prevalence of preterm birth compared with those who experienced
   discrimination less than once per year, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=1.5
   (0.7-3.1) and 3.6 (0.9-14.4), respectively.
   Conclusion In our cohort, we found a statistically significant
   association only in the medium discrimination group in Latina women, but
   we did not find a statistically significant association in African
   American women. Reduction in experienced discrimination may be an
   important intervention for reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes.}},

Title = {{Association Between beta-Blocker Use and Mortality/Morbidity in Patients
   With Heart Failure With Reduced, Midrange, and Preserved Ejection
   Fraction and Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION-HEART FAILURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   It is unknown if beta-blockers reduce mortality/morbidity in patients
   with heart failure (HF) and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), a
   population underrepresented in HF trials.
   Methods:
   Observational cohort of HF patients with advanced CKD (estimated
   glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) from the Swedish
   Heart Failure Registry between 2001 and 2016. We first explored
   associations between beta-blocker use, 5-year death, and the composite
   of cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization among 3775 patients with HF
   with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and advanced CKD. We compared
   observed hazards with those from a control cohort of 15 346 patients
   with HFrEF and moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60-30
   mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), for whom beta-blocker trials demonstrate benefit.
   Second, we explored outcomes associated to beta-blocker among advanced
   CKD participants with preserved (HFpEF; N=2009) and midrange ejection
   fraction (HFmrEF; N=1514).
   Results:
   During a median follow-up of 1.3 years, 2012 patients had a subsequent
   HF hospitalization, and 2849 died in the HFrEF cohort, of which 2016
   died due to cardiovascular causes. Among patients with HFrEF,
   beta-blocker use was associated with lower risk of death (adjusted
   hazard ratio 0.85 {[}95\% CI, 0.75-0.96]) and cardiovascular
   mortality/HF hospitalization (0.87 {[}0.77-0.98]) compared with nonuse.
   The magnitude of the associations was similar to that observed for HFrEF
   patients with moderate CKD. Conversely, no significant association was
   observed for beta-blocker users in advanced CKD with HFpEF (death: 0.88
   {[}0.77-1.02], cardiovascular mortality/HF hospitalization: 1.05
   {[}0.90-1.23]) or HFmrEF (death: 0.95 {[}0.79-1.14], cardiovascular
   mortality/HF hospitalization: 1.09 {[}0.90-1.31]).
   Conclusions:
   In HFrEF patients with advanced CKD, the use of beta-blockers was
   associated with lower morbidity and mortality. Although inconclusive due
   to limited power, these benefits were not observed in similar patients
   with HFpEF or HFmrEF.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline electrolytes impede the corrosion of Si photoanodes under
   positive potentials and/or illumination, due to the formation of a SiOx
   layer that etches 2-3 orders of magnitude more slowly than Si. Hence
   during water oxidation under illumination, pinholes in protection layers
   on Si photoanodes result in the local formation of a protective,
   stabilizing passive oxide on the Si surface. However, operation under
   natural diurnal insolation cycles additionally requires protection
   strategies that minimize the dark corrosive etching rate of Si at
   pinholes. We show herein that addition of {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) to 1.0 M
   KOH(aq) results in a self-healing process that extends the lifetime to
   >280 h of an np(+)-Si(100) photoanode patterned with an array of Ni
   catalyst islands operated under simulated day/night cycles. The
   self-healing {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) additive caused the exposed Si(100)
   surface to etch >180 times slower than the Si etch rate in 1.0 M KOH(aq)
   alone. No appreciable difference in etch rate or facet preference was
   observed between Si(100) and Si(111) surfaces in 1.0 M KOH(aq) with
   {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-), indicating that the surface conformally oxidized
   before Si dissolved. The presence of {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) minimally
   impacted the faradaic efficiency or overpotential of p(+)-Si/Ni
   electrodes for the oxygen-evolution reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is widely used worldwide.
   Intracranial manifestation as an adverse event of BCG is extremely rare.
   A previously healthy 16-month-old boy was referred to our hospital for
   eye contact difficulties and progressive gait disturbance lasting two
   months. He was inoculated with BCG at seven months of age. Brain
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hydrocephalus with widespread
   and disseminated enhancement lesions with thickening of the third
   ventricle floor, and brain tissue pathologically showed non-caseous
   granulomatous inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapies were initiated
   because of a provisional diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Three months
   later, a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for the
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was obtained. Eventually, M. bovis
   (BCG Tokyo 172 strain) was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   and shunt tube culture. The prolonged use of antituberculosis drugs and
   multiple shunt replacement surgeries were needed for recovery. There was
   no evidence of immunodeficiency. Unfortunately, he had severe
   neurological sequelae of bilateral blindness and neurodevelopmental
   delay. Our purpose in this report was to highlight the potential for
   intracranial manifestations of adverse reactions related to BCG
   vaccination. We propose that the CSF PCR assay of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis (MTB) complex should be applied repeatedly in children
   suspected of intractable neurosarcoidosis, with a history of BCG
   vaccination. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {{Real-world long-term outcomes in individuals at clinical risk for
   psychosis: The case for extending duration of care}},
Journal = {{ECLINICALMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{28}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most services for individuals at Clinical High Risk for
   Psychosis (CHR-P) provide short-term clinical care. This study
   determines the real-world and long-term clinical outcomes beyond
   transition to psychosis in a large cohort of CHR-P individuals.
   Method: Retrospective RECORD-compliant real-world Electronic Health
   Records (EHR) cohort study in secondary mental health care (the South
   London and the Maudsley -SLaM- NHS Foundation Trust). All CHR-P patients
   accessing the CHR-P service at SLaM in the period 2001-2018 were
   included. Main outcomes were long-term cumulative risk of first: (i)
   developing an ICD-10 psychotic disorder (primary outcome), receiving a
   treatment with (iia) antipsychotic medication, (iib) benzodiazepines,
   (iic) other psychotropic medications, (iid) psychotherapy, receiving an
   (iiia) informal or (iiib) compulsory admission into a mental health
   hospital, and the time to these events; (iiic) number of days spent in
   hospital and (iv) cumulative risk of death for any reason and age/gender
   Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR). Data were extracted from the EHR and
   analysed with Kaplan Meier failure functions, Cox and zero-inflated
   negative binomial regressions.
   Findings: 600 CHR-P patients (80.43\% Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms,
   APS; 18.06\%, Brief and Limited Intermittent Psychotic Symptoms, BLIPS,
   1.51\% Genetic Risk and Deterioration Syndrome) were included (mean age
   22.63 years, range 13-36; 55.33\% males; 46.44\% white, mean duration of
   untreated attenuated psychotic symptoms 676.32 days, 1105.40 SD). The
   cumulative risk to first psychosis was 0.365 (95\%CI 0.302-0.437) at 11
   years; first antipsychotic 0.777 (95\%CI 0.702-0.844) at 9 years; first
   benzodiazepine 0.259 (95\%CI 0.183-0.359) at 12 years; first other types
   of medications 0.630 (95\%CI 0.538-0.772) at 9 years; first
   psychotherapy 0.814 (95\%CI 0.764-0.859) at 9 years; first informal
   admission 0.378 (95\%CI 0.249-0.546) at 12 years; first compulsory
   admission 0.251 (95\%CI 0.175-0.352) at 12 years; those admitted spent
   on average 94.84 (SD=169.94) days in hospital; the cumulative risk of
   death for any reason was 0.036 (95\%CI 0.012-0.103) at 9 years, with an
   SMR of 3.9 (95\%CI 1.20-6.6). Compared to APS, BLIPS had a higher risk
   of developing psychosis, being admitted compulsorily into hospital,
   receiving antipsychotics and benzodiazepines and lower probability of
   receiving psychotherapy. Other prognostic factors of long-term outcomes
   included age, symptoms severity, duration of untreated attenuated
   psychotic symptoms, ethnicity and employment status.
   Interpretation: Duration of care provided by CHR-P services should be
   expanded to address long-term real-world outcomes. (C) 2020 The

Title = {{Implementing mechanical biological treatment in an emerging waste
   management system predominated by waste pickers: A Brazilian case study}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) could be a decisive game-changer
   for the development of household solid waste management (e.g., reduce
   waste in landfills). However, in a nascent household waste management
   (HSWM) system, which is characterized by divergent interest groups
   ranging from the national government, municipalities, waste pickers and
   householders as providers of waste, implementing MBTs could create
   positive but also adverse impacts, in particular on waste pickers (WPs).
   Formal WPs are in cities, like Belo Horizonte (Brazil), a constituent
   part of the HSWM. This study builds strategies as a form of normative
   scenarios to assist decision-making processes to deal with WPs and
   implement MBTs systems. The present study includes material and energy
   flows, life cycle environmental impacts and social indicators
   characterized by the number of active WPs and capacity building. The
   results show that an integrated commitment of the local society can
   reduce landfilling by 70\% and global warming emissions to a quarter. An
   emphasis on greenhouse gas emissions, like Belo Horizonte's promise for
   long-term attitude, brings a broad commitment to developing HSWM since a
   functioning system based on focused strategies will consequently reflect
   a positive action on climate. Waste pickers can fulfill the estimated
   vacancies at MBT plants and promote their active life or not according
   to the capacity building. MBT has substantial room to grow. Therefore,
   this growth will only happen with new thoughts on the adaptability of
   MBT systems focused on sufficiency to secure fair conditions for local
   livelihoods and targets with systemic implications.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The development of rh immune globulin (RhIG) for the
   prevention of Rhesus D (RhD) alloimmunization has significantly
   decreased the incidence of RhD alloimmunization. Despite long-standing
   prevention, the experiences of RhD negative women with pregnancy is
   absent in the literature.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of RhD
   negative women with pregnancy.
   Methods: Utilizing an Interpretive Description approach, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with RhD negative women about their
   pregnancies. This study took place within the geographic context of
   northern British Columbia (BC). The analysis involved a two-cycle
   approach to identify themes within the data.
   Findings: Sixteen RhD negative women that live in northern BC
   participated in this study. The analysis identified that RhD negative
   women are uninformed and want to be involved in the decision-making
   process regarding the prevention of RhD alloimmunization. The themes
   that emerged from the interview data were communication,
   information-seeking behaviour, out of sight out of mind, choice and
   trust, and patient advocacy.
   Discussion: The participants in this study described lacking information
   regarding the prevention of RhD alloimmunization. They sought
   information to overcome the gaps in knowledge and a desire to be
   involved in the decision-making process.
   Conclusion: RhD negative women want information and to be involved in
   the decision-making process in the prevention of RhD alloimmunization.
   Working with RhD negative women to develop decision-aids and/or other
   educational tools to aid in the decision-making process are warranted.

Abstract = {{The lithium-rich brines of the Salar de Olaroz in the Central Andes of
   NW Argentina are considered to be of great economic and strategic
   interest. This study focused on the fluid source(s) and geochemical
   processes governing the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the
   surficial waters of Olaroz (residual brines, ephemeral lakes, rivers and
   tributary streams), aiming to define the mechanisms leading to such a
   huge Li reservoir. The chemistry of the Rosario River, which is one of
   the main sources of recharge of the Salar de Olaroz, is mostly
   controlled by fluid inputs from hydrothermal systems located north of
   the salar (in the volcanic areas of Rosario de Coyaguayma, Pairique, and
   Cono Panizo). The hydrothermal fluids are characterized by relatively
   high Li concentrations, as they interact with Li-rich rocks pertaining
   to Miocene - Pliocene volcanic formations, Ordovician sedimentary
   deposits, and, possibly, pre-Ordovician crystalline basement. In the
   salar, the hyperarid climate regulates the relative proportion between
   supplied waters and evaporation, inducing deposition/dissolution of
   salts, which controls the concentrations of main ions in brines and
   ephemeral lakes. Hence, the peculiar combination of a Li-rich primary
   source, the hydrothermal scavenging by geothermal fluids that feed the
   Rosario River, and secondary concentration processes affecting the
   surficial water within the salar leads to the formation of the huge Li
   reservoir characterizing this area.}},

   a stochastic market price modeled by a geometric Brownian process. We
   assume that there are delay constraints imposed on the decisions of the
   manager. More precisely, starting harvesting order and selling order are
   executed after a delay. By using the dynamic programming approach, we
   characterize the value function as the unique solution to an original
   partial differential equation. We complete our study with some numerical
   illustrations.}},

Abstract = {{Natural plant-based materials have several advantages. They are
   biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, cost-effective, and easily
   available. It can undergo chemical modification such as capping and
   stabilizing agent as well. Bio convivial and compatible approaches are
   made to utilize the renewable source of extract of Cassia fistula as
   efficient capping and stabilizing agent to prepare zinc oxide
   nanomaterial. Biogenic way to synthesize the ZnO nanoparticles involves
   aqueous extract of plant material. The extract along with 20 mL of
   aqueous solution of zinc acetate (0.2 M) stirred for an hour at pH 12
   maintain by addition of NaOH (0.4 M) at room temperature under vigorous
   stirring for 2 h, which resulted in the formation of a white suspension
   ZnO nanoparticles. A ZnO nanoparticle prepared by chemical method
   characterized by XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM and EDAX clearly indicates rod shaped
   nanoparticles. Whereas, the biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles using
   aqeous extract of Cassia fistula flower shows Cluster of rods less than
   0.5 mu m and ZnO nanoparticles using aqeous extract of Cassia fistula
   stem shows flat layered pentagonal structure with deposition of
   particles which was less than1 mu m with weak physical force.In vitro
   antibacterial activity of ZnO nanomaterial's shows maximum zone of
   inhibition for nanoparticles prepared from stem (CFS-ZnO nanoparticles)
   against Proteusmirabilis, Staphyllococcusalbus, and Lactobacillus.
   Antifungal activity of ZnO nanomaterial shows maximum zone of inhibition
   for nanoparticles prepared from stem (CFS-ZnO nanoparticles). In case of
   the ZnO nanoparticles prepared by green synthesis shows potency compared
   to ZnO nanoparticles prepares as it is against S. mutans reported for
   the first time The ZnO nanoparticles prepared from the green route can
   be formulated in the form of a mouth wash, or as an intracanal
   medicament where an antimicrobial agent is required.}},

Abstract = {{In automotive applications, Cu/Al2O3/Cu compounds are widely used as
   substrates in electronic power devices due to their high thermal and

   The significance of this research are Vickers hardness measurements that
   reveal the hardening of Cu in Cu/Al2O3/Cu compounds under thermal
   cycling for the first time. A key finding was that the Cu hardening
   dictates the characteristics of the observed crack propagation path.
   Using a kinematic and isotropic Cu hardening model in finite element
   simulations and a fracture mechanical modeling methodology, we were able
   to predict the crack path in very good agreement with experimental
   observations.}},

Journal = {{TOXICON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Domoic acid (DA) is an excitatory marine neurotoxin produced by diatoms
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. as a defence compound that accumulates in the food
   web and is associated with amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans.
   Although its toxicity has been well established in marine species, there
   is limited data on DA cytogenotoxicity in human non-target cells.
   Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cytogenotoxic potential of DA
   (0.01-10 mu g/mL) in human peripheral blood cells (HPBCs) using a
   battery of bioassays in vitro. In addition, the influence of DA on
   oxidative stress parameters as a possible mechanism of action was
   assessed. Results revealed that DA induced dose- and time-dependent
   cytotoxic effects. DA significantly affected genomic instability by
   increasing the frequency of micronuclei and nuclear buds. Furthermore, a
   slight induction of primary DNA strand breaks was detected after 24 h of
   exposure accompanied by a significant increase in the number of abnormal
   size tailed nuclei. No induction of hOGG1 (human 8-oxoguanine DNA
   glycosylase) sensitive sites was determined upon exposure to DA.
   Additionally, DA induced oxidative stress by increased production of
   reactive oxygen species accompanied by changes in glutathione,
   superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels.
   Overall, the obtained results showed adverse genotoxic effects of DA in
   non-target HPBCs.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We examine the impact of social entrepreneurship orientation (SEO), a
   behavioral measure of the social entrepreneurship of the organization,
   on the social and financial performance of a sample of Austrian firms.
   Despite growing research interests in social entrepreneurship, the field
   remains fragmented and this has led to calls for a careful examination
   of the implications of social entrepreneurship for firms. We draw on
   stakeholder theory and hybrid organizing to hypothesize that social
   performance mediates the SEO-financial performance relationship. By
   analyzing a sample of 1,156 companies, we find that the SEO-financial
   performance relationship is partially positively mediated by social
   performance even though the direct effect is negative. Our results show
   that social performance compensates for the otherwise negative effect
   SEO has directly with financial performance. We contribute to an
   understanding of the mechanisms by which an SEO affects firm performance
   and provide richer insights into the various aspects of performance. We
   discuss the future implications of our study and suggest promising
   avenues for further research on the SEO construct.}},

Abstract = {{Red mud-based inorganic polymer spheres were used as alternative pH
   regulators and process enhancers in sequencing batch anaerobic reactors
   treating cheese whey. This byproduct tends to quickly acidify under
   anaerobic conditions, and the common route to control pH and ensure
   suitable conditions for methane production involves the use of
   commercial alkaline raw materials. The spheres were synthesized using
   significant amounts of hazardous and toxic waste, red mud (50 wt\% of
   solid components), whose recycling is challenging. The inorganic
   polymeric spheres, when compared to virgin alkaline raw materials,
   improved organic matter removal by 44\%, prevented VFA accumulation
   (acidification degree less than 20\%), maintained pH values in a range
   (6.5-7.2) to ensure maximum methanogenic activity by archaea
   microorganisms, and boosted the methane volume by similar to 90\%. These
   promising results demonstrate the feasibility and performance advantages
   of using these innovative spheres instead of virgin raw materials, which

Title = {{A RISC-V Processor Design for Transparent Tracing}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Code instrumentation enables the observability of an embedded software
   system during its execution. A usage example of code instrumentation is
   the estimation of ``worst-case execution time{''} using hybrid analysis.
   This analysis combines static code analysis with measurements of the
   execution time on the deployment platform. Static analysis of source
   code determines where to insert the tracing instructions, so that later,
   the execution time can be captured using a logic analyser. The main
   drawback of this technique is the overhead introduced by the execution
   of trace instructions. This paper proposes a modification of the
   architecture of a RISC pipelined processor that eliminates the execution
   time overhead introduced by the code instrumentation. In this way, it
   allows the tracing to be non-intrusive, since the sequence and execution
   times of the program under analysis are not modified by the introduction
   of traces. As a use case of the proposed solution, a processor, based on
   RISC-V architecture, was implemented using VHDL language. The processor,
   synthesized on a FPGA, was used to execute and evaluate a set of
   examples of instrumented code generated by a ``worst-case execution
   time{''} estimation tool. The results validate that the proposed
   architecture executes the instrumented code without overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores a new filtering problem for the class of delayed
   discrete-time complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) via state-feedback
   control design. The novelty of this article comes from the consideration
   of the newly developed complex-valued reciprocal convex matrix
   inequality as well as the complex-valued Jensen-based summation
   inequalities (JSIs). By employing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional (LKF) and by using newly proposed complex-valued
   inequalities, attention is concentrated on the design of a
   state-feedback filter such that the associated filtering error system is
   asymptotically stable with prescribed filter and control gain matrices.
   The proposed theoretical results are presented in terms of
   complex-valued linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can be solved
   numerically by using the YALMIP toolbox in MATLAB software.
   Additionally, one numerical example is given to confirm the validity of
   the resulting sufficient conditions with the availability of the
   suitable control and filter design.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive spine surgery techniques for pedicle screw
   instrumentation are being more frequently used. They offer shorter
   operative times, shorter hospital stays for patients, faster recovery,
   less blood loss, and less damage to surrounding tissues. However, they
   may rely heavily on fluoroscopic imaging, and confer radiation exposure
   to the surgeon and team members. Use of the AIRO Mobile Intraoperative
   CT by Brainlab during surgery is a way to eliminate radiation exposure
   to staff and may improve accuracy rates for pedicle screw
   instrumentation. We designed a retrospective analysis of our first 12
   patients who had a total of 59 pedicle screws inserted when we began to
   incorporate the AIRO iCT scanner to our surgical workflow. During
   pedicle screw insertion, projection images were saved, and compared to
   CT scans gone at the end of the case. We measured the distances between
   the projected and postprocedural screw locations, at both the screw tips
   and tulip heads. We observed a mean of 2.8 mm difference between the
   projection and postprocedural images. None of the screws inserted had
   any clinically significant complications, and no patient required
   revision surgery. Overall, iCT guided navigation with the AIRO system is
   a safe adjunct to spinal surgery. It decreased operator and staff
   radiation exposure, and helped facilitate successful MIS surgery without
   fluoroscopic imaging. Additional studies and research can be done to
   further improve accuracy and reliability.}},

   steel-concrete vertical hybrid structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{174}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Steel-concrete vertical hybrid structure (S-RC structure) is usually
   composed of upper steel and lower reinforced concrete (RC) structures.
   The transfer joint between them is the key part to ensure the vertical
   structural internal force transferring. This study proposed a new kind
   of joint by inserting the upper steel column into the lower RC column.
   To study the seismic performance of this joint, four specimens are
   tested under cyclic loading. The effects of axial force ratio, steel
   column size, and embedded depth ratio are investigated and discussed.
   Test results show that the failure patterns are typical beam flexural
   failure with plastic hinges formed at the beam ends adjacent to the
   corbel. All the specimens exhibited satisfied seismic performance with
   stable load-displacement response, excellent energy dissipation capacity
   and ductility. Furthermore, the increase of steel column size shows
   positive influence on the joint strength and stiffness, and larger axial
   force ratio can greatly improve the energy dissipation capacity, while
   increasing the embedded depth ratio only improves the strength by less
   than 10\%. Finally, calculation methods for the bearing capacity and
   design suggestions on the embedded depth ratio of the steel column are
   both proposed for the new joint, which provide useful guidance on the
   design of the transfer joint in S-RC structures. (C) 2020 Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Tian Shan is one of the largest and most active intracontinental
   orogenic belts in the world, which has experienced complex deformation,
   resulting in the formation of several fold-and-thrust belts (FTBs) in
   the piedmonts. Investigations on when and how the Cenozoic compressional
   deformation has reached the leading edge of the FTBs will improve our
   understanding of the characteristics and mechanism of deformation
   propagation in contractional orogenic wedges. In this study, we focus on
   the kinematic evolution of the Nanka (South Kalayuergun) and Yangtake
   anticlines at the southern limit of the western Kuqa FTB where the
   Paleocene-Eocene Kumugeliemu Formation (E(1-2)km) salt has been involved
   into deformation via the area-depth strain (ADS) analysis of petroleum
   seismic reflection profiles. The results indicate that these two
   detachment folds have experienced two-stage tectonic shortening almost
   synchronously since the late Miocene, which are in contrast to the
   previously inferred progressive eastward elongation. The initial age of
   folding is temporally consistent with that of the Yaken anticline in the
   eastern sector where the detachment is the Miocene Jidike Formation
   (N(1)j) salt, suggesting that salt probably has facilitated the
   basinward propagation of structural deformation to reach its external
   pinch-out rapidly. Meanwhile, the salt-lubricated detachment has also
   promoted the lateral fold propagation, and hence the present length was
   quickly reached at a very early stage. The simultaneous, episodic
   deformation at the leading edge demonstrated by our analysis is
   consistent with the results of analog and numerical modeling, which
   would further our understanding of structural development and
   topographic expression in salt-bearing FTBs.}},

Title = {{Refined Seismic Design Method for RC Frame Structures to Increase the
   Collapse Resistant Capacity}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In current structural design codes, elastic vibration modes are used for
   seismic design. However, when a structure is subjected to strong
   earthquakes and inelastic response or even when collapse damage is
   observed, the damage state is always unevenly distributed along the
   height of the structure. Such a phenomenon implies the materials of
   stories with elastic response and slight damage are not fully utilized.
   In this paper, a new practical and effective method, which improves
   collapse resistant capacity by making full use of materials, is proposed
   for reinforcement concrete (RC) frame structures at a structural
   collapse state. In this method, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is
   used to evaluate the structural collapse capacity. Tangent\_ratio (TR)
   is formulated based on the IDA curves, and the longitudinal
   reinforcement of columns is modified based on the TR to achieve uniform
   distribution of damage along the height of building. Fewer variables are
   optimized and constraints of the provisions in current codes are
   considered, which makes the proposed procedure more computationally
   efficient and practical. The proposed method is employed on a 5-story RC
   frame structure to illustrate its feasibility and practicality.
   Comparison work indicates that the refined seismic design method can
   significantly increase the collapse resistant capacity and decrease the
   maximum inter-story drift ratio response under strong ground motion in a
   few iterative steps without a cost increase.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) could be
   improved by identifying critical subsets that maximize diagnostic
   accuracy and eliminate low information elements.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify optimal SCAT subsets for acute concussion
   assessment.
   METHODS: Using Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE)
   Consortium data, we compared student-athletes' and cadets' preinjury
   baselines (n = 2178) with postinjury assessments within 6 h (n = 1456)
   and 24 to 48 h (n = 2394) by considering demographics, symptoms,
   Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), and Balance Error Scoring
   System (BESS) scores. We divided data into training/testing (60\%/40\%)
   sets. Using training data, we integrated logistic regression with an
   engineering methodology-mixed integer programming-to optimize models
   with <= 4, 8, 12, and 16 variables (Opt-k). We also created models
   including only raw scores (Opt-RS-k) and symptom, SAC, and BESS
   composite scores (summary scores). We evaluated models using testing
   data.
   RESULTS: At < 6 h and 24 to 48 h, most Opt-k and Opt-RS-k models
   included the following symptoms: do not feel right, headache, dizziness,
   sensitivity to noise, and whether physical or mental activity worsens
   symptoms. Opt-k models included SAC concentration and delayed recall
   change scores. Opt-k models had lower Brier scores (BS) and greater area
   under the curve (AUC) (<6 h: BS = 0.072-0.089, AUC = 0.95-0.96; 24-48 h:
   BS = 0.085-0.093, AUC = 0.94-0.95) than Opt-RS-k (< 6 h: BS =
   0.082-0.087, AUC = 0.93-0.95; 24-48 h: BS = 0.095-0.099, AUC =
   0.92-0.93) and summary score models (<6 h: BS = 0.14, AUC = 0.89; 24-48
   h: BS = 0.15, AUC = 0.87).
   CONCLUSION: We identified SCAT subsets that accurately assess acute
   concussion and improve administration time over the complete battery,
   highlighting the importance of eliminating ``noisy{''} elements. These
   findings can direct clinicians to the SCAT components that are most
   sensitive to acute concussion.}},

Abstract = {{Syringomyelia is a cystic cavity of the spinal cord, and is considered a
   progressive and degenerative condition. There are multiple and varied
   ways to classify it, based mainly on its origin, or on known production
   mechanisms. A 27-year-old patient with a four-month history of motor
   impairment, which began in the upper limbs and continued with clumsy
   gait, was presented. On physical examination, he presented paretospastic
   gait, quadriparesis with a predominance of weakness in the upper limbs
   with respect to the lower ones, as well as crural and left brachial
   spasticity, with right brachial hypotonia, associated with distal
   atrophy of both upper limbs and suspended thermal and painful
   hypoesthesia of the limb upper right. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
   showed a wide syringomyelic cavity in the cervical spine, with descent
   of the cerebellar tonsils, compatible with type I Chiari malformation.
   Although the association of both entities is common, progressive motor
   deficit in a young patient is a reason for admission or consultation
   rare in the Neurology Service. In these cases, decompressive treatment
   can decrease the size of the syringomyelic cavity.}},

Abstract = {{The turbulent phenomena occurring in the thin slab mold affect the final
   product quality. Therefore, it is essential to carry out studies to
   understand and control their occurrence. Current research aims to study
   the electromagnetic brake (EMBr) effects on the flow patterns in a
   funnel thin slab mold. The objective is to prevent the detrimental
   phenomenon known as dynamic distortions (DD) of the flow, applying the
   EMBr in the typical horizontal position (H-EMBr) and a new vertical
   position close to the narrow faces (V-EMBr). The fluid dynamics are
   simulated using the Reynolds stress model (RSM), the Volume of Fluid
   (VOF) model and the Maxwell equations in their magnetohydrodynamics
   (MHD) simplification. The results show that the H-EMBr effectively
   counteracts the DD phenomenon by reducing the submerged entry nozzle
   (SEN) ports' mass flow rate differences. The EMBr reduces the highest
   meniscus fluctuations from -10 to +/- 3 mm with a field intensity of
   0.1T and almost 0 mm for higher field intensities. In contrast, the
   V-EMBr configuration does not reduce or control at all the DD
   phenomenon, even though eliminating the upper roll flows does not
   diminish the meniscus fluctuation amplitudes and induces new small roll
   flows close to the SEN's wall.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites sometimes expand their host range and cause new disease
   aetiologies. Genetic changes can then occur due to host-specific
   adaptive alterations, particularly when parasites cross between
   evolutionarily distant hosts. Characterizing genetic variation in
   Cryptosporidium from humans and other animals may have important
   implications for understanding disease dynamics and transmission. We
   analyse sequences from four loci (gp60, HSP-70, COWP and actin)
   representing multiple Cryptosporidium species reported in humans. We
   predicted low genetic diversity in species that present unusual human
   infections due to founder events and bottlenecks. High genetic diversity
   was observed in isolates from humans of Cryptosporidium meleagridis,
   Cryptosporidium cuniculus, Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium
   parvum. A deviation of expected values of neutrality using Tajima's D
   was observed in C. cuniculus and C. meleagridis. The high genetic
   diversity in C. meleagridis and C. cuniculus did not match our
   expectations but deviations from neutrality indicate a recent decrease
   in genetic variability through a population bottleneck after an
   expansion event. Cryptosporidium hominis was also found with a
   significant Tajima's D positive value likely caused by recent population
   expansion of unusual genotypes in humans. These insights indicate that
   changes in genetic diversity can help us to understand host-parasite
   adaptation and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Competitiveness of SMEs (Small or Medium Enterprise) within the tourism
   field has been of a great interest for many scholars over time. Due to
   the crisis conditions specific to the present time, the issue of
   competitiveness becomes a very sensitive one, giving rise to sometimes
   contradictory points of view. Our research aims to analyze the opinions
   and perceptions of SME managers in the field of tourism in terms of the
   concept of competitiveness, how to measure it and sources of
   competitiveness still viable within the context of the current crisis or
   specific to it, etc. In order to be able to properly analyze the above,
   qualitative research was initiated and conducted in the form of an
   in-depth interview with 42 Romanian SME managers in the tourism field.
   The results of the study reflect a mature approach of managers in terms
   of possible new sources of competitiveness-the emphasis on technical
   solutions capable of managing the socio-medical dimensions of tourism
   consumer behavior, a prevalence for an organic growth strategy and for
   additional investments in qualified personnel, as well as online
   management of most aspects related to services and openness to
   collaboration within tourism clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were reconstructed from sediment cores
   collected in the Martot and Les Damps ponds, downstream of the Eure
   River watershed. PAHs exhibited a positive correlation with fine
   fractions, but mainly with the refractory organic carbon measured in the
   sediments, which suggests PAH inputs from materials largely composed of
   refractory carbon (e.g. soot). Since around the 1940s, PAH
   concentrations ranged between 2.93-38.20 and 2.27-28.20 mg kg(-1) in
   sediment cores from the Martot and Les Damps ponds, respectively. Based
   on the temporal distribution of isomers and diagnostic ratios, the PAHs
   in the sediments were found to be predominantly of pyrogenic origin,
   particularly in the 1940s-1960s, when PAH levels were particularly high.
   PCBs also showed an affinity with the fine fraction and with refractory
   organic carbon, albeit less so than PAHs. Since around the 1940s, PCB
   concentrations ranged between 0.02-1.57 in Martot Pond and 0.09-1.60 mg
   kg(-1) in Les Damps Pond. The recorded PCB temporal trends were mainly
   associated with the production, consumption, and banning of these
   chemicals in France. According to the temporal distribution of PCB
   congeners, high levels in the 1950s-1970s were linked to ``technical
   mixture{''} discharges into waterways, which were mainly composed of
   ``low chlorinated congeners{''}, whereas PCB levels after the 1970s were
   of atmospheric origin.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Despite the rising trend of medicolegal challenges in India,
   there is an absolute dearth of literature from India on this issue. The
   authors conducted a survey, to their knowledge a first of its kind, to
   assess the perceptions of Indian neurosurgeons about the medicolegal
   challenges faced in everyday practice.
   METHODS An anonymous online survey performed using Google Forms was
   widely circulated among neurosurgeons practicing in India via email and
   social media platforms. The questionnaire consisted of 38 questions
   covering the various aspects of medicolegal issues involved in
   neurosurgery practice.
   RESULTS A total of 221 survey responses were received, out of which 214
   responses were included in the final analysis, barring 7 responders who
   had no work experience in India. The respondents were categorized
   according to their working arrangements and work experience. Out of all
   of the respondents, 20 (9.3\%) had >= 1 malpractice suits filed against
   them. More than 90\% of the respondents believed that malpractice suits
   are on the rise in India. Almost half of the respondents believed the
   advent of teleconsultation is further compounding the risk of
   malpractice suits, and 66.4\% of respondents felt that they were
   inadequately trained during residency to deal with medicolegal issues.
   Most respondents (88.8\%) felt that neurosurgeons working in the
   government sector had lesser chances of facing litigations in comparison
   to those working in the private sector. The practice of obtaining video
   proof of consent was more commonly reported by respondents working in
   freelancing and private settings (45.1\%) and those with multiple
   affiliations (61.3\%) compared to respondents practicing in government
   settings (22.8\%) (p < 0.001). Neurosurgeons working in the private
   sector were more likely to alter management and refer sick patients to
   higher-volume treatment centers to avoid malpractice suits than their
   government counterparts (p = 0.043 and 0.006, respectively). The
   practices pertaining to legal preparedness were also found to be
   significantly higher among the respondents from the private sector (p <
   0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS This survey highlights the apprehensions of neurosurgeons in
   India with regard to rising malpractice suits and the subsequent
   increase of defensive neurosurgical practices, especially in the private
   sector. A stronger legal framework for providing for quick redress of
   patient complaints, while deterring frivolous malpractice suits, can go
   a long way to allay these fears. There is a dire need for systematic
   training of neurosurgeons regarding legal preparedness, which should
   begin during residency.}},

   rarefied gas flows. In the present work, the variation of the Poiseuille
   number with respect to the Mach number has been documented for a 3D
   microchannel of aspect ratio (width/height) 0.49. Measurements of mass
   flow rate, static pressure, and temperature have been conducted with
   nitrogen in highly compressible and slightly rarefied (slip flow)
   regime: outlet Mach number (0.43-0.99), outlet Knudsen number (4.04 x
   10(-3)-7.04 x 10(-3)), and pressure ratio (8.17-8.72). The present 3D
   measurements are compared with available analytical solutions for
   isothermal and adiabatic flows. A maximum deviation of only 4.8\% from
   the adiabatic slip flow solution points toward the adiabatic nature of
   the exit choked state, which is being experimentally demonstrated for
   the first time in the highly compressible slip flow regime. Furthermore,
   the influence of losses of microchannel end manifolds on the overall
   pressure drop is calculated to be negligible. We further propose the
   ranges of the area ratio, Reynolds number, and Knudsen number for which
   these losses continue to be unimportant for gaseous slip flow. This
   study gives insights into the influence of subsonic choking on the
   frictional resistance at various mass flow rates and is relevant for
   future space expeditions and in certain biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Methods for measuring frailty over-emphasise physical
   health, and consensus for a more holistic approach is increasing.
   However, holistic tools have had mixed success in meeting the validation
   criteria required of a frailty index. We report on the further
   development and validation of a Frailty Tool designed for use in the
   community with a greater emphasis on psychological markers, Holland et
   al's Community-Oriented Frailty Index (COM-FI).
   Method: A total of 351 participants aged 58-96 were recruited from
   Retirement Villages and local communities across the West Midlands of
   the UK. Participants completed a series of measures designed to assess
   frailty and outcomes associated with frailty over a 2-year period.
   Results: All three candidate items ('polypharmacy', `exercise
   frequency', and the Coronary Heart Disease and Diabetes joint effect')
   were incorporated into the tool, and one variable, `falls' was removed
   from the index. The revised COM-FI was shown to be valid and met
   Rockwood's validation criteria (Rockwood et al., 2006), with the
   exception that in this specific sample there was no significant gender
   difference and the index did not predict mortality.
   Discussion: Overall, the COM-FI is a valid and reliable tool, although
   the capacity for the COM-FI to predict mortality over a 2-year period
   remains inconclusive given the small numbers of people at the higher
   ends of the frailty range. Prediction of need for social care was good,
   showing the utility of this community based tool.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on red and blue quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) has identified
   peculiar number distributions as a function of radio-loudness that we
   explore and attempt to explain from the perspective of a picture in
   which a subset of the population of active galaxies evolves from the
   radio-loud to the radio-quiet state. Because the time evolution is
   slowed down by an order of magnitude or more for the radio-quiet phase,
   the numbers of red and blue QSOs approach each other at the extreme end
   of the radio-quiet range of radio-loudness with larger numbers. The
   rapid time evolution of most radio-loud phases, instead, makes the
   numbers similar but lower at the far radio-loud end. At the midpoint of
   radio-loudness, instead, the differences between red and blue QSOs
   experience their largest values which results from accretion rapidly
   spinning black holes down but subsequently spinning them up more slowly.
   Recovering these basic features of the observations is evidence for
   rapid evolution away from radio-loudness and slow evolution in
   radio-quiet states.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through cosmic
   structures can provide invaluable information on the geometry and
   content of our Universe as well as on the fundamental theory of gravity.
   In order to test possible departures from General Relativity, it is
   essential to analyze, in a modified gravity setting, how GWs propagate
   through a perturbed cosmological space-time. Working within the
   framework of geometrical optics, we develop tools to address this topic
   for a broad class of scalar-tensor theories, including scenarios with
   non-minimal, derivative couplings between scalar and tensor modes. By
   focussing on a set-up where scalar modes propagate with the same speed
   as tensor degrees of freedom, we determine the corresponding evolution
   equations for the GW amplitude and polarization tensor. The former
   satisfies a generalized evolution equation that includes possible
   effects due to a variation of the effective Planck scale; the latter can
   fail to be parallel transported along the GW geodesics unless certain
   conditions are satisfied. We apply our general formulas to specific
   scalar-tensor theories with unit tensor speed, and then focus on GW
   propagation on a perturbed space-time. We determine corrections to
   standard formulas for the GW luminosity distance and for the evolution
   of the polarization tensor, which depend both on modified gravity and on
   the effects of cosmological perturbations. Our results can constitute a
   starting point to disentangle among degeneracies from different sectors
   that can influence GW propagation through cosmological space-times.}},

Title = {{Design of Fractional Order Controllers Using the PM Diagram}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a modeling and controller tuning method for
   non-rational systems. First, a graphical tool is proposed where transfer
   functions are represented in a four-dimensional space. The magnitude is
   represented in decibels as the third dimension and a color code is
   applied to represent the phase in a fourth dimension. This tool, which
   is called Phase Magnitude (PM) diagram, allows the user to visually
   obtain the phase and the magnitude that have to be added to a system to
   meet some control design specifications. The application of the PM
   diagram to systems with non-rational transfer functions is discussed in
   this paper. A fractional order Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)
   controller is computed to control different non-rational systems. The
   tuning method, based on evolutionary computation concepts, relies on a
   cost function that defines the behavior in the frequency domain. The
   cost value is read in the PM diagram to estimate the optimum controller.
   To validate the contribution of this research, four different
   non-rational reference systems have been considered. The method proposed
   here contributes first to a simpler and graphical modeling of these
   complex systems, and second to provide an effective tool to face the
   unsolved control problem of these systems.}},

Abstract = {{The developing literature on consumer information and vertical relations
   has yet to consider information provision via costly retail price
   advertising. By exploring this, we show that the double marginalisation
   problem exists in equilibrium despite an upstream supplier offering a

   to strategically reduce retailers' advertising expenditure in order to
   extract additional rents. We then demonstrate how vertical restraints,

   captures GPS data from professional soccer players of some Brazilian
   teams. This set of data has a lot of features and the One Sports asked
   if it was possible to predict the ideal position of a player. Then, was
   firmed cooperation between an academic study and a commercial company.
   This work finds to understand the proposed methods and techniques to
   predict the ideal position of the soccer player, using machine learning
   algorithms. The database has more than one million tuples. It was
   submitted to the preprocessing step, which is fundamental, because it
   generated new features, removed incomplete and noisy data, generated a
   new balanced dataset and delete outliers, preparing the data to
   execution of the algorithms k-NN, decision trees, logistic regression,
   SVM and neural networks. With the purpose to understand the performance
   and accuracy, some scenarios were tested. There were poor results when
   executed multiclass problems. The best results come from binary
   problems. The models k-NN and SVM, specifically to this study, had the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for rationalization of irrational
   coefficients of filters designed using three-step lifting scheme. The
   existing three-step lifting schemes result in the irrational filter
   coefficients which require infinite precision for implementation. In
   this work, Euler-Frobenius halfband polynomials are designed to obtain
   the required kernels of three-step lifting structure. Next, the
   efficient rationalization of the designed filter banks (FBs) is proposed
   to reduce the arithmetic complexity. The proposed rational FBs preserve
   perfect reconstruction, near-orthogonality and regularity properties of
   wavelet FBs. These filters with rational coefficients are then used in
   image compression algorithms to compress the test images in well-known
   Classic, EPFL, RAISE, FiveK datasets and chromosome image datasets. The
   performance of the proposed rational FBs is compared with the existing
   rational FBs. It is observed that the performance of the proposed
   rational FBs is improved in terms of computational cost,
   encoding-decoding time and compression ratio as compared to existing
   rational FBs.}},

Title = {{Distal paravertebral nerve block in sheep undergoing laparohysterotomy:
   Comparing the use of 1\% and 2\% lignocaine hydrochloride}},
Journal = {{SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The study was designed as a blinded, randomized, prospective, clinical
   trial to compare the use of 1\% and 2\% lignocaine hydrochloride for
   distal paravertebral nerve block in sheep undergoing Caesarian section.
   Full-term ewes (n = 18) with dystocia requiring laparohysterotomy were
   randomly and equally allotted to two groups (I and II). They were
   administered ceftriaxone (10 mg kg(-1)) and meloxicam (0.3 mg kg(-1),
   IM) 30 min and diazepam (0.2 mg kg(-1), IV) 15 min before injecting 15.0
   mL (5.0 mL per spinal nerve) of either 1\% (Group I) or 2\% (Group II)
   lignocaine hydrochloride for achieving distal paravertebral anesthesia.
   Nociceptive stimuli during pre- and postoperative periods comprised of
   superficial and deep pinpricks. The reaction of the animals to the
   surgical intervention, manipulations and application of the sutures were
   recorded intraoperatively. Routine postoperative management included
   regular wound dressing, administration of the antibiotic and analgesic.
   The onset time (mean +/- standard deviation) of the regional anesthesia
   in group I and II ewes was 4.6 +/- 1.5 min and 5.4 +/- 2.8 min
   respectively. One sheep per group showed temporary, mild muscle
   twitching near ventral flank but required no rescue analgesia. The
   duration of surgery was 52 +/- 11 min and 60 +/- 11 min and the
   anesthesia lasted for 87 +/- 15 min and 98 +/- 17 min respectively.
   Significant difference between the groups was not detected in any of
   these variables. From this clinical study it is concluded that
   satisfactory flank anesthesia is achieved using 2\% or 1\% lignocaine
   hydrochloride for distal paravertebral nerve block. The recommendation
   to use 1\% instead of 2\% local anesthetic preparation for safety in
   small ruminants is thus validated.}},

Abstract = {{Preventive chemotherapy (PC) is a WHO-recommended strategy to control
   and eliminate schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). We
   assessed the prevalence, intensity, and correlates of schistosomiasis
   and STH infection after five rounds of PC in southern Ethiopia. A total
   of 3162 school children from four schools in Wondo Gennet and Hawella
   Tula districts were screened for Schistosoma mansoni and STHs infection.
   The overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 25.8\% (range between
   schools 11.6\% to 54.1\%), with light (19.1\%), moderate (5.3\%), and
   heavy (1.4\%) infection intensities. A total of 61.6\% S.
   mansoni-infected children were STH co-infected. The overall prevalence
   of STHs infection was 54.7\% (range between schools 30.6-71.0\%), with
   moderate-to-heavy intensity infections being 16.3\%. Ascaris
   lumbricoides was the most prevalent 45\% (95\% CI, 43.5-47) followed by
   Trichuris trichiura 25.3\% (95\% CI, 23.8-26.9) and hookworm 6.1\% (95\%
   CI, 5.3-7). A total of 33.7\% of STHs-infected children had A.
   lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infections. S. mansoni infection was
   significantly associated with school and STHs co-infection (p < 0.001).
   STH infection was correlated with school and younger age (p < 0.001).
   Despite repeated PC, S. mansoni and STH infection remain significant
   health problems, and the WHO target to control schistosomiasis and
   eliminate STH by 2020 may not be achieved. Intensified control and
   prevention measures, including drug efficacy surveillance, is
   recommended.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: In response to the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19),
   Italy established the national school closings from March 5, 2020. It
   has been shown that during school closures, there are significant
   decreases in the diagnoses of the respiratory infections. This has
   brought as well to a reduction in all those symptoms related to
   adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
   Methods: The study included 162 children, aged between 3 and 13 years,
   waiting for adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, eventually combined with
   tympanocentesis or tube insertion. Parents have been called to answer a
   telephone interview aimed at detecting how the symptoms related to
   adenotonsillar hypertrophy were changing during lockdown.
   Results: There was an improvement in the overall symptomatology of
   children during the lockdown period. The value attributed by parents to
   the children's general assessment during the lockdown period decreased
   significatively during the quarantine (p = 0,0000).
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that lockdown can have a
   positive impact on those specific diseases derived from precocious
   socialization and that it results to be particularly effective for the
   most vulnerable children. Indeed, lockdown has resulted to be so
   efficient that it has caused a modification in a medical and surgical
   therapeutic indication.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: A narrow distal aorta (NDA) makes endovascular aortic
   repair (EVAR) challenging and prone to immediate and late complications.
   We describe a case of an abdominal aortic false aneurysm (AAFA) with an
   NDA and iliac occlusive disease that was treated by an iliac branch
   device (IBD) placed at the aortic bifurcation.
   Case Report: A 76-year-old male patient suffering from severe bilateral
   calf claudication presented to our clinic. He had a history of ischemic
   heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and left colectomy for colon cancer.
   His workup revealed an AAFA with severe iliac occlusive disease. His
   aortic lumen and his aortic bifurcation were very narrow (10 mm)
   precluding a classic bifurcated EVAR.
   An open repair was not possible because of his multiple comorbidities.
   We successfully used an IBD by placing its Y configuration at the level
   of the aortic bifurcation, bridging the branch into one iliac artery
   with a balloon-expandable covered stent and extending the main component
   proximally up to the renal arteries with an aortic cuff.
   Conclusions: Bifurcated EVAR may not be suitable in patients with an
   NDA. Using an IBD at the level of the aortic bifurcation is feasible.
   This technique offers a total endovascular solution in high-risk
   patients for open repair.}},

Abstract = {{Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated proteins contribute to the
   pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through affecting synoviocyte
   proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production. The role of
   DERL3, an ER-associated degradation component, in joint inflammation of
   RA was explored. Synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis (OA)
   patients were collected, and in RA synovial tissue, DERL3 showed
   up-regulation and significantly positive correlation with the expression
   of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and
   matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. Immunofluorescence result suggested
   DERL3 was located in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Among different
   inflammatory stimuli, DERL3 could be up-regulated by TNF-alpha
   stimulation in FLS. Under TNF-alpha stimulation, knocking down DERL3,
   the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-13 was reduced and the
   activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway was
   inhibited. In pristaneinduced arthritis (PIA) rat model, Der13 was
   up-regulated in synovial tissue and disease was attenuated after
   intraarticular injection of siDerl3. Overall, we conclude that TNF-alpha
   inducing DERL3 expression promotes the inflammation of FLS through
   activation of NF-kappa B signaling pathway, suggesting DERL3 plays
   important roles in the pathogenesis of RA and is a promising therapeutic
   target.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly
   being used in patients with advanced heart failure as bridge to
   transplant, bridge to decision, or destination therapy. Infections are a
   major complication associated with LVADs. Staphylococcus aureus is one
   of the common causative organisms associated with LVAD infections.
   Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-colonized patients
   are at an increased risk for developing MRSA-associated infections.
   Various studies have demonstrated decolonization of skin with topical
   chlorhexidine and nares with 2\% intranasal mupirocin ointment is
   effective in reducing MRSA-associated infections.
   Objective: The objective of this observational study was to examine the
   impact of a universal decolonization protocol using topical
   chlorhexidine and intranasal mupirocin ointment for 5 days before LVAD
   implantation on postoperative infections (30, 60, and 90 days) and
   30-day infection-related rehospitalization.
   Methods: A preoperative universal decolonization with 4\% chlorhexidine
   daily whole-body bath and 2\% intranasal mupirocin ointment twice a day
   for 5 days was implemented for patients undergoing elective LVAD
   implantation. Using an observational study design, we included a
   convenience sample of 84 subjects who were established patients in an
   accredited advanced heart failure program. Thirty-seven patients served
   in the standard protocol group, and 47 in the universal decolonization
   protocol group participated in the observational study.
   Results: In the standard protocol group, there were 4 MRSA infections
   with none in the universal decolonization group (X-2 = 534, P =.03). In
   total, there were 8 surgical site infections in the standard protocol
   group and 1 in the universal decolonization group (X-2 = 5.95, P =.01).
   Conclusion: A 5-day universal decolonization protocol before LVAD
   implantation was effective in reducing total infections as well as
   MRSA-specific infections.}},

Abstract = {{Design and investigation of a new configuration of wideband
   dual-polarized magneto-electric dipole (MED) antenna for 2G/3G/4G base
   station applications operating from 1.7 to 2.7 GHz is presented. Two
   pairs of single-polarized MED antennas are arranged adjacent to each
   other to produce +/- 45 degrees dual-polarization. Each pair of dipoles
   excited through a 3-dB power divider fed by a coaxial cable and a ground
   plane employed under the dipoles with the distance of lambda/4 to
   produces a metallic reflector, which leads to unidirectional radiation
   patterns. Consequently, the proposed two-port base-station (BTS) antenna
   yields bandwidths of 1190 MHz (1.64 GHz-2.83 GHz) and 1060 MHz (1.67
   GHz-2.73 GHz) for port-1 and -2 respectively with isolation better than
   -20 dB between the ports. Twelve metallic ground walls surround the
   radiators to achieve stable radiation properties across the operating
   frequency band. Subsequently, the dual-polarized antenna achieves
   half-power beamwidths (HPBWs) of about 61 degrees, 65 degrees, and 70
   degrees at frequencies of 1800 MHz, 2000 MHZ, and 2300 MHz respectively
   and realized peak gain of around 10.29 dBi for port-1 and 10.27 dBi for
   port-2 within the operating frequency band. A prototype of the proposed
   dual-polarized BTS antenna fabricated and tested with a good agreement
   between the measurements and simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of breed and production
   system on quantity and quality of milk in goats. The data obtained from
   two groups of Markhoz goats reared in two different regions (MS and ME),
   and one group of Kurdish hairy goats distributed in one region (KE) were
   analyzed. Environmental factors and management system for MS and ME
   goats were different, but ME and KE goats were reared in similar
   conditions. The investigated traits were daily milk production (g/day),
   milk composition including the percentage of fat, protein, solids
   non-fat, lactose, ash and density (g/cm(3)), as well as fatty acid
   compositions (g/100 g total fatty acids). The number of 1260 samples for
   daily milk production and milk composition, as well as 45 samples for
   milk fatty acid profile, were used in the analysis. The milk and fatty
   acid composition were determined by Lactoscan SL60 and GCMass apparatus,
   respectively. The least-square means of fat, protein, lactose and
   density were affected by the breed-production system (P<0.01). The
   effects of lactation stage on all traits were significant (P<0.01),
   except for protein percentage (P>0.05). Furthermore, the effect of age
   of goats on daily milk production was significant (P<0.01). The
   proportion of C12, C16, CLA and C18:3 was influenced (P<0.05) by the
   breed-production system. Also, the age of does and lactation stage had a
   significant impact on the amount of some milk fatty acids (P<0.05).}},

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite several different measures of efficiency that are applicable to
   the photosynthetic systems, a precise degree of efficiency of these
   systems is not completely determined. Introducing an efficient model for
   the dynamics of light-harvesting complexes in biological environments is
   a major purpose in investigating such systems. Here, we investigate the
   effect of macroscopic quantum behavior of a system of two pigments on
   the transport phenomena in this system model which interacts with an
   oscillating environment. We use the second order perturbation theory to
   calculate the time-dependent population of excitonic states of a
   two-dimensional Hamiltonian using a non-master equation approach. Our
   results demonstrate that the quantum efficiency is robust with respect
   to the macroscopicity parameter h solely, but the ratio of
   macroscopicity over the pigment pigment interaction energy can be
   considered as a parameter that may control the energy transfer
   efficiency at a given time. So, the dynamical behavior and the quantum
   efficiency of the supposed photosynthetic system may be influenced by a
   change in the macroscopic behavior of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the relative performance of multiple data
   embedding into H.264 compressed video under two schemes of closed-loop
   and open- loop methods. In closedloop, a part of an encoder is modified
   to embed data within the encoding loop during re-compression, while in
   the openloop scenario, a part of decoder is modified to embed data out
   of decoding loop. It is shown, while for the first instance of
   embedding, both methods behave almost similarly for all picture types,
   for later instances of embedding, open-loop outperforms the closed-loop
   method. Moreover, the required time for embedding and extracting
   processes of open-loop method is only 1-1.5\% of that of the closed-loop
   counterpart. In both methods, the quality of watermarked video and the
   data hiding capacity are controlled by the position of last non-zero
   (LNZ) coefficient in the H.264 zigzag scanning order. However, for
   B-pictures, the side-effect of embedding distortion is very limited (in
   the order of 0.002 in terms of SSIM), but for I- and P-pictures it can
   be significant. Picture degradations in I- and P-frames are alleviated
   by confining data embedding only into the last block of macroblocks of
   I-frames and the last P-frame in the GOP, respectively. Finally, it is
   shown that while with CAVLC type entropy coder, the number of increased
   bits due to data embedding can vary from 5\%-65\% of the metadata volume
   (depending on quality degradation) this value with CABAC coder is only
   less than 20\% of that under CAVLC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction A baseline fetal heart rate between 110 and 160 bpm is
   considered normal. However, among normal fetuses the average baseline
   heart rate has been shown to diminish progressively and the 90th centile
   of the fetal heart rate at 40 weeks of gestation has been consistently
   found at around 150 bpm. The aim of our study was to assess the labor
   and neonatal outcome of fetuses at 40 gestational weeks or beyond, whose
   intrapartum baseline fetal heart rate was between 150 and 160 bpm.
   Material and methods Retrospective cohort study including singleton
   pregnancies with spontaneous onset of labor, gestational age between
   40(+0) and 42(+0) weeks, category I CTG trace according to the FIGO
   guidelines 2015 with baseline fetal heart rate between 110 and 160 bpm
   during the first 60 minutes of active labor. Exclusion criteria were
   maternal hyperpyrexia at admission, fetal arrhythmias, maternal
   tachycardia (>110 bpm) and uterine tachysystole (>5 contractions/10
   minutes). The following outcomes were compared between fetuses with a
   baseline ranging between 110 and 149 bpm and those with a baseline
   ranging between 150 and 160 bpm: incidence of meconium-stained amniotic
   fluid, intrapartum hyperpyrexia, mode of delivery, Apgar at 5 minutes
   <7, arterial pH <7.1 and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission,
   incidence of a composite adverse neonatal outcome.
   Results In all, 1004 CTG traces were included in the analysis, 860 in
   Group 110-149 bpm and 144 in Group 150-160 bpm. Group 150-160 bpm had a
   significantly higher incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (odds
   ratio {[}OR] 2.6; 95\% CI 1.8-3.8), maternal intrapartum hyperpyrexia
   (OR 4.7; 95\% CI 1.1-14.6), urgent/emergent cesarean section for
   suspected fetal distress (OR 13.4; 95\% CI 3.3-54.3), Apgar <7 at 5th
   min (OR 9.13; 95\% CI 1.5-55.1) and neonatal acidemia (OR 3.5; 95\% CI
   1.5-55.1). Logistic regression including adjustiing for potential
   confounders showed that fetal heart rate between 150 and 160 bpm is an
   independent predictor of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}aOR] 2.2; 95\% CI 1.5-3.3), cesarean section during labor for
   fetal distress (aOR 10.7; 95\% CI 2.9-44.6), neonatal acidemia (aOR 2.6;
   95\% CI 1.1-6.7) and adverse composite neonatal outcome (aOR 2.6; 95\%
   CI 1.2-5.6).
   Conclusions In fetuses at 40 weeks or beyond, an intrapartum fetal heart
   rate baseline ranging between 150 and 160 bpm seems associated with a
   higher incidence of labor complications.}},

   long-term creep behavior. The microstructural analysis using different
   DSC techniques and rheological measurements revealed more sensitivity of
   the polyethylene resin with uniform comonomer distribution to the carbon
   black aggregates and their polymeric carriers. The Full Notched Creep
   Test (FNCT) was performed to determine the long-term creep performance
   of the black compounds; it is shown that the sample having more uniform
   comonomer distribution is more resistant compared to other samples. On
   the other hand, by addition of carbon black masterbatch, resistance to
   slow crack growth in samples decreases since carbon black aggregates can
   act as stress concentration spots in the structure. However, with
   addition of the masterbatch with LDPE carrier polymer, the reduction of
   this value in samples is lower compared to one with HDPE carrier. The
   reason for this observation is that long branches of LDPE polymer enter
   the structure of lamellae in the PE100 resins, making them more coherent
   and increasing the number of tie molecules. The samples that are blended
   with LDPE polymer have a rougher surface, which means linkage between
   two sides of crack was stronger due to higher entanglement density in
   these samples. The impact test confirms the same trend as FNCT test,
   with the sample containing LDPE carrier having higher impact strength.}},

Title = {{Application of an active PCM storage system into a building for
   heating/cooling load reduction}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{210}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs) into buildings has
   recently attracted widespread attention as they can bridge the mismatch
   between energy supply and demand through their large energy storage
   capacity. This paper presents the use of an active PCM storage system in
   buildings and evaluates its energy performance over the different
   seasons. To this end, two experimental huts, each equipped with solar
   and electric heaters in winter or an air conditioning unit in summer,
   were used to investigate the concept. Also, one of the huts was provided
   with PCM storage units, and the results obtained were compared with
   those collected from the reference hut. A CompactRIO, data acquisition
   system, powered by LabVIEW real-time software, was used to transfer data
   for analysis, processing, and communicating with the host computer. In
   this research, the active PCM storage units could store solar energy in
   cold seasons or free night cooling in warm seasons for later use and
   hence reduce the heating/cooling load requirements. An accumulative
   heating energy savings of 40\% in May and 10.3\% in June/July 2019, were
   achieved. The use of PCM for space cooling also led to an accumulative
   energy-saving of 30\% in March/April and 10\% in January. (C) 2020

Title = {{Handling data imperfection-False data inputs in applications for
   Alzheimer's patients}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{130}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Handling data imperfection is a crucial issue in many application
   domains. This is particularly true when handling imperfect data inputs
   in applications for Alzheimer's patients. In this paper we first propose
   a typology of imperfection for data entered by Alzheimer's patients or
   their caregivers in the context of these applications (mainly due to the
   memory discordance caused by the disease). This topology includes nine
   direct and three indirect imperfection types. The direct ones are
   deduced from the data inputs e.g. uncertainty and uselessness. The
   indirect imperfection types are deduced from the direct ones, e.g. the
   redundancy. We then propose an approach, called DBE\_ALZ, that handles
   false data entry by estimating the believability of each data input.
   Based on the proposed typology, the falsity of these data is related to
   five imperfection types: uncertainty, confusion, typing error, wrong
   knowledge and inconsistency. DBE\_ALZ includes a believability model
   that defines a set of dimensions and sub-dimensions allowing a
   qualitative estimation of the believability of a given data input. It is
   estimated based on its reasonableness and the reliability of its author.
   Compared to related work, the data input reasonableness is measured not
   only based on common-sense standard, but also based on a set of
   personalized assertions. The reliability of the patient is estimated
   based on the progression of the disease and the state of his memory at
   the moment of entry. However, the reliability of the caregiver is
   estimated based on his age and his knowledge about the data input's
   field. Based on the believability model, we estimate quantitatively the
   believability of the data input by defining a set of metrics associated
   to the proposed dimensions and sub dimensions. The measurement methods
   rely on probability and fuzzy set theories to reason about uncertain and
   imprecise knowledge (Bayesian networks and Mamdani fuzzy inference
   systems). Three languages are supported: English, French and Arabic.
   Based on the generated believability degrees, a set of decisive actions
   are proposed to guarantee the quality of the data inputs e.g., inferring
   or not based on a given data. We illustrate the usefulness of our
   approach in the context of the Captain Memo memory prosthesis. Finally,
   we discuss the encouraging results derived from the evaluation step.}},

Title = {{Multifold enhancement in water dissociation with Ag/Ni bimetallic alloy
   surfaces}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{701}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Water dissociation is an indispensable step in industrial as well as in
   natural processes. It is the rate-determining step in the industrially
   important water gas shift reaction. The barrier for the dissociation of
   H2O on metal surfaces is very high and therefore, the probabilities of
   H2O dissociation on these metal surfaces in the energy range of
   industrial relevance are very low. Thereby, there is a clear need of a
   better catalyst for this reaction. Bimetallic alloys have unique
   electronic and catalytic properties as compared to the respective
   monometals. In this present study, we have investigated the catalytic
   role played by the Ag/Ni bimetallic alloy surfaces towards H2O
   dissociation. This is a thermodynamically stable alloy and has already
   been synthesized experimentally as nanoparticles {[}J. Phys. Chem. C.
   113 (2009) 1155-1159], {[}J. Phys. Chem. C. 114 (2010) 14,309-14,318]
   and this can aid the surface phenomenon. Systematic density functional
   theory calculations were performed on a series of overlayer starting
   from pure Ag(111) and we report the Ag-based catalyst, Ni9\_Ag(111)
   (full monolayer coverage of Ni on Ag top layer) to act as a better
   catalyst with a barrier for H2O dissociation of 0.13 eV compared to 1.78
   eV for pure Ag(111). A detailed analysis behind this lowering of the
   barrier is found to be governed by the large shift in the d-band center
   value of the metal due to alloying. Molecular orbital pictures provided
   further insight into the interactions of H2O with the surfaces.
   Transition state calculations also showed that the subsequent addition
   of Ni atom to Ag(111) surfaces decreases the dissociation barriers
   gradually. Finally, the semiclassical tunneling probability is computed
   using minimum energy path including the effect of surface temperature
   with the lattice atom motion. We observed an increase in surface
   temperature increases the dissociation probability, where, the extent of
   increase is strongly dependent on the change in the barrier heights.}},

Abstract = {{Plant phenotyping is the quantitative description of a plant's
   physiological, biochemical, and anatomical status which can be used in
   trait selection and helps to provide mechanisms to link underlying
   genetics with yield. Here, an active vision- based pipeline is presented
   which aims to contribute to reducing the bottleneck associated with
   phenotyping of architectural traits. The pipeline provides a fully
   automated response to photometric data acquisition and the recovery of
   three-dimensional (3D) models of plants without the dependency of
   botanical expertise, whilst ensuring a non-intrusive and non-destructive
   approach. Access to complete and accurate 3D models of plants supports
   computation of a wide variety of structural measurements. An Active
   Vision Cell (AVC) consisting of a camera-mounted robot arm plus combined
   software interface and a novel surface reconstruction algorithm is
   proposed. This pipeline provides a robust, flexible, and accurate method
   for automating the 3D reconstruction of plants. The reconstruction
   algorithm can reduce noise and provides a promising and extendable
   framework for high throughput phenotyping, improving current
   state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the pipeline can be applied to
   any plant species or form due to the application of an active vision
   framework combined with the automatic selection of key parameters for
   surface reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the impact of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) on bank

   the determination of bank lending, which includes the amount of ELA
   received by each bank, allowing us to investigate the direct effect of
   ELA on lending. Our model corrects a misspecification found in the
   prototype model used in the literature. We then undertake a VAR

   we examine spillover effects among banks, indicating that ELA generated
   positive spillovers to other banks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Cefepime therapeutic drug monitoring: Evaluation of agreement between

Journal = {{CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{510}},
Pages = {{450-454}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Therapeutic drug monitoring for cefepime is increasingly
   being performed because of the potential relation between exposure and
   neurotoxicity. An in vitro pilot study suggested significant carryover
   of cefepime from central venous catheters when blood sampling is carried
   out via the same catheter used for administration of cefepime.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate carryover of cefepime
   in a real-life clinical setting.
   Methods: A prospective single-center study was conducted at the
   hematology department of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients
   treated with cefepime, and having a central venous catheter, were
   included. Cefepime trough samples were taken simultaneously via the
   central venous catheter and peripheral venepuncture.
   Results: Twenty-four patients were included in this study, resulting in
   28, 11 and 5 paired samples for tunnelled catheters, implantable port
   catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters, respectively. No
   statistically nor clinically significant difference was found between
   cefepime concentrations measured in centrally versus peripherally
   obtained blood samples, overall and for all three types of central
   venous catheters separately. Of note, four paired samples showed a
   difference larger than 10\%, with lower central concentrations probably
   reflecting a dilution error.
   Conclusion: There was no significant carryover of cefepime from
   long-term central venous catheters. Cefepime samples can be drawn
   reliably via the central venous catheter, after flushing and discarding
   the first blood sample. Although, flushing and discard volumes should be
   standardized to avoid potential dilution errors.}},

   Center were recruited by email to participate. In total, 31 medical
   students completed the experience.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one participants participated in this study. Group 2
   (preferred music first, nonpreferred music second) showed no significant
   change in their test scores (72.73 vs 74.33, p = 0.34). However, Group 1
   (nonpreferred music first, then preferred music) showed significant
   improvement between trial runs (70.31 vs 81.88, p < 0.001). There was no
   significant difference between the initial runs for each group. When
   analyzed irrespective of group assignment, there was a significant
   increase in scores for preferred music vs nonpreferred music (77.45 vs
   72.26 p = 0.025).
   CONCLUSIONS: Participants showed expected improvement with task
   repetition. This improvement may have been offset by exposure to
   nonpreferred music during repeat runs. Our findings suggest that the
   impact of music was nearly as large as the impact of prior exposure to
   the task. This may have implications for environmental conditions during
   resident procedural training, especially early in residency training
   when new tasks are being introduced and the skill level of the learner
   is still low. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Association of

Abstract = {{An 82-year-old female was admitted with pyrexia and rigors. Bloods
   showed a raised C-reactive protein and she was commenced on empirical
   intravenous antibiotics. Chest X-ray, urine microscopy and computed
   tomography scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate
   a source of infection, and blood cultures did not grow a microorganism.
   A collateral history was taken from the patient's husband who raised
   concerns regarding her vaginal shelf pessary and it was therefore
   removed. Subsequently the patient's fever subsided, her inflammatory
   markers improved and she was discharged 2 days later. We believe this is
   the first reported case of pyrexia secondary to a non-infected vaginal

Abstract = {{Downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara halstedii (Farl.) Berl. and de Toni,
   is an economically important disease in cultivated sunflowers,
   Helianthus annuus L. Resistance genes incorporated into commercial
   hybrids are used as an effective disease management tool, but the
   duration of effectiveness is limited as virulence evolves in the
   pathogen population. A comprehensive assessment of pathogen virulence
   was conducted in 2014 and 2015 in the U.S. Great Plains states of North
   Dakota and South Dakota, where approximately 75\% of the U.S. sunflower
   is produced annually. The virulence phenotypes (and races) of 185
   isolates were determined using the U.S. standard set of nine
   differentials. Additionally, the virulence phenotypes of 61 to 185
   isolates were determined on 13 additional lines that have been used to
   evaluate pathogen virulence in North America and/or internationally.
   Although widespread virulence was identified on several genes, new
   virulence was identified on the Pl(8) resistance gene, and no virulence
   was observed on the Pl(Arg), Pl(15), Pl(17) and Pl(18) genes. Results of
   this study suggest that three additional lines should be used as
   differentials and agree with previous studies that six lines proposed as
   differentials should be used in two internationally accepted
   differential sets. For effective disease management using genetic
   resistance, it is critical that virulence data be relevant and timely.
   This is best accomplished when pathogen virulence is determined
   frequently and by using genetic lines containing resistance genes
   actively incorporated into commercial cultivars.}},

Title = {{A novel hybrid optimization approach for reactive power dispatch problem
   considering voltage stability index}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{96}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel, reliable, and effective hybrid approach
   based on the integration of the firefly algorithm (FA) and the adaptive
   particularly tunable fuzzy particle swarm optimization (APT-FPSO) method
   to address reactive power dispatch (RPD) problem, a crucial optimization
   problem in the operation of power systems. Similar to many other
   original meta-heuristic optimization techniques, the standard FA suffers
   from some severe drawbacks, most importantly being easily trapped into a
   locally optimal solution. In order to tackle these difficulties, in the
   current study, an improved version of fuzzy-based particle swarm
   optimization is utilized in the internal structure of the original FA.
   The developed hybrid approach, which is capable of avoiding premature
   convergence of the original FA by enhancing exploration and exploitation
   procedures, is employed to determine the optimum control variables
   (i.e., the voltage of generation buses, tap positions of tap-changer
   transformers, and reactive power output of shunt compensators) through
   optimizing three distinct objective functions consisting of total
   transmission real power loss, the voltage magnitude deviations as well
   as voltage stability index. To validate the accuracy and competency of
   the proposed hybrid approach, it is firstly used for solving several
   benchmark optimization functions and then applied to three test systems
   at different scales, consisting of IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE
   118-bus power systems, for solving the RPD problem. Eventually, the
   results of the presented hybrid method will be compared to those
   obtained by other implemented swarm intelligence-based approaches. The
   statistical analysis of this research substantiates the robustness and
   effectiveness of the developed algorithm to handle sophisticated
   optimization problems, particularly the RPD problem.}},

Abstract = {{Drug and fragment screening at X-ray crystallography beamlines has been
   a huge success. However, it is inevitable that more high-profile
   biological drug targets will be identified for which high-quality,

   heterogeneity in crystal systems, the application of current
   multi-data-set methods becomes ever less sensitive to bound ligands. In
   order to ease the bottleneck of finding a well behaved crystal system,
   pre-clustering of data sets can be carried out using cluster4x after
   data collection to separate data sets into smaller partitions in order
   to restore the sensitivity of multi-data-set methods. Here, the software
   cluster4x is introduced for this purpose and validated against published
   data sets using PanDDA, showing an improved total signal from existing
   ligands and identifying new hits in both highly heterogenous and less
   heterogenous multi-data sets. cluster4x provides the researcher with an
   interactive graphical user interface with which to explore multi-data

Title = {{Interactions of cone abundancies, opsin expression, and environmental
   lighting with emmetropization in chickens}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{200}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We had previously found that M to L cone abundancy ratios in the chicken
   retina are correlated with vitreous chamber depth and refractive state
   in chickens eyes, when they have normal visual exposure but not when
   they develop deprivation myopia. The finding suggests an interaction
   between cone abundancies and emmetropization. In the current study, we
   analyzed how stable this correlation was against changes in
   environmental variables and strain differences. We found that the
   correlation was preserved in two chicken strains, as long as they were
   raised in the laboratory facilities and not in the animal facilities of
   the institute. To determine the reasons for this difference, spectral
   and temporal lighting parameters were better adjusted in both places,
   whereas temperature, humidity, food, diurnal lighting cycles and
   illuminance were already matched. It was also verified that both strains
   of chickens had the same cone opsin amino acid sequences. The
   correlation between M to L cone abundancy and ocular biometry is highly
   susceptible to changes in environmental variables. Yet undetermined
   differences in lighting parameters were the most likely reasons. Other
   striking findings were that green cone opsin mRNA expression was
   downregulated when deprivation myopia developed. Similarly, red opsin
   mRNA was downregulated when chicks wore red spectacles, which made them
   more hyperopic. In summary, our experiments show that photoreceptor
   abundancies, opsin expression, and the responses to deprivation, and
   therefore emmetropization, are surprisingly dependent on subtle
   differences in lighting parameters.}},

Journal = {{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{465-470}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background - A relationship is known to exist between gastric and
   pancreatic cancers and ABO antigens, caused by various immune
   modulations related to the ABO blood group of the patient. A similar
   relationship with regard to gynaecological cancers remains
   controversial.
   Materials and methods - Patients who underwent surgery for endometrioid
   endometrial cancer in International Federation of Gynaecology and
   Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II, III or IV from 2006 to 2018 were
   identified. The research explored the existence of a relationship
   between the patients' blood group or Rhesus factor and the incidence of
   endometrial cancer, grade (G1, G2, G3), FIGO stage, nodal status,
   recurrence, menopausal status, parity, and body mass index. Statistical
   methods such as the chi-square test, analysis of variance and the
   Scheffe post-hoc test were used.
   Results - Two hundred and two patients with endometrioid endometrial
   cancer were included: 96 had blood group A, 19 blood group B, 75 blood
   group 0, and 12 had blood group Al This distribution corresponds to the
   general blood group distribution in Germany. The vast majority of the
   dependent variables, such as grade, FIGO stage, nodal status or
   recurrence were not significantly associated with ABO blood group or
   Rhesus factor status. The relative frequencies of G1 and G3 endometrial
   cancers with respect to blood group were similar. Menopausal status,
   parity, and body mass index were not related to more advanced FIGO
   stages at initial diagnosis or to ABO blood group.
   Discussion - Blood group screening would probably not be helpful in the
   diagnosis of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas in early stages
   compared to the current gold standard. Furthermore, a specific blood
   group does not increase either the risk of recurrence or the risk of a
   dedifferentiated type of endometrial carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{A new evaluation scheme to assess the nutritional status of dairy cows
   on the basis of milk constituents was derived from 7.37 million German
   records of milk testing. The aim of this work was to validate this new
   scheme. Two data sets with fertility and health information (data set A)
   and with measured energy and nutrient intake and metabolic
   characteristics (data set B) were analyzed. Data set A included 32
   commercial dairy farms in northeast Germany, with 72,982 records of
   43,863 German Holstein cows; data set B included 12 German experimental
   farms, with 49,275 records of 1,650 German Holstein, Simmental, and
   Brown Swiss cows. Milk traits were linked to health disorders and
   metabolic and feeding characteristics. Frequently used limits of milk
   constituents were compared with ranges of the new ``Dummerstorf feeding
   evaluation.{''} To distinguish an optimal from a deficient energy
   supply, a milk protein content >= 3.20\% (previously used) and a milk
   fat:protein ratio (FPR) <= 1.4 (new scheme) were chosen and compared
   with feed energy intake in relation to demand. Energy status was more
   often correctly assigned by FPR than by milk protein content (80.7 and
   68.7\%, respectively). Over all data, the new optimum range of milk urea
   between 150 and 250 mg/L was better suited to dietary crude protein
   intake in relation to demand than the previously used range of 150 to
   300 mg/L (42.4 and 38.0\%, respectively). Ketosis or blood values
   associated with ketosis such as beta-hydroxybutyrate >1.2 mmol/L or
   nonesterified fatty acids >1,000 mu mol/L, as well as strong
   mobilization of body weight >= 1.5 kg/d, loss of back fat thickness >=
   10 mm, and loss of body condition score >= 1 unit in first 60 days in
   milk were compared with different milk trait thresholds. For the updated
   scheme FPR >1.4 was used in combination with either milk protein content
   below the individual statistical lower limit of milk protein content, or
   milk fat content greater than the individual statistical upper limit of
   milk fat content; FPR >1.5 was taken as a frequently used threshold. For
   these ketosis indicators, the new scheme had higher sensitivities.
   Energy oversupply or the risk of overconditioning could not be
   identified by milk constituents alone. Urinary acid-base content was not
   related to milk content. Similarly, milk testing data did not allow a
   clear distinction to be made between the diagnoses of acidosis and, for
   example, ketosis. Essential requirements for good herd management are
   the continuous observation of milk testing data in combination with
   other established instruments of feeding and animal monitoring.}},

Title = {{Cannabis vapor self-administration elicits sex- and dose-specific
   alterations in stress reactivity in rats}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Cannabis users frequently report stress relief as their
   primary reason for use. Recent studies indicate that human cannabis
   users exhibit blunted stress reactivity; however, it is unknown whether
   this is a cause or a consequence of chronic cannabis use.
   Objectives: To determine whether chronic cannabis vapor
   self-administration elicits sexand/or dose-dependent alterations in
   stress reactivity and basal corticosterone (CORT) concentrations, or
   whether pre-vapor exposure stress reactivity predicts rates of cannabis
   vapor self-administration.
   Methods: Male and female rats were subjected to 30 min acute restraint
   stress to assess stress reactivity prior to vapor self-administration.
   Rats were then trained to self-administer cannabis extract vapor
   containing 69.9\% Delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at one of four
   extract concentrations (0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/ml) daily for 30 days.
   Half of the rats were then subjected to a second restraint stress
   challenge 24 h after the final self-administration session, while the
   other half served as no-stress controls. Plasma CORT concentrations were
   measured prior to stress and immediately post-stress offset.
   Results: Female rats earned significantly more vapor deliveries than
   male rats. Pre-vapor stress reactivity was not a predictor of
   self-administration rates in either sex. Basal CORT concentrations were
   increased following vapor self-administration relative to pre-vapor
   assessment, irrespective of treatment condition. Importantly, cannabis
   self-administration dose-dependently reduced stress reactivity in
   female, but not male, rats.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that chronic cannabis use can
   significantly dampen stress reactivity in female rats and further
   support the use of the cannabis vapor self-administration model in rats
   of both sexes.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive hydro-geophysical prospecting to delineate fresh water
   zone in the coastal aquifer, South India}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The integrated hydrogeophysical surveys were used to discriminate
   between fresh and saline groundwater in the coastal aquifer zones of
   lower Vellar river basin, south India, which is considered to be the
   main source of groundwater in the basin. Geologically, the basin
   consists of tertiary and quaternary formation. In order to delineate the
   freshwater aquifer zone, sixty-nine (69) VES locations were surveyed by
   Schlumberger electrode arrangement and eight (8) scanning surveys were
   conducted by multi electrode scanning method. The VES results, reflect
   that the overall resistivity ranges from 0.01 to 12,670 Omega m and
   thickness varies from 0.49 to 49.9 m, with a maximum of four subsurface
   layers. The dominant curve types are H and QH followed by KH (8) and K
   (6). The pseudo sections prepared to understand the variations of
   subsurface characteristics and to delineate potential fresh/saline water
   aquifer zones in the basin. Whereas the scanning surveys results showed
   resistivity ranges from 1 to 500 Omega m. The resistivity 20-60 Omega m
   was considered as freshwater aquifer zone and observed at six locations
   at varying depths. The both the VES and scanning results were correlated
   with existing borewell lithology and it showed reliable matching. The
   results of this survey identified the freshwater aquifer zones (20-60
   Omega m) in central and south-central part of the basin with high
   potential aquifer thickness and optimum yield. This integrated
   hydrogeophysical methods proved to be an excellent solution for
   delineation of fresh water aquifer zone and could be applied to any
   other basins with similar lithological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid technological improvements in mobile devices and their
   inclusion in Internet of Things (IoT), secure key management becomes
   mandatory to ensure security of information exchange. For instance, IoT
   applications, such as smart health-care and smart homes, provide
   automated services to the users with less or no user intervention. As
   these application use user-sensitive data, ensuring their security and
   privacy should be paramount, especially during the key management
   process. However, traditional approaches for key management will not
   suit well in IoT environment because of the inherent resource constraint
   property of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed
   key management scheme for IoT ecosystem. The proposed scheme efficiently
   provides security to IoT devices by delegating most of the resource
   consuming cryptographic processing to a local entity. This entity
   coordinates with other peer entities to provide a distributed key as
   well as an authentication mechanism to network devices. In particular,
   the proposed scheme exploits the advantages of mobile agents by
   deploying them in different subnetworks as and when required: (1) to
   process the cryptography work for the IoT devices, and (2) to act as an
   local authenticated entity to perform fast authentication process. To
   verify the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed scheme, we have
   simulated it in a large IoT scenario and evaluated against relevant
   metrics that includes user mobility, certification generation time, and
   communication overhead.}},

Title = {{Decarbonising the transport and energy sectors: Technical feasibility
   and socioeconomic impacts in Costa Rica}},
Journal = {{ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Compliance with the Paris Agreement requires the transformation of
   national economies to meet net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by
   mid-century. To accomplish this, countries need to define long-term
   decarbonisation strategies with near- and mid-term actions to determine
   their ideal future scenario while maximizing socioeconomic benefits.
   This paper describes the process followed to support the creation of the
   decarbonisation pathway for the transport and energy sectors presented
   in Costa Rica's National Decarbonisation Plan. We discuss in detail the
   technological pathway of a deep-decarbonisation future that supports
   reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Compared to a business-as-usual
   (BAU) scenario, our results show that the decarbonisation pathway can
   lead to emissions' reduction of 87\% in the transport and energy sectors
   by 2050. Energy efficiency, the adoption of electromobility, modal-shift
   towards public transport and active mobility, as well as reduced demand
   due to digitalisation and teleworking, are found to be key drivers
   towards the deep-decarbonisation. These measures combined enable a 25\%
   reduction of primary energy production by 2050. The results highlight
   that the decarbonisation scenario requires installing 4.4 GW more of
   renewable power plants by 2050, compared to the BAU scenario (80\%). We
   also show that additional investments for the deep-decarbonisation are
   compensated with the reduced operating cost. Crucially, we found that
   the National Decarbonisation Plan results in a lower total discounted
   cost of about 35\% of current Costa Rica's GDP, indicating that a deep
   decarbonisation is technically feasible and is coupled to socioeconomic
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aims to evaluate the awareness and approaches of
   all family physicians from one province in Turkey regarding occupational
   diseases. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional, descriptive study. A
   questionnaire was applied to family physicians between November 2018 and
   February 2019. The questionnaire investigates family physicians'
   knowledge, attitude, behavior, proficiency, and approaches to
   occupational diseases. Results: Three hundred twenty four family
   physicians participated in our study. 59.3\% had received training on
   occupational diseases and only 22.9\% of these physicians indicated that
   this training was adequate. Physicians identified ``lack of occupational
   anamnesis{''} as the most common reason behind the underreporting of
   occupational diseases, and ``difficulties in identifying occupational
   diseases{''} as the second. Conclusions: Family physicians believe that
   they inadequately evaluate occupational diseases and find the
   occupational disease-related training to be insufficient.}},

   as a reducing and stabilising agent in the production of sericin/silver
   nanocomposite samples with a binary reducing agent system containing
   NaOH and NaBH4. The nanocomposite samples were prepared with three
   different cross-linkers and applied to cotton fabrics at nanocomposite
   concentrations of 20 g/L and 40 g/L. The antibacterial performance
   against Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) and Staphylococcus Aureus (S. Aureus)
   was good; which remained even at the end of 20 wash cycles. The fabrics

Title = {{Analysis of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Titers of Recovered COVID-19
   Patients}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide
   protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our aim was to
   determine whether any MMR IgG titers are inversely correlated with
   severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with MMR
   II. We divided 80 subjects into two groups, comparing MMR titers to
   recent COVID-19 severity levels. The MMR II group consisted of 50
   subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II
   vaccine, and a comparison group of 30 subjects consisted of those who
   would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II,
   including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. There was a
   significant inverse correlation (r(s) = -0.71, P < 0.001) between mumps
   virus titers (mumps titers) and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II
   group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and
   severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the
   MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in
   either group. Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300
   arbitrary units (AU)/ml (n = 8) were found only in those who were
   functionally immune or asymptomatic; all with mild symptoms had mumps
   titers below 134 AU/ml (n = 17); all with moderate symptoms had mumps
   titers below 75 AU/ml (n = 11); all who had been hospitalized and had
   required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n = 5). Our results
   demonstrate that there is a significant inverse correlation between
   mumps titers from MMR II and COVID-19 severity.
   IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has presented various paradoxes that, if understood
   better, may provide clues to controlling the pandemic, even before a
   COVID-19 vaccine is widely available. First, young children are largely
   spared from severe disease. Second, numerous countries have COVID-19
   death rates that are as low as 1\% of the death rates of other
   countries. Third, many people, despite prolonged close contact with
   someone who is COVID-19 positive, never test positive themselves.
   Fourth, nearly half of people who test positive for COVID-19 are
   asymptomatic. Some researchers have theorized that the
   measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be responsible for these
   disparities. The significance of our study is that it showed that mumps
   titers related to the MMR II vaccine are significantly and inversely
   correlated with the severity of COVID-19-related symptoms, supporting
   the theorized association between the MMR vaccine and COVID-19 severity.}},

Title = {{Shifts in Prescribers' Initial Postoperative Opioid Prescriptions
   Following Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty Between 2014 and 2018}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{3208-3213}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis impacting the
   practice of surgeons performing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).
   Seeking to evaluate changes in prescribers' practices, we asked the
   following questions: (1) Have the initial discharge opioids following
   THA changed and (2) Have initial total oral morphine milligram
   equivalents (OME) prescribed following THA decreased since 2014?
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed discharge prescriptions for 4233
   primary THAs performed between fiscal years (FYs) 2014 and 2018
   throughout our healthcare system. Drug, dosing, and total OMEs were
   recorded. We categorized prescriptions into 3 groups: short-acting
   narcotics only, short-acting plus long-acting narcotics, and
   short-acting narcotics plus tramadol. Mean age was 59 and 63\% were
   males.
   Results: The proportion of patients receiving tramadol increased from
   2\% (FY14) to 25\% (FY18) while long-acting opioid prescriptions
   decreased from 44\% (FY14) to 14\% (FY18). Oxycodone (82\%) was the most
   common short-acting narcotic. In total, we observed a 27\% decrease in
   initial OME prescribed to a mean of 683 mg (FY18) (P<.0001).
   Short-acting only protocols had a 19\% OME decrease to 589 mg (FY18).
   Short plus long-acting protocols haed a 23\% OME decrease to 939 mg
   (FY18). Short-acting plus tramadol had an OME of 849 mg (FY18).
   Conclusion: Despite a 27\% observed decrease in initial OME prescription
   following THA, the 683 mg mean OME in FY18 was high. Substituting
   tramadol for a long-acting narcotic failed to have a dramatic clinical
   impact on decreasing OME. These data suggest that decreasing the number
   of short-acting narcotic pills is a critical factor in decreasing OME.

Abstract = {{This study compared the wear resistance of different reinforced

   crystallized by conventional (c) or microwave (mw) firing protocols were
   collected according to the contact- {[}two-body (n = 20/gr)] and
   contact-free wear tests {[}three-body (n = 20/gr)]. After wear tests
   performed on ACTA wear machine, mean surface roughness (Ra) and Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyzes were performed to evaluate the
   surface alterations. The wear and roughness data (in mu m) were
   evaluated using two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test (alpha = 0.05).
   Two-body wear test revealed that ZLS1 (1.30 +/- 1.79) A showed higher
   wear rate than LD (0.79 +/- 2.15)(B) and ZLS2 (0.85 +/- 0.94)(B),
   regardless the crystallization approach. For three-body test,
   conventional crystallization (0.62 +/- 0.4)(A) showed higher wear rates
   than microwave (0.22 +/- 0.71)(B); while the type of ceramic was not
   significant. The crystallization protocol (p < 0.001) and ceramic
   material (p = 0.001) affected the surface roughness in the three-body;
   whereas the two-body test, only the crystallization protocol (p =
   0.046). SEM analysis showed a similar and smother surface morphology for
   LD and ZLS2 compared to ZLS1. Conventional crystallization showed
   materials more prone to wear than the microwave, in the presence of food
   bolus. Therefore, the microwave crystallization can be suggested as an
   alternative to improve the evaluated glass-ceramics wear resistance.}},

Title = {{Assessing Collaborative Capabilities for Sustainability in
   Interorganizational Networks}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability in interorganizational networks depends on developing
   collaborative capabilities for this purpose. However, to improve their
   collaborative capabilities for sustainability (CCS), companies in
   interorganizational networks need methods to assess them. The existing
   CCS assessment approaches in the literature do not indicate what
   capabilities should be improved in an individual company to support
   collaborative strategies. Addressing this gap, the main contribution of
   this paper is providing a framework to assess CCS in interorganizational
   networks, providing support for improving firm-level capabilities. To
   attain this aim, the framework was based on the graph-theoretic approach
   (GTA), a multi-attribute technique that captures the interrelationships
   between elements of a system, providing multi-level and overall
   assessment. We tested the framework in three hotels from a tourism
   cluster in Brazil, where sustainability has been an unsettling issue. By
   applying the assessment framework, it was possible to generate a CCS
   index for each company and, thereby, to compare the results. Findings
   from the field confirmed the benefits of using the framework and its
   utility in assessing CCS and setting priorities for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple factors can affect presence in virtual environments, such as
   the number of human senses engaged in a given experience or the extent
   to which the virtual experience is credible. The purpose of the present
   work is to study how the inclusion of credible multisensory stimuli
   affects the sense of presence, namely, through the use of wind, passive
   haptics, vibration, and scent. Our sample consisted of 37 participants
   (27 men and 10 women) whose ages ranged from 17 to 44 years old and were
   mostly students. The participants were divided randomly into 3 groups:
   Control Scenario (visual and auditory - N = 12), Passive Haptic Scenario
   (visual, auditory, and passive haptic - N = 13) and Multisensory
   Scenario (visual, auditory, wind, passive haptic, vibration, and scent -
   N = 12). The results indicated a significant increase in the involvement
   subscale when all multisensory stimuli were delivered. We found a trend
   where the use of passive haptics by itself has a positive impact on
   presence, which should be the subject of further work.}},

Title = {{Mechanics-Guided Genetic Programming Expression for Shear-Strength
   Prediction of Squat Reinforced Concrete Walls with Boundary Elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Squat reinforced concrete shear walls with boundary elements (SRCSW-BE)
   are used in special structures (e.g., nuclear facilities) to resist
   lateral seismic loads. However, several studies have demonstrated the
   inaccuracy of the relevant current shear strength prediction expressions
   (e.g., ASCE/SEI 43-05). Specifically, expressions originally developed
   based on empirical or experimentally calibrated analytical models (using
   different datasets) showed discrepancies when their predictions were
   compared with experimental results from other datasets. This situation
   is mainly attributed to the complex shear behavior and failure
   mechanisms of SRCSW-BE in addition to the wide ranges of their
   interdependent design characteristics. To address this issue, the
   current study utilizes genetic programming (GP), a form of artificial
   intelligence, to develop an elegant shear strength prediction expression
   using a dataset of 254 SRCSW-BE. Guided by mechanics, the key factors
   governing wall shear strength were first identified, and the GP-based
   expression was subsequently developed, trained, validated, and tested.
   The accuracy of the developed GP-based expression was assessed through
   different performance evaluation measures. The analyses showed that the
   developed expression can provide better predictions with significantly
   higher accuracy compared to other shear strength prediction expressions
   available in relevant design standards and literature. Further
   robustness assessment also demonstrated the conformity of the GP-based
   expression with known underlying behavior mechanics of SRCSW-BE, which,
   along with its elegant form, makes the developed expression
   adoption-ready by relevant design standards (e.g., ACI 318 and CSA
   A23.3). Overall, the current study is expected to demonstrate the
   ability of GP-based approaches in addressing other complex behaviors of
   structural components/systems and tackling relevant challenges
   pertaining to the latter's behavior predictions. DOI:

Title = {{IL-6-induced acetylation of E2F1 aggravates oxidative damage of retinal
   pigment epithelial cell line}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{200}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative damage in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) is considered
   to be a crucial pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
   Although dysregulation of the DNA repair system has been found in RPE
   cells of AMD patients, the detailed molecular mechanisms of this
   dysregulation and their relationship with the intraocular
   microenvironment of AMD patients remain unclear. Here, we established an
   RPE model of H2O2-induced oxidative stress and found that Sirtuin 1
   (Sirt1)-mediated deacetylation of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) was
   required for oxidation resistance in RPE cells. Moreover, E2F1 induced
   the expression of the chromatin-binding protein, high mobility group
   AT-Hook 1 (HMGA1), which promoted the transcription of glucose
   6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the
   pentose phosphate pathway, to increase NADPH level for antioxidant
   defense. Interrupting the E2F1/HMGA1/G6PD regulatory axis increased
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, DNA damage, and apoptosis in RPE
   cells under oxidative stress. Notably, interleukin 6 (IL-6), an
   inflammatory cytokine that is known to be upregulated in the intraocular
   fluid of AMD patients, induced phosphorylation (S47) of Sirtl by
   activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby inhibiting Sirtl activity
   and increasing the acetylation of E2F1. Specific inhibitors of
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling decreased DNA damage and ROS while increasing
   NADPH in RPE cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that
   IL-6-induced acetylation of E2F1 impairs the antioxidant capacity of RPE
   cells by disturbing the pentose phosphate pathway, which elucidates a
   relationship between the intraocular microenvironment and RPE oxidative
   damage in AMD and provides a possible therapeutic target for AMD.}},

Title = {{Heat transfer enhancement and pressure loss in a plate-fin heat
   exchanger with V-shaped oblique wavy surface}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Numerical investigations on the heat transfer and pressure loss of a
   plate-fin heat exchanger with V-shaped oblique wavy surface have been
   conducted. The effects of pointing direction of V shape, oblique angle
   and wave amplitude are systematically studied to find out the geometry
   with the best thermal-hydraulic performance. It is found that the
   oblique wavy surface induces two pairs of counter rotating secondary
   flows which significantly enhance heat transfer irrespective of the
   pointing direction of the V shape. Meanwhile, the oblique wavy surface
   with the V shape pointing downstream shows relatively low pressure loss.
   It is also found that moderate oblique angle and large amplitude are
   beneficial for heat transfer augmentation, while oblique angle near 75
   degrees and small amplitude are beneficial for relieving pressure loss.
   The optimal geometry which balances heat transfer enhancement and
   pressure loss is obtained by adopting an acute oblique angle close to 75
   degrees with large amplitude, and its Colburn factor j and goodness
   factor j/f increased by 150\% and 16\% at Re = 500, respectively,
   compared with the plain channel. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Multilayer scaffolds fabricated by 3D printing or other techniques have
   been used to repair osteochondral defects. However, it remains a
   challenge to regenerate the articular cartilage and subchondral bone
   simultaneously with higher performance. In the present study, we
   enhanced the repair efficiency of osteochondral defects by developing a
   bi-layer scaffold: an interleukin-4 (IL-4)-loaded radially oriented
   gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) scaffold printed with digital light
   processing (DLP) in the upper layer and a porous polycaprolactone and
   hydroxyapatite (PCL-HA) scaffold printed with fused deposition modeling
   (FDM) in the lower layer. An in vitro test showed that both layers
   supported cell adhesion and proliferation, as the lower layer promoted
   osteogenic differentiation and the upper layer with IL-4 relieved the
   negative effects of inflammation on murine chondrocytes, which were
   induced by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and M1 macrophages. In a
   rabbit osteochondral defect repair model, the IL-4-loaded bi-layer
   scaffold group obtained the highest histological score (24 +/- 2)
   compared to the nontreated (11 +/- 1) and pure bi-layer scaffold (16 +/-
   1) groups after 16 weeks of implantation, which showed that the
   IL-4-loaded bi-layer scaffold promoted regeneration of both cartilage
   and subchondral bone with increased formation of neocartilage and
   neobone tissues. Thus, the IL-4-loaded bi-layer scaffold is an
   attractive candidate for repair and regeneration of osteochondral
   defects. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Prior research has illustrated the antecedents of customer-oriented
   constructive deviance. However, research on their consequences has been
   limited. To clarify the relationship between customer-oriented
   constructive deviance and its outcome, the present study is based on
   affective event theory and posits that customer-oriented constructive
   deviance predicts customer gratitude and employee guilt, which in turn
   lead to customer and employee satisfaction and loyalty, respectively.
   This research also investigates how service and ethical climates
   moderate these relationships. Based on a dataset comprising 223 matched
   employee-customer pairs collected from luxury hotel restaurants, we
   found that customer-oriented constructive deviance is positively related
   to customer loyalty, but negatively related to employee loyalty.
   Furthermore, service and ethical climates are found to have disparate
   impacts on these relationships. Our findings call attention to a
   potential risk that managers should be aware of when they manage
   customer-oriented constructive deviance to achieve greater customer
   service.}},

Title = {{A quality improvement project for managing hypocalcemia after pediatric
   total thyroidectomy}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy (TT) is
   relatively common. It may result in significant morbidity, prolonged
   hospital stay, and increased costs. Treatment with intravenous (IV)
   calcium gluconate may also carry significant risks. In pediatrics,
   management consensus guidelines are lacking.
   Methods: At Phoenix Children's Hospital, a team of pediatric
   endocrinologists, surgeons and otolaryngologists developed a clinical
   pathway for patients undergoing TT. It was a Quality Improvement (QI)
   project with the primary aim of decreasing IV calcium gluconate use from
   a baseline of 68\% to less than 40\% over 15 months. Secondary aims
   included reducing hypocalcemia and length of hospitalization.
   Interventions included sending weekly pathway reminder emails, starting
   pre-operative calcium, and pathway implementation into the electronic
   health record.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients underwent TT over 15 months. IV calcium
   gluconate use dropped to 48\%. Hypocalcemia and length of
   hospitalization were 96\% and 52.7 h (range 21.1-115.7) respectively.
   Pathway adherence improved after targeted interventions. Eleven (73\%)
   of the 15 patients whose post-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) nadir
   was below 15 pg/mL required IV calcium gluconate vs. two (17\%) out of
   12 with levels above this threshold.
   Conclusions: Standardizing care allowed for objective outcome analysis.
   We learned that post-operative serum PTH level was the main risk factor
   for requiring IV calcium gluconate. Implementing the pathway as a QI
   project allows for revisions based on outcomes, ultimately resulting in
   a pathway that best utilizes our infrastructure to optimize care. Other
   pediatric institutions may face similar challenges and can potentially
   learn from our experience.}},

Title = {{Nutrient Contribution of Litterfall in a Short Rotation Plantation of

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to quantify the potential contribution of nutrients
   derived from leaf litter in a short rotation coppice plantation which
   includes monocultures of the species Populus alba (PA) and Robina
   pseudoacacia (RP) as well as a mixture of 50PA:50RP, in the middle of
   the rotation. The P. alba monoculture was that which provided the most
   leaf litter (3.37 mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by the 50PA:50RP mixture
   (2.82 mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and finally the R. pseudoacacia monoculture
   (2.55 mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). In addition to producing more litterfall,
   leaves were shed later in the P. alba monoculture later (December) than
   in the R. pseudoacacia monoculture (October) or the mix (throughout the
   fall). In terms of macronutrient supply per hectare, the contributions
   derived from leaf litter were higher for K, P and Mg in the case of P.
   alba and for N in R. pseudoacacia, the mix presenting the highest Ca
   content and intermediate concentrations for the rest of the nutrients.
   In addition, other factors such as C:N or N:MO ratios, as well as the
   specific characteristics of the soil, can have an important impact on
   the final contribution of these inputs. The carbon contribution derived
   from leaf fall was higher in the P. alba monoculture (1.5 mg ha(-1)
   yr(-1)), intermediate in the mixed plot (1.3 mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and
   slightly lower for the R. pseudoacacia monoculture (1.3 mg ha(-1)
   yr(-1)). Given these different strategies of monocultures with regard to
   the dynamism of the main nutrients, species mixing would appear to be
   suitable option to achieve a potential reduction in mineral
   fertilization in these plantations.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Snowfall and snowpack are tightly coupled within the snow water cycle
   and careful monitoring is crucial to better understand snow's role in
   Earth's water and energy cycles. Current and future estimates of the
   total amount of seasonal snow on the ground are limited by the
   variability in the initial snowfall and uncertainties in in situ and
   remote sensing observations. In this study, passive microwave remote
   sensing estimates of snowfall and snow water equivalent (SWE) from the
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) instrument are used to
   assess the consistency in the snow products. A snow evolution model,
   SnowModel, is employed to simulate snow processes that occur between the
   initial snowfall and subsequent SWE. AMSR-E is found to have significant
   discrepancies in both snowfall and SWE compared toMERRA-2 reanalysis and
   the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) snow product. It is shown that
   AMSR-E snowfall is currently not a useful metric to estimate SWE without
   applying large corrections throughout the winter season. Regions of
   consistency in the AMSR-E snow products occur for reasons that pertain
   to underestimation in both snowfall and SWE. In addition to snow
   consistency, microwave brightness temperatures (TBs) are analyzed in
   response to the snowpack and snowfall physical properties. These
   experiments indicate significant sensitivity to regime-dependent
   scattering characteristics that must be accounted for to accurately
   estimate global snow properties and provide better physical consistency
   in the snow products from remote sensing platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on policies for the control of the tobacco epidemic
   suggests that increasing excise taxes on the consumption of tobacco
   products is the most cost-effective policy. Cigarette tax structure in
   Argentina is very complex. All the tax bases for cigarette consumption
   taxes are related and, therefore, any modification of a tax affects the
   collection of the rest of the taxes. This is important given that funds
   raised by one of the taxes, the Special Tobacco Fund (FET), are
   allocated among the tobacco provinces according to the value of tobacco
   production. These provinces oppose in the congress to any reform that
   increase taxes on cigarette consumption that negatively affects these
   funds. In May 2016, the government decided to increase the rate of one
   of the taxes, the internal tax, from 60\% to 75\%. We study the impact
   on cigarettes' demand price elasticity, consumption and tax revenues of
   this tobacco tax reform. Using an Error Correction Model, we estimate
   short-run and long-run demand price and income elasticities. We find
   that the tax reform of May 2016 induced an increase in the magnitude, in
   absolute value, of the short-run demand price elasticity and at the same
   time increased the funds collected by the FET. We simulate the effects
   of the tax reform over the government revenues and per-capita
   consumption of cigarettes showing that additional increments in taxes
   would increase revenues and diminish consumption of cigarettes.}},

Abstract = {{Using interviews with forty formerly incarcerated people in the Greater
   Toronto Area, I explore how criminal record holders describe seeking
   work. People articulate being driven by a desire to be selective to
   whom, when, and how they disclose their past criminal record; they
   simultaneously want to talk about their past, at least to some people,
   some of the time. Many say they are quite selective in what types of
   jobs and employers they seek out, and their efforts to secure employment
   are driven by broader projects of stigma management. In light of these
   findings, I coin ``selective, voluntary disclosure{''} (SVD) as a new
   set of policy configurations that aim to facilitate not only employment
   but also dignity, privacy, and empowerment. SVD is well attuned with
   what former prisoners describe doing on an everyday basis, and it
   accords with their goals, aspirations, and rehabilitative self-projects.}},

Title = {{Are All Colonies Created Equal? The Role of Honey Bee Colony Strength in
   Almond Pollination Contracts}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines how honey bee population dynamics, the scale and
   timing of almond bloom, and unmarketability of almond honey interact to
   create misaligned incentives for growers and beekeepers in the
   California almond pollination services market. We combine economic
   contract theory with data from the first pollination contract survey to
   examine the design of pollination contracts. 89.2\% of respondents used
   contracts with minimum colony population requirements, suggesting that
   all colonies are not considered to be equal providers of pollination
   services. Contracts that involved enforcement every year provided the
   highest pollination fees on average, while those with no enforcement
   provided the lowest fees. We contribute to the literature regarding
   pollination services by demonstrating that the number of hives and price
   per hive present an incomplete picture of almond pollination
   transactions without information regarding colony strength requirements
   and enforcement. We also provide a theoretical rationale for why almond
   pollination agreements have anecdotally become more formal over time: as
   the marginal value of colony strength increases, the grower offers the
   beekeeper stronger incentives to provide high colony strength.
   California almond production is an extreme case of a crop relying almost
   solely on managed pollinators, but ultimately could reflect the future
   for many pollinator-dependent crops if pollinator populations continue
   to decrease while monoculture crop production increases.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout his career, Jung felt the psyche had `ancestral layers' that
   contained elements of an individual's species history, and clinical
   experience has shown that this idea can be an aid to psychological
   healing and emotional well-being. Thus, some later thinkers have
   attempted to link such theoretical constructs to the genome, as Jung had
   little knowledge of genetics in his day. But in the early 2000s, genome
   studies suggested that the genome might contain too little content to be
   capable of encoding symbolic information. This opinion gave rise to an
   oft-repeated `impoverished genome' argument, i.e. that the genome could
   not provide a significant contribution to the collective unconscious,
   prompting theorists to propose other sources for it, or to argue that it
   doesn't exist. Today, however, developments in evolutionary
   neurogenetics calls the impoverished genome argument into question for a
   number of independent reasons. These developments re-open the idea that
   the genome may be worth reconsidering as the biological substrate for
   the collective unconscious.}},

Abstract = {{George Town is a busy yet hushed part of Chennai, one of India's biggest
   cities. A glance at George Town shows men in their forties, fifties and
   sixties riding cycle rickshaws, cycle carts and operating push-carts.
   This article explores the question: why is a locality in one of India's
   most modern cities characterized by modes of transportation that have
   been deemed pre-modern and of little utility? I argue that by catering
   to niche demand groups, the rickshaw wallahs persist with their trade
   owing to multiple ostensible reasons such as the inability to shift
   trades or complacency. I also argue that, in addition to this, the
   processes of meaning-making and space-making during action and inaction
   contribute to making the rickshaws indispensable to the rickshaw wallahs
   of George Town.}},

Abstract = {{In the InGaN/GaN Quantum Well (QW) Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), the
   electron-hole overlap function de-creases significantly, and the carrier
   overflow is exhibited, under certain conditions, which deteriorates the
   performance of the devices. This hurdle is created by the detrimental
   effect of the polarization fields. The paper has elaborately presented
   the comprehensive and constructive studies on the effect of Ga and
   N-face polarities of GaN, in the conventional and staggered InGaN/GaN QW
   LEDs. The transition energies, the transition probabilities, the carrier
   concentrations, and the energy bands of the QW LEDs, are numerically
   calculated using the self-consistence solutions of the Schroddinger and
   Poisson equations. The Ga-face QW LEDs have shown a better electron-hole
   overlap function, even at low operating current. The N-face structures
   have suppressed the carrier overflow mechanism. A large carrier density
   has been found in the N-face QWs, due to the change of band structure
   along the direction of the polarization fields. This information may
   help the optoelectronic designer to design an efficient device.}},

   the methods they employed. We also conduct predictive analytics on
   finalist submissions, gauging contributors to success in establishing
   winning entries. We find that predicting Edelman winners a priori is
   extremely difficult; however, given a set of finalists, predictive
   models based on monetary impact could have predicted the winner over
   half the time in recent years, but would have had less predictive
   success in the early years of the competition. We suggest that, by
   characterizing the finalists, we can give future entrants a better

Abstract = {{Objective: The study aimed to assess the transverse craniofacial
   dimensions of patients (age, 7-14 years) with unilateral cleft lip and
   palate (UCLP), compare these dimensions with those of noncleft
   individuals, and identify the correlations between the nasal and
   maxillary transverse widths of patients with UCLP. Design: A
   cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty patients operated on for
   complete UCLP (UCLP group; 35 girls, 45 boys; median age: 10.7
   {[}7.9-14] years) and 80 age- and sex-matched noncleft individuals
   (control group; 35 girls, 45 boys; median age: 10.7 {[}7.3-14] years).
   Interventions: Interorbital, bizygomatic, nasal, maxillary skeletal,
   maxillary molar, mandibular molar, and antegonial width measurements
   were performed using posteroanterior cephalometric radiographs.
   Intergroup comparisons were conducted by using the independent
   samplest-test and Mann-WhitneyUtest. Correlation between the variables
   was examined using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: The
   bizygomatic, maxillary skeletal and molar, mandibular molar, and
   antegonial widths in the UCLP group were significantly less than those
   in the control group (P< .05). A positive correlation was found between
   the maxillary skeletal and nasal widths (r= 0.550,P< .001) and between
   the maxillary molar and nasal widths (r= 0.560,P< .001). Conclusions: In
   individuals with UCLP, the bizygomatic, maxillary skeletal and molar,
   mandibular molar, and antegonial widths were significantly less than
   those in noncleft individuals. As the maxillary skeletal and dental
   widths presented a positive correlation with the nasal width, a decrease
   in nasal width must be considered when maxillary constriction is noted.}},

   Synapses}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Retinofugal synapses serve as models for understanding how sensory
   signals from the periphery are relayed to the brain. Past studies have
   focused primarily on understanding the postsynaptic glutamatergic
   receptor subtypes involved in signal transmission, but the mechanisms
   underlying glutamate release at presynaptic retinal terminals remains
   largely unknown. Here we explored how different calcium (Ca2+) channel
   subtypes regulate glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission in two
   principal retinorecipient targets, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus
   (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC) of the mouse. We used an in vitro
   slice preparation to record the synaptic responses of dLGN and SC
   neurons evoked by the electrical stimulation of optic tract (OT) fibers
   before and during the application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers. We
   found that synaptic responses to paired or repetitive OT stimulation
   were highly sensitive to extracellular levels of Ca2+ and to selective
   antagonists of voltage gated Ca2+ channels, indicating that these
   channels regulate the presynaptic release of glutamate at retinal
   synapses in both dLGN and SC. Bath application of selective Ca2+ channel
   blockers revealed that P/Q-type Ca2+ channels primarily operate to
   regulate glutamate release at retinal synapses in dLGN, while N-type
   Ca2+ channels dominate release in the SC.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Tensegrities are prestressable trusses that have been proven to support
   various load distributions with minimum mass. This article presents a
   novel efficient method for designing lightweight tensegrities under
   local and global failure constraints. Local failure includes buckling
   and material yielding of individual members in the tensegrity. Global
   failure refers to global buckling of the tensegrity, where it loses
   stability without undergoing local failure at its individual members.
   The formulation and numerical approach to determine the critical global
   buckling forces and mode shapes of tensegrities with arbitrary shape and
   topology are first provided. Next, the design method considering local
   and global failure is presented, which starts with the local sizing of
   the member areas of the given tensegrity for the prevention of local
   failure. The method then determines the dominant failure mode by
   comparing the external forces and the critical global buckling force of
   the locally sized structure. If the critical global buckling force is
   larger than the external force, the dominant mode is a local failure and
   the locally sized design is returned as the minimum mass design.
   Conversely, if global failure is the dominant mode, different global
   reinforcement approaches are applied to raise the critical buckling
   force of the structure until it matches the external force, preventing
   global buckling. These reinforcement approaches include increasing the
   areas of the members and increasing the prestress in the tensegrity.
   Representative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the design method considering box and T-bar tensegrities.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to visualize profiles of older

   Retirement in Europe (SHARE), carried out in 18 countries and
   representing over 124 million aged individuals in Europe. Using the
   information of around 30 mixed-type variables, we design four composite
   indices of wellbeing for each respondent: self-perception of health,
   physical health and nutrition, mental agility, and level of dependency.
   Next, by implementing the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, profiles
   are created by combining those indices with a collection of
   socio-economic and demographic variables about the respondents. Five
   profiles are established that segment the dataset into the least to the
   most individuals at risk of health and socio-economic wellbeing. The
   methodology we propose is wide enough to be extended to other surveys or

Abstract = {{The structural-morphological types and localization conditions of talc
   occurrences in the Beloretsk district of the Western Urals talc province
   are discussed. The talc mineralization is represented by low-iron
   talcites and talc stones in the Riphean clastic-carbonate complexes of
   the Bashkirian Meganticlinorium. Prospective talc objects in the
   Beloretsk district are classified as apocarbonate, to be distinguished
   from the apoultramafic deposits, which are predominant in the Urals. The
   hydrothermal-metasomatic genesis of the talc ores, their association
   with the metamorphosed dolomite-bearing members of the Lower and Middle
   Riphean Kyzyltash and Avzyan formations, the cooccurrence with magnesite
   deposits, and the absence of relationship with granitoid magmatism are
   established. The inner resources of the Riphean sedimentary basins,
   activated by metamorphic processes, are viewed as the sources of
   ore-forming fluids. The flanks of magnesite bodies in dolomite sequences
   near contacts with silicate interbeds are considered as the lithological
   settings favorable for talcite formation. The presence of the stacks of
   interbedded magnesian-carbonate and aluminosilicate rocks in the Riphean
   sequences facilitates the silica-magnesium bimetasomatism but leads to
   the formation of predominantly lean talc-chlorite stone varieties. The
   morphological types of mineralization are represented by the stratiform
   bed-like talcite and talc stone bodies; the saddle-like and ribbon-like
   talcite bodies confined to monoclines and fold hinges and limbs; and the
   fault controlled steeply dipping linear bodies of rich talc ores.}},

   which revealed a large hypoechoic mass overlying the IVC. Abdominal
   computed tomography (CT) was performed which revealed an 8.9 x 7.9 x 9
   cm multilobulated lesion encasing the IVC. A CT-guided biopsy was
   performed which revealed a primary LMS of the IVC. Surgical en bloc

   Given that MMT has transitioned from the relatively marginal terrain of

   can expect that it will be able to shape the economic agenda in coming

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{47}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Earth system models predict that increases in atmospheric and soil
   dryness will reduce photosynthesis in the Amazon rainforest, with large
   implications for the global carbon cycle. Using in situ observations,
   solar-induced fluorescence, and nonlinear machine learning techniques,
   we show that, in reality, this is not necessarily the case: In many of
   the wettest parts of this region, photosynthesis and biomass tend to
   increase with increased atmospheric dryness, despite the associated
   reductions in canopy conductance to CO2. These results can be largely
   explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves
   flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than
   the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response
   to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate
   change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we
   represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric
   dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon
   sink.}},

   perception of the text, ordering of events, how to begin a story, how to
   end a story and how to edit a text. The students wrote four texts during
   the intervention. The quality of these texts was assessed by a panel of
   trained raters. Additionally, the language and reading comprehension and
   working memory capacity were tested. The results show that average text
   quality had significantly improved at the end of the intervention, and
   that this improvement was modulated by reading and language
   comprehension. Three months later, however, text quality was

Abstract = {{The Russian Constitutional Court (RCC) has over time developed a
   practice of adopting so-called ``Positive inadmissibility decisions{''}
   (Pozitivnoe Opredelenie) which complements (but also undermines) the
   existent formal procedure of only delivering decisions on merits with
   Judgments (Postanovlenie). The paper explores the uses of this peculiar
   practice. I show that the Positive inadmissibility doctrine is used by
   the Court to overcome the rigidity of the formal procedure where this is
   necessary for reasons of inter- or intra-organizational expediency. To
   do that I construct and analyze quantitatively a unique comprehensive
   dataset of all decisions handed down by the RCC in 1995-2015. I show
   that ``Positive inadmissibility decisions{''} are handed whenever a
   subpar case is deemed too important to be simply dismissed: in
   particular, if it is submitted by a powerful petitioner, or when the
   case is assigned to a longer serving member of the Court for judicial
   report.}},

Abstract = {{The provenance of the opening Aramaic portion of the Passover Haggadah

   that additional evidence, found in some neglected Talmudic manuscripts

   practical elements of this passage were originally unrelated to Passover
   or Jewish ritual. Instead, they were part of a recognised social script
   in late antique Jewish Babylonia that was integrated into the Passover
   Haggadah. With changes in Babylonian Jewish society, and with the
   transmission of this section and its associated practices to Jewish
   communities outside of Babylonia, the original social and cultural
   context of this sentence was forgotten. Untethered from the setting in
   which it was culturally legible, it developed through encounters with

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate tax competition in a neoclassical growth
   model where each country may use both residence- and source-based
   capital taxes. We show that both types of capital taxes are zero at any
   interior steady state, just as in a closed economy. For symmetric
   countries, and even for countries that differ only with respect to size
   and productivity, we prove analytically and verify numerically that the
   open-economy policies coincide exactly with the closed-economy policies
   in all time periods. For countries that are asymmetric in other
   dimensions, we find that source-based taxes are used to manipulate the
   intertemporal terms of trade in the short run. Either way, the fiscal
   externalities of source-based taxes vanish once residence-based taxes
   are allowed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria have a more comprehensive
   metabolism than expected - there may be other electron acceptors that
   oxidize ammonium nitrogen under anaerobic conditions, in addition to the
   well-known nitrite nitrogen, one of which is sulfate in the sulfammox
   process. Sulfate-containing compounds are part of the medium for the
   anammox process, but their concentrations are not particularly high (0.2
   g MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O/dm(3) and 0.00625 g FeSO4/dm(3)). They can
   react to some extent with influent ammonium nitrogen. In this work,
   tests were carried out in two sequencing batch reactors with granular
   sludge. The first reactor (R1) operated in a 6 h cycle, and the
   concentration of the inflowing sulfate was kept at 44 mg/dm(3)center dot
   d. The second reactor (R2) was operated until the 36th day in a 6 h
   cycle; the influencing concentration was 180 mg SO42-/dm(3)center dot d
   from the 37th to 64th day in a 3 h cycle, with an influencing
   concentration of 360 mg SO42-/dm(3)center dot d; and from the 65th to
   90th day, the reactor was operated again in a 6 h cycle with an
   influencing concentration of 180 mg SO42-/dm(3)center dot d. Along with
   the increased share of sulfate, both the ammonium utilization rate and
   specific anammox activity showed an increasing trend. As soon as the
   sulfate dosage was reduced, the ammonium utilization rate and specific
   anammox activity values dropped. Therefore, it can be concluded that
   sulfate-containing compounds contribute to the efficiency and rate of
   the anammox process.}},

Abstract = {{The European Union has set targets to reduce the greenhouse gases
   emissions in total energy consumption as a part of the securing the
   clean energy initiative and the efforts of carbon emissions reductions
   of 90\%, compared to the 1990 ones, until 2050. The transport sector is
   particularly exacerbating the above problems. Focusing on their fight,
   European authorities have invested and continue to invest in electric
   propulsion. In the European Union, electric mobility has grown
   tremendously in the last decade. Specifically, more and more automobile
   industries are turning their interest in electric technology to replace
   conventional cars which they use internal combustion engine. This study
   tries to evaluate the impact of the electric vehicle penetration in the
   electricity demand and related emissions inside the EU, in three steps.
   First, the penetration of electric vehicles into the Union is evaluated
   through literature review, then the impact in electricity demand due to
   the electric vehicles penetration is estimated and finally the emission
   of carbon dioxide gases allocated to these changes in the electricity
   demand are calculated based on official data published by EuroStat. The
   results were calculated using the most common prognostic tools in order
   to identify the expected trends, and showed that the future
   electrification in transportation will support the efforts on reducing
   the carbon emissions but not that fast as it was expected as the
   electricity generation in EU is still based in fossil fuels at
   significant percentage. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the parametric approach for linear time-variant
   systems by using dynamic compensator and multi-objective optimization.
   Based on the solution to a class of generalized Sylvester matrix
   equations, the generally completely parametrized expression of the
   dynamic compensator is established, meanwhile, the completely parametric
   forms of left and right closed-loop eigenvectors and two groups of
   arbitrary parameters are obtained. With the proposed parametric
   approach, the closed-loop system can be transformed into a linear
   time-invariant one with expected eigenstructure. Simultaneously, it also
   considers a novel technique to multi-objective optimization design for
   linear time-varying systems. Multiple performance objectives, including
   the overall sensitivity function, H-2 norm and H-infinity norm, are
   formulated by two groups of arbitrary parameters. Based on these
   performance objectives, the robustness criteria is expressed by a
   comprehensive objective function which includes each performance
   objective weighted. By utilizing the degrees of freedom in parameters to
   optimize the comprehensive objective function, an optimized dynamic
   compensator can be obtained to satisfy the robustness criteria. Finally,
   an example of spacecraft rendezvous problem is presented to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Vortioxetine is currently used as the first-line therapy drug for major
   depressive disorder (MDD). In the present study, we aimed to develop and
   fully validate an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of
   vortioxetine and its major metabolite Lu AA34443 in plasma and to
   investigate the effects of dronedarone and amiodarone on vortioxetine
   metabolism in rats. After protein precipitation with acetonitrile, the
   separation of vortioxetine, Lu AA34443 and duloxetine (internal
   standard, IS) were finished on an Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 1.7
   mu m) column and their detections were conducted by a Xevo TQ-S triple
   quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode. The assay
   displayed excellent linearity in the range of 0.5-50 ng/mL for
   vortioxetine, and 5-1000 ng/mL for Lu AA34443. The results of this
   method exhibited that the precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery,
   and stability of vortioxetine and Lu AA34443 met all requirements for
   the quantitation in plasma samples. The validated assay was further
   successfully employed to study the effects of dronedarone (80 mg/kg) and
   amiodarone (60 mg/kg) on vortioxetine metabolism in rats. The results
   showed that dronedarone and amiodarone could increase the concentration
   of vortioxetine and have inhibitory effect on vortioxetine metabolism.
   Thus, vortioxetine dose interruption or reduction may be considered. (C)

Journal = {{ENGINEERING REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A steam turbine is one of the components in a power plant. Considered as
   a strong coupling system, steam turbines may possess correlation
   information among the operation parameters. In this article, a
   correlation extraction method based on mutual information theory is
   proposed for performance monitoring. First, five functions between two
   variables including linear and nonlinear relationships are tested to
   validate the proposed method. In the first industrial case study, a
   sensor fault detection based on the governing stage pressure is
   conducted on the abnormal fluctuation mutual entropy values calculated
   by operation data. The results show the proposed method may effectively
   be used to detect sensor errors and locate the first error sample.
   Furthermore, uncertainty analysis on the heat rate is studied to sort
   the importance degree of the relative parameters. The mutual information
   entropy difference values are then calculated to quantify the
   sensitivity degree of the operation parameters to the heat rate index.
   The results in this case study are in accordance with the sequences by
   the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty Measurement (GUM) and Monte
   Carlo (MC) methods. In conclusion, mutual information entropy may hence
   be used as a new solution for turbine monitoring, combined with
   information theory.}},

Title = {{A Novel Approach to Quantitative Evaluation of Outer Retinal Lesions Via
   a New Parameter ``Integral{''} in Spectral Domain Optical Coherence
   Tomography}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to design a new parameter
   ``integral{''}to quantitatively evaluate the spatial cumulative
   reflectivity of the outer retinal layers in optical coherence tomography
   (OCT), and to investigate its role in the detection of outer retinal
   diseases.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Fovea-centered line OCT scans
   were performed on 60 eyes of 60 healthy volunteers and 44 eyes of 44
   patients diagnosed with outer retinal diseases. The integrals of the
   ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) were measured by
   respectively accumulating the grayscale values of all the pixels within
   the EZ and IZ at specified locations on the scanning lines, and were
   then adjusted by calculating their percentages on the outer retina. The
   integrals of the EZ and IZ were compared between the two groups.
   Results: The integrals of the EZ and IZ were stably and normally
   distributed in the healthy eyes, and were significantly lower in eyes
   with outer retinal lesions than in healthy ones (P < 0.05). Moreover,
   the integrals of the EZ and IZ were correlated with best corrected
   visual acuity (BCVA; adjusted R-2 = 0.620) and the presence of outer
   retinal lesions (Nagelkerke R-2 = 0.767). The area under the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.954 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 0.918-0.990) when the integral was selected as a diagnostic
   variable.
   Conclusions: Obtained from this novel quantification method, the new
   parameter integral was comparable between different individuals and had
   the potential to detect outer retinal abnormalities in reflectivity
   through OCT.
   Translational Relevance: Our work verified the feasibility of the new
   image analysis technique in the detection of the diseases affecting the
   outer retina.}},

Abstract = {{Overfeeding causes severe steatosis but not inflammation in goose liver,
   suggesting existence of protective components. Previous studies have
   shown that some intestinal microbes and their metabolites damage
   intestinal structural integrity and function, thus causing inflammation

   Therefore, this study hypothesizes that intestinal structural integrity
   of goose is maintained during overfeeding, which may provide goose fatty
   liver a protective mechanism against inflammation. To test this
   hypothesis, 48 seventy-day-old healthy Landes male geese were overfed
   (as overfeeding group) or normally fed (as control group). Blood and
   intestine (jejunum, ileum, and cecum) samples were harvested on the 12th
   and 24th d of overfeeding. Data showed that goose fatty liver was
   successfully induced by 24 d of overfeeding. Hematoxylin-eosin staining
   analysis indicated that the arrangement of villi and crypts in the
   intestine was orderly, and the intestinal structure was intact with no
   pathological symptoms in the 2 groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   and quantitative PCR analysis indicated no significant differences in
   the expression of tight junction and inflammation-related genes as well
   as plasma lipopolysaccharide concentration between the groups. Ileal
   hypertrophy and cecal atrophy were observed in the overfed vs. control
   geese, probably because of change of sphingolipid metabolism. Activation
   of apoptotic pathway may help cecum avoid necrosis-induced inflammation.
   In conclusion, healthy and intact intestine provides a layer of
   protection for goose fatty liver against inflammation. Sphingolipid
   metabolism may be involved in the adaptation of ileum and cecum to
   overfeeding. The hypertrophy of ileum makes it an important contributor
   to the development of goose fatty liver. The atrophy and decline in the
   function of cecum may be caused by apoptosis induced by overfeeding.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of drugs for patients with central
   mid-temporal (rolandic) discharges detected by electroencephalogram
   (EEG).
   Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 430 patients with rolandic
   discharges, who were treated at the Neuroelectrophysiology Center of the
   Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from February 2015 to
   February 2018. Patients were divided into three groups according to
   medication: levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC) and sodium
   valproate (VPA). All patients were followed up for at least 2 years, and
   the seizure frequency, EEG results and side effects of drugs were
   recorded.
   Results: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) occurred in 398/430 patients. Rolandic
   discharges were also found in those with febrile seizures, tic
   disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thirty-one
   patients experienced only one seizure and no relapse, while 367 patients
   experienced more than two seizures (including 364 receiving drug
   treatment). The failure rate of LEV as initial therapy was significantly
   higher than those of OXC and VPA. The overall efficacy of OXC was higher
   than that of LEV. However, none of the three medications could control
   rolandic discharges. Moreover, the side effects of the three drugs were
   mild.
   Conclusions: Rolandic discharges are common in children with RE and
   other diseases, such as febrile seizures, tic disorders, and attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder. Patients with only one seizure need no
   treatment. Those with multiple seizures can be treated with OXC, LEV,
   and VPA. OXC serves as the initial antiepileptic drug with a lower
   failure rate and significant efficacy.}},

Title = {{Incorporation of lysine-modified UiO-66 for the construction of
   thin-film nanocomposite nanofiltration membrane with enhanced water flux
   and salt selectivity}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{493}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The utilization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been proved to be
   promising in the attainment of high-performance membranes. In this work,
   lysine-decorated UiO-66 (Lys@UiO-66) is prepared via post-synthetic
   modification. Then, the controlled positioning of Lys@UiO-66 on a
   polyethersulfone (PES) substrate membrane is achieved by a
   pressure-assisted method, followed by interfacial polymerization to
   fabricate the Lys@UiO-66-based thin-film nanocomposite membrane
   (TFN-LDU). An even distribution of hydrophilic MOFs atop the substrate
   induces the formation of regular tent-like and mesh-topology polyamide
   structures, which enhance the effective membrane surface area and
   provide additional water transport channels. The optimal membrane with a
   Lys@UiO-66 loading density of 17.13 mu g cm(-2), TFN-LDU8, achieves a
   55\% enhancement in water permeability (18.27 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1))
   without compromising the solute selectivity. Importantly, the TFN-LDU8
   membrane exhibits high rejections of divalent cation salts (97.81\% for
   MgCl2 and 92.81\% for CaCl2) and improved mono-/divalent cation
   selectivity due to the pore hindrance and electrostatic exclusion of the
   Lys@UiO-66. Furthermore, the TFN-LDU8 membrane evinces a stable
   nanofiltration performance during the long-term nanofiltration
   experiment and displays a good antifouling ability in the fouling tests.
   This research provides a promising strategy for the design of
   nanofiltration membranes with special functions by using modified MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{Among the many characterization techniques for solar panel testing, two,
   electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL), can provide useful
   visual information about the presence of different types of cell
   defects. EL is performed outdoors by night in commercial solar plants
   due to the very weak luminescence emission compared to sunlight. PL
   faces the added difficulty of needing to find a large-area homogeneous
   light source to excite the modules. Since nighttime work poses many
   drawbacks and risks, a daylight outdoor EL/PL system would be useful for
   offering safe inspection of solar plants. We present daylight
   luminescence techniques based on a bias switching method, in which a
   pulsed luminescence signal is obtained by alternating the polarization
   state of the solar panels, synchronizing it with the luminescence image
   detection by an InGaAs camera. Fast switching and selecting an optimized
   exposure time are key to achieving high-quality images. The daylight
   luminescence method described herein allows both EL and PL luminescence
   images to be obtained, even under high solar irradiance conditions.}},

Journal = {{PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Scientific journals are a fundamental instrument for the dissemination
   of research results. Spanish Library and Information Science (LIS)
   journals have achieved a prominent presence in international databases.
   By studying the articles published in them, it is possible to determine
   the thematic evolution of research in LIS, a subject on which few
   studies are available. The current work presents a biblionnetric and
   thematic analysis of Spanish journals included in the Information
   Science and Library Science category of the Web of Science between 2015
   and 2019. On the one hand, the production of the journals is identified
   and analyzed individually and as a group, according to the data
   available in the WoS Core Collection, considering the productivity of
   authors, citations, organizations, countries, and core publications. On
   the other hand, the production of journals as a whole is analyzed using
   SciMAT, an open-source software tool developed to perform science
   mapping analysis in a longitudinal framework by identifying research
   themes that have been the object of research during the period of
   analysis as well as their composition, relationship, and evolution. The
   results highlight the specialization of Spanish LIS journals in a series
   of topics that can be grouped into five main areas, in order of
   importance: social networks and digital media, bibliometrics and
   scholarly communication, open access, open data and big data, libraries,
   and information and knowledge management. Likewise, these journals have
   opened up their thematic focus to other disciplines, among which
   Communication stands out prominently, as reflected in the established
   thematic categories. This study establishes a reference framework for
   researchers in the Information Science and Library Science area, making
   it possible to understand new relationships and research opportunities
   both inside and outside the original knowledge area.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A full understanding of changes of the microbiome and metabolome during
   Napier grass silage in relation to aerobic exposure can improve the
   nutritional value and extend the aerobic stability of this important
   feed in tropical and subtropical regions. The round bale silage of
   Napier grass was prepared with deionized water (control) and screened
   strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR753 (LR753) and L. buchneri 40788
   (LB). Silages were stored at ambient temperature (30-40 degrees C) for
   60 days, followed by 2 and 4 days of aerobic exposure. Strains LB and
   LR753 significantly improved aerobic stability (>84 h vs. 18 h of
   control) of baled Napier grass silage by inhibiting the growth of
   Saccharomycetales as for the higher production of acetic acid (P <
   0.05). Weissella and Issatchenkia spp. were the dominant bacteria and
   fungi in 60-day silage, respectively. LC-MS/MS detected a total of 426
   metabolites throughout ensiling and aerobic exposure. With the decrease
   of Weissella spp. and the increase of Acetobacter spp., the metabolites
   associated with both were mainly odor-related (3-methylbutanoic acid,
   isoquinoline, and cuminaldehyde) and amines (tryptamine and tyramine) in
   control silage, while more antimicrobial activity metabolites were found
   in strains LB and LR753-treated silage (methylbutanoic acid,
   1,2-propanediol, and tiglic acid). Screened local strain LR753 showed a
   promising potential for improving silage fermentation and aerobic
   stability of Napier grass. The present study indicates that adequately
   describing the microbiome and metabolome of silages during fermentation
   and aerobic exposure can improve ensiling practices and the screening of
   silage inoculants that act synergistically with the natural microbiome
   of the forage in hot and humid areas.}},

Abstract = {{Shijiazhuang, the city with the worst air quality in China, is suffering
   from severe ozone pollution in summer. As the key precursors of ozone
   generation, it is necessary to control the Volatile Organic Compounds
   (VOCs) pollution. To have a better understanding of the pollution status
   and source contribution, the concentrations of 117 ambient VOCs were
   analyzed from April to August 2018 in an urban site in Shijiazhuang.
   Results showed that the monthly average concentration of total VOCs was
   66.27 ppbv, in which, the oxygenated VOCs (37.89\%), alkanes (33.89\%),
   and halogenated hydrocarbons (13.31\%) were the main composite on. Eight
   major sources were identified using Positive Matrix Factorization
   modeling with an accurate VOCs emission inventory as inter-complementary
   methods revealed that the petrochemical industry (26.24\%), other
   industrial sources (15.19\%), and traffic source (12.24\%) were the
   major sources for ambient VOCs in Shijiazhuang. The spatial
   distributions of major industrial activities emissions were identified
   by using geographic information statistics system, which illustrated the
   VOCs was mainly from the north and southeast of Shijiazhuang. The
   inverse trajectory analysis using Hybrid Single -Particle Lagrangian
   Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) and Potential Source Contribution
   Function (PSCF) clearly demonstrated the features of pollutant transport
   to Shijiazhuang. These findings can provide references for local
   governments regarding control strategies to reduce VOCs emissions. (C)

Title = {{Analytical approach to quantitative risk assessment for solar power
   projects}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the economic risk associated with a solar power project is
   essential in order to secure financing. Quantitative risk assessment is
   often conducted by rerunning a model to calculate economic viability
   measures, including Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Levelized Cost of
   Electricity (LCOE), for ranges of values of uncertain input parameters
   that determine capital cost, operating cost, energy yield and revenue.
   This paper provides an analytical approach that avoids this repetitive
   recalculation. The analytical approach is based on differentiating the
   economic viability measures with respect to the input parameters of
   interest. Using 20\% changes in parameter values, the analytical
   approach is shown to agree within 0.875\% for a behind-the-meter
   project. For an off-grid utility scale project the analytical approach
   is exact for five cost and energy yield parameters and agrees within
   0.01\% for degradation rate and 0.14\% for discount rate. Moreover, the
   analytical approach is extended to provide differential importance
   measures that indicate which parameters are contributing most/least to
   the riskiness of the project. Results indicate that the ranking of
   parameters is identical for IRR and LCOE despite these being very
   different measures of economic viability, thus further supporting the
   analytical method provided in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is an important
   agricultural pest worldwide. Uridine diphosphate
   (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are one of the largest and most
   ubiquitous groups of proteins. Because of their role in detoxification,
   insect UGTs are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we
   identified and analyzed UGT genes in B. tabaci MEAM1 to investigate
   their potential roles in host adaptation and reproductive capacity.
   Based on phylogenetic and structural analyses, we identified 76 UGT
   genes in the B. tabaci MEAM1 genome. RNA-seq and real-time quantitative
   PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed differential expression patterns of these genes
   at different developmental stages and in association with four host
   plants (cabbage, cucumber, cotton and tomato). RNA interference results
   of selected UGTs showed that, when UGT352A1, UGT352B1, and UGT354A1 were
   respectively silenced by feeding on dsRNA, the fecundity of B. tabaci
   MEAM1 was reduced, suggesting that the expressions of these three UGT
   genes in this species may be associated with host-related fecundity.
   Together, our results provide detailed UGTs data in B. tabaci and help
   guide future studies on the mechanisms of host adaptation by B. tabaci.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine patients' and carers' understanding of pharmacy
   generated medication labels.
   Methods: A user testing questionnaire was conducted individually for 80
   participants at 2 hospitals through a face-to face semi-structured
   interview. Pharmacy generated medication labels from different locations
   were grouped based on components into 4 different variations.
   Participants were asked to read and demonstrate understanding of the
   dose and frequency from 1 of the 4 variations for 4 prescription
   medications. Twenty participants for each variation were recruited so
   that demographic characteristics matched between variations.
   Results: Overall, only 45\% of participants were able to correctly
   understand the dose and frequency presented on all the pharmacy labels
   presented on medications. Medication labels with standardised timing
   performed better than other variations with 91\% of participants able to
   determine the correct frequency. The use of numeric figures was
   understood by 80-90\% of participants compared to the use of capitalised
   text (65-70\%). Pharmacy generated medication labels that proposed one
   step were better understood than instructions that incorporated several
   steps.
   Conclusion/practice implications: The study supports the use of simple,
   clear and explicit written instructions along with the use of numeric
   figures in pharmacy generated medication labels to achieve higher
   understandability in patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The growing number, size, complexity, and energy density of data centers
   result in considerable energy challenge. The implementation of efficient
   and eco-friendly cooling systems, strategies, and methods that can help
   reduce the energy consumption of traditional cooling systems is
   imperative for data centers. In this study, an innovative concept of a
   solar chimney-based direct airside free cooling (SC-DAFC) system is
   proposed for data centers to achieve energy saving. A theoretical model
   of the SC-DAFC system is developed to evaluate the indoor thermal
   environment, ventilation flow rate, and heat recovery of the data center
   under given climate conditions. 3D numerical simulations are carried out
   to investigate the effects of raised floor height and turbine pressure
   drop on the cooling performance of the system. An economic analysis is
   also conducted by calculating the net present value and dynamic
   investment recovery period of the project. Results indicate that the
   thermal environment in the SC-DAFC data center can meet the cooling
   requirements under favorable climate conditions, and such project has
   strong profitability. The SC-DAFC system is technically and financially
   feasible, thereby providing efficient solutions that reduce energy
   consumption and operational costs.}},

   perspective}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to explore the roles of consumers' risk and benefit
   perception and food information processes in predicting their acceptance
   of genetically modified food. We integrate the protective action
   decision and heuristic systematic models to develop a conceptual model
   to predict customers' purchase intention. We conducted a survey
   questionnaire with measures adapted from existing Likert scales. We used
   a sample of 573 respondents from Shandong Province, China, comprising
   people who had ever purchased genetically modified products. We tested
   our hypotheses using a structural equation model. Results suggest that
   perceived risk is a negative determinant of purchase intention, while
   perceived benefit is a positive factor of purchase intention. Moreover,
   perceived benefit is an important predictor of purchase intention.
   Perceived risk significantly affects information need, information
   seeking, and systematic processing. Perceived benefit has a positive
   relationship with information need and systematic processing.

Title = {{A Novel Combination of Fruits and Vegetables Prevents Diet-Induced
   Hepatic Steatosis and Metabolic Dysfunction in Mice}},

Abstract = {{Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that higher fruits and
   vegetables (F\&V) consumption correlates with reduced risk of hepatic
   steatosis, yet evidence for causality and the underlying mechanisms is
   lacking.
   Objectives: We aimed to determine the causal relation between F\&V
   consumption and improved metabolic disorders in mice fed high-fat (HF)
   (Experiment-1) or normal-fat (Experiment-2) diets and its underlying
   mechanisms.
   Methods: Six-week-old male C57BU6J mice were randomly grouped and fed
   diets supplemented at 0\%-15\% (wt:wt) with a freeze-dried powder
   composed of 24 commonly consumed F\&V (human equivalent of 0-9
   servings/d) for 20 wk. In Experiment-1, mice were fed an HF (45\% kcal
   fat) diet with 0\% (HFO), 5\%, 10\%, or 15\% (HF15) F\&V or a matched
   lowfat control diet (10\% kcal fat). In Experiment-2, mice were fed an
   AIN-93 diet (basal) (B, 16\% kcal fat) with 0\% (BO), 5\%, 10\%, or 15\%
   (B15) F\&V supplementation. Body weight and composition, food intake,
   hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ceramide levels, sphingomyelinase
   activity, and gut microbiota were assessed.
   Results: In Experiment-1, mice fed the HF15 diet had lower weight gain
   (179\%), hepatic steatosis (48.4\%), adipose tissue inflammation, blood
   (24.6\%) and liver (33.9\%) ceramide concentrations, and
   sphingomyelinase activity (38.8\%) than HFO mice (P < 0.05 for all). In
   Experiment-2, mice fed the B15 diet had no significant changes in weight
   gain but showed less hepatic steatosis (28.5\%), blood and adipose
   tissue inflammation, and lower blood (30.0\%) ceramide concentrations
   than BO mice (P < 0.05 for all). These F\&V effects were associated with
   favorable microbiota changes.
   Conclusions: These findings represent the first evidence for a causal
   role of high F\&V intake in mitigating hepatic steatosis In mice. These
   beneficial effects may be mediated through changes in ceramide and/or
   gut microbiota, and suggest that higher than currently recommended
   servings of F\&V may be needed to achieve maximum health benefits.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{114}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{3D printed fly ash based geopolymer was prepared with fly ash and quartz
   sand as main raw materials while slag powder and silica fume as
   supplementary cementitious materials. In this paper, anhydrous sodium
   silicate powder was used as activator and ATTAGEL-50 thixotropic
   thickener was used as 3D printing additive. The effect of slag powder
   and silica fume on the rheological properties of 3D printed fly ash
   based geopolymer was studied. The results show that the apparent
   viscosity, thixotropic property, plastic viscosity and yield stress of
   geopolymer first increased and then decreased with the increase of slag
   powder and silica fume respectively. Compared with the Bingham (BH)
   model, the Herschel-Bulkley (H-B) model is more accurate and more
   suitable for characterizing the rheological model of fly ash based 3D
   printed geopolymer. The suitable content for slag powder is 10\%. On the
   basis of adding slag powder, silica fume was also used to replace the
   fly ash, the suitable content for silica fume is 10\% in this fly
   ash-slag powder based 3D printing geopolymer. According to the SEM
   observations, it is found that the interior of the printing layer of the
   3D printing block is more conducive to the production of the geopolymer
   gel than the interlaminar surface of the printing layers. It is found
   that the printing layers are connected with each other through bridges.}},

   Squeeze Casting Process for Wrought Aluminum Alloy Scroll}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Scroll compressors are popularly applied in air-conditioning systems.
   The conventional fabrication process causes gas and shrinkage porosity
   in the scroll. In this paper, the electromagnetic stirring (EMS)-based
   semisolid multicavity squeeze casting (SMSC) process is proposed for
   effectively manufacturing wrought aluminum alloy scrolls. Insulation
   temperature, squeeze pressure, and the treatment of the micromorphology
   and mechanical properties of the scroll were investigated
   experimentally. It was found that reducing the insulation temperature
   can decrease the grain size, increase the shape factor, and improve
   mechanical properties. The minimum grain size was found as 111 +/- 3 mu
   m at the insulation temperature of 595 degrees C. The maximum tensile
   strength, yield strength, and hardness were observed as 386 +/- 8 MPa,
   228 +/- 5 MPa, and 117 +/- 5 HV, respectively, at the squeeze pressure
   of 100 MPa. The tensile strength and hardness of the scroll could be
   improved, and the elongation was reduced by the T6 heat treatment. The
   optimal process parameters are recommended at an insulation temperature
   in the range of 595-600 degrees C and a squeeze pressure of 100 MPa.
   Under the optimal process parameters, scroll casting was completely
   filled, and there was no obvious shrinkage defect observed inside. Its
   microstructure is composed of fine and spherical grains.}},

Title = {{Highly effective flame retardant lignin/polyacrylonitrile composite
   prepared via solution blending and phosphorylation}},
Journal = {{POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aiming at improving the thermal stability and flame retardancy of
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN), a novel flame retardant PAN composite was
   prepared via a facile approach. First, lignin (LIG) and PAN were
   dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a uniform blend solution
   of LIG and PAN, then the solution was poured into the mould to scrape
   the LIG/PAN composite film. Subsequently, the flame retardant LIG/PAN
   composite (FR-LIG/PAN) was fabricated via phosphorylation. The structure
   of pure PAN, LIG, LIG/PAN and FR-LIG/PAN composite was characterized by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The thermal and combustion properties of the samples
   were evaluated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone
   calorimeter test (CCT). In addition, the cross section and char residue
   of FR-LIG/PAN composite after combustion were observed by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the elemental compositions and
   contents of the cross section and char residue of FR-LIG/PAN composite
   after combustion were tested by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDS). The results indicated that hydroxyl group and benzene skeleton
   were present in LIG/PAN and the phosphorus element was successfully
   introduced into FR-LIG/PAN composite via phosphorylation. The amount of
   char residue for FR-LIG/PAN at 800 degrees C is more than those of pure
   PAN and LIG/PAN. SEM photos indicate the expansion characteristics of
   the char residue, and EDS results prove that the uniform distribution of
   elements in the cross-section of FR-LIG/PAN composite. Moreover,
   FR-LIG/PAN exhibits the lowest peak heat release rate (pHRR) and smoke
   production rate (SPR). These results demonstrated that FR-LIG/PAN had
   excellent flame retardancy and char forming ability. In addition, the
   composition of the gases evolved from pyrolysis process of FR-LIG/PAN
   was analyzed by thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). The main pyrolysis products in gas phase are
   H2O, CO2 and PO center dot. This work proposes one facile method for
   preparation of practical flame retardant PAN composite. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Sulfonated polyimides (SPIs)/silica composite membranes were prepared

   on 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl
   ether-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether have been
   chosen for the preparation of composite membranes due to their
   relatively high hydrolytic stability. Membranes varying in degree of
   sulfonation as well as silica content were characterized by FT-IR
   spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, transmission electron
   microscopy and impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the thermal and
   hydrolytic stability of membranes was enhanced by silica particles.
   Based on the morphological and conductivity data it is suggested that
   formation of a hydrogen bonded network of silanol groups of silica
   nanoparticles and sulfonic acid groups of the polymer matrix enhances
   the proton conductivity via the hopping mechanism of proton transport.}},

Journal = {{POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we critically approach the idea of ``saving Muslim
   women{''} by examining two prominent judgments by the Supreme Court of
   India and their attendant debates: Mohammad Ahmed Khan vs. Shah Bano
   Begum and Others 1985 AIR 945, popularly known as the Shah Bano judgment
   and Shayara Bano vs. Union of India And Others WP(C) No.118 of 2016,
   popularly known as the Triple Talaq (divorce) judgment. Using the
   frameworks of feminist geopolitics, femonationalism, and feminist
   geolegality, we analyze the debates around the Shah Bano and Triple
   Talaq judgments, looking at how the state employs and often usurps the
   narrative of gender equality and women's rights for its own purposes. We
   highlight how laws ostensibly for the protection of Muslim women (and
   the discourses that surround them) have the effect of strengthening the
   Hindu nationalist state, and furthering masculinist state building and
   territory making. By focusing debates on the categories of Muslim men
   and women, the law becomes a means to resolve the ``problem{''} of
   Muslims in India.}},

Title = {{Prediction error parameters for visuospatial interference: Minimal
   prediction errors leave positive declarative memory intact following
   visuospatial word search interference}},
Journal = {{LEARNING AND MOTIVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{72}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Prediction error (PE) is an important boundary condition for memory
   reconsolidation; however, while it is clear that a prediction error is
   necessary for reactivation, the parameters for what constitutes a
   prediction error are unclear. In the present study, participants watched
   a video with a positive emotional valence, followed by a baseline free
   recall test. One day later, participants completed one of three
   prediction error conditions (NoPE, 1PE, 2PE), followed by a visuospatial
   interference task (i.e., complex word search) or a nonvisuospatial
   multiplication control task. The NoPE condition viewed a photo and short
   summary of the video presented in a congruent modality (i.e., digitally
   on a computer monitor). The 1PE condition viewed the same photo and
   summary but received this information in an incongruent modality (i.e.,
   on a piece of paper). The 2PE condition viewed the same photo and
   summary in an incongruent modality (i.e., on a piece of paper), plus one
   new fact added to the summary. Memory testing one week later showed a
   significant drop in free recall, but not recognition, for all groups
   from the first to the second free recall test; however, no differences
   were observed between groups. These results indicate that, in the
   positive film paradigm, minimal prediction errors (i.e., one or two
   changes) are not sufficient to destabilize memory. Given the importance
   of prediction error for applications of reconsolidation to the treatment
   of memory-based psychological disorders and drug addiction, further
   examination of the parameters for prediction error is warranted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{650-657}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A procedure for the design of optical schemes of holographic displays is
   developed. The procedure implies the simultaneous optimization of the
   image quality factors and the root-mean-square values of the hologram
   diffraction efficiency at the control points. The procedure is
   implemented at the level of specific software tools and utilized for the
   design of an example scheme of a waveguide holographic display. The
   display operates within the 480-620 nm spectral range and has a 10
   degrees angular field of view and an exit pupil diameter of 10 mm. The
   input of radiation into the waveguide plate and the radiation output are
   achieved using diffractive elements operating in the transmitted light.
   The output element in this case is a volume phase hologram recorded by
   two point sources. The calculation results show that the implementation
   of the proposed design makes it possible to reduce the radius of the
   circle of confusion in terms of the angular measure by 0.28 `-0.97 `.
   The diffraction efficiency of the output hologram in this case is closer
   to the target value by 2.5\% to 19\%. (C) 2021 Optical Society of

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Chimerism testing by short tandem repeats (STRs) is used to monitor
   engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (HSCT). Generally, STR alleles are stable and transferred from parent to
   child or from donor to recipient. However, 3 cases did not follow this
   norm. Additional work-up with help from forensic literature solved these
   mysteries.
   In case 1, the patient received HSCT from his son. The son shared STR
   alleles in 22/23 loci except Penta E, which was explained by repeat
   expansion in the son.
   In case 2, the patient had been in remission for 14 years after HSCT for
   lymphoma and developed repeat expansion in CSF1P0 in granulocytes.
   In case 3, a pre-HSCT patient demonstrated 3 alleles, with 2 peaks
   taller than the third, in the FGA locus (chromosome 4). A combination of
   a triallelic variant and leukemia-associated trisomy 4 explained the
   finding. STR number variants are rare and clinically inconsequential but
   can overlap malignancy-associated, clinically significant changes.}},

   for drought-prone areas in Indonesia}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Climatic and environmental changes significantly influence the
   suitability of land for sustainable staple crop production around the
   world. Under climate change, droughts become severe due to the lack of
   precipitation, and food insecurity exists in many developing countries.
   Indonesia has been facing the challenges of climate change, especially
   in mitigating the effects of drought, and it is essential to select land
   that is suitable for microlevel crop production. Therefore, the aim of
   this research was to classify the suitable lands in drought-prone areas
   of central East Java of Indonesia. GIS and satellite remote sensing
   datasets have been used to develop a land suitability analysis based on
   the FAO classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was
   incorporated with expert opinion using factors and constraints, which
   influenced the land suitability assessments. The integrated AHP and the
   land suitability analysis inferred that 40.26 per cent of the study area
   was classified as highly suitable, 30.82 per cent were moderately
   suitable, and 21.89 per cent were marginally suitable for Maize
   Cultivation in central East Java. At the microlevel, the suitable land
   were further divided using a random forest classifier with
   high-dimensional classification features to increase the computational
   efficiency using k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms. The
   experimental results of this algorithm could effectively search the
   nearest classifier to increase the algorithm efficiency. This research
   recommends extending the machine learning approach with remote sensing
   and GIS to select suitable land for maize production at the microlevels
   in drought-prone areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia assessed the
   outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) treatment among children younger than 15
   years. Retrospective data were collected on treatment outcomes and their
   determinants for children with TB for the cohorts of 2012-2014 enrolled
   in 40 hospitals and 137 health centers. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and
   logistic regression were used for the analysis. Of 2,557 children
   registered, 1,218 (47.6\%) had clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB, 1,100
   (43\%) had extrapulmonary TB, and 277 (8.9\%) had bacteriologically
   confirmed TB. Among all cases, 2,503 (97.9\%) were newly diagnosed and
   178 (7\%) were HIV positive. Two-thirds of the children received
   directly observed treatment (DOT) in health centers and the remaining
   one-third, in hospitals. The treatment success rate (TSR) was 92.2\%,
   and the death rate was 2.8\%. The childhood TSR was high compared with
   those reported in focal studies in Ethiopia, but no national TSR report
   for children exists for comparison. Multivariate analysis showed that
   being older-5-9 years (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR], 95\% CI: 2.53,
   1.30-4.94) and 10-14 years (AOR, 95\% CI: 2.71, 1.40-5.26)-enrolled in
   DOT in a health center (AOR, 95\% CI: 2.51, 1.82-3.48), and HIV negative
   (AOR, 95\% CI: 1.77, 1.07-2.93) were predictors of treatment success,
   whereas underdosing during the intensive phase of treatment (AOR, 95\%
   CI: 0.54, 0.36-0.82) was negatively correlated with treatment success.
   We recommend more research to determine if intensive monitoring of
   children with TB, dosage adjustment of anti-TB drugs based on weight
   changes, and training of health workers on dosage adjustment might
   improve treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study evaluated the seizure outcomes in children with
   drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), having a pre-existing VNS device, after
   generator replacement with cardiac-based VNS device.
   Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 30 children with DRE from 2
   centers with an existing VNS device nearing end-of-service who underwent
   generator replacement with cardiac-based VNS device and had at least 1
   year follow up. Seizure outcomes and adverse effects were studied.
   Results: The mean age at insertion of cardiac-based VNS device was 15.03
   years. 26.7 \% patients showed at least one class improvement at last
   follow up (mean 2.08 years) and half of the patients maintained their
   McHugh seizure-outcome class. Thirty-six percent of patients had > 50 \%
   seizure reduction at last follow up. Ten patients reported improvement
   in ictal severity. Most of the patients tolerated the replacement well.
   Conclusions: Nearly one-third of patients with DRE showed additional
   improvement after replacement with cardiac based VNS device. Half of the
   patients maintained their seizure control.}},

Journal = {{INFANT BEHAVIOR \& DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{61}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of cultural differences in face scanning is thought to be
   shaped by social experience. However, previous studies mainly
   investigated eye movements of adults and little is known about early
   development. The current study recorded eye movements of British and
   Japanese infants (aged 10 and 16 months) and adults, who were presented
   with static and dynamic faces on screen. Cultural differences were
   observed across all age groups, with British participants exhibiting
   more mouth scanning, and Japanese individuals showing increased central
   face (nose) scanning for dynamic stimuli. Age-related influences
   independent of culture were also revealed, with a shift from eye to
   mouth scanning between 10 and 16 months, while adults distributed their
   gaze more flexibly. Against our prediction, no age-related increases in
   cultural differences were observed, suggesting the possibility that
   cultural differences are largely manifest by 10 months of age. Overall,
   the findings suggest that individuals adopt visual strategies in line
   with their cultural background from early in infancy, pointing to the
   development of a highly adaptive face processing system that is shaped
   by early sociocultural experience.}},

Title = {{Oak Transpiration Drawn From the Weathered Bedrock Vadose Zone in the
   Summer Dry Season}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The spatiotemporal dynamics of plant water sources are hidden and poorly
   understood. We document water source use of Quercus garryana growing in
   Northern California on a profile of approximately 50 cm of soil
   underlain by 2-4 m of weathered bedrock (sheared shale melange) that
   completely saturates in winter, when the oaks lack leaves, and
   progressively dries over the summer. We determined oak water sources by
   combining observations of water stable isotope composition, vadose zone
   moisture and groundwater dynamics, and metrics of tree water status
   (potential) and use (sapflow). During the spring, oak xylem water is
   isotopically similar to the seasonal groundwater and shallow,
   evaporatively enriched soil moisture pools. However, as soils dry and
   the water table recedes to the permanently saturated, anoxic,
   low-conductivity fresh bedrock boundary, Q. garryana shifts to using a
   water source with a depleted isotopic composition that matches residual
   moisture in the deep soil and underlying weathered bedrock vadose zone.
   Sapflow rates remain high as late-summer predawn water potentials drop
   below -2.5 MPa. Neutron probe surveys reveal late-summer rock moisture
   declines under the oaks in contrast to constant rock moisture levels
   under grass-dominated areas. We therefore conclude that the oaks
   temporarily use seasonal groundwater when it occupies the weathered
   profile but otherwise use deep unsaturated zone moisture after seasonal
   groundwater recedes. The ample moisture, connected porosity, and
   oxygenated conditions of the weathered bedrock vadose zone make it a key
   tree water resource during the long summer dry season of the local
   Mediterranean climate.}},

Title = {{Structural Insight on Functional Regulation of Human MINERVA Protein}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{MINERVA (melanoma invasion by ERK), also known as FAM129B, is a member
   of the FAM129 protein family, which is only present in vertebrates.
   MINERVA is involved in key signaling pathways regulating cell survival,
   proliferation and apoptosis and found upregulated in many types of
   cancer promoting invasion. However, the exact function of the protein
   remains elusive. X-ray crystallographic methods were implemented to
   determine the crystal structure of MINERVA(Delta C), lacking C-terminal
   flexible region. Trypsin digestion was required before crystallization
   to obtain diffraction-quality crystals. While the N-terminal pleckstrin
   homology (PH) domain exhibits the typical fold of PH domains, lipid
   binding assay indicates specific affinity towards phosphatidic acid and
   inositol 3-phosphate. A helix-rich domain that constitutes the rest of
   the molecule demonstrates a novel L-shaped fold that encompasses the PH
   domain. The overall structure of MINERVA(Delta C) with binding assays
   and cell-based experiments suggest plasma membrane association of
   MINERVA and its function seem to be tightly regulated by various motifs
   within the C-terminal flexible region. Elucidation of MINERVA(Delta C)
   structure presents a novel fold for an alpha-helix bundle domain that
   would provide a binding platform for interacting partners.}},

   the often larger group of voters with economic grievances over
   immigration. Using individual level data from eight rounds of the
   European Social Survey, our empirical analysis shows that while cultural
   concerns over immigration are a stronger predictor of far right party
   support, those who are concerned with the impact of immigration on the
   economy are important to the far right in numerical terms. Taken
   together, our findings suggest that economic grievances over immigration
   remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage.}},

Abstract = {{The article examines how many leaders used Twitter during the COVID-19
   pandemic, in what way, and the impact they had on the public. In the
   context of Twitter, the impact on the public refers to the growth in
   followers as it signifies the increased interest of the public about
   information. 50,872 tweets were collected from 143 state leaders and an
   original dataset was created containing information on the growth of
   followers. Ordinary least squares regression models were used for the
   analysis. It was found that 64.8\% of UN member states had a leader that
   tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant increase in the
   number of followers during the pandemic compared to months prior was
   noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining
   Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted
   and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet
   users. The research implies that citizens are interested in being
   informed about emergencies through social networks, and government
   officials should use them.}},

Abstract = {{Though Germany has long provided education for children speaking a
   heritage language and received two recent waves of refugees, reliable
   assessment tools for diagnosis of language impairment or the progress in
   the acquisition of German as a second language (L2) by refugee children
   are still lacking. The few tools expressly targeting bilingual
   populations are normed for younger, early successive bilingual children.
   This study investigates 27 typically developing children with Arabic as
   first language (L1), comparing 15 school-age Syrian refugees (6;6-12;8),
   with 12 heritage speakers (6;0-12;9). We assess the L1 and L2 skills of
   these two groups with standardized tests, but crucially with an Arabic
   and a German sentence repetition (SRT) as well as a nonword (NWRT)
   repetition task (Grimm \& Hubner, in press; Marinis \& Armon-Lotem,
   2015). Comparable scores emerged only for German LITMUS-NWRT and Arabic
   LITMUS-SRT. Refugee children had an advantage in L1 measures, for
   example, vocabulary and morphosyntactic production, whereas they
   performed poorly in the German LITMUS-SRT and other L2 tests involving
   morphosyntax and vocabulary even with 24 months of systematic exposure.
   This indicates that the acquisition of adequate vocabulary and complex
   syntax takes time. The paper explores factors influencing performance on
   the repetition tasks and relates the results to established diagnostic
   procedures and educational policies.}},

Pages = {{1375-1378}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Integration of clinical, biomedical, social,
   administrative, and pharmaceutical sciences in a pharmacotherapeutics
   course is beneficial to student education. Unfortunately, the perceived
   increase in time, commitment, and workload required to produce
   integrated material often serves as a barrier to high level academic
   integration. This commentary discusses how interdisciplinary faculty
   communication started at the beginning of content development, using an
   initial brief planning session and ongoing unscheduled flexible methods,
   can efficiently produce integrated material without substantially
   increasing faculty workload compared to independently produced
   integrated course material.
   Commentary: Content development can be streamlined during a short
   initial meeting to consider the relevant disciplines (e.g.,
   pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, clinical sciences) for a topic and to
   collaboratively develop corresponding content outlines. To produce fully
   integrated material, collaborators should develop content using a
   cloud-based file sharing system and communicate using asynchronous,
   electronic means to ask questions and provide suggestions to
   collaborators.
   Implications: Interdisciplinary communication is the foundation of
   integrated pharmacotherapeutic sessions, but supplemental meetings in
   addition to already required faculty meetings are both challenging to
   schedule and time consuming. With proper planning and the deliberate use
   of both continuous file sharing and asynchronous electronic
   communication, educators can produce parallel content emphasizing key
   concepts across disciplines without substantially increasing faculty
   workload.}},

Abstract = {{Cinacalcet (CT) is an important drug for the treatment
   hyperparathyroidism. Only few studies havereported thepotential
   interaction between CT and other potentially coadministered drugs. In
   this study, the potential of invitro interaction between CT and DF
   sodium (DF-Na) was investigated. An ion pair salt of CT with DF was
   obtained by mixing the two compounds in solution; the product was fully
   characterized by HPLC analysis, UV, FTIR, NMR spectroscopy in addition
   to DSC. The solubility and partition coefficients were found to
   significantly decrease and increase, respectively, for the obtained ion
   pair salt in comparison to the parent compounds. Dissolution studies in
   phosphate buffer pH 6.8 revealed a significant decrease in the
   dissolution of an already poorly water soluble drug (decrease to similar
   to 20\% of the original). Permeation studies, through Caco-2 cells
   monolayer, revealed a significant decrease in permeation of CT when
   coexisted with DF (almost to half). Apparent permeability coefficient
   (Papp) decreased from 3.6 x 10(-6) to 1.8 x 10(-6) cm/s. Interestingly,
   a structure for the formed CT-DF salt that could explain the above
   findings (increase in lipophilicity), could be proposed based on
   structural modelling, molecular dynamic simulations and NMR proton
   chemical shifts analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Very preterm infants are at risk for adverse
   neurodevelopmental outcome. To better identify children without brain
   injury at risk for developmental sequelae, we assessed predictive values
   of supratentorial brain metrics in relation to outcome. Methods: Very
   preterm infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
   term-equivalent age. Infants with any grade of supra- or infratentorial
   brain injury according to Kidokoro et al. {[}Pediatrics
   2014;134:e444-53] were excluded. Supratentorial brain metrics
   (biparietal width, extracerebral space, interhemispheric distance) were
   measured and categorised using existing cut-off values. The Psychomotor
   Developmental Index (PDI) and Mental Developmental Index (MDI) were
   assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second and third
   edition, at 2 years of age. Developmental delay was defined as a score
   Results: A total of 237 very preterm infants were enrolled. Of all
   infants, 59 (21.2\%) showed developmental delay. Infants with z-scores
   less than -0.5 for biparietal width had significantly lower PDI (p =
   0.039) and MDI (p = 0.042) than infants with normal z-scores.
   Enlargement of extracerebral spaces was also related to lower PDI (p =
   0.047) and MDI (p = 0.036). Negative predictive value was highest when
   all brain metrics were within the normal range (PDI <85: 96.6\%, MDI
   <85: 90.0\%). Combining the biparietal width and the interhemispheric
   distance showed highest positive predictive values for developmental
   delay (MDI or PDI <85: 58.3\%). Discussion: Supratentorial brain metrics
   are predictive for neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with ostensibly
   normal MRI. A combination of supratentorial brain metrics is most
   meaningful for identifying infants at risk for long-term sequelae.}},

Abstract = {{The reversal and lateral vibration of the drill string are very complex
   motion and can affect the normal operation of the drill string. The
   movement of the drill string in the stepped well is different from the
   movement of the drill string in the regular well. The vibration of the
   drill string in the stepped well varies with the size of the wellbore
   and can be visually reflected by the phase speed. To find out the
   relationship between reversal and lateral vibration, the natural
   frequency of lateral vibration of the drill string was solved by using
   the method of energy conservation. The analysis shows that the phase
   speed of flexural wave in the stepped well is faster in small size
   wellbore than in large size wellbore. The reversal and lateral resonance
   is easy to happen in small size wellbore, and the reversal will excite
   lateral vibration. When the sum of reversal and rotational angular
   frequencies approaches the natural angular frequency of lateral
   vibration, the lateral resonance will occur.}},

Abstract = {{The mass elevation effect (MEE) of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has
   attracted the attention of geographers because of its significant
   influence on the Asian climate, snow line, timberline, and other
   important climate-ecological boundaries of the plateau and on global
   ecological patterns. In recent years, much progress has been made in
   quantifying the MEE of TP. However, factors that affect the size of MEE
   have not been examined in depth, and the key factors still remain
   unclear. Based on quantification of MEE for each mountain basal
   elevation plot, this study identifies the factors that contribute
   significantly to MEE of the plateau. Seven factors are considered,
   including mountain basal elevation, distance from the core zone of MEE,
   thermal continentality, maximum elevation, height difference, area, and
   difference of underlying surface (with the yearly max ``Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index{''} (NDVI) serving as a quantitative
   indicator). We also used these seven factors as independent variables to
   develop a multiple linear regression model for MEE of the plateau.
   Results show that: (1) the determination coefficient (R-2) of the model
   reaches as high as 0.877, and the contributions of mountain basal
   elevation, distance from the core zone of MEE, thermal continentality,
   maximum elevation, topographical height difference, area, and NDVI are
   39.77\%, 23.02\%, 14.48\%, 5.78\%, 11.41\%, 2.92\%, and 2.62\%,
   respectively, with mountain basal elevation and the distance from the
   core of MEE as the most important factors; (2) thermal continentality
   and MEE are significantly correlated, and maximum elevation only has a
   coupling relationship with MEE, with height difference and NDVI
   contributing little to MEE. This study deepens our understanding of MEE
   and its forming factors in the Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{TGF-beta 1 is associated with sepsis renal injury. miR-663a regulates
   TGF-beta 1 level by MiRDB analysis. Our study investigated whether
   miR-663a involves in renal damage of sepsis via TGF-beta 1. 30 healthy
   SD rats were divided into control group, Sepsis group and Sepsis +
   miR-663a inhibitor group followed by analysis of creatinine and urea
   nitrogen (BUN) by automatic biochemical analyzer, renal cell apoptosis
   by TUNES method, miR-663a level by qRT-PCR and TGF-beta 1 and Tubulin
   protein level by Western blot. Compared with Control group, blood
   creatinine and BUN were significantly elevated in Sepsis group, and
   renal cell apoptosis was increased (P < 0.01). Compared with Sepsis
   group, creatinine and BUN levels of the Sepsis +miR-663a inhibitor group
   were decreased significantly and apoptosis of renal tissues were
   decreased (P < 0.05). The miR-663a level in Sepsis group was
   significantly increased (P < 0.01), which was significantly reduced by
   miR-663a inhibitor (P < 0.05). TGF-beta 1 is the target of miR-663a.
   Compared to Control group, TGF-beta 1 level in Sepsis group was
   significantly reduced (P < 0.01) and increased in Sepsis + miR-663a
   inhibitor group (P < 0.05). When sepsis occurs, miR-663a level is
   elevated and TGF-beta 1 level is decreased. MiR-663a binds TGF-beta
   1-UTR and reduce its level. miR-663a causes sepsis kidney damage by
   reducing TGF-beta 1 and miR-663a inhibitor can ameliorate sepsis kidney
   damage by antagonizing the effect of miR-663a.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, PI3K and mTOR have been regarded as promising targets for
   cancer treatment. Herein, we designed and synthesized four series of
   novel thieno{[}3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives that containing aroyl
   hydrazone or aryl hydrazide moieties. These derivatives act as PI3K/mTOR
   dual inhibitors, suggesting that they can be used as cancer therapeutic
   agents. All compounds were tested for anti-proliferative activity
   against four cancer cell lines. The structure-activity relationship
   (SAR) studies were conducted by varying the moieties at the C-6 and C-2
   positions of the thieno{[}3,2-d]pyrimidine core. It indicated that aryl
   hydrazide at C-6 position and 2-aminopyrimidine at C-2 position are
   optimal fragments. Compound 18b showed the most potent in vitro activity
   (PI3K alpha IC50 = 0.46 nM, mTOR IC50 = 12 nM), as well as good
   inhibition against PC-3 (human prostate cancer), HCT-116 (human
   colorectal cancer), A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) and MDA-MB-231
   (human breast cancer) cell lines. Furthermore, Annexin-V and propidium
   iodide (PI) double staining confirmed that 18b induces apoptosis in
   cytotoxic HCT-116 cells. Moreover, the influence of 18b on cell cycle
   distribution was assessed on the HCT-116 cell line, and a cell cycle
   arrest was observed at the G1/S phases.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Helicobacter pylori harbouring cag-pathogenicity island
   (cagPAI) which encodes type IV secretion system (T4SS) and cagA
   virulence gene are involved in inflammation of the gastric mucosa. We
   examined all the 27 cagPAI genes in 88 H. pylori isolates from patients
   of different ethnicities and examined the association of the intactness
   of cagPAI region with histopathological scores of the gastric mucosa.
   Results: 96.6\% (n = 85) of H. pylori isolates were cagPAI-positive with
   22.4\% (19/85) having an intact cagPAI, whereas 77.6\% (66/85) had a
   partial/rearranged cagPAI. The frequency of cag2 and cag14 were found to
   be significantly higher in H. pylori isolated from Malays, whereas cag4
   was predominantly found in Chinese isolates. The cag24 was significantly
   found in higher proportions in Malay and Indian isolates than in Chinese
   isolates. The intactness of cagPAI region showed an association with
   histopathological scores of the gastric mucosa. Significant association
   was observed between H. pylori harbouring partial cagPAI with higher
   density of bacteria and neutrophil activity, whereas strains lacking
   cagPAI were associated with higher inflammatory score.
   Conclusions: The genotypes of H. pylori strains with various cagPAI
   rearrangement associated with patients' ethnicities and
   histopathological scores might contribute to the pathogenesis of H.
   pylori infection in a multi-ethnic population. (C) 2020 Sociedade

Abstract = {{People overestimate the risk of some events, such as terrorist attacks

   indicates that politicized, out-group stereotypes may be to blame. We

   violence-out-group, in-group and non-racialized-will occur in their
   local communities. We hypothesize that negative stereotypes of
   immigrants and Muslims will increase the perceived risk of out-group
   violence but not of other forms of violence. Analyses of original survey
   data from a sample of 1,068 Americans reveal four findings: (1) most
   Americans accurately perceive home-grown violence to be more likely than
   violence by foreigners, (2) political identification and ideology
   strongly predict out-group stereotypes, (3) out-group stereotypes
   strongly predict the perceived risk of out-group violence but are not
   significantly associated with risk perceptions for other forms of
   violence and (4) vulnerability factors predict risk perceptions for all

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate drying shrinkage, strength and
   microstructure of alkali-activated high-calcium fly ash (AAHF) paste by
   using FGD-gypsum (FGD) and dolomite (DLM) as expansive additives. The 10
   M sodium hydroxide combined with sodium silicate solutions were used as
   alkaline activator for all mixes. The preparation of AAHF paste was
   divided into 2 steps. First, the study focused on the effects of
   expansive additive (FGD and DLM) and liquid/binder (L/B) ratio on the
   drying shrinkage of AAHF paste. The fly ash (HF) was replaced with FGD
   and DLM at the dosages of 0\%, 2.5\%, 5.0\%, 7.5\%, and 10\% by weight
   of binder. The drying shrinkage, setting time, compressive strength and
   microstructure of AAHF paste containing FGD and DLM were studies. Test
   results showed that the use of FGD and DLM as expansive additives
   improved the drying shrinkage of AAHF paste. The increasing L/B ratio
   had an adverse effect on drying shrinkage. The setting time of AAHF
   paste containing FGD and DLM decreased, whereas the strength increased.
   However, the strength development of the AAHF paste incorporated with
   FGD tended to decline at the curing time of 120 days. The increase in
   strength was due to the formation of some strength-bearing chemical
   phases which was demonstrated by the XRD, FTIR, and SEM/EDS analyses.
   The differences in reaction products were an essential factor in the
   strength development of the AAHF paste with expansive additive. It can
   be recommended that using DLM was advantages regarding the improvement
   of drying shrinkage and long-term strength in comparison with the AAHF
   paste with FGD.}},

Abstract = {{Core-scale measurements are considered the ground truth that oil and gas
   or electric utility companies use to predict the migration of fluids
   such as oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide, or brine deep underground
   during their extraction or injection operations. To provide a greater
   understanding of petrophysical properties of low-permeability geologic
   formations such as shales and tight gas sandstones, this study
   introduces a novel core-analysis procedure. The technique follows
   conventional pressure-pulse-decay permeametry, where the pressure in an
   inlet chamber adjacent to a cylindrical core plug undergoes a rapid
   pressurization, the system is shut in, and the pressure reaches a new
   equilibrium. However, unlike a standard unidirectional pressure-pulse
   decay, the full-immersion pressure-pulse decay (Hannon 2019) applies a
   pressure disturbance to the entire outer surface area of the sample.
   This article covers the numerical simulator designed to model flow
   through an anisotropic porous sample in this scenario. The model assumes
   distinct but uniform permeabilities along the radial and axial
   directions of the cylindrical plug sample. When extracting a plug
   vertically (or perpendicular to bedding), the permeability along the
   radial direction associates with the horizontal permeability (i.e.,
   parallel to bedding), whereas in the axial direction, flow occurs
   perpendicular to bedding (a vertical permeability). Investigations of
   these model outputs demonstrate an approximately 20-fold decrease in
   time to complete a full-immersion experiment compared with conventional
   pressure-pulse decay. Furthermore, the pressure-decay curves resulting
   from the full-immersion method have slightly different shapes than those
   resulting from other unidimensional transient methods. These differences
   begin to demonstrate that, under achievable experimental conditions, the
   analysis of pressure data from one full-immersion test could enable the
   simultaneous estimation of the apparent permeabilities parallel and
   perpendicular to bedding of a cylindrical sample in addition to its
   porosity. A follow-up article finalizes the proof of this capability
   with a parameter-estimation procedure and presents experimental
   verification through a proof-of-concept study. Described in greater
   detail in that article, the parameter estimator requires multiple
   forward simulations to analyze the data, which behooves minimizing the
   compute time for each simulation. By using an alternating direction
   implicit time-marching scheme and a structured but variably spaced grid,
   the numerical simulator built for this purpose provides a forward model
   output with suitable accuracy in approximately 0.5 seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Through the examination of recent developments in Iraq, Brazil and
   China, this paper explores the role of public communication in a)
   generating, corralling, and buttressing political legitimacy, and b)
   negotiating, demarcating, and reproducing collective identities. The
   transformation of Iraq's public sphere after the fall of the Ba'ath
   regime saw it shift from a tightly controlled and unified communication
   space to unencumbered yet fragmented spheres split along ethno-sectarian
   lines, buttressing sectarian politics and identities. The emergence of
   subaltern publics in Brazil's favelas empowered residents to express
   public dissent, assert their voice, and develop pride in their
   community. Chinese efforts to control online public discourse provide
   the government with ways of managing its perceived legitimacy and foster
   patriotic fellowship online. Legitimation and the affirmation of
   identity interact and support one another in public discourse, as we
   illustrate.}},

Title = {{Public administrators' roles in the policy adaptation of transport
   directives: How knowledge is created and reproduced}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{208-216}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The European Union (EU), as well as many national governments, has
   adopted directives intended to reduce the environmental impact of
   transport. For example, the EU's clean fuel strategy requires member
   states to develop national policy frameworks for the market development
   of alternative fuels and their infrastructure. Given these directives,
   policy solutions must be formulated and proposed by member states. This
   paper focuses on the policy adaptation phase of a policy process,
   specifically on administrators' knowledge-making when constructing
   policy proposals. The paper combines policy theory with planning theory
   and provides a theoretical framework for studying policy adaptation,
   specifically, administrators' construction of knowledge in such
   processes. The empirical study is based on two cases, both situated in
   the Swedish context. It concludes that administrators use several
   sources of knowledge: process knowledge, project knowledge, and context
   knowledge. New policy so-lutions are constructed by reusing data from
   existing reports and policy proposals. There has been a specific focus
   on the use of economic analysis as an instrument for evaluating
   solutions. The paper shows that, in the policy adaptation phase, no new
   analyses are conducted and that decoupling strategies are used when
   dealing with economic analysis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Renal pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) is a mild form of an
   aldosterone-resistance syndrome caused by mutations in the NR3C2 gene
   that codes for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The disease is
   inherited as an autosomal dominant trait characterized by signs and
   symptoms of salt-losing in infancy. Disease manifestations could be
   severe in infancy but improve after the age of 1-3 years. Some affected
   members are asymptomatic and remain so life-long. In this study, we
   report the identification of a large deletion in the NR3C2 gene
   (c.1897+1\_1898 1)\_(c.{*}2955+?)del in renal PHA1 patients from an
   extended family spanning four generations. We prospectively evaluated
   the plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone profiles over four
   decades in symptomatic and asymptomatic affected family members. The
   benefits of early diagnosis on the clinical outcome were assessed as
   well. The long-term follow-up showed an age-dependent decrease in both
   plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels over the years.
   However, aldosterone levels remain high life-long. Thus, levels of
   aldosterone are a reliable marker to detect asymptomatic family members.
   The diagnosis of the proposita led to early diagnosis and therapy in
   other affected family members, significantly mitigating the clinical
   course. Despite the extremely elevated serum aldosterone levels during
   pregnancy, affected pregnant women did not experience any ill effects.
   However, this should be verified by observations in other adult
   patients.}},

Title = {{The Laboratory-Based HySpex Features of Chlorite as the Exploration Tool
   for High-Grade Iron Ore in Anshan-Benxi Area, Liaoning Province,
   Northeast China}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Anshan-Benxi area in Liaoning province is an important banded iron
   formations (BIFs) ore-mining district in China. Chlorite is widely
   distributed in this area, which is related to BIFs and high-grade iron
   ore, respectively. A fast and convenient method to identify the type and
   spatial distribution of different chlorites is crucial to the evaluation
   of high-grade iron ore in this area. Qidashan iron mine is a typical
   BIFs deposit, and its BIFs-related high-grade iron ore reserves are the
   second largest in the area. In this paper, the laboratory-based
   HySpex-320m hyperspectral imaging was used to study the wall rock in
   Qidashan iron mine. A hyperspectral imaging processing model was
   established for mineral identification, mineralogy mapping, and chlorite
   spectral features extraction. The results show that the wavelength
   positions of OH, Fe-OH, and Mg-OH absorptions of chlorite in the altered
   wall rock of high-grade iron ore are between 1400 and 1410, 2260 and
   2265, and 2360 and 2370 nm, respectively, which are longer than those
   around BIFs. The relationship between cations in the octahedral layer of
   chlorite and the wavelengths of OH, Fe-OH, and Mg-OH indicates that Mg
   and Mg/(Mg + Fe) are inversely related to these wavelengths, whereas Fe
   is positively related. The wavelengths appear to be weakly influenced by
   Al-VI. Since the bandpass of hyperspectral imaging systems is usually
   less than 10 nm, these chlorite wavelength differences can be used as a
   favorable tool for the high-grade iron ore exploration and the iron
   resources evaluation in the Anshan-Benxi area.}},

Title = {{Adenomyosis in mice resulting from mechanically or thermally induced

Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE ONLINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research question: Do uterine procedures potentially disrupting the
   endometrial-myometrial interface (EMI) induce adenomyosis?
   Design: Six prospective, randomized controlled experiments were
   conducted involving a total of 106 female BALB/c and 12 female C57BL/6
   mice. The incidence of adenomyosis was evaluated in these two strains of
   mouse after mechanically induced EMI disruption (EMID), or thermally
   induced EMID using electrocoagulation of different intensities. Finally,
   the incidence was evaluated in mice that had received perioperative
   administration of aprepitant (an NK1R inhibitor), propranolol (a
   beta-blocker) or vehicle. Body weight, hot plate latency and grade of
   myometrial infiltration were evaluated. Histology, immunohistochemistry
   and histochemistry analyses were also performed.
   Results: Mechanical injury to the EMI caused EMID. Adenomyosis developed
   in the majority of mice in the EMID groups 3 months after mechanically
   induced EMID but did not develop in the control group (83.3\% in C57BL/6
   mice, P = 0.015; 100\% in BALB/c mice, P = 0.0002). With thermally
   induced EMID, adenomyosis was found in 30\% of the EMID mice 10 weeks
   later, but the incidence increased to 66.7\% if the extent of EMID
   damage was increased. In mice with perioperative administration of
   aprepitant or propranolol, the incidence of adenomyosis was reduced from
   100\% to 58.3\% (both P = 0.00034).
   Conclusions: This study provides the first piece of experimental
   evidence that EMID resulting from iatrogenic uterine procedures can
   substantially increase the risk of developing adenomyosis, with the risk
   in proportion to the severity of disruption. More intriguingly,
   perioperative administration of an NK1R antagonist or beta-blocker
   significantly reduced the risk of developing adenomyosis.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to observe the immunomodulatory effects of
   oligopeptides derived from jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.)
   (JOPs). 200 female BALB/c mice in five groups were respectively given
   deionized water (control), whey protein (0.20 g per kg body weight (BW))
   and JOPs at doses of 0.20, 0.40, and 0.80 g per kg BW by intragastric
   administration on a daily basis. 7 tests were conducted to determine the
   immunomodulatory effects of JOPs on immune organ indexes, cellular and
   humoral immune responses, macrophage phagocytosis, and natural killer
   (NK) cell activity. Spleen T lymphocyte sub-populations and serum
   cytokine and immunoglobulin levels were tested to study how JOPs
   improved the immune system. We found that JOPs could significantly
   enhance innate and adaptive immune responses in mice by the improvement
   of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, macrophage phagocytosis capacity
   and NK cell activity. The immunomodulatory effects may be based on
   increased T and Th cell percentages, serum interleukin (IL)-1 alpha,
   IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, production of immunoglobulin
   (Ig) M, IgG, and IgA, and depressed interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion.
   These results suggest that dietary JOPs could be valuable as potential
   immunomodulators.}},

Abstract = {{Metals are of serious concern due to their toxicity, persistency, and
   accumulation potential in aquatic animals. However, limited information
   is available on the combined effects of metal with temperature
   elevation, which is one of the future climate changes suggested for the
   oceans. In this study, the effect of temperature elevation was
   investigated by analyzing toxicity, bioconcentration, and antioxidant
   response in juvenile and adult marine mysids upon exposure to 20 degrees
   C and 25 degrees C for 48 h and 96 h. Based on LC50 values, toxicity of
   metals was highly reliant on temperature, exposure period, and age.
   Elevation in temperature significantly increased the whole metal
   toxicity in juveniles. Bioconcentration was elevated by increasing
   exposure period and metal concentration. Significant elevation of
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and depletion of glutathione (GSH) was measured in
   juveniles, while significant elevation of both MDA and GSH was detected
   in adults. Subsequently, enzymatic activities of antioxidant enzymes in
   catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly in
   adults at 48 h and 96 h, whereas most activities were significantly
   lowered in juveniles at 96 h. These results suggest that the early life
   stage of marine mysids is more sensitive to the combined effect of metal
   and temperature than adult stage due to an impairment in the induction
   of the antioxidant defense system.}},

Abstract = {{High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) limits treatment options for

   production of beta-lactamase using the disk diffusion method, polymerase
   chain reaction, and a nitrocefin-based test, respectively, in
   Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated from patients at
   a university hospital in Tokyo in 2010. Of the 100 E. faecalis isolates
   analyzed, 30 isolates had high-level resistance (HLR) to gentamicin, and
   22 isolates had HLR to streptomycin. Of the 40 E. faecium isolates
   analyzed, 9 isolates had HLR to gentamicin, and 9 isolates had HLR to
   streptomycin. Of the 39 gentamicin-HLR enterococcal isolates, 24
   isolates were non-HLR to streptomycin. All 39 isolates with HLR to
   gentamicin as well as 19 of 101 without HLR carried aac(6')-Ie-aph(2
   `')-Ia. Carriage of ant(6)-Ia was confirmed in 25 of 31 streptomycin-HLR
   isolates. Production of P-lactamase was documented in none of the E.
   faecalis and E. faecium isolates. Whole-genome sequencing analysis
   revealed that all but one E. faecalis isolate that carried
   aac(6)-Ie-aph(2 `')-Ia and ant(6)-Ia belonged to sequence type (ST) 4 (n
   = 8), ST16 (n = 4), or ST179 (n = 9). Nevertheless, most of the pairs of

Abstract = {{In the process of implementing a construction project, it is necessary
   to meet numerous requirements imposed on investors by regulations
   related to broadly understood environmental protection, which are
   significant for the vast majority of investment processes. For obvious
   reasons, the environment, understood as all natural elements, is not
   subject to geopolitical division principles. Therefore, the issue of
   international cooperation between states in the field of environmental
   protection is becoming increasingly important. One of its major tools is
   the procedure for transboundary environmental impact assessment in the
   Polish legal order. The article presents regulations applying to the
   strategic environmental impact assessment and verification of the
   environmental effects of project implementation. The complex nature of
   the indicated regulations, as well as their nonuniform application by
   entities issuing administrative decisions may directly contribute not
   only to delays in implementing an investment project, but also to a
   significant increase in its costs. It should also be remembered that
   strict compliance with these requirements is a necessary condition for
   the participation of Community funds in the implementation of a specific

Abstract = {{Under global warming, expectations for woody biomass as a renewable
   energy are increasing. Short rotation coppice willow is the most widely
   planted energy wood crop. In this study, we examined the effect of
   harvest frequency on willow yield across multiple harvest rotations,
   something which is poorly understood. We planted 18 clones of Salix
   pet-susu and S. sachalinensis at a density of 25,000 or 16,667 cuttings
   ha(-1) in Hokkaido, northern Japan, and harvested either annually or
   biennially for 10 years (2009-2018). Annual variation in willow yield
   per stool was analyzed using five linear mixed-effect models
   incorporating the number of rotations, harvest interval, and weather
   parameters during the growing season with clones and plant density as
   random factors. Number of rotations had a significant negative effect on
   annual yield in all five models. We estimated that yield could be halved
   over 10 consecutive years of harvesting. In three out of the five
   models, biennial harvesting had a significant positive effect on yield
   in comparison with annual harvesting. In addition, we found that weather
   conditions, such as hours of sunshine during growing season, air
   temperature in May (when leaf flushing occurs), and precipitation in
   July (when vigorous height growth occurs) have significant positive
   effects on willow yield. These results suggest that, to maintain willow
   vigor for longer time periods biennial, or more than two-year-harvest,
   cycle is recommended rather than annual harvest.}},

Title = {{Hormonal reactivity during martial arts practice among high-risk youths}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Martial arts have become a popular afterschool activity for youths
   across the globe. Accumulating data suggest that these activities may
   confer substantial cognitive and psychological benefits, and recent
   efforts have been made to introduce martial arts training into
   educational and rehabilitation settings. However, few studies have
   examined the potential mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. The
   current study evaluated the reactivity of two hormones, oxytocin (OT)
   and cortisol (CT), thought to be respectively involved in regulating
   mammalian social behaviors and responsivity to stress, to a session of
   intensive martial arts training in samples of at high-risk and low-risk
   (in regular educational establishments) youths. OT and CT were measured
   at baseline, during peak training, and following a cool down period.
   Analyses revealed that high-risk youths had lower OT but similar CT
   baseline levels, compared to low-risk youths, prior to the martial arts
   session. A significant group by time interaction indicated that whereas
   the OT levels among low-risk youths returned to baseline levels
   following training, OT levels among high-risk youths remained elevated.
   Finally, unlike low-risk youths for whom CT levels continued to increase
   throughout the training session, high-risk youths showed no significant
   CT reactivity. This study suggests that some of the beneficial effects
   of martial arts may be related to hormonal processes, especially
   increases in OT levels, and highlights the differing effects that
   training may have in different populations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Distractions theory and general practice have suggested that providing
   safe physical conditions will reduce task demands and thereby increase
   workers' ability to develop highly productive and safe production
   systems. However, the construction industry has not achieved greater
   productivity and safety gains despite extensive safety efforts. This
   study aimed to examine whether the reduced task-demands as a result of
   safer conditions actually causes fall risks to be underestimated,
   encourages increased productivity, and changes risk-taking behaviors. To
   do so, the changes in study participants' productivity, risk perception
   (through physiological and subjective measures), risk-taking behavior
   (through tracking subject's motion, and localizing their positions and
   postures), and safety performance (through frequency of near misses)
   were examined when they were provided with various levels of safety
   interventions. The findings indicated that the reduced perceived risk
   and the desire for increased productivity may skew risk analysis and
   strongly bias workers toward presuming invulnerability when safety
   interventions are in place. Known as risk compensation cognitive bias,
   this change in human behavior counteracts the traditional outcomes
   explained by Hinze's distractions theory. The empirical evidence from a
   simulated roofing task helped substantiate the proposed
   productivity-safety model, which illustrates how safety interventions
   might become counterproductive because of the risk-compensation bias
   experienced by workers. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To provide a normative database of several Pentacam parameters
   for a healthy pediatric population. Methods: This was a retrospective
   study conducted at Al Watany Eye Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt. We explored
   the Pentacam HR database and collected the data of 432 normal right eyes
   of children and teenagers aged 3 to 18 years. The subjects were
   classified into the following 3 groups: group 1 (3-6 years, 17 eyes),
   group 2 (6-12 years, 126 eyes), and group 3 (12-18 years, 289 eyes). The
   parameters of the study cohort were compared with those of a healthy
   adult cohort. Results: The mean age of the study cohort was 13.5
   (13.2-13.8) years. There were significant differences in the following
   indices among the 3 age groups: anterior chamber (depth and volume),
   curvature (index of height decentration, index of vertical asymmetry,
   and center keratoconus index), elevation (front and back elevations from
   the best fit toric ellipsoid), and pachymetric (minimum and average
   pachymetric progression indices and average Ambrosio relational
   thickness) parameters (Pvalues 0.001, 0.001, 0.002, 0.04, <0.001,
   <0.001, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: There
   were significant differences in the normative values of several Pentacam
   indices between the pediatric and adult cohorts. Based on this finding,
   it is more credible to incorporate separate software cutoff values for
   pediatric patients. However, because there were no clinically
   significant differences in the parameters of the pediatric subgroups,
   there is no need to consider a separate cutoff value for each pediatric
   age range.}},

Abstract = {{Government efforts toward the prevention, detection, and investigation
   of child abuse and neglect are carried out through the United States'
   child welfare system-a complex web of programs that provide family
   assistance and promote child safety. Most funding for these activities
   is split among federal, state, and local governments and comprises
   specific child welfare-related funding (such as Titles IV-E and IV-B of
   the Social Security Act) and non-child welfare funding that is spent on
   programs that support poor and disadvantaged families (Medicaid and
   TANF). I provide an overview of these funding streams that finance the
   child welfare system, review the federal legislation since 1970 that has
   led to the current funding structure, and end with a discussion of how
   the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 has the potential to
   create better outcomes for children and families by promoting prevention
   activities and program support with strong evidence of success.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effect of varying the aspect ratio of a 1:8 scaled Ground
   Transportation System (GTS) was numerically investigated using the
   steady formulation of the RANS k - omega SST model. Cases of different
   aspect ratios (defined as the ratio of the varying width to the baseline
   width (Eq. (1)), with and without a boat-tail, were considered. For the
   GTS without boat-tail, a quasi-linear decline in the drag coefficient
   was found with increasing aspect ratio, resulting from a variation in
   the strength of the side shear layers, and the consequent change in the
   vertical symmetry of the near-wake. The average length of the wake was
   found to increase with increasing aspect ratios, resulting from an
   increase in the size of high Reynolds shear stress regions in the wake.
   For the GTS with boat-tail, variation of aspect ratio was found to have
   no effect on the critical boat-tail angle, albeit the magnitude of
   reduction in the drag coefficient differed between low and high aspect
   ratio configurations. Variation of the ground clearance (G{*}) of the
   GTS (without boat-tail) concluded a G{*} value corresponding to minimum
   drag coefficient (G{*} = 0.083), while retaining of vertical
   quasi-symmetry was observed for G{*} >= 0.29.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a P-I-N thin film Al/NiO/BaTiO3/ZnO/ITO heterojunction
   diode-based UVC detector was fabricated and characterized. The thin film

   technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to assess the
   thin film surface microstructure. The crystal structure of the surface
   layer was investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The P-I-N electrical

   effects of ex situ thermal treatment on the device characteristics were
   evaluated. The untreated diode showed poor rectifying behavior, and the
   optimum characteristics were presented by the device treated at 100
   degrees C. The P-I-N photodetection capability was studied in the dark
   and under different optical power radiation levels ranging from 5.3 to
   5.6 mW. The photodetection response of the devices treated at the
   optimum temperature was investigated. Under 5.57 mW UVC (254 nm)

Title = {{Formulation of pH-Responsive Quatsomes from Quaternary Bicephalic
   Surfactants and Cholesterol for Enhanced Delivery of Vancomycin against
   Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus}},
Journal = {{PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Globally, human beings continue to be at high risk of infectious
   diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA);
   and current treatments are being depleted due to antimicrobial
   resistance. Therefore, the synthesis and formulation of novel materials
   is essential for combating antimicrobial resistance. The study aimed to
   synthesize a quaternary bicephalic surfactant (StBAclm) and thereof to
   formulate pH-responsive vancomycin (VCM)-loaded quatsomes to enhance the
   activity of the antibiotic against MRSA. The surfactant structure was
   confirmed using H-1, C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and high-resolution
   mass spectrometry (HRMS). The quatsomes were prepared using a
   sonication/dispersion method and were characterized using various in
   vitro, in vivo, and in silico techniques. The in vitro cell
   biocompatibility studies of the surfactant and pH-responsive
   vancomycin-loaded quatsomes (VCM-StBAclm-Qt(1)) revealed that they are
   biosafe. The prepared quatsomes had a mean hydrodynamic diameter (MHD),
   polydispersity index (PDI), and drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) of
   122.9 +/- 3.78 nm, 0.169 +/- 0.02 mV, and 52.22 +/- 8.4\%, respectively,
   with surface charge switching from negative to positive at pH 7.4 and pH
   6.0, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HR-TEM) characterization of the quatsomes showed spherical vesicles
   with MHD similar to the one obtained from the zeta-sizer. The in vitro
   drug release of VCM from the quatsomes was faster at pH 6.0 compared to
   pH 7.4. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug loaded
   quatsomes against MRSA was 32-fold and 8-fold lower at pH 6.0 and pH
   7.4, respectively, compared to bare VCM, demonstrating the
   pH-responsiveness of the quatsomes and the enhanced activity of VCM at
   acidic pH. The drug-loaded quatsomes demonstrated higher electrical
   conductivity and a decrease in protein and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
   concentrations as compared to the bare drug. This confirmed greater MRSA
   membrane damage, compared to treatment with bare VCM. The flow cytometry
   study showed that the drug-loaded quatsomes had a similar bactericidal
   killing effect on MRSA despite a lower (8-fold) VCM concentration when
   compared to the bare VCM. Fluorescence microscopy revealed the ability
   of the drug-loaded quatsomes to eradicate MRSA biofilms. The in vivo
   studies in a skin infection mice model showed that groups treated with
   VCM-loaded quatsomes had a 13-fold decrease in MRSA CFUs when compared
   to the bare VCM treated groups. This study confirmed the potential of
   pH-responsive VCM-StBAclm quatsomes as an effective delivery system for
   targeted delivery and for enhancing the activity of antibiotics.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an integral part of the
   outer cell membrane complex of Gram-negative bacteria. It plays an
   important role in the induction and stimulation of the immune system.
   Various LPS purification protocols have been developed. However,
   analysis of their efficacy is limited by contamination during downstream
   applications or the public health hazard of LPS. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate a modified method for extracting LPS as well as assess
   the purity of the extracted LPS by high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Further. we evaluated its
   immunopotentiating function by measuring the relative RNA expression
   levels of splenic immune-related genes such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1
   beta) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), after intramuscular injection of
   increasing concentrations of the extracted LPS in specific pathogen-free
   (SPF) chick.
   Materials and Methods: Isolation, identification, and serotyping of
   Salmonella Typhimurium were performed using chicken flocks. We then
   performed molecular typing of Salmonella isolates using conventional
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A new protocol for purification of LPS
   from Salmonella isolate (S. Typhimurium) was conducted. HPLC analysis of
   the extracted LPS in the current study was compared to existing methods.
   An in vivo study was performed to evaluate the ability of LPS to induce
   an immune response by measuring relative IFN-gamma and IL-1 beta gene
   expression after injecting increasing concentrations of the extracted
   LPS into SPF chicks.
   Results: Isolation and serotyping revealed that Salmonella enterica was
   of the serovar Typhimurium. Confirmation was conducted by molecular
   typing through conventional PCR. Fractionation of the LPS extract by
   HPLC revealed a high degree of purity comparable with standard
   commercial LPS. These results demonstrate the high purity of extracted
   LPS based on our modified method using propanol and sodium hydroxide
   mixture. Intramuscular injection of the extracted LPS in 22 day-old SPF
   chicks. compared to the negative control. revealed significant
   upregulation of IFN-gamma and slight downregulation of IL-1 beta.
   Conclusion: The new modified method can be used for high purity LPS
   extraction and demonstrates effective immunopotentiating activity.}},

Title = {{Growth Stage Classification and Harvest Scheduling of Snap Bean Using
   Hyperspectral Sensing: A Greenhouse Study}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The agricultural industry suffers from a significant amount of food
   waste, some of which originates from an inability to apply site-specific
   management at the farm-level. Snap bean, a broad-acre crop that covers
   hundreds of thousands of acres across the USA, is not exempt from this
   need for informed, within-field, and spatially-explicit management
   approaches. This study aimed to assess the utility of machine learning
   algorithms for growth stage and pod maturity classification of snap bean
   (cv. Huntington), as well as detecting and discriminating spectral and
   biophysical features that lead to accurate classification results. Four
   major growth stages and six main sieve size pod maturity levels were
   evaluated for growth stage and pod maturity classification,
   respectively. A point-based in situ spectroradiometer in the
   visible-near-infrared and shortwave-infrared domains (VNIR-SWIR;
   400-2500 nm) was used and the radiance values were converted to
   reflectance to normalize for any illumination change between samples.
   After preprocessing the raw data, we approached pod maturity assessment
   with multi-class classification and growth stage determination with
   binary and multi-class classification methods. Results from the growth
   stage assessment via the binary method exhibited accuracies ranging from
   90-98\%, with the best mathematical enhancement method being the
   continuum-removal approach. The growth stage multi-class classification
   method used raw reflectance data and identified a pair of wavelengths,
   493 nm and 640 nm, in two basic transforms (ratio and normalized
   difference), yielding high accuracies (similar to 79\%). Pod maturity
   assessment detected narrow-band wavelengths in the VIS and SWIR region,
   separating between not ready-to-harvest and ready-to-harvest scenarios
   with classification measures at the similar to 78\% level by using
   continuum-removed spectra. Our work is a best-case scenario, i.e., we
   consider it a stepping-stone to understanding snap bean harvest maturity
   assessment via hyperspectral sensing at a scalable level (i.e., airborne
   systems). Future work involves transferring the concepts to unmanned
   aerial system (UAS) field experiments and validating whether or not a
   simple multispectral camera, mounted on a UAS, could incorporate < 10
   spectral bands to meet the need of both growth stage and pod maturity
   classification in snap bean production.}},

   greifensteinite, black amorphous vitreous Mn-oxyhydroxide, triplite, and
   quartz. It forms isolated, partly corroded, colorless to snow-white
   crystals up to 0.9 mm long, showing rhombic cross sections. Limousinite
   is transparent with a vitreous luster, non-fluorescent, without cleavage
   planes; its calculated density is 2.58 g/cm(3). Optically, the mineral
   is biaxial negative, alpha = 1.532(2), beta = 1.553(3), gamma = 1.558(2)
   (measured under 589 nm wavelength light), 2V(calc.) = 18 degrees,
   non-dispersive, with Z parallel to the elongation of the prismatic
   crystals. Electron-microprobe analyses indicate an empirical formula of
   (Ba0.91K0.07)(Sigma 0.98)(Ca0.87Na0.05)(Sigma
   0.92){[}(Be3.87Al0.13)(Sigma 4)P4O16]center dot 5.56H(2)O, calculated on
   the basis of 4 P atoms per formula unit, assuming 4 (Be + Al) pfu and a
   water content calculated from refined site-occupancy factors. A
   single-crystal structure refinement was performed to R-1 = 4.90\%, in
   the P2(1)/c space group, with a = 9.4958(4), b = 13.6758(4), c =
   13.4696(4) angstrom, beta = 90.398(3)degrees, V = 1749.15(10)
   angstrom(3), Z = 4. The crystal structure is characterized by a
   beryllophosphate framework similar to that of phillipsite-group
   zeolites, based on corner-sharing BeO4 and PO4 tetrahedra forming
   interconnected four- and eight-membered rings. Large cages within this
   zeolite framework contain Ba, Ca, and water molecules. Limousinite is
   the third known natural zeolite-type beryllophosphate, together with
   pahasapaite and wilancookite; it is also the first phosphate with a
   framework identical to that of a natural zeolite silicate.}},

Title = {{Detection of protons using the rotating ring disk electrode method
   during electrochemical oxidation of battery electrolytes}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of the degradation mechanisms inside lithium-ion batteries
   (LIBs) is critical in designing robust next-generation materials. While
   significant efforts have led to advances in characterization techniques
   and in our general understanding of the numerous decomposition
   reactions, the complex, multicomponent nature of batteries has hindered
   our progress towards developing a complete picture of these processes.
   In this work, we present a method for the detection of protons-one of
   the commonly proposed products of battery electrolyte decomposition at
   high potentials-using the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method.
   Using the H-2 oxidation reaction (HOR) as a model reaction, we first
   determine that protons generated at the disk electrode can be detected
   in organic carbonate-based electrolyte at the ring electrode with a ring
   collection efficiency close to the theoretical value. We then show that
   protons are indeed generated during the electrochemical decomposition of
   the battery electrolyte on Pt(111) at high potentials. Furthermore,
   quantitative detection of protons provided a valuable insight into the
   mechanism of oxidation for the electrolyte used. Overall, our work
   demonstrates the value of RRDE as a complementary method for studying
   potential-dependent electrolyte stability.}},

Title = {{The performance of a new linear light path flow cell is compared with a
   liquid core waveguide and the linear cell is used for spectrophotometric
   determination of nitrite in sea water at nanomolar concentrations}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{219}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of a spectrophotometric assay is enhanced either by
   increasing the concentration of the target molecules within the flow
   cell or by extending the length of the light path of the flow cell.
   Determination of nutrients at nanomolar concentrations in sea water has
   therefore been based either on the preconcentration of the analyte on a
   microcolumn from a large volume of sample followed by its elution into a
   conventional 1-2 cm flow cell, or by the use of Liquid Core Waveguide
   (LCW) with a light path as long as several meters. In order to evaluate
   the relative improvements of these different approaches to increasing
   sensitivity we have developed a preconcentration technique for the
   determination of nitrite in seawater using the Gries reaction and
   compare its sensitivity and precision to that of non preconcentration
   techniques using both LCW and Linear Light Path (LLP) cells of different
   lengths. In this work the performance of the LLP is investigated and
   compared with the performance of the coiled LCW flow cell. Next, the
   determination of nitrite, automated by programmable Flow Injection
   (pFI), was carried out by using LCW and LLP flow cells, as well as by
   using a 10 cm LLP flow cell together with the preconcentration step of
   nitrite on a microcolumn. The assay of nitrite in sub micromolar range
   was most efficiently performed by a combination of pFI with the LLP flow
   cell without the need for a pre concentration step. The determination
   was performed at a rate of 40 samples/hour with a Limit of Detection
   (LOD) = 0.6 nM N using a 50 cm long, and a LOD = 2.5 nM N using a 10 cm
   long, LLP flow cell. Analysis of sea water samples confirmed that
   salinity does not affect the sensitivity of the determination. At a much
   lower cost than LCW, the LLP flow cell can also be easily assembled from
   components usually at hand in a laboratory.}},

Title = {{Sustainable Production of Monoraphidium Microalgae Biomass as a Source
   of Bioenergy}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Microalgae are a renewable source of unconventional biomass with
   potential application in the production of various biofuels. The
   production of carbon-neutral fuels is necessary for protecting the
   environment. This work determined the possibility of producing biomass
   of microalgae belonging to Monoraphidium genus using saline wastewater
   resulting from proecological salmon farming in the recirculating
   aquaculture system. The tests were carried out in tubular
   photobioreactors using LED light. As a part of the analyses, the growth
   and productivity of microalgal biomass, cell density in culture, and
   lipid concentration and ash content in biomass were determined. In
   addition, the concentration of selected phosphorus and nitrogen forms
   present in wastewater corresponding to the degree of their use by
   microalgae as a nutrient substrate was determined. The biomass
   concentration estimated in the tests was 3.79 g center dot L-1, while
   the maximum biomass productivity was 0.46 g center dot L-1 center dot
   d(-1). The cells' optical density in culture measured at 680 nm was
   0.648. The lipid content in biomass was 18.53\% (dry basis), and the ash
   content was 32.34\%. It was found that microalgae of the genus
   Monoraphidium effectively used the nitrogen as well as phosphorus forms
   present in the wastewater for their growth. The total nitrogen content
   in the sewage decreased by 82.62\%, and total phosphorus content by over
   99\%. The analysis of the individual forms of nitrogen showed that N-NO3
   was reduced by 85.37\% and N-NO2 by 78.43\%, while orthophosphate (V)
   dissolved in water was reduced by 99\%. However, the content of N-NH4 in
   wastewater from the beginning till the end of the experiment remained
   <0.05 mg center dot L-1.}},

Abstract = {{Plant phenotyping plays a crucial role in understanding variations in
   the phenotype of individual plants affected by environment, management,
   and genotype. Measurement of seed germination is an important
   phenotyping stage as germination impacts on the whole plant growth
   process. However, germination measurement has been limited to
   germination percentage of a seed population. Understanding of the
   germination time, from sowing to outbreak of the radicle from seed coat,
   at a single seed level is essential. How individual germination time and
   further plant growth are affected by its microenvironment and management
   factors remains elusive. Plant phenotype measurement system was
   developed to assess individual germination time of romaine lettuce
   (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia), using time-series two-dimensional
   camera images, and to analyze how microenvironment (volumetric water
   percent in seed tray, individual seed surface temperature and air
   temperature) and management factors (coated/uncoated seeds) affect the
   germination time for plant cohort research, emphasizing practicality in
   commercial cultivation. Germination experiments were conducted to
   demonstrate the performance of the system and its applicability for a
   whole plant growth process in a plant factory for commercial production
   and/or breeding. The developed phenotyping platform revealed the effects
   of microenvironment and management factors on germination time of

   on considerations of scattered light in optical computed tomography
   measurements}},
Journal = {{RADIATION MEASUREMENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Measurements using three-dimensional (3D) gel dosimeters and optical
   computed tomography (CT) have exhibited tremendous potential for fast
   and accurate 3D dose verifications in radiation therapy. However,
   accurate measurements may not be possible owing to cupping artifacts. It
   has been reported that the Fricke and the polymer gel dosimeters induce
   considerable and extensive cupping artifact effects, whereas the
   micellar gel dosimeter exhibits a smaller effect. In this study, we
   estimated that the effect of cupping artifacts in the micellar dye gel
   dosimeter can be predicted by considering the absorption in the dye and
   the scattering induced by the gelling agent. Solutions with various
   absorbances were prepared and measured by optical CT. In parallel,
   changes in absorbance owing to the gelling agent were investigated using
   cells with different optical path lengths. Spectroscopic analyses
   demonstrated that the Lambert Beer law holds for the light attenuation
   induced by the dyes and the gelling agent when measured with optical CT.
   We conclude that the generation of the cupping artifacts was attributed
   to the fact that the detection limit of the detector was exceeded owing
   to excessive light attenuation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the
   effectiveness of optical CT measurements based on the conversion of the
   measured value of the optical CT to absorbance and the prediction of the
   presence of cupping artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{A pebble distribution places a nonnegative number of pebbles on the
   vertices of a graph G. In graph rubbling, the pebbles can be
   redistributed using pebbling and rubbling moves, typically with the goal
   of reaching some target pebble distribution. In graph pebbling, only the
   pebbling move is allowed. The cover pebbling number is the smallest k
   such that from any initial distribution of k pebbles, it is possible
   that after a series of pebbling moves there is at least one pebble on
   every vertex of G. The Cover Pebbling Theorem asserts that to determine
   the cover pebbling number of a graph, it is sufficient to consider the
   pebbling distributions that initially place all pebbles on a single
   vertex. In this paper, we prove a rubbling analogue of the Cover
   Pebbling Theorem, providing an answer to an open question of Belford and
   Sieben (2009). In addition, we prove a stronger version of the Cover
   Rubbling Theorem for trees. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research on program termination has a long tradition. However, most of
   the existing techniques target a single program only. We propose in this
   paper an incremental termination analysis approach by reusing certified

   procedure is further developed to increase the reusability of certified
   modules. The proposed approach has wide applicability, applicable to
   various program changes. The proposed technique, to the best of our
   knowledge, represents a novel attempt to the termination analysis of
   evolving programs. We implemented the approach on top of ULTIMATE
   AUTOMIZER. Experimental results show dramatic improvement of our
   approach over the state-of-the-art tool.}},

Title = {{DSN/TdT recycling digestion based cyclic amplification strategy for
   microRNA assay}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{219}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Sensitive and specific detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) is of great
   significance for early cancer diagnosis. Here we report a simple and
   sensitive fluorescence signal amplification strategy that based on
   DSN/TdT recycling digestion for miRNA detection. DSN initiates DNA
   digestion on 3'-phosphate-primer/miRNA heteroduplex which causes miRNA
   recycle. The digested DNA strands with 3'-OH ends enable TdT to
   synthesize a polydeoxyguanylic tails on the 3'-end. The DNAs with
   polydeoxyguanylic tails are converted to double-stranded-DNA prior to
   initiation of DSN/TdT recycling digestion. With the cooperation of TdT
   and DSN, a new round of digestion and extension is triggered, leading to
   massive fluorophores separating and signal amplification. The
   amplification strategy produces large amounts of 3'-OH probes that can
   be used directly for dsDNA enrichment and DSN digestion. Moreover, both
   DSN digestion and TdT extension are sequence-independent reaction
   without the need of complex sequences design. In addition, this strategy
   is utilized to analyze miRNA samples from MCF-7 cell lysates and Cu (II)
   ion samples, indicating its potential application in actual sample
   analysis. The method shows a promising analytical platform for DNA
   nicking-related studies and tumor biomarkers measuring in clinical
   diagnostics.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To treat impairments in hard tissues or overcome pathological
   calcification in soft tissues, a detailed understanding of
   mineralization pathways of calcium phosphate materials is needed. Here,
   we report a detailed mechanistic study of hydroxyapatite (HA)
   mineralization pathways in an artificial saliva solution via in situ
   liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that the
   mineralization of HA starts by forming ion-rich and ion-poor solutions
   in the saliva solution, followed by coexistence of the classical and
   nonclassical nucleation processes. For the nonclassical path, amorphous
   calcium phosphate (ACP) functions as the substrate for HA nucleation on
   the ACP surface, while the classical path features direct HA nucleation
   from the solution. The growth of HA crystals on the surface of ACP is
   accompanied by the ACP dissolution process. The discoveries reported in
   this work are important to understand the physiological and pathological
   formation of HA minerals, as well as to engineer the biomineralization
   process for bone healing and hard tissue repairs.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{960}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We propose a symmetry of T (T) over bar deformed 2D CFT, which preserves
   the trace relation. The deformed conformal killing equation is obtained.
   Once we consider the background metric runs with the deformation
   parameter mu, the deformation contributes an additional term in
   conformal killing equation, which plays the role of renormalization
   group flow of metric. The conformal symmetry coincides with the fixed
   point. On the gravity side, this deformed conformal killing equation can
   be described by a new boundary condition of AdS(3). In addition, based
   on the deformed conformal killing equation, we derive that the stress
   tensor of the deformed CFT equals to Brown-York's quasilocal stress
   tensor on a finite boundary with a counterterm. For a specific example,
   BTZ black hole, we get T (T) over bar deformed conformal killing vectors
   and the associated conserved charges are also studied. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {{Bidens pilosa is an invasive weed that threatens the growth of crops and
   biodiversity in China. In 2017, suspected bacterial wilt of B. pilosa
   was discovered in Qinzhou and Beihai, Guangxi, China. A variety of weeds
   are considered as reservoirs harboring bacterial wilt pathogens, but
   most do not show obvious symptoms in the field. Identifying the
   classification status of the B. pilosa bacterial wilt pathogen and
   exploring its geographical origin might be helpful for clarifying the
   role of weeds in the circulation of the disease. Phylotyping, sequevar
   analysis, and cross inoculation of pathogens isolated from B. pilosa and
   nearby peanut (Arachis hypogaea), balsam gourd (Momordica charantia),
   and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus robusta) plants were carried out. Three
   isolates of B. pilosa (Bp01, Bp02, and Bp03) were identified as
   Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum, race 1, biovar 3, and phylotype I, and
   belonged to sequevars 17 and 44, and an unknown sequevar. The sequevars
   isolated from B. pilosa were not completely consistent with those of the
   nearby hosts, and the virulence of these isolates differed when cross
   inoculated. The Bp03 sequevar was different from peanut isolate
   sequevars in the same field and was not identical to any previously
   designated sequevars. The isolates from B. pilosa and other nearby hosts
   displayed low or no virulence toward their cross hosts (with wilt
   incidences less than 33.33\%). An exception to this was the isolates
   from B. pilosa, which displayed high virulence toward eucalyptus (with a
   wilt incidence of 70.00 to 100.00\%). This is the first report of
   different sequevars of R. pseudosolanacearum causing typical bacterial
   wilt symptoms in B. pilosa in the field.}},

Title = {{Heavy ion and proton induced single event upsets in 3D SRAM}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) memory has considerable application prospects to
   improve the memory storages to satisfy the highly integrated circuits,
   while the radiation effects for the 3D memory are complicated due to its
   multiple sensitive layers. In this paper, heavy ions and protons are
   used to investigate the radiation sensitivity of an advanced 3D Static
   Random Access Memory (SRAM). The single-event upsets (SEU) on different
   layers are distinguished and discussed. The track profile of heavy ions
   and its impacts on diverse layers are calculated and verified by the
   Monte Carlo simulation. Direct ionization induced SEU merely exists in
   the irradiation of protons with high Linear Energy Transfer (LET), which
   is about 2-3 magnitude order larger than that caused by nuclear

   sections than the ions with medium energy and barely enough range.
   Moreover, the ultrahigh-energy heavy ions are suitable to be used to
   evaluate the radiation sensitivity of 3D SRAM with intact packages, if

Journal = {{ALGORITHMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A large amount of time series data is being generated every day in a
   wide range of sensor application domains. The symbolic aggregate
   approximation (SAX) is a well-known time series representation method,
   which has a lower bound to Euclidean distance and may discretize
   continuous time series. SAX has been widely used for applications in
   various domains, such as mobile data management, financial investment,
   and shape discovery. However, the SAX representation has a limitation:
   Symbols are mapped from the average values of segments, but SAX does not
   consider the boundary distance in the segments. Different segments with
   similar average values may be mapped to the same symbols, and the SAX
   distance between them is 0. In this paper, we propose a novel
   representation named SAX-BD (boundary distance) by integrating the SAX
   distance with a weighted boundary distance. The experimental results
   show that SAX-BD significantly outperforms the SAX representation, ESAX
   representation, and SAX-TD representation.}},

   learning representations}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{312-323}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many tasks involve learning representations from matrices, and
   Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been widely used due to its
   excellent interpretability. Through factorization, sample vectors are
   reconstructed as additive combinations of latent factors, which are
   represented as non-negative distributions over the raw input features.
   NMF models are significantly affected by latent factors' distribution
   characteristics and the correlations among them. And NMF models are
   faced with the challenge of learning robust latent factor. To this end,
   we propose to learn representations with an awareness of the semantic
   quality evaluated from the aspects of intra- and inter-factors. On the
   one hand, a Maximum Entropy-based function is devised for the
   intra-factor semantic quality. On the other hand, the semantic
   uniqueness is evaluated via inter-factor correlation, which reinforces
   the aim of semantic compactness. Moreover, we present a novel non-linear
   NMF framework. The learning algorithm is presented and the convergence
   is theoretically analyzed and proved. Extensive experimental results on
   multiple datasets demonstrate that our method can be successfully
   applied to representative NMF models and boost performances over
   state-of-the-art models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at analyzing the effects of liposomal
   nanoparticle-based miR-27b on PPAR gamma and osteogenic differentiation
   of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells under microgravity. The rat bone
   marrow mesenchymal stem cells were set as the research object, and the
   gyroscope was employed for simulation of microgravity. The cells were
   randomized into four groups, including the experimental group A
   (simulated microgravity + liposomal nanoparticle-mediated miR-27b
   transfection group), as well as the control groups: group B (simulated
   microgravity + negative control group), group C (simulated microgravity
   + transfection reagent group) and group D (normal gravity + liposomal
   nanoparticle-mediatedmiR-27b transfection group). After a two-week
   osteogenic induction in vitro, staining was performed to assess the
   lipogenesis rate of the samples. In addition, ALP activity and PPAR
   gamma mRNA level was detected. The number of alizarin staining-positive
   osteogenic nodules and ALP activity (0.21 +/- 0.44 King unit) in group A
   was significantly diminished compared to those in group B, C, and D.
   Moreover, its lipogenesis rate (9.31 +/- 1.02\%) and PPAR gamma mRNA
   level (1.86 +/- 0.39) were significantly higher than those in group B,
   C, and D (P<0.05). The number of alizarin staining-positive osteogenic
   nodules and ALP activity (0.96 +/- 0.18 King unit) in group D were
   significantly reduced in comparison with those in groups B and C, while
   the lipogenesis rate (4.86 +/- 0.77\%) and PPAR gamma mRNA level (0.93
   +/- 0.34) were significantly higher than those in group B and C (P<0.05)
   without difference between group B and group C (P>0.05). Under a

   impede the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts via regulating PPAR

Abstract = {{On a commercial broiler farm with substantial health problems, shown by
   a reported loss rate of approx. 10\% and regular antibiotic use, samples
   were taken at different locations in 2 barns, with the aim of analyzing
   possible entry routes and persistence of pathogens and
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as revealing weak points in
   sanitation. Therefore, swab samples for biofilm and water samples from
   animal drinking water lines and the spray cooling system were taken
   twice immediately before restocking. In addition, swab samples from
   drain holes and air samples were collected. At restocking, hatchlings
   that died during transportation and chick paper were sampled. All
   samples were analyzed for the occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   total coliform count, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, namely,
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli,
   Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter
   baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). No
   MRSA or VRE were detectable. In all samples from drinking water and
   sprinkler system pipes, P. aeruginosa was detectable; in most cases,
   antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa was also detected, with varying
   resistance profiles. Samples from the hatchlings and chick paper were
   contaminated with antibiotic-resistant Enterobacter spp., with
   resistance to piperacillin, fosfomycin, and the third-generation
   cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Therefore, the initial entry
   of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae likely occurred via exposure
   at the hatchery, resulting in colonization of the chicks. Animals on the
   fattening farm were treated with colistin, amoxicillin, and lincomycin
   in the 3 production cycles before sampling. Owing to the frequent
   administration of several antibiotic classes during the fattening period
   via piped water in both barns, resistance of isolates from water pipes
   accumulated, showing additional resistance to chloramphenicol and
   frequently to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. To prevent the development
   of secondary diseases caused by the facultative pathogen P. aeruginosa
   in chicks with a weak immune status, the hygiene management for drinking
   water lines and the spray cooling system was changed. These changes
   resulted in an improvement in water line sanitation, shown by the
   absence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and rare detection of P.
   aeruginosa.}},

Title = {{Statewide Prevalence of Smoke-Free and Vape-Free Homes, by Tobacco
   Product Use, Minnesota, 2018}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Securing clean indoor air laws is a major tobacco control accomplishment
   of the past 15 years. The public quickly adopted and supported such
   policies both in public and private spaces. Clean indoor air is now
   threatened by the emergence of e-cigarettes. E-cigarette aerosol
   contains nicotine, heavy metals, and carcinogens, and the long-term
   effect of secondhand exposure is unknown. Surveillance is necessary to
   track voluntary rules on smoking and vaping in the home.
   Methods
   The Minnesota Adult Tobacco Survey (MATS) is a series of
   cross-sectional, random-digit-dial telephone surveys on smoking, vaping,
   and other tobacco-related behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs among
   Minnesota adults. MATS measured voluntary smoke-free rules in the home
   in 2014 (N = 9,304) and measured both smoke-free and vape-free home
   rules in 2018 (N = 6,055).
   Results
   The prevalence of smoke-free home rules among Minnesota adults in 2018
   was 91.5\% (95\% CI, 90.5\%-92.5\%), up slightly from 89.3\% (95\% CI,
   88.4\%-90.2\%) in 2014. In comparison, 84.0\% (95\% CI, 82.7\%-85.3\%)
   reported vape-free home rules. Although 70.0\% (95\% CI, 66.0\%-73.0\%)
   of smokers in 2018 reported smoke-free home rules, only 23.3\% (95\% CI,
   15.0\%-31.6\%) of e-cigarette users reported vape-free home rules.
   Living with children younger than 18 years significantly increased the
   odds of having smoke-free and vape-free home rules.
   Conclusion
   Although widespread adoption of voluntary smoke-free and vape-free home
   rules demonstrates a positive change in social norms, most e-cigarette
   users allow vaping in their homes, including those who live with
   children younger than 18. Tracking voluntary smoke-free and vape-free
   home rules and efforts to encourage them are important to improve the
   public's health.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess performance of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) composite
   indices and evaluate guselkumab's effect on achieving low disease
   activity or remission.
   Methods In this phase II trial, patients with active PsA (>= 3 tender
   and >= 3 swollen joints, C-reactive protein level >= 0.3 mg/dl, >= 3\%
   body surface-area with psoriasis involvement) were randomized 2:1 to
   subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg (n = 100) or placebo (n = 49) at week 0,
   week 4, and every 8 weeks through week 44. At week 16, patients with
   <5\% improvement in swollen and tender joints could early escape to
   open-label ustekinumab. Patients continuing placebo crossed over to
   receive guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 24, 28, 36, and 44 (placebo to
   guselkumab). PsA composite indices (Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity
   Score {[}PASDAS], Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and
   Psoriatic Arthritis composite score {[}GRACE], modified Composite
   Psoriatic Disease Activity Index {[}mCPDAI], and Disease Activity in
   Psoriatic Arthritis {[}DAPSA]) were analyzed as secondary outcomes (last
   observation carried forward for missing/post-early escape data through
   week 24; observed data post-week 24). Instrument performance was
   assessed.
   Results Baseline PASDAS, GRACE, mCPDAI, and DAPSA scores indicated
   moderate-to-high disease activity. At week 24, mean changes in each of
   these composite indices showed significant improvement with guselkumab
   (-2.50, -2.73, -3.8, and -23.08, respectively) versus placebo (-0.49,
   0.35, -0.8, and -4.98, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). Significantly
   more guselkumab-treated patients achieved low/very low/remitted disease
   activity states according to PASDAS (very low + low 35\% versus 4\%; P <
   0.001), GRACE (30\% versus 2\%; P < 0.001), mCPDAI (46\% versus 10\%; P
   < 0.001), and DAPSA (remission + low 40\% versus 12\%; P < 0.001). A
   total of 12\% of guselkumab-treated versus no placebo-treated patients
   achieved DAPSA remission (P < 0.01). The PASDAS and GRACE instruments
   were more sensitive than the mCPDAI and DAPSA tools in detecting
   treatment effect. Residual skin disease and enthesitis were marginally
   more prominent in patients achieving DAPSA low disease activity versus
   other indices.
   Conclusion Guselkumab demonstrated efficacy in achieving low disease
   activity/remission based on all PsA composite indices assessed.
   Composite index use in PsA trials and the clinic requires careful
   consideration to optimize feasibility and instrument performance.}},

Abstract = {{Jeff Bub has developed an information-theoretic interpretation of
   quantum mechanics on the basis of the programme to reaxiomatise the
   theory in terms of information-theoretic principles. According to the
   most recent version of the interpretation, reaxiomatisation can dissolve
   some of the demands for explanation traditionally associated with the
   task of providing an interpretation for the theory. The key idea is that
   the real lesson we should take away from quantum mechanics is that the
   `structure of information' is not what we thought it was. In particular
   a feature of the new structure is intrinsic randomness of measurement,
   which allegedly dissolves a significant part of the measurement problem.
   I argue that it is difficult to find an appropriate argument to support
   the claim that measurement is intrinsically random in the relevant
   sense. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The optimal surgical indications for humeral shaft fractures
   in the working population remain uncertain. This study investigates the
   impact of surgical fixation on return to duty, union, and complications
   in workers' compensation patients with humeral shaft fractures.
   Methods: All workers' compensation patients with humeral shaft fractures
   managed at a single institution between 2007 and 2017 were identified.
   Manual chart and radiographic review was performed to identify etiology
   of injury, type of work, time until return to duty, length of physical
   therapy, complications, and time to fracture union.
   Results: There were 39 humeral shaft fractures in workers' compensation
   patients managed at our institution (25 surgical; 64.1\%). There was no
   difference in the return to light (106.1 versus 60.4 days; P=0.20) or
   full (140.1 vs. 139.9 days; P=0.99) duty for surgical versus nonsurgical
   treatment, respectively. There was no difference in the length of
   physical therapy (132.6 versus 106.3 days; P=0.15) or time to maximum
   medical improvement (174.3 vs. 198.8 days; P=0.25) for surgical versus
   nonsurgical treatment, respectively. Three patients returned to the
   operating room in the surgical group. Nonunion was observed in two
   surgical cases (8.0\%) and one case (7.1\%) of nonsurgical management.
   Conclusion: This study did not identify an advantage for faster return
   to work after surgical management of humeral shaft fractures in workers'
   compensation patients. Though one of the perceived advantages of
   surgical fixation is a quicker return to physical activity, there may be
   other variables in this patient population that influence the timing of
   return to work.}},

   Bacillus thuringiensis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To adapt to changing and potentially hostile environments, bacteria can
   activate the transcription of genes under the control of alternative
   sigma factors, such as SigB, a master regulator of the general stress
   response in several Gram-positive species. Bacillus thuringiensis is a
   Gram-positive spore-forming invertebrate pathogen whose life cycle
   includes a variety of environments, including plants and the insect
   hemocoel or gut. Here, we assessed the role of SigB during the
   infectious cycle of B. thuringiensis in a Galleria mellonella insect
   model. We used a fluorescent reporter coupled to flow cytometry and
   showed that SigB was activated in vivo. We also showed that the
   pathogenicity of the Delta sigB mutant was severely affected when
   inoculated via the oral route, suggesting that SigB is critical for B.
   thuringiensis adaptation to the gut environment of the insect. We could
   not detect an effect of the sigB deletion on the survival of the
   bacteria or on their sporulation efficiency in the cadavers. However,
   the gene encoding the pleiotropic regulator Spo0A was upregulated in the
   Delta sigB mutant cells during the infectious process.
   IMPORTANCE Pathogenic bacteria often need to transition between
   different ecosystems, and their ability to cope with such variations is
   critical for their survival. Several Gram-positive species have
   developed an adaptive response mediated by the general stress response
   alternative sigma factor SigB. In order to understand the
   ecophysiological role of this regulator in Bacillus thuringiensis, an
   entomopathogenic bacterium widely used as a biopesticide, we sought to
   examine the fate of a Delta sigB mutant during its life cycle in the
   natural setting of an insect larva. This allowed us, in particular, to
   show that SigB was activated during infection and that it was required
   for the pathogenicity of B. thuringiensis via the oral route of
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   The present study aimed to determine benefits and risks of a dietary
   supplementation combining hydroxytyrosol and n3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFA) on developmental patterns and metabolic traits of offspring
   in swine, a model of intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) pregnancies.
   There were no deleterious effects on the reproductive traits of the sows
   and the postnatal features of the piglets. Piglets from the supplemented
   sows, in spite of a lower mean weight and corpulence at birth, showed
   higher average daily weight gain and fractional growth rate afterwards.
   Consequently, they reached higher weight and corpulence with increased
   muscle development and better lipidemic and fatty acids profiles than
   control offspring at juvenile stages.
   Maternal supplementation with antioxidants and n3 PUFAs may be a
   promising strategy to reduce the risk of intrauterine growth restriction
   and preterm delivery, which may diminish the appearance of
   low-birth-weight neonates. The present study aimed to determine benefits
   and risks of a dietary supplementation combining hydroxytyrosol, a
   polyphenol from olive leaves and fruits, and n3 PUFAs, from linseed oil,
   on developmental patterns and metabolic traits of offspring in swine, a
   model of IUGR pregnancies. The results obtained indicate that maternal
   supplementation with hydroxytyrosol and n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy
   has no deleterious effects on the reproductive traits of the sows
   (prolificacy, homogeneity of the litter, and percentage of stillborns
   and low-birth-weight, LBW, piglets) and the postnatal features of the
   piglets (growth patterns, adiposity, and metabolic traits). Conversely,
   in spite of a lower mean weight and corpulence at birth, piglets from
   the supplemented sows showed higher average daily weight gain and
   fractional growth rate. Thus, at juvenile stages afterwards, the
   offspring from the treated group reached higher weight and corpulence,
   with increased muscle development and better lipidemic and fatty acid
   profiles, in spite of similar adiposity, than offspring in the control
   group. However, much caution and more research are still needed before
   practical recommendation and use in human pregnancies.}},

Abstract = {{Among Maimonides's many statements about extrascriptural laws in
   rabbinic literature, none has attracted as much attention as principle 2
   in his Book of the Commandments. Modern scholars have largely understood
   this text to claim that very few of the laws found in rabbinic
   literature are Sinaitic in origin and of biblical status. Yet, until the
   twentieth century, principle 2 was primarily read as distinguishing
   between revealed laws that constitute enumerated commandments and
   revealed laws that do not. In fact, neither reading is consistent with
   other Maimonidean statements. By contextualizing principle 2 within the
   Book of the Commandments, this essay reconsiders Maimonides's
   enumeration of the commandments and argues that many of the problems
   that principle 2 was designed to address, and that it also generated,
   resulted from the incongruity of his project of enumerating precisely
   613 commandments alongside his understanding of revelation as a corpus
   that included not only the Written Torah but innumerable extrascriptural
   traditions as well. An appendix evaluates pertinent aspects of the most
   recent monograph dedicated to Maimonides's scriptural hermeneutics.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Biopsies of brainstem lesions are performed to establish a
   diagnosis in the setting of an atypical clinical or radiological
   presentation, or to facilitate molecular studies. A better understanding
   of the safety and diagnostic yield of brainstem biopsies would help
   guide appropriate patient selection.
   METHODS All patients who underwent biopsy of a brainstem lesion during
   the period from January 2011 to June 2019 were reviewed. Demographic,
   radiological, surgical, and outcome data were collected.
   RESULTS A total of 58 patients underwent 65 brainstem biopsies during
   the study period. Overall, the median age was 7.6 years (IQR 3.9-14.2
   years). Twenty-two of the 65 biopsies (34\%) were open, 42 (65\%) were
   stereotactic, and 1 was endoscopic. In 3 cases (5\%), a
   ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed, and in 9 cases (14\%), a
   posterior fossa decompression was performed during the same operative
   session as the biopsy. An intraoperative MRI (iMRI) was performed in 28
   cases (43\%). In 3 of these cases (11\%), the biopsy was off target and
   additional samples were obtained during the same procedure. New
   neurological deficits were noted in 5 cases (8\%), including sensory
   deficits, ophthalmoparesis/ nystagmus, facial weakness, and hearing
   loss; these deficits persisted in 2 cases and were transient in 3 cases.
   A pseudomeningocele occurred in 1 patient; no patients developed a CSF
   leak or infection. In 8 cases (13\%) an additional procedure was needed
   to obtain a diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS Brainstem biopsies are safe and effective. Target selection
   and approach should be a collaborative effort. iMRI can be used to
   assess biopsy accuracy in real time, thereby allowing any adjustment if
   necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Limited knowledge exists on the preferences of people with Type 2
   diabetes towards diabetes care. Consequently, these care preferences
   cannot yet be considered in the development of tailored diabetes care
   approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to assess care preferences and
   their determinants in people with Type 2 diabetes. Methods A discrete
   choice experiment was conducted to elicit people's preferences. People
   with Type 2 diabetes, treated in 30 Dutch primary care practices, were
   asked to choose repeatedly between two hypothetical diabetes care
   packages, which differed in six attributes: role division in daily
   diabetes care planning, lifestyle education method, type of medication
   management support, consultation frequency, emotional support and time
   spend on self-management. A mixed-logit model was used to estimate the
   relative importance of the included attributes. Preference heterogeneity
   among people with different person- and disease-related characteristics
   was investigated. Results In total, 288 participants completed the
   experiment. They preferred to plan their daily diabetes care together
   with a healthcare provider, to receive individual lifestyle education,
   medication and emotional support from a healthcare provider, one
   consultation visit every 3 months and to spend less time on
   self-management. Participants did not prefer to receive emotional
   support from a psychologist. Heterogeneity in preferences could partly
   be explained by differences in sex, education level and glucose-lowering
   drug use. Conclusion People with Type 2 diabetes show a preference for
   traditional care models. Emotional support was identified by
   participants as the most important attribute. It is therefore important
   to adequately guide them when changes in diabetes care organization are
   implemented.}},

Title = {{Technique for simple apatite coating on a dental resin composite with
   light-curing through a micro-rough apatite layer}},

Abstract = {{Tooth root surfaces restored with dental resin composites exhibit
   inferior biocompatibility. The objective of this study was to develop a
   simple technique for coating apatite onto a resin composite to improve
   its surface biocompatibility. First, we fabricated a polymer film coated
   with a micro-rough apatite layer and pressed it (coating-side down) onto
   a viscous resin composite precursor. As a result of light-induced curing
   of the precursor through the overlaid film, the micro-rough apatite
   layer was integrated with the resin composite and, thus, transferred
   from the polymer film surface to the cured resin composite surface as a
   result of the difference in interfacial adhesion strength. The
   transferred apatite layer attached directly to the cured resin composite
   without any gaps at the microscopic level. The adhesion between the
   apatite layer and the cured resin composite was so strong that the layer
   was not peeled off even by a tape-detaching test. The flexural strength
   of the resulting apatite-coated resin composite was comparable to that
   of the clinically used resin composite while satisfying the ISO
   requirement for dental polymer-based restorative materials. Furthermore,
   the apatite-coated resin composite showed better cell compatibility than
   the uncoated resin composite. The present apatite coating technique is
   well suited for dental treatment because the coating is applied during a
   conventional light curing procedure through simple utilization of the
   apatite-coated polymer film in place of an uncoated film. The proposed
   technique represents a practical evolution in dental treatment using
   light-curing resin composites, although further in vitro and in vivo
   studies are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The Na+-coupled citrate transporter (NaCT/SLC13A5/mINDY) in the liver
   delivers citrate from the blood into hepatocytes. As citrate is a key
   metabolite and regulator of multiple biochemical pathways, deletion of
   Slc13a5 in mice protects against diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and
   metabolic syndrome. Silencing the transporter suppresses hepatocellular
   carcinoma. Therefore, selective blockers of NaCT hold the potential to
   treat various diseases. Here we report on the characteristics of one
   such inhibitor, BI01383298. It is known that BI01383298 is a
   high-affinity inhibitor selective for human NaCT with no effect on mouse
   NaCT. Here we show that this compound is an irreversible and
   noncompetitive inhibitor of human NaCT, thus describing the first
   irreversible inhibitor for this transporter. The mouse NaCT is not
   affected by this compound. The inhibition of human NaCT by BI01383298 is
   evident for the constitutively expressed transporter in HepG2 cells and
   for the ectopically expressed human NaCT in HEK293 cells. The IC50 is
   similar to 100 nM, representing the highest potency among the NaCT
   inhibitors known to date. Exposure of HepG2 cells to this inhibitor
   results in decreased cell proliferation. We performed molecular modeling
   of the 3D-structures of human and mouse NaCTs using the crystal
   structure of a humanized variant of VcINDY as the template, and docking
   studies to identify the amino acid residues involved in the binding of
   citrate and BI01383298. These studies provide insight into the probable
   bases for the differential effects of the inhibitor on human NaCT versus
   mouse NaCT as well as for the marked species-specific difference in
   citrate affinity.}},

Abstract = {{Use of photosynthetic organisms is one of the sustainable ways to
   produce high-value products. Marine purple photosynthetic bacteria are
   one of the research focuses as microbial production hosts. Genetic
   transformation is indispensable as a biotechnology technique. However,
   only conjugation has been determined to be an applicable method for the
   transformation of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria so far. In this
   study, for the first time, a dual peptide-based transformation method
   combining cell penetrating peptide (CPP), cationic peptide and
   Tat-derived peptide (dTat-Sar-EED) (containing D-amino acids of Tat and
   endosomal escape domain (EED) connected by sarcosine linkers)
   successfully delivered plasmid DNA into Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, a
   marine purple photosynthetic bacterium. The plasmid delivery efficiency
   was greatly improved by dTat-Sar-EED. The concentrations of
   dTat-Sar-EED, cell growth stage and recovery duration affected the
   efficiency of plasmid DNA delivery. The delivery was inhibited at 4
   degrees C and by A22, which is an inhibitor of the actin homolog MreB.
   This suggests that the plasmid DNA delivery occurred via MreB-mediated
   energy dependent process. Additionally, this peptide-mediated delivery
   method was also applicable for E. coli cells. Thus, a wide range of
   bacteria could be genetically transformed by using this novel
   peptide-based transformation method.}},

   non-linear, the ANN needs a relatively large training dataset (hundreds
   of data points) to capture these relations adequately. This paper
   introduces a novel assisted-ANN modeling approach that enables the
   development of ANNs using small datasets, while maintaining high
   prediction accuracy. This approach uses parameters that are obtained
   using the known input/output relations (partial or full relations).
   These so called assistance parameters are included as ANN inputs in
   addition to the traditional direct independent inputs. The proposed
   assisted approach is applied for predicting the residual strength of
   panels with multiple site damage (MSD) cracks. Different assistance
   levels (four levels) and different training dataset sizes (from 75 down
   to 22 data points) are investigated, and the results are compared to the
   traditional approach. The results show that the assisted approach helps
   in achieving high predictions' accuracy (<3\% average error). The
   relative accuracy improvement is higher (up to 46\%) for ANN learning
   algorithms that give lower prediction accuracy. Also, the relative
   accuracy improvement becomes more significant (up to 38\%) for smaller
   dataset sizes.}},

Title = {{Influence of phosphate chelators on white efflorescence formation in dry
   fermented sausages with co-extruded alginate casings}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different
   condensed phosphates on the white efflorescence formation on dry
   fermented sausages with calcium alginate casings. The efflorescence
   formation is induced by the complexation of the divalent cations
   magnesium and calcium with lactate on the surface of the product.
   Phosphates are known to complex divalent cations like magnesium and
   calcium, which are responsible for the efflorescence formation with
   lactate. To treat the surface of the raw fermented sausages a mixture of
   di- and polyphosphates and a polyphosphate were used. The sausages were
   dipped in 5\% solutions of the phosphates. The mixture of di- and
   polyphosphate showed the best results in reducing the white
   efflorescence formation, the amount of efflorescences on the surface was
   18.12\% after 8 weeks of storage. The diffusion of magnesium was
   significantly reduced by similar to 40\% after 8 weeks of storage
   compared to the control for both phosphates. However, the crystals
   formed during storage had a different structure and size compared to the
   control. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that the
   divalent calcium ions and the polyphosphates from aggregates caused the
   crystal formation on the surface, whereas this effect was not seen in
   combination with magnesium. The surface treatment with the phosphates
   did not inhibit the white efflorescence formation. However, the extent
   was reduced but different kind of crystals were formed on the surface
   during the storage.}},
