Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the association between the presence of Kaposi's
   sarcoma (KS) as an AIDS-defining illness and HIV transmission categories
   among European women with AIDS.
   Design: Comparison of the prevalence of KS as an AIDS-defining illness
   in different HIV transmission categories.
   Methods: Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for KS were
   computed by means of unconditional multiple logistic regression
   equations.
   Results: KS was reported in 344 (2.2\%) out of 15 809 women diagnosed
   with AIDS. Women who reported HIV infection via heterosexual intercourse
   had a >twofold increase of KS risk than intravenous drug users (OR, 2.4;
   95\% CI, 1.9-3.0). Particularly elevated OR were observed among women
   originating from African or Caribbean countries (OR, 4.9; 95\% CI,
   3.7-6.5), and in partners of bisexual men (OR, 4.8; 95\% CI, 2.8-8.2).
   Such risk patterns for KS were consistent in different countries, age
   groups and year of AIDS diagnosis.
   Conclusions: These results are in agreement with similar analyses from
   the United States, and support the existence of some putative KS
   agent(s) which can be acquired via sexual intercourse with bisexual men,
   or earlier in life in countries where non-AIDS-associated KS is
   frequent.}},

Abstract = {{CdTe was directionally solidified by the vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger
   technique. Quartz ampoules were used uncoated, coated with carbon, or
   with a transparent film of boron nitride. Wetting by molten CdTe on
   these surfaces was determined by contact angle measurements. Wetting
   increased in the following order: BN-coated quartz, carbon-coated
   quartz, uncoated quartz. Ingots solidified in uncoated ampoules adhered
   to the ampoule after growth. These ingots exhibited nucleation of new
   grains throughout the growth. Ingots solidified in carbon-coated or
   BN-coated ampoules did not adhere to the ampoules. Ingots solidified in
   BN-coated ampoules had many small elongated indentations along their
   surface, presumably due to bubbles on the ampoule surface during
   solidification. These indentations did not affect the grain structure.
   The dislocation densities measured on the (111)Cd surface using the
   Nakagawa etchant increased in the following order: BN-coated quartz,
   carbon-coated quartz, uncoated quartz. A cellular arrangement of
   dislocations was observed for both uncoated and carbon-coated quartz. No
   cellular structure was found with BN-coated quartz. A correspondence was
   seen between the mean etch pit density and the wetting property of the

   involved by B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) in nine patients with
   different histological subtypes and clinical stages. 40 TCC (55\%)
   expressed the CD25 Ag and were also able to proliferate in the presence
   of irradiated autologous B-NHL cells. Among them, 23 autotumour (AuTu)
   proliferative TCC were found not to proliferate to autologous
   EBV-transformed B-cell lines, indicating that the proliferative
   reactivity of these TCC was preferentially directed at autologous B-NHL
   cells, Tested against autologous B-NHL cells, only three AuTu
   proliferative TCC (CD8(+)) showed a significant level of cytotoxicity
   (specific lysis > 15\%), In blocking experiments, the AuTu proliferative
   reactivity of three TCC from one patient was strongly inhibited by
   anti-DR and anti-DQ mAbs, whereas that of three TCC from another patient
   was not affected by either anti-MHC class I or class II (DR, DP, DQ)

Abstract = {{Hypoxia is a critical and sometimes fatal complication of anesthesia.
   Since there is little information on the cardiovascular response to
   hypoxia during epidural anesthesia, we assessed the affects of epidural
   anesthesia on the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and on survival in
   dogs.
   We randomly assigned 36 mongrel dogs to one of three groups according to
   the anesthetic technique used: the thoracic group (n=12) received
   thoracic epidural anesthesia plus general anesthesia, the thoracolumbar
   group (n=12) received thoracolumbar epidural anesthesia plus general
   anesthesia, and the control group (n=12) received general anesthesia
   alone. We monitored hemodynamics and plasma catecholamine concentrations
   and assessed survival in these groups during normocapnic hypoxia
   (FiO(2), 0.09 for 120 min).
   During hypoxic challenge, PaCO2 and PaO2 values were similar in all
   groups. in both groups that received epidural anesthesia, heart rate,
   systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, and plasma epinephrine and
   norepinephrine concentrations were lower and arterial pH was greater
   than in the control group.
   There was no significant difference in survival among groups. Epidural
   anesthesia modified both the physiologic cardiovascular and
   catecholamine responses to hypoxia. Epidural anesthesia of the thoracic
   region did not appear to accelerate cardiac arrest, but it attenuated
   the development of metabolic acidosis during hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{To eliminate systemic toxicity, including the hypotension associated
   with human tumor necrosis factor cy (TNF-(alpha), we constructed mutant
   proteins (muteins) by mean of genetic engineering. A novel mutein,
   F4614, containing mutations of (5)Thr --> Gly and (6)Pro --> Asp, which
   resulted in the introduction of cell-adhesive Arg-Gly-Asp and (29)Arg
   --> Val, had remarkably reduced hypotensive effects and lower lethality,
   We present evidence that the Arg --> Val mutation at position 29 is
   largely responsible for the reduced hypotensive effect. This effect of
   F3614 was thought to be closely correlated with its low inducibility of
   nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) in vivo. In addition, the
   therapeutically effective dose of F46P4 to MethA
   fibrosarcoma-transplanted mice was increased compared with that of
   TNF-alpha. Indicating a wide therapeutic index. These results indicated
   that F4614 has several advantages as a systemic therapeutic drug in the

   austenitic stainless steel forged plate at liquid helium temperature for
   fusion reactor magnets of next generation. Elastic-plastic fracture
   toughness (J(IC)) testing was conducted in general accordance with ASTM
   standards E813-81 and E813-87, and unloading-compliance technique was
   applied using compact specimens 25.0 mm and 12.5 mm thick. Thermocouples
   were used to measure the temperature rise near the crack tip. The
   effects of specimen size and side-groove on the cryogenic fracture
   properties of this alloy are examined. Examination of the fracture
   surface of CT specimens by scanning electron microscopy showed ductile
   failure by microvoid coalescence, The effect of inclusion on fracture
   mechanics parameters (J(Q), J(IC)) is also discussed using energy
   dispersive X-ray analyser.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that perioperative train-of-four (TOF) monitoring
   does not reduce the incidence of postoperative residual curarization
   (PORC). The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of
   tactile assessment of the response of the adductor pollicis to
   supramaximal TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist during
   anaesthesia affected the incidence of PORC. Thirty-nine ASA I or II
   surgical patients were studied during thiopentone/fentanyl N2O/enflurane
   anaesthesia. Pancuronium (70-100 mu g . kg(-1) was used to facilitate
   tracheal intubation and additional pancuronium increments used to
   maintain surgical relaxation. The requirement for incremental doses of
   pancuronium and adequacy of recovery following reversal were assessed
   according to random allocation, either with (Group A; n = 20) or without
   (Group B; n = 19) access to TOF monitoring. Patients in the two groups
   received neostigmine in similar doses (Group A: 53 mu g . kg(-1) (5.9);
   Group B: 55 mu g . kg(-1) (5.4)). On arrival of the patient to the
   recovery area, neuromuscular function was assessed electromyographically
   (using the Datex NMT 221 to measure TOF ratio) and clinically. The
   incidence of PORC (TOF ratio < 70\%) war;greater in Group B (47\%) than
   in Group A (15\%) (P = 0.029). We conclude that the use of perioperative
   TOF monitoring decreases the incidence of pancuronium-induced PORC.}},

   characteristics and clinical significance. Phi rhythm was defined as a
   minimum of three consecutive monomorphic posterior delta waves occurring
   within 2 sec of eye closure on at least two occasions during
   electroencephalography. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients (16 male and 14
   female) with a mean age of 11.6 +/- 8.4 years (range, 3 to 46 years) who
   were evaluated between 1978 and 1993. Phi rhythm most commonly occurred
   when the patient was alert and after concentrated visual attention, such
   as reading or picture or pattern scanning. Seventeen of these patients
   had epilepsy (11 generalized, 3 focal, 1 both, and 2 unclassified). The
   frequency of epilepsy was not significantly different from that of a
   control group bf 60 patients matched for age and sex; however,
   generalized epilepsies were more common in the phi group (P = 0.008).
   Group 2 consisted of a previously unreported series of 121 patients
   evaluated between 1960 and 1962. A diverse range of underlying clinical
   diagnoses was evident in both groups. The mechanism of the phi rhythm is

Abstract = {{Collagen was investigated as a drug delivery matrix because it is
   injectable, biocompatible and is naturally resorbed in the body. This
   work focuses on understanding the effect of electrostatically mediated
   binding interactions on release kinetics of charged polypeptides from
   collagen matrices. The charge distribution on collagen molecules can be
   modified by specific chemical reactions to yield net negative or net
   positive charges at physiological pH. These electrostatic charges are
   favorable in binding oppositely charged polypeptides. An ESR based
   technique was utilized to measure adsorption isotherms in order to
   characterize the strength of binding interactions. Adsorption isotherm
   measurements indicate that increasing the charge density of collagen
   enhances binding interactions. Enhanced binding interactions are also
   observed when the degree of charge modification is increased as well as
   when the prevailing ionic strength of the matrix is lowered. Charged
   polypeptides show slower release rates from higher charge density
   collagen matrices. Release kinetics have been modeled via coupled
   desorption and diffusion mechanisms and comparisons based on independent
   measurements of desorption (kinetic and equilibrium) and diffusional
   parameters with experimentally measured release rates are in good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Newly synthesized enzymes destined for lysosomal localization contain
   mannose 6-phosphate (Man6-P) residues, allowing interaction with Man6-P
   receptors (MPRs) and subsequent intracellular targeting to the lysosome.
   In most cultured cells, lysosomal enzymes are rapidly dephosphorylated
   after targeting, but in some transformed cell lines, these proteins
   retain the Man6-P marker, To investigate the significance of this in
   human malignancy, we examined the persistence of the Man6-P marker in
   human breast biopsy specimens using MPR derivatives as affinity probes.
   In one approach, extracts of frozen tissue were standardized to protein
   content, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, immobilized on nitrocellulose, and
   probed with iodinated MPR, On average, carcinomas contained 4-fold
   higher levels of Man6-P glycoproteins than did benign tumors or normal
   breast samples, In about 15\% of the carcinomas, levels of Man6-P
   glycoproteins were highly elevated (7-10-fold). Multiple Man6-P
   glycoproteins were detected, suggesting a general alteration in the
   synthesis or processing of many lysosomal enzymes in carcinomas, In a
   second approach, sections of formalin-fixed breast biopsy specimens were
   probed with biotinylated MPR. Malignant cells in 25 of 75 carcinomas
   exhibited granular cytoplasmic staining in what appears to be
   intracellular vesicles, Staining was specifically inhibited by Man6-P
   and was not observed in stromal components or lymphocytes. In addition,
   Man6-phosphorylated proteins were not detected in the 14 normal or
   benign biopsy samples examined. Staining appeared to be independent of
   most prognostic factors examined, including p53, cathepsin D, DNA
   ploidy, and hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor status,
   However, positive staining was significantly associated with high
   histological and nuclear grades (P < 0.05) and potentially with c-erbB-2
   (P < 0.10), suggesting that elevated levels of Man6-P glycoproteins are
   associated with the more aggressive tumors.}},

Title = {{THE G(2)M ARREST CAUSED BY IODIDE IS UNRELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF IODIDE
   AT ADENYLATE-CYCLASE}},
Journal = {{THYROID}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{325-330}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Previously, we have shown that iodide was able to inhibit TSH induced
   thyrocyte proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at G(0)G(1) and
   G(2)M, suggesting that iodide may be exerting its effects through more
   than the TSH-adenylate cyclase-cAMP system. To confirm the effects of
   iodide on the adenylate cyclase (AC) system, forskolin- and
   dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP (dBcAMP)-stimulated FRTL5 thyroid cells were
   exposed to inhibitory concentrations of iodide and the resultant effects
   on the cell cycle were compared to the effects observed with TSH, using
   flow cytometric DNA analysis. Forskolin stimulated the proliferation of
   FRTL5 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cell numbers rose from baseline
   by 169 +/- 4\% to peak at 10 mu M forskolin. Interestingly, 100 mu M
   forskolin inhibited cell proliferation, causing cell numbers to fall by
   approximately 50\%. Iodide inhibited forskolin-induced proliferation to
   baseline levels. However, the pattern of cell cycle perturbation was
   different to that with TSH-stimulated cells. There were no differences
   in the proportion of cells in G(0)G(1) between forskolin alone and
   forskolin + NaI, while there was a marked fall in the proportion of
   cells in S phase, indicating possible partial arrest at G(0)G(1).
   Furthermore, there was a marked accumulation of cells in G(2)M over and
   above that found with TSH + NaI, indicating arrest at G(2)M. dBcAMP
   maximally stimulated cell numbers to rise from baseline by 125\% with 1
   mM dBcAMP. Again, higher concentrations of the mitogen had an inhibitory
   effect on proliferation. The addition of NaI inhibited dBcAMP stimulated
   cell proliferation. However, unlike the effect of NaI on TSH- or
   forskolin-induced proliferation, there was no G(0)G(1) arrest in the
   cell cycle. With dBcAMP, there were decreases in the proportion of cells
   in both G(0)G(1) and S phases with a marked accumulation of cells in
   G(2)M indicating that the inhibitory effect of iodide is due purely to
   G(2)M cell cycle arrest. In this study, the requirement of AC activation
   for the mediation of TSH-induced proliferation has been confirmed.
   Further, the inhibitory effects of iodide are mediated by at least 2
   mechanisms, one AC related and the other independent of the AC system.
   Iodide caused significant inhibition at G(0)G(1) and G(2)M with cells
   stimulated by TSH, while in the presence of forskolin, which stimulates
   the cAMP cascade at the catalytic component of AC, iodide caused little
   or no cell cycle arrest at G(0)G(1), but induced marked cell cycle
   arrest at G(2)M. Further, iodide in the presence of dBcAMP, which acts
   distal to AC, induced only a G(2)M arrest. This indicates that the
   G(0)G(1) arrest caused by iodide is due to effects at or proximal to the
   catalytic component of AC while the G(2)M arrest is unrelated to the
   effects of iodide at AC.}},

Abstract = {{Starting from the observation that the technological potentials are
   underutilized in economic and in social terms, this article raises the
   question of what role technology assessment (TA) can play in technology
   policy to address this problem. The causes of the problem of
   underutilization are analyzed and discussed in relation to developments
   in technology policy and TA. Against this background, the actual state
   of TA in Europe at national and supranational levels is described, gaps
   and flaws in the European TA Infrastructure (ETAI) are identified, and
   suggestions for improvement are made. It is concluded that TA can play
   an important role in increasing the social and economic returns on
   investments in the development of new technology. Growing interest in,
   and budgets for, TA at European level - together with the shift from a
   supply side toward a more demand oriented technology policy - create a
   favorable environment for this. However, attempts to strengthen TA will
   only be successful if the TA community recognizes this role and is not
   satisfied with the marginal position it still has.}},

   gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using anti-cross-reacting
   determinant antibody. In addition to bile canalicular surfaces, CALP
   activity was found over hepatocyte sinusoidal surfaces by histochemical
   staining of canine liver sections. A significantly higher ratio of CALP
   to total alkaline phosphatase activity was observed in serum as opposed
   to bile in 10 of 11 paired serum and bile samples from dogs. This
   suggested that bile is not likely to be the source of serum CALP and is
   consistent with the release of CALP from hepatocyte basolateral surfaces
   directly into serum. It was concluded that serum CALP was once membrane
   bound and was released by phospholipase activity into serum. Our
   findings are consistent with release of CALP from the sinusoidal
   surfaces of hepatocytes into serum either by endogenous GPI-PLD activity
   or release by GPI-PLC followed by modification of the
   phosphatidylinositol remnant in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{There are multiple routes of NAD(P)H oxidation associated with the inner
   membrane of plant mitochondria. These are the phosphorylating NADH
   dehydrogenase, otherwise known as Complex I, and at least four other
   nonphosphorylating NAD(P)H dehydrogenases. Complex I has been isolated
   from beetroot, broad bean, and potato mitochondria. It has at least 32
   polypeptides associated with it, contains FMN as its prosthetic group,
   and the purified enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by rotenone. In terms
   of subunit complexity it appears similar to the mammalian and fungal
   enzymes. Some polypeptides display antigenic similarity to subunits from
   Neurospora crassa but little cross-reactivity to antisera raised against
   some beef heart complex I subunits. Plant complex I contains eight
   mitochondrial encoded subunits with the remainder being nuclear-encoded.
   Two of these mitochondrial-encoded subunits, nadir and nad9, show
   homology to corresponding nuclear-encoded subunits in Neurospora crassa
   (49 and 30 kDa, respectively) and beef heart CI (49 and 31 kDa,
   respectively), suggesting a marked difference between the assembly of CI
   from plants and the fungal and mammalian enzymes. As well as complex I,
   plant mitochondria contain several type-II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases which
   mediate rotenone-insensitive oxidation of cytosolic and matrix NADH. We
   have isolated three of these dehydrogenases from beetroot mitochondria
   which are similar to enzymes isolated from potato mitochondria. Two of
   these enzymes are single polypeptides (32 and 55 kDa) and appear similar
   to those found in maize mitochondria, which have been localized to the
   outside of the inner membrane. The third enzyme appears to be a dimer
   comprised of two identical 43-kDa subunits. It is this enzyme that we
   believe contributes to rotenone-insensitive oxidation of matrix NADH. In
   addition to this type-Il dehydrogenases, several observations suggest
   the presence of a smaller form of CI present in plant mitochondria which
   is insensitive to rotenone inhibition. We propose that this represents
   the peripheral arm of CI in plant mitochondria and may participate in
   nonphosphorylating matrix NADH oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic macrophytes of the littoral zone were surveyed in 21 Nova
   Scotian lakes, and macrophyte composition was interpreted in relation to
   chemical and physical characteristics. The lake set included both
   nutrient-enriched and acidified lakes, and consequently had a wide range
   of water chemistry variables, notably pH (3.7-8.3) and total phosphorus
   (0.003-6.0 mg l(-1)). Using canonical correspondence analysis, we
   related differences in vegetation among lakes to 14 water chemistry and
   three physical variables. Alkalinity, total phosphorus, and total
   nitrogen were most strongly correlated with differences in vegetation
   between heavily enriched, moderately enriched and non-enriched lakes.
   Interestingly, macrophyte composition was not strongly correlated with
   pH. Even in a subset of lakes consisting of moderately enriched and
   non-enriched lakes, alkalinity, total phosphorus and total nitrogen
   remained strongly correlated with vegetation differences. By contrast,
   vegetation differences among non-enriched lakes correlated most strongly
   with substrate slope, lake area, calcium, and alkalinity.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of macrovascular disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetes
   (NIDDM) have shown a significant increase in peripheral vascular,
   coronary, and carotid artery disease in diabetics compared to
   non-diabetics. This prevalence appears to be related to insulin levels
   and to the degree of hyperinsulinemia as measured in the blood of these
   patients. Indeed, a cluster of markers, including hyperinsulinemia,
   insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipoproteinemia, and a high
   waist-hip ratio, has been associated with NIDDM and increased risk for
   macrovascular disease. Variously described as Metabolic Syndrome or
   Syndrome X, this syndrome may be operative for many years before NIDDM
   is diagnosed. Given the complexity of Metabolic Syndrome, a
   single-factor intervention for preventing macrovascular disease in NIDDM
   is unlikely. However, it seems advisable to screen, on a regular basis,
   all patients presenting a pre-NIDDM state, as well as those with overt
   NIDDM, for pertinent cardiovascular risk parameters and for emerging
   macrovascular disease. It is suggested that any attempt to prevent
   macrovascular disease in subjects with glucose intolerance should aim at
   decreasing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.}},

Abstract = {{Upon vascular damage platelet activation and blood coagulation are
   initiated. Interference at the initial level of the activation of the
   coagulation cascade can result in effective inhibition of thrombus
   formation. The in vivo antithrombotic properties of a series of bovine
   pancreatic trypsin inhibitor mutants (BPTI, aprotinin) 4C2, 7L22, 5L15,
   5L15-PEG, 6L15 and 5L84, as described in the accompanying paper, with a
   combined inhibitory activity on factor Xa, factor VIIa-tissue factor
   complex, factor XIa and plasma kallikrein were compared to rTAP,
   r-hirudin, heparin and enoxaparin in a platelet rich thrombosis model in
   hamsters.
   Platelet dependent thrombus deposition was quantified by dedicated image
   analysis after transillumination of the femoral vein to which a
   standardised vascular trauma was applied. After increasing intravenous
   bolus injections all tested agents, except for aprotinin, induced a dose
   dependent decrease of thrombus formation and a concomitant prolongation
   of the aPTT. From the linear correlation between these two parameters it
   was found that 5 out of the 6 tested aprotinin analogues, rTAP and
   r-hirudin completely inhibited thrombus formation at a therapeutical (2-
   to 3-fold) aPTT prolongation while 4C2, heparin and enoxaparin only
   inhibited thrombus formation for 40 to 50 percent at a 2-fold aPTT
   prolongation Based on the calculated IC50 values for thrombus formation
   rTAP was found to be the most active compound in this model.
   It is concluded that acceptable interference at the initial level of the
   blood coagulation, e.g. within a therapeutical aPTT prolongation, can
   significantly inhibit platelet deposition at a site of vascular injury.}},

Abstract = {{The cytochrome P450 enzyme debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase metabolizes many
   different classes of commonly used drugs, such as antidepressants and
   neuroleptics. Deficient hydroxylation of debrisoquine, known as the poor
   metabolizer (PM) phenotype, affects 5-10\% of Caucasians and may lead to
   adverse reactions upon administration of drugs in standard doses. This
   autosomal recessive metabolic deficiency is caused by the possession of
   two PM-associated mutations in the human CYP2D6 gene locus coding for
   the enzyme. These mutations include at least four different single base
   mutations and two different large gene deletion alleles, The single base
   mutations can be rapidly detected by PCR methods. In contrast, the large
   gene deletions have so far only been directly identified by RFLP
   analysis, By the use of sequence data previously published by others, we
   report here an alignment of different CYP2D alleles to focus on the
   presence of almost completely identical sequences immediately downstream
   of both CYP2D7 and CYP2D6 which may seriously complicate and interfere
   with PCR-based detection of the gene deletion. Based on this analysis,
   we have developed a rapid assay which, for the first time, detects the
   13kb (also called 11.5 kb) Xba I gene deletion allele by the use of
   long-PCR technology. The primers were designed to amplify a 3.5 kb PCR
   product in the presence of this D6(D) allele. We have evaluated the
   method on 23 different DNA samples heterozygous (n = 22) or homozygous
   (n = 1) for the 13 kb gene deletion allele (previously typed by RFLP
   analyses). All samples were correctly identified by the assay, The PCR
   method did not detect the rare 11 kb Xba I gene deletion allele (n = 5),
   and there was no false positive amplification from deletion negative DNA
   samples (n = 47). This sensitive and specific PCR-based assay for
   detection of the D6(D) allele will improve the scientific and clinical
   use of CYP2D6 genotyping.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between oviposition preference and offspring
   performance is critical to the evolutionary ecology of the interactions
   between herbivorous insects and plants, but is not well understood. To
   improve our understanding of this relationship we must critically
   evaluate the relative importance of the selective forces or causes of
   mortality that affect developing larvae. We documented a strong
   relationship between oviposition preference and larval performance for 2
   species of galling tenthredinid sawflies, a petiole galler, Euura sp.,
   and a leaf galler, Pontania sp., near P. pacifica on the arroyo willow,
   Salix lasiolepis. There was a correlation between attack and survival on
   different ramet ages for both sawfly species. Mortality caused;by plant
   resistance by ramet age primarily explained the pattern of attack of
   both sawflies. The effect of plant resistance was strongest on willow
   shoots on very young ramets. This effect decreased rapidly as ramet age
   increased and then increased relatively slowly as ramets aged, becoming
   very strong on the oldest ramets. Mortality caused by plant resistance
   was 8-fold greater than mortality caused by natural enemies for Euura
   and 3.2-fold greater for Pontania. Natural enemies may play a lesser
   role in the population dynamics of the sawflies that may be subsidiary
   to the plant-herbivore interaction. We reason that selection has
   resulted in ovipositing females flying primarily in the upper parts of
   willow clones and avoiding the highly resistant younger ramets common in
   the lower parts of clones. Within the upper parts of clones, the
   evolution of female behavior that discriminates against shorter, slower
   growing shoots on older ramets would be selected for by the decreasing
   survival of offspring on these shoots.}},

Abstract = {{Integrin receptors for extracellular matrix receptors are important
   effecters of cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration in cultured
   cells and are believed to be critical effecters of these processes
   during development. To determine when beta 1 integrins become critical
   during embryonic development, we generated mutant mice with a targeted
   disruption of the beta 1 integrin subunit gene. Heterozygous mutant mice
   were normal. Homozygous loss of beta 1 integrin expression was lethal
   during early postimplantation development. Homozygous embryos lacking
   beta 1 integrins formed normal-looking blastocysts and initiated
   implantation at E4.5. However, the E4.5 beta 1-null embryos in situ had
   collapsed blastocoeles, and whereas the trophoblast penetrated the
   uterine epithelium, extensive invasion of the decidua was not observed.
   Laminin-positive endoderm cells were detected in the inner cell mass
   area, but endoderm morphogenesis and migration were defective. By E5.5
   beta 1-null embryos had degenerated extensively. In vitro analysis
   showed that trophoblast function in beta 1-null peri-implantation
   embryos was largely normal, including expression of tissue-specific
   markers, and outgrowth on fibronectin- and vitronectin-coated, although
   not on laminin-coated substrates. In contrast, the inner cell mass
   region of beta 1-null blastocyst outgrowths, and inner cell masses
   isolated from beta 1-null blastocysts, showed highly retarded growth and
   defective extraembryonic endoderm morphogenesis and migration. These
   data suggest that beta 1 integrins are required for normal morphogenesis
   of the inner cell mass and are essential mediators of growth and
   survival of cells of the inner cell mass. Failure of continued
   trophoblast development in beta 1-null embryos after inner cell mass
   failure could be attributable to either an intrinsic requirement for
   beta 1 integrins for later stages of trophoblast development, or to the
   lack of trophic signals from the beta 1-null inner cell mass.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for estimating potential volume yield is developed for
   stands containing dominant Douglas-fir in the Northern Rocky Mountains.
   Earlier work on site index and height growth and maximum stand density
   was the basis for deriving a stand form factor equation that provides
   potential volume estimates for a continuum of even- to uneven-aged
   mixed-species stands. The coefficients of this equation (which explained
   84\% of the variation) differ with respect to habitat type. The
   combination of asymptotic dominant height, potential basal area, and
   stand form factor allows for estimating potential total volumes as a
   function of site index and age of dominant Douglas-fir, habitat type,
   and the skewness of the dbh(1.5)-distribution (which characterizes stand
   structure). Potential volume yield levels vary with respect to habitat
   type and stand structure (skewness), indicating that much information on
   potential total volume is lost if only site index is used to measure
   productivity. These discrepancies between productivity estimates based
   on site index and potential volume are the result of different yield
   levels sensu Assmann existing within a given site index class, For the
   majority of habitat types, volume growth potential would have been
   underestimated using site index alone.}},

Abstract = {{While over 20 intrinsic proteins of the Golgi apparatus have been
   identified and sequenced, there is no information on their developmental
   history, i.e., whether all Golgi proteins are expressed simultaneously
   or whether there is a hierarchical or stage-specific order of their
   expression during embryonic development. In this study we have examined
   the emergence and distribution of MG160 during the development of
   chicken embryos. MG160 is a conserved membrane sialoglycoprotein of the
   Golgi apparatus of most cells displaying over 90\% amino acid sequence
   identities with two apparently unrelated molecules, namely CFR, a
   chicken fibroblast growth factor receptor, and ESL-1, a ligand for
   E-selectin (Gonatas et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1989, 264, 646-653; Burrus
   and Olwin, J. Biol. Chem. 1989, 264, 18647-18653; Burrus et al., Mol.
   Cell Biol. 1992, 12, 5600-5609; Gonatas et al., J. Cell Sci. 108,
   457-467; Steegmaier et al., Nature 1995, 373, 615-620). This study was
   carried out by in situ hybridization, using a 56-mer antisense probe for
   the chicken homologue of MG160 which differs only by four bases from the
   corresponding segment of the rat cDNA and by immunocytochemistry and
   Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum against MG160. The protein
   was ubiquitously and exclusively localized in the Golgi apparatus and
   appeared early in development within the ectoblast and primitive
   endoblast prior to the formation of the primitive streak. At 2 to 3
   days, MG160 was particularly prominent in the notochord, neural tube,
   somites, and cartilage cells. In organs with central lumens, such as the
   neural tube, the Golgi apparatus, visualized by immunostaining for
   MG160, was elongated and it was located at the apical pole of cells. In
   6-day-old embryos, the ongoing physiologic degeneration of the notochord
   was accompanied by fragmentation of the immunostained Golgi apparatus
   and decreased labeling of the mRNA for MG160. In order to gain
   information on possible interactions between MG160 and basic fibroblast
   growth factor (bFGF), the localization of both molecules was studied by
   immunocytochemistry in 3-day-old chicken embryos. While MG160 was
   ubiquitous in the Golgi apparatus of all cells and tissues, endogenous
   bFGF was not detected, while exogenous bFGF bound only to basement
   membranes. These results indicate that MG160 is a primordial protein of
   the Golgi apparatus and are consistent with the hypothesis that the
   binding of MG160 to fibroblast growth factors and E-selectin is not
   related to the still unknown principal function of MG160 in the Golgi
   apparatus. (C) 1995 Academic Press Inc.}},

   PROTEINURIA}},

Abstract = {{Proteinuria is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and
   mortality. Release of nitric oxide by the endothelium has been advanced
   as an important defense mechanism against vessel-wall damage. In the
   present study we therefore tested the hypothesis that proteinuria is
   associated with a defect in nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation, by
   using venous occlusion plethysmography of the forearm in nine patients
   with nephrotic range proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 hr) and normal renal
   function (creatinine 83.1 +/- 8.7 mu mol/liter), eight patients with
   active glomerulonephritis but normal renal function (creatinine 81.2 +/-
   5.4 mu mol/liter) and low range proteinuria (<1.0 g/24 hr), and ten
   healthy volunteers. We infused L-NMMA (2 mg/min) to inhibit basal nitric
   oxide production, serotonin (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 ng/kg/min) as an
   endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and nitroprusside (1, 10, 30 and 100
   ng/kg/min) as an endothelium-independent vasodilator into the brachial
   artery. Administration of L-NMMA decreased basal forearm vascular
   resistance (FVR) by 30 +/- 4\% in the nephrotic subjects, 38 +/- 4\% in
   the non-nephrotic patients and by 37 +/- 2\% in the healthy controls (P
   = 0.15). Upon the highest dose of serotonin FVR decreased in nephrotic
   subjects by 40 +/- 5\%, which was less than in non-nephrotic patients
   (56 +/- 3\%; P < 0.05) or in healthy controls (55 +/- 3\%; P < 0.05).
   The maximal decrease in FVR upon nitroprusside infusion was not
   different between the groups (respectively 84 +/- 2, 84 +/- 3 and 84 +/-
   2\%). The impaired serotonin-induced vasodilation could be attributed to
   a defect in nitric oxide production, since L-NMMA almost completely
   prevented serotonergic vasodilation. The defect in agonist-induced
   nitric oxide release or activity could not be explained by decreased
   substrate availability, as infusion of excess L-arginine (0.2 mg/kg/min)
   did not improve vasodilation. The nephrotic subjects also had an
   increased lysophosphatidylcholine content in the low-density-lipoprotein
   fraction, which has been shown to interfere with Gi-protein-dependent
   signal transduction pathways, including serotonin-induced vasodilation.
   In conclusion, nephrotic-range proteinuria is accompanied by impaired
   endothelium-dependent vasomotion.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of vulvo-vaginal
   candidiasis among the users of acitretin. The incidence rate ratio of
   vulvo-vaginal candidiasis was estimated in a cohort of acitretin users
   by using prescription sequence analysis. Study subjects were 196 women
   between 15 and 45 years of age, exposed to acitretin in 1990.
   Prescriptions of drugs for treatment of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis were
   used as proxy for the occurrence of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis.
   Validation of the proxy drug was performed by record linkage of pharmacy
   and medical records. In addition to the risk estimation by incidence
   rate ratios a case-crossover study with patient-stratified logistic
   regression analysis was performed to control for distortion due to
   individual differences in contribution of exposure time. The positive
   predictive value of the proxy drug for vulvo-vaginal candidiasis ranged
   between 57 and 100\%, the sensitivity was 87\% and the specificity
   estimated 99\%. The crude incidence rate ratio for vulvo-vaginal
   candidiasis following acitretin exposure was 2.8 (CI95\%:1.1-7.1). The
   pooled Mantel-Haenszel incidence rate ratio was 3.3 (CI95\%:1.1-9.6)
   after stratification for accumulated level of exposure.
   Patient-stratified analysis on the subgroup of cases (n = 15) revealed
   an odds ratio of 6.5 (CI95\%:2.3-18.2).
   This study strongly suggests that the higher occurrence of vulvo-vaginal
   candidiasis during acitretin exposure is attributable to the drug.}},

Abstract = {{By assuming an elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive relation for the
   material and employing a model which consists of four compressible
   elastic-plastic bars connected by four elastic-plastic `'hinges'' of
   finite length, the dynamic behaviour of an inertia-sensitive impact
   energy-absorbing structure (previously called a Type II structure) under
   impact is analysed in detail. By taking account of the complicated
   deformation history involving loading, unloading and reversed loading,
   the large deformation process is traced completely and the variation of
   the `'impact force'' with time or with the vertical displacement is
   determined. In particular, the peak load is determined on the basis of
   elastic-plastic material behaviour and the consideration of inertia
   effects. The analysis presented indicates that the dynamic behaviour of
   the structure considered significantly differs from the quasi-static
   behaviour of the same structure even when the effect of strain-rate on
   the material properties is excluded. Therefore, inertia would appear to
   be the dominant effect in this sort of impact problems.}},

   variations of electron density and temperature near 600 km altitude in
   the low-latitude region are studied by comparison with values from the
   Sheffield University plasmasphere-ionosphere model (SUPIM). The model
   results show that the observed features of higher electron density in
   the summer hemisphere and higher electron temperature in the winter
   hemisphere are caused principally by the difference in the summer and
   winter hemisphere values of the meridional neutral wind. Closer
   agreement between the modeled and observed values is obtained when the
   interhemisphere difference in the meridional wind, as given by the
   horizontal wind model (HWM) 90, is reduced and when the peak value of
   the daytime poleward wind is moved to the afternoon sector in the winter
   hemisphere and to the morning sector in the summer hemisphere. The model
   results also show that the altitude variation of the vertical ExB drift
   velocity plays an important role in the development of the ionospheric
   equatorial anomaly. The latitude and diurnal variations of the modeled
   electron density and temperature are in good agreement with the
   observations when the ExB drift velocity used by the model is in accord
   with the observations made by the AE-E satellite for magnetic field
   lines with apex altitude less than 400 km and at Arecibo for magnetic
   field lines with apex altitude greater than 2000 km; linear
   interpolation of the observed values is used for the intermediate

Abstract = {{We have identified, characterized and cloned human, mouse and chicken
   cDNA of a novel protein that binds to the Src homology domain 3 (SH3) of
   the Yes proto-oncogene product, We subsequently named it YAP for
   Yes-associated protein. Analysis of the YAP sequence revealed a protein
   module that was found in various structural, regulatory and signaling
   molecules, Because one of the prominent features of this sequence motif
   is the presence of two conserved tryptophans (W), we named it the WW
   domain. Using a functional screen of a cDNA expression library, we have
   identified two putative ligands of the WW domain of YAP which we named
   WBP-1 and WBP-2. Peptide sequence comparison between the two partial
   clones revealed a homologous proline-rich region, Binding assays and
   site-specific mutagenesis have shown that the proline-rich motif binds
   with relatively high affinity and specificity to the WW domain of YAP,
   with a preliminary consensus that is different from the SH3-binding PXXP
   motif, This suggests that the WW domain has a role in mediating
   protein-protein interactions via proline-rich regions, similar but
   distinct from Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, Based on this finding, we
   hypothesize that additional protein modules exist and that they could be
   isolated using proline-rich peptides as functional probes.}},

Abstract = {{The classification and labeling of dangerous substances was first
   introduced in 1967 in the European Community with Council Directive
   67/548/EEC, known as the Dangerous Substances Directive. The Sixth
   Amendment to this directive in 1979 introduced a notification procedure
   for new chemicals and a requirement for labeling chemicals for toxicity.
   Three special categories for labeling were for carcinogenicity,
   mutagenicity, and teratogenicity. The teratogenicity classification was
   restricted to chemicals inducing teratogenic effects in the classical
   sense of the word, ie, producing only gross structural malformations.
   Discussions by expert advisors to the European Commission over several
   years led to a widening of concern in this area of toxicology and under
   the recent Seventh Amendment,(1) the classification of `'teratology''
   has been changed to `'toxic to reproduction.'' This includes adverse
   effects on fertility, pre- and postnatal development, and lactation, and
   encompasses not only structural but also functional deficits. This will
   bring about a major change in the testing requirements to allow adequate
   classification of chemicals for these other aspects of reproductive
   toxicity.}},

   phytoplankton clones representing different algal groups and cell sizes
   indicate that cellular iron uptake rates are similar among the species

   apparently is explained by evolutionary pressures that have pushed iron
   uptake in all species toward the maximum limits imposed by diffusion and
   ligand exchange kinetics. Because of these physical/chemical limits on
   uptake, oceanic species have been forced to decrease their cell size
   and/or to reduce their growth requirements for cellular iron by up to
   8-fold. The biochemical mechanisms responsible for this reduction in
   metabolic requirements are unknown.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{1. We studied within-tree variation in leaf quality of the mountain
   birch, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa, for larvae of the autumnal moth,
   Epirrita autumnata.
   2. The purpose of the study was to determine the possible occurrence of
   systematic differences in larval growth on short shoot leaves (i.e.
   leaves of the same age): among leaves facing in different compass
   directions, between leaves of lower and upper branches, among leaves on
   different positions within a branch and among leaves of different sizes
   within a short shoot. We also measured larval growth between short shoot
   and long shoot leaves (i.e. between leaves of different age).
   3. The larvae grew best on leaves on the north side of trees and most
   poorly on south side leaves, the east and west sides being intermediate.
   Leaves from the upper branches supported larval growth better than
   leaves from the lower ones. The larvae grew better on the smallest leaf
   of each short shoot and were able to utilize it more efficiently than
   the two larger leaves. Short shoot leaves from the basal and middle
   parts of the upper branches of the trees were of better quality for the
   larvae than short shoot leaves from the tip part of the branches, The
   larval growth rate did not differ between short shoot and long shoot
   leaves. In general, within-tree variation in the larval growth rate was
   lower than variation among different trees.
   4. Damage to leaves can decrease leaf quality for herbivores in the same
   year (rapidly inducible responses) or the following year(s) (delayed
   inducible responses). Our results show that systematic within-tree
   variation in larval growth can be as great as the effects of rapidly
   inducible responses and that variation among individual trees can be as
   great as the mean effects of delayed inducible responses.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program
   (SHEP) demonstrated a significant reduction in stroke and coronary event
   rates among participants randomly assigned to active blood pressure
   treatment. Selected participants were evaluated for peripheral
   atherosclerosis and followed up for cardiovascular events beyond the end
   of the SHEP trial. Antihypertensive treatment effects were evaluated
   based on the presence or absence of clinical or subclinical
   atherosclerosis.
   Methods As an ancillary study to SHEP, 190 participants at the
   Pittsburgh center were evaluated for peripheral atherosclerosis, defined
   as either an internal carotid stenosis (by duplex scan) or lower
   extremity arterial disease (identified by ankle blood pressure).
   Participants were subsequently followed up for cardiovascular events.
   Results Estimates of 4-year mortality rates were 4.8\% for participants
   with no atherosclerosis, 16.7\% for those with subclinical
   atherosclerosis, and 23\% among those with clinical evidence of
   atherosclerosis (P < .001). Fatal plus nonfatal cardiovascular event
   rates were 10.9\%, 29.8\%, and 58.3\% for the three groups, respectively
   (P < .001). Differences remained significant after adjustment for age,
   sex, treatment assignment, smoking, and high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol. Individuals assigned to placebo at the beginning of SKEP
   had higher cardiovascular event rates than individuals assigned to
   active treatment (P = .011), with the most striking difference 3 or more
   years after the end of the SHEP trial. When this analysis was stratified
   by the presence or absence of detectable atherosclerosis, the absolute
   treatment effect was largest among those with evidence of disease.
   Conclusions Individuals with systolic hypertension and evidence of
   peripheral atherosclerosis are at high risk for cardiovascular events.
   Targeting this group for antihypertensive therapy would result in the
   prevention of a large number of cardiovascular events.}},

Abstract = {{Two cross sections of the same buried linear erosion form are studied in
   the upper course of the Mikulinskiy ravine, revealed in a quarry wall of
   the Mikhaylovskiy Mining and Dressing Combine. Polygenetic catenas are
   developed on the slopes and in the bottom of the ravine. In the history
   of existence of these catenas, four soil-forming phases have been
   identified, along with the cryomorpholithogenic phases which appear and
   are preserved differently in the studied catenas. Based on study of Late
   Pleistocene catenas, the direction has been established not only for
   soil-forming processes, but also processes of cryo- and
   morpholithogenesis in the glaciation-interglacial cycle. The concept of
   `'complete evolution of catenas and geosystems'' is introduced: the
   process of differentiation of space from homogeneous, represented by a
   single elementary soil area (ESA) or a single elementary geosystem, to
   the most complex, differentiated space, consisting of several ESA, and
   integration of space again to homogeneous. The obtained results can be
   used to solve problems of the evolution of modern soils and predict the
   development of Holocene catenas and geosystems in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria induces
   a variety of biological effects in mammals, We have earlier demonstrated
   that lysozyme (LZM) will bind to both smooth and rough forms of LPS and
   lipid A with high affinity, and inhibits several of the immunomodulatory
   activities of LPS, The production of LZM/LPS complexes was suggested to
   be significantly influenced by both reaction temperature and ionic
   strength. In this manuscript, we describe experiments designed to
   examine the formation of LZM/LPS complexes prepared under various
   conditions as assessed by fluorescence measurements of dansylated LZM
   and also by separation of complexes via filtration methodologies, The
   results of these studies provide additional experimental evidence that
   complex formation requires both ionic and hydrophobic interactions, The
   most stable complexes were formed at conditions of low ionic strength
   and higher temperature, Under these conditions, hydrophobic interactions
   were predominant in complex formation, At lower temperatures, the extent
   of complex formation was less, and ionic interactions were predominant.
   TNF production by RAW264.7 cells in vitro was decreased by LZM/LPS
   complexes prepared in both high and low ionic strength, but was most
   significantly decreased at conditions of low ionic strength and higher
   temperatures, These facts suggest that both ionic and hydrophobic
   interactions of LZM with LPS are important for neutralizing the
   biological activity of LPS.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate anisotropic transport in various types of
   lattices, two-dimensional electron gas in the hexagonal and rectangular
   antidot lattices are measured. Magnetoresistance is isotropic in
   hexagonal lattice, but anisotropic in the rectangular lattice with
   circular antidots. The influence of antidot shapes upon anisotropic
   transport is also investigated in the rectangular lattice. It is found
   that the anisotropic transport is sensitive to the arrangement and the
   shape of antidot potential and anomalous peaks are observed in
   rectangular lattice with ellipsoidal antidots. The origin of the
   anomalous peaks is discussed. In both lattices quenching of the flail
   effect is observed and the positions of commensurate peaks in Hall
   resistance shift to higher field than that in magnetoresistance. These
   effects cannot be explained by the pinned orbit model.}},

   peak depending on the direction of charged particles produced by thermal

   by charged particles having mainly `'parallel direction'' and `'any

   It is concluded that, as a result of space charge effect, the direction
   of charged particles to the anode wire affects the variations of pulse
   height, energy resolution and the optimum bias voltage in the
   proportional counter. The experimental results also suggest that by
   selection of signal pulses produced by the parallel ion track, the

Abstract = {{A long-term experiment to study the effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus
   (P) and potassium (K) in intensive rice monoculture commenced at the Cuu
   Long Delta Rice Research Institute (CLRRI), Omen, Vietnam, in 1986. Two
   lowland rice crops, transplanted and irrigated, of cultivar IR64 were
   grown each year, one in the wet season (WS) from May to August, and the
   other in the dry season (DS) from December to March. The soil is an
   Fluvaquentic Humaquept representative of much of the double-cropped rice
   area in the Mekong Delta. The eight treatments were N-P-K fertiliser at
   the following rates in kg element ha(-1): 0-0-0 (check), 80-0-0,
   0-17.5-0, 0-0-25, 80-17.5-0, 80-0-25, 0-17.5-25, and 80-17.5-25 in a
   randomised complete block with 4 replications. Mean grain yields
   1986-1994 ranged from 2.1 t ha(-1) for nil fertiliser in the WS to 5.9 t
   ha(-1) with N + P in the DS. Wet season yields showed significant
   decline with time. The most rapid decline was 376 kg ha(-1) year(-1)
   from an initial level of 3.9 t ha(-1) for the treatment of N without P.
   Dry season yields of the N + P treatments increased at a rate of 293 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1) to over 5 t ha(-1). Nitrogen fertiliser-use efficiency
   declined rapidly in WS, even in combination with P. There was no
   significant benefit from K throughout. The main yield component reduced
   in WS was the number of grain per panicle. Phosphorus in combination
   with N returned up to 180 kg grain per kg P for WS and around 80 kg
   ha(-1) in DS. Summed over all 16 crops, the application of N + P
   returned an additional 26 t grain ha(-1) over the check or treatments
   with N alone. This was after deduction of the cost of fertiliser as
   grain equivalent. Phosphorus is a key factor for productivity in this
   environment, and if adequately supplied can prevent WS yield decline.}},

Abstract = {{The rates of the phase relaxations due to the Raman scattering of
   phonons and the interaction of the optical center with flipping
   two-level systems (TLS) have been calculated for the D-5(0)-F-7(0) line
   of the EU(3+) and Sm2+ ions in solids, by taking into account the mixing
   between the 4f(6) states (J mixing) through the static crystal-field
   potential. The results have been compared with the previously reported
   experimental data on the wavelength dependence of the homogeneous width
   of the inhomogeneously broadened D-5(0)- F-7(0) transition of EU(3+) and
   Sm2+ in several kinds of glasses at various temperatures. It has been
   found that the experimental data in the temperature region above about
   Ib K, where the homogeneous width shows nearly quadratic temperature
   dependence, are accounted for well, by assuming that the homogeneous
   width of this transition in glasses is dominated by the two-phonon Raman
   process in the F-7(0) state, which occurs via the M(J)=0 component of
   the F-7(0) manifold mixed into F-7(0) through the axial second-order
   crystal-field potential. On the other hand, the above wavelength
   dependence observed in the Eu3+-doped silicate glass at liquid-He
   temperature can be explained well by the calculation based on the
   interpretation that the difference between the permanent electric dipole
   moments in the D-5(0) and F-7(0) states of the rare-earth ion which
   interacts with TLS is caused by the J mixing. In addition, the
   probability of the one-phonon F-7(0)-F-7(1) absorption process has been
   calculated. The mixing of the F-7(2) state into F-7(0) and F-7(1) by the
   second-order crystal-field components is shown to play an essential role
   in this process.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormal myocardial long-chain fatty acid uptake is suspected of being
   involved in certain types of heart disease, but the mechanism by which
   the heart takes up long-chain fatty acids remains unclear, The
   sulfo-N-succinimidyl derivatives of long-chain fatty acids have been
   reported to undergo covalent binding to a membrane protein and to
   irreversibly inhibit the transport of long-chain fatty acids by rat
   adipocytes (Harmon et al., 1991). It has been suggested that the
   membrane protein bound by these derivatives is a candidate transporter
   for long-chain fatty acids in adipocytes, However, myocardial membrane
   long-chain fatty acid-binding proteins have not yet been fully
   investigated. Rat hearts were isolated and perfused with a
   sulfo-N-succinimidyl derivative of tritium-labeled palmitate
   ({[}H-3]SSP). Then the {[}H-3]SSP-binding protein was characterized by
   sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
   autoradiography and histological autoradiography, Myocardial palmitic
   acid uptake was examined after pretreatment of isolated perfused rat
   hearts with SSP. The SSP-binding protein was isolated from bovine hearts
   by successive chromatography, and the amino acid sequences of
   lysylendopeptidase-digested peptide fragments were determined, SDS-PAGE
   autoradiography revealed that {[}H-3]SSP bound to an 85-90 kDa protein
   derived from the myocardial microsomal fraction, and histological
   autoradiography demonstrated that {[}H-3]SSP radioactivity was localized
   to the myocardial cell membrane, Pre-incubation with SSP inhibited
   palmitic acid uptake by isolated perfused rat hearts. A
   {[}H-3]SSP-binding protein was also found in canine and bovine hearts,
   and was isolated from the bovine cardiac membrane fraction, Amino acid
   sequencing revealed that four peptide fragments showed strong sequence
   homology with rat adipocyte membrane protein, which is implicated in the
   binding or transport of long-chain fatty acids (Abumrad et al., 1993),
   We conclude that the SSP-binding protein is localized to the myocardial
   cell membrane and might be involved in the uptake or transport of
   long-chain fatty acids. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{Non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) is a common multimetabolic
   disorder with potential (and potentially severe) long-term complications
   affecting large and small blood vessels. Where microvascular
   complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) are concerned,
   the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), as well as much
   circumstantial evidence, suggests that hyperglycaemia is the main
   aetiological factor and this is likely to apply in NIDDM as well as
   IDDM. Unfortunately, achieving normoglycaemia in NIDDM is not easy and
   it is unclear whether insulin has advantages over oral hypoglycaemic
   agents or vice versa. Turning to macrovascular disease, it is unclear
   which of the many potentially atherogenic abnormalities - hypertension,
   hyperinsulinaemia, hyperlipidaemia, etc - are most important. A further
   problem is that macrovascular disease is already well developed in many
   patients when NIDDM is diagnosed and we do not know whether secondary
   prevention is effective. Nevertheless, it is sensible to try to reverse
   the atherogenic milieu and this should be done in the first instance by
   lifestyle modification rather than drugs. Even if we cannot manipulate
   the biochemistry to prevent small or large vessel complications, much
   can still be done; proactive foot care can prevent ulceration, timely
   laser treatment can prevent visual loss and thrombolytic therapy is
   relatively more effective in diabetic patients with myocardial
   infarction than in their non-diabetic peers. Finally, patients with
   NIDDM need intensive education and each needs an individualised
   treatment plan and goals.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between climate change and the dynamics of ecotonal
   populations of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana {[}Bong.] Carr.) was
   determined by comparing climate and the age structure of trees from 24
   plots and seedlings from 13 plots in the subalpine zone of Lassen
   Volcanic National Park, California. Tree establishment was greatest
   during periods with above normal annual and summer temperatures, and
   normal or above normal precipitation. Seedling establishment was
   positively correlated with above normal annual and summer temperatures
   and negatively correlated with April snowpack depth. The different
   responses of trees and seedlings to precipitation variation is probably
   related to site soil moisture conditions. Mountain hemlock populations
   began to expand in 1842 and establishment increased dramatically after
   1880 and peaked during a warm mesic period between 1895 and 1910. The
   onset of forest expansion coincides with warming that began at the end
   of the Little Ice Age (1850-1880). These data indicate that stability of
   the mountain hemlock ecotone is strongly influenced by climate. If
   warming induced by greenhouse,eases does occur as climate models
   predict, then the structure and dynamics of near timberline forests in
   the Pacific Northwest will change.}},

Abstract = {{A modelling study has been carried out, investigating the binding of
   histamine (Hist), 2-methylhistamine (2-MeHist) and 2-phenylhistamine
   (2-PhHist) at two postulated agonistic binding sites on transmembrane
   domain 5 (TM5) of the histamine H-1-receptor. For this purpose a
   conformational analysis study was performed on three particular residues
   of TM5, i.e., Lys(200), Th-203 and Asn(207), for which a functional role
   in binding has been proposed. The most favourable results were obtained
   for the interaction between Hist and the Lys(200)/Asn(207) pair.
   Therefore, Lys(200) was subsequently mutated and converted to an
   alanine, resulting in a 50-fold decrease of H-1-receptor stimulation by
   histamine. Altogether, the data suggest that the Lys(200)/Asn(207) pair
   is important for activation of the H-1-receptor by histamine. In
   contrast, analogues of 2-PhHist seem to belong to a distinct subclass of
   histamine agonists and an alternative mode of binding is proposed in
   which the 2-phenyl ring binds to the same receptor location as one of
   the aromatic rings of classical histamine H-1-antagonists. Subsequently,
   the binding modes of the agonists Hist, 2-MeHist and 2-PhHist and the
   H-1-antagonist cyproheptadine were evaluated in three different
   seven-alpha-helical models of the H-1-receptor built in homology with
   bacteriorhodopsin, but using three different alignments. Our findings
   suggest that the position of the carboxylate group of Asp(116) (TM3)
   within the receptor pocket depends on whether an agonist or an
   antagonist binds to the protein; a conformational change of this
   aspartate residue upon agonist binding is expected to play an essential
   role in receptor stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Oviduct epithelial cells (OEC) increasingly are used to support
   embryonic development and to study gamete interactions with the female
   reproductive tract in vitro. This series of experiments was designed to
   characterize monolayers derived from oviduct epithelium. Epithelial
   cells harvested from the isthmus and ampulla of the oviducts of five
   estrous mares were cultured with or without the basal lamina extract,
   Matrigel. Within each group OEC were cultured in the presence of either
   estradiol-17 beta or a carrier control. All groups were subcultured
   three times. Epithelial cell morphology and function were examined by
   microscopy, analysis of secreted proteins, and immunocytochemistry.
   Epithelial cells attached more rapidly and reached confluence sooner
   when cultured on Matrigel than in uncoated wells. Cells showed variable
   evidence of ciliary activity up to 12 days in primary culture. Cells
   grown on Matrigel had a more polarized appearance in primary culture
   than those in uncoated wells, although no morphologic difference between
   anatomic site of origin or between steroid treated groups was noted.
   Anatomic site of origin had no effect, and steroid treatment had minimal
   effects, on patterns of secreted proteins. However, some differences
   were noted in protein secretion between cells grown with or without
   Matrigel. These data suggest that culture substrate may affect structure
   and function of OEC monolayers. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model, based on unsaturated zone water and solute
   balances, was developed to describe the uptake of saline groundwater by
   plants in dry regions. It was assumed that: i. initially, the profile
   had low water and salt contents to some depth; ii. both water and
   solutes move upwards from the water table by piston flow due only to
   plant water extraction; iii, the uptake of water concentrates solutes in
   the soil solution until some threshold salinity is reached, above which
   plants can no longer extract water due to osmotic effects; iv. uptake of
   the groundwater does not affect the water table level; and v. uptake of
   groundwater is only limited by transmission of groundwater through the
   soil, Model predictions were compared with measurements of groundwater
   uptake made over 15 months at five sites in a Eucalyptus forest in a
   semi-arid area, using independently measured model parameters. Depth and
   salinity of groundwater, and soil type varied greatly between sites.
   Predicted groundwater uptake rates were close to measured values,
   generally being within similar to 0.1 mm day(-1). Sensitivity analysis
   showed that groundwater depth and salinity were the main controls on
   uptake of groundwater, while soil properties appeared to have a lesser
   effect. The model showed that uptake of groundwater would result in
   complete salinisation of the soil profile within 4 to 30 yr at the sites
   studied, unless salts were leached from the soil by rainfall or flood
   waters. However, a relatively small amount of annual leaching may be
   sufficient to allow groundwater uptake to continue. Thus groundwaters,
   even when saline, may be important sources of water to plants in arid
   and semi-arid areas.}},

Abstract = {{Nodulated plants of Ulex europaeus L. (gorse) were grown over two
   seasons in sand. Nutrients were supplied as solutions containing either
   0.25 mol m(-3) NO3-, 5.0 mol m(-3) NO3-, 0.25 mol m(-3) NH4+ or 5.0 mol
   m(-3) NH4+, as Ca(NO3)(2) or (NH4)(2)SO4. In the first season all
   nitrogen (N) was enriched with N-15 to 5 atom \%. In the second season
   half the plants received the same solution, while the remaining plants
   received a similar solution in terms of form and amount of nitrogen but
   at natural abundance. Throughout the second season eight destructive
   harvests were performed. Plants were separated into roots, nodules,
   previous season's shoot, new shoot and flowers, and then analysed for
   total N and N-15 content. This allowed estimates to be made of total
   root N uptake, N-2 fixation and the contribution of re-mobilization to
   the nitrogen content of new shoot growth in the second season. The main
   source of N was N-2 fixation for plants receiving a low supply of N and
   root uptake for plants receiving a high supply of N. Plants supplied
   high NH4+ stored more N over winter than did plants given other
   treatments. The proportion of over-wintering stores that were
   re-mobilized to support spring shoot growth was unaffected by the
   capacity of the plants for N-2 fixation.}},

Abstract = {{The commonly held perspective of wetland habitats in planned landscapes
   has shifted from areas requiring drainage and fill to valuable habitat
   providing benefits to society. This shift in perspective has given rise
   to federal, state and local wetland protection efforts, but planners,
   landscape architects and engineers have yet to integrate wetland
   habitats into communities and planned landscapes. In fact, many of the
   practices employed by land planners to address wetland protection are
   all too often creating ecological traps that do more harm than good.
   Complicating the integration of wetland habitats into communities is the
   public preference for certain types of natural landscapes. In response
   to this stated aesthetic preference, landscape management practices
   intended to improve the appearance of wetland habitats actually destroy
   valuable breeding sites, and food and cover for numerous birds, mammals,
   reptiles and amphibians. With careful planning, design, implementation,
   and public education, wetland habitats can be fully integrated into
   planned landscapes without destroying valuable benefits provided by
   wetland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency of metastasis to the spine in the population of patients
   suffering from malignant disease is a significant clinical problem, as
   these patients present with intractable pain and neurologic impairment.
   The sequelae of metastatic tumors to the spinal column significantly
   decrease the quality of the patient's life. With the advent of modern
   chemotherapeutic regimens in metastatic disease, patients with
   metastatic tumors are living longer and more productive lives. The goal
   of surgical management of this problem is to increase the quality of the
   patient's life, and not longevity. The immediate technical goals are
   resection of the pathological segment, restoration of load bearing
   capacity for mobilization of the patient, and decompression of
   compromised neural structures, as well as maintenance of spinal
   stability to decrease pain and increase the patient's qualify of life
   during the terminal stages. This is a series of 28 patients with
   metastatic tumors to the spine, with an average age of 61.5 years,
   ranging from 25-81 years of age. Within this population there were 11
   different tumor types. The postoperative survivorship was an average of
   6.4 months. Twenty patients in this series had an anterior procedure
   alone using a combination of Methylmethacrylate and inexpensive plate
   fixation. Six patients required an anterior/posterior procedure for
   circumferential spinal compression and instability. These techniques
   provide immediate spinal stability for rapid mobilization of the
   patient. Twenty-four patients in the series had significant pain relief,
   and 17 experienced neurologic improvement. The approach to decompression
   and stabilization with a combination of inexpensive AO DCP plates, GASP
   plate, and AO cervical spine locking plate in combination with
   Polymethylmethacrylate provides very inexpensive implants when compared
   with other available spinal systems. They are effective in meeting the
   goal of spinal stability, as there were no implant failures in this
   series; and this style of fixation does not require a postoperative
   brace.}},

   have been characterized. The presence of a highly conserved

Abstract = {{In a series of nine experiments, observers were required to identify the
   shapes of moving targets, and to discriminate regions of motion from
   regions of uncorrelated noise, Maximum displacement thresholds (D-max)
   for performing these tasks were obtained under a wide variety of
   conditions, The stimulus parameters manipulated included the number of
   distinct frames in the motion sequences, the stimulus onset asynchrony
   between each frame, the size of the moving dots, and the shape, area and
   eccentricity of the target regions, For two-frame displays presented in
   alternation, the area of the target region was the only one of these
   variables to have any significant effect on D-max. For longer length
   sequences, in contrast, D-max varied dramatically among the different
   conditions over a range of 10 min are to 10 deg, In an effort to isolate
   the specific processes of spatiotemporal integration, we also examined
   how performance is affected by having overlapping transparent motions in
   opposite directions, or by the presence of dynamic noise or limited dot
   lifetimes within the moving target regions, The overall pattern of
   results suggest that D-max is primarily determined by the ability of the
   visual system to isolate motion signals from the noise produced by
   spurious false target correlations, As a general rule, D-max will
   increase as a result of any stimulus manipulation that increases the
   number of local signal correlations detected relative to those arising
   from noise, and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin (5-HT) is an important mediator of allergic airway narrowing
   in several animal species. The present study was designed to
   characterize the receptor subtypes that mediate 5-HT-induced airway
   responses in the rat. To do this, we measured Ca2+ transients and
   adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production evoked by 5-HT in
   cultured rat tracheal smooth muscle cells as well as 5-HT-induced
   contractions of isolated tracheal rings. 5-HT (10(-6) to 10(-4) M)
   triggered a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
   ({[}Ca2+](i)) followed by a second phase of sustained, elevated, and
   sometimes oscillating levels of {[}Ca2+](i). Sustained but not peak
   {[}Ca2+](i) levels were dependent on Ca2+ influx but were not attenuated
   by nifedipine (10(-5) M). Oscillations were observed in cells in
   Ca2+-free medium, suggesting Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release independent of
   Ca2+-influx. The effects of 5-HT were inhibited by thapsigargin (10(-6)
   M) and ketanserin (10(-7) M). In cells incubated with LY-278,584 (5-HT3
   antagonist) and (-)pindolol (5-HT1 antagonist), 5-HT-evoked responses
   were not significantly different from the control values.
   5-methyltryptamine (5-MT), a ligand with higher affinity for 5-HT2c
   receptors than `'classical'' 5-HT2 receptors, elicited higher responses
   than dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (DP-5-CT), which possesses lower
   affinity for 5-HT2c receptors than 5-MT, butan affinity for the
   classical 5-HT2 receptor similar to 5-MT. 5-HT (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) had
   no effect on basal levels of cAMP, and 10(-6) M 5-HT did not change
   forskolin-induced elevations of cAMP in the presence or absence of
   (-)pindolol. 5-HT increased isometric force of tracheal rings in a
   concentration-dependent manner. Ketanserin (10 (-7) M) caused 100\%
   relaxation and (-)pindolol caused 40\% relaxation of rings precontracted
   with 5 x 10(-6) M 5-HT. Our data suggest that in rat airway 5-HT acts
   via 5-HT2c-like receptors expressed on smooth muscle cells, causing Ca2+
   release from intracellular stores, followed by Ca2+ influx, possibly
   through Ca2+ release-activated channels.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the mechanism of diamond-like film deposition in a
   r.f. discharge in methane, a tiny glass fiber was spanned along the
   discharge axis and perpendicular to the parallel-plate electrodes. The
   discharge was operated in a symmetric and slightly asymmetric regime.
   The film thickness and its surface topography were analyzed by means of
   scanning electron microscopy. Across the interelectrode space a
   non-uniform film thickness distribution on the fiber was observed. The
   films up to 15 mu m were deposited with excellent coverage uniformity
   and time stability on a 40 mu m diameter glass fiber substrate. The film
   thickness distribution along the fiber is the result of the
   space-dependent density profile of methyl CH3 radicals which contribute
   mostly to the film formation. It was concluded that the diffusion of
   methyl radicals in the discharge is responsible for the observed film
   thickness profile along the fiber.}},

Abstract = {{Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and mass in plasma and their increase

   population-based age- and sex-matched control subjects without coronary
   heart disease to study the relations between these parameters in plasma
   and their correlations with plasma lipoproteins in subjects with a wide
   range Of lipoprotein and LPL levels. There was a relatively large amount
   of LPL protein compared with LPL activity in preheparin plasma,
   indicating that the majority of circulating LPL is catalytically
   inactive. LPL mass and activity in postheparin plasma (postheparin minus
   preheparin values) were highly correlated. and the calculated mean
   specific activity (0.35 mU/ng) was in the range expected for
   catalytically active LPL. Hence, heparin releases mainly active LPL. The
   four LPL parameters (mass and activity in plasma and their increase
   after heparin administration) were not related to each other: except for
   postheparin plasma LPL mass and activity, and they showed different
   correlations with plasma lipoprotein lipid concentrations. There was a
   strong positive correlation between LPL mass in preheparin plasma and
   the HDL cholesterol level as well as weak negative relations to VLDL
   triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in the patients. In
   contrast, preheparin LPL activity showed no correlation with the HDL
   cholesterol level but weak positive relations to VLDL triglyceride and
   cholesterol concentrations in the control subjects. Postheparin plasma
   LPL activity related positively to the HDL cholesterol level and
   negatively to the VLDL triglyceride concentration in the control
   subjects. Case subjects differed from control subjects in that they had
   higher preheparin plasma LPL activity and a tendency toward lower
   specific activity of postheparin plasma LPL. The different relations of
   the measured LPL parameters to plasma lipoproteins and the difference in
   preheparin plasma LPL activity between patients and control subjects
   might reflect a disturbance of the LPL system in the patients.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Determination of within-subject day-to-day coefficients of
   variations (CV) of 24-h measurements of spontaneous physical activity
   (SPA), macronutrient oxidation, energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate
   (HR).
   DESIGN: Two 24-h measurements in respiration chamber, separated by 14
   days of strict weight stability.
   SUBJECTS: 22 healthy obese subjects, 15 females and seven males (age
   27-64 y, BMI: 30-39 kg/m(2)).
   MEASUREMENTS: SPA assessed by microwave radar, substrate oxidation and
   EE measured by indirect calorimetry and heart rate measured by
   telemetry.
   RESULTS: For 24-h measurements CV was 0.8\% for RQ, 6.7\% for fat
   oxidation, 5.6\% for carbohydrate oxidation, 14.5\% for protein
   oxidation, and 4.3\% for heart rate. SPA assessed by microwave radar was
   also reproducible (CV = 9.7\%), Within-subject day-to-day coefficients
   of variations (CV) were 1.5 and 1.8\% for 24-h EE and sleeping EE, and
   4.1\% for RMR. Both on day 1 and 14, 93.4\% of the variation in 24-h EE
   could be explained by differences in fat-free mass (92.3 and 92.4\%,
   respectively) and SPA (1.1 and 1.0\%, respectively). Also the algorithm
   and correlation between 24-h RQ and 24-h energy balance were highly
   reproducible (r = 0.56, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Both macronutrient oxidation, SPA and EE in obese patients
   can be determined with high reproducibility in a respiration chamber.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms underlying defibrillation threshold reduction with biphasic
   waveforms remain unclear. The interaction of local shock-induced voltage
   gradients, which change with distance from the shocking electrode, and
   the slate of membrane repolarization results in different cellular
   responses that may influence the success of defibrillation. We used
   intracellular microelectrodes and S1S2 pacing protocols in myocardial
   cell aggregates to determine the effects of shock intensity and waveform
   on refractory period responses during simulated fibrillation (3 s of S-1
   pacing at 180-ms cycle length). We simulated defibrillation by electric
   field stimulation S-2 using 8-ms monophasic (MS?) and 4/4 biphasic (BS2)
   waveforms (65\% total tilt) delivered at intensities of 1.5, 3, and 5
   times S-1 diastolic threshold, or approximate to 2 to 7 V/cm. Responses
   following MS(2) varied with S-2 intensity and coupling interval
   (P<.001). When averaged over the last 10 ms of the refractory period,
   MS(2) produced a negligible response (8.8+/-1.4 ms) at 1.5 times
   diastolic threshold and a prolonged response (53.0+/-3.1 ms) at 5 times
   diastolic threshold (P<.01). In contrast, BS2 response duration did not
   change significantly (P=NS) between 1.5 times diastolic threshold
   (35.1+/-12.6 ms) and 5 times diastolic threshold (46.2+/-2.7 ms). Our
   results suggest that biphasic waveforms not only prolong response
   duration at low shock intensity but reduce dispersion of refractoriness
   produced by differing local potential gradients generated by
   defibrillation shocks compared with monophasic waveforms. Preventing
   dispersion of refractoriness and prolonging shock-induced responses may
   improve biphasic waveform efficacy at low shock intensity.}},

Abstract = {{The pressure threshold for injury of pulmonary capillaries is
   approximate to 50 to 55 cm H2O in the canine lung, as measured by
   changes in the filtration coefficient (K-f,K-c). Since the pulmonary
   endothelial basement membrane has been observed to thicken in patients
   with heart failure and pulmonary venous hypertension, we hypothesized
   that both baseline permeability and the threshold for
   high-vascular-pressure injury would be altered as a result. Dogs (n=12)
   were chronically paced at 245 beats per minute for approximate to 4
   weeks, then were paced at 225 beats per minute for an additional 3
   weeks. Lung lobes from anesthetized paced dogs and additional control
   dogs (n=14) were then isolated, ventilated, and perfused with blood.
   Although vascular resistance was increased nearly threefold and vascular
   compliance reduced by 50\% in the paced group, K-f,K-c referenced to 1 g
   blood-free dry weight was no different from control. Despite this lack
   of difference at normal pulmonary vascular pressures, several
   significant results were obtained. First, in the paced group there was a
   significant increase in the threshold for high-vascular-pressure injury:
   K-f,K-c measured at pulmonary vascular pressures commonly seen in heart
   failure (20 to 50 cm H2O) were significantly less in this group compared
   with control. Model predictions showed that in vivo, this difference in
   K-f,K-c would result in a 50\% reduction in the amount of water and
   protein cleared across the pulmonary capillary endothelial barrier in
   the paced group. Next, challenge with high vascular pressure resulted in
   less accumulation of residual blood in this group compared with control.
   Finally, in separate groups of animals, morphometric analysis of the
   alveolocapillary barrier showed that after either 4 or 7 to 8 weeks of
   pacing, endothelial, interstitial, and epithelial thicknesses were
   increased compared with control. Together, these results suggest that
   vascular remodeling confers a modest but important increase in the
   resistance of these lungs to high-vascular-pressure injury and the
   development of alveolar edema.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the contribution of the epiblast cell behavior to the
   primitive streak formation, we examined the motility of a single
   epiblast cell from pre-streak stage embryo in vitro. On the substratum
   that was evenly coated with laminin gel, epiblast cells attached well to
   the gel and one or a few very long and broad cellular processes
   protruded from their spherical cell bodies; however, they hardly
   locomoted on it. Unexpectedly, after overnight culture, half of the
   single cells dissolved the laminin gel beneath them to make well-like
   holes, and invaded in the holes. On the substratum lined parallel with
   the fibrous laminin gels supplemented with fibronectin, they locomoted
   actively in accordance with the alignment. That is, they were subjected
   to contact guidance. In locomotion they looked like snails, extending
   one or a few long and broad processes in a forward direction from the
   spherical cell bodies. However, on the substratum lined with laminin or
   fibronectin only, they did not locomote actively. Individual chick
   pre-streak epiblast cells had already been committed to invade, and
   their migratory nature existed in each cell, even though they were
   isolated from the epithelial sheet. The implication of these findings on
   the cellular basis of primitive streak formation will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Troglobites - cave restricted species - are good models for
   chronobiological studies focusing on the functions of circadian
   rhythmicity since they provide a test for hypotheses on external versus
   internal selection. Cases of reduction in the circadian components of
   activity have been reported for cave fishes, beetles, and crustaceans,
   but the methods of data analysis are not fully comparable. We present
   the results of spectral analysis of locomotor activity in two species of
   troglobitic catfishes: the less specialized Pimelodella kronei (compared
   to its eyed close relative, P. transitoria) and a highly specialized
   Imparfinis, undescribed species. The activity of seven specimens of P.
   transitoria, nine of P. kronei, and six of Imparfinis sp, was
   automatically recorded in an infra-red photocell device, for four to ten
   consecutive days, under constant darkness. All the eyed catfishes showed
   significant free-running circadian components, as did seven P. kronei
   and three Imparfinis specimens. Variable ultradian and infradian rhythms
   were detected. These data suggest a regression of circadian rhythmicity
   in part of the blind populations. Some hypotheses may account for the
   persistence of circadian rhythms in these cave fishes: 1) Evolutionary
   time in isolation has not been sufficient to genetically fix this
   regression throughout the population (specially for P. kronei); 2)
   `'Zeitgebers'' such as temperature oscillations (for P. kronei) and
   light-dark cycles (for Imparfinis sp.) are acting over part of these
   populations; 3) It is the expression of the selective value of a
   mechanism insuring periodic movements to and from the cave (for P.
   kronei); 4) Circadian rhythmicity has been preserved due to its role in
   the maintenance of internal temporal order.}},

Abstract = {{Liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) respond to many stimulations with the
   production of bioactive substances including cytokines, eicosanoids, and
   inorganic radicals, In this study the activation of transcription
   factors by substances inducing cytokine gene expression or superoxide
   formation in rat Kupffer cells was examined. Using primary cultures of
   rat Kupffer cells the role of NF-kappa B and activator protein 1 (AP-1)
   in the expression of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene by
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated. Both transcription factors
   were strongly activated but with different kinetics, Maximal DNA-binding
   activity was induced with 50 ng of LPS/mL of medium and persisted for at
   least 24 hours, At that time, NF-kappa B as well as AP-1-DNA complexes
   decreased their mobilities in native gels. Among the cytokines tested
   only TNF-alpha and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were
   able to activate NF-kappa B in Kupffer cells. Phorbol ester and zymosan
   activated AP-1 but not NF-kappa B; the treatment of zymosan yielding a
   modified form of AP-1. Of ah substances found to interfere with
   TNF-alpha production by Kupffer cells (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate,
   dexamethasone, prostaglandin E(2), interleukin {[}IL]-4, IL-10, and
   transforming growth factor-beta {[}TGF-beta]) only pyrrolidine
   dithiocarbamate was able to completely inhibit the activation of
   NF-kappa B by LPS, Although not abrogating the LPS activation of
   NF-kappa B, dexamethasone inhibited that of AP-1. The results indicate a
   direct participation of NF-kappa B in the regulation of TNF-alpha
   synthesis and a differential effeet of LPS on NF-KB and AP-1,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades there has been increasing interest in the
   formation of ordered organic multilayers by the Langmuir-Blodgett
   technique, by self-assembly, by evaporation of amphiphilic materials in
   vacuo and by various other methods. A variety of applications of such
   films has been proposed and many model devices constructed.
   This article reviews the various techniques which can be used to form
   ordered multilayers and the methods which can be used to characterise
   the degree of order obtained. Possible applications are only touched on
   lightly as this aspect of the subject has received considerable
   attention elsewhere.
   The author gives a personal view of likely developments in the light of
   recent work published up to the end of the year 1994.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of interferon are seen in only a limited number of patients
   with hepatitis C virus (HCV) of the K1 type, indicating that a
   combination therapy with other antiviral drugs may be essential to
   obtain better results. In the present pilot study, the effects of
   combination therapy with interferon (IFN) and an antiviral drug
   azidothymidine (AZT) were analyzed. The combination therapy was
   conducted in 22 patients with chronic hepatitis C after obtaining their
   informed consent (combination group). Three or six million units of
   natural IFN alpha was administered daily for 3 weeks and then three
   times a week for 21 weeks. Combination therapy was initiated at the
   beginning of the 8th week of IFN treatment, 500 mg of AZT per day being
   given for 8 weeks. As a control, changes in HCV-RNA were also analyzed
   in patients treated with interferon alone (IFN-alone group). At the end
   of the treatment, blood was negative for HCV in 32.5\% of the IFN-alone
   group and in 50.0\% of the combination group, the difference not being
   significant. However, in patients with HCV-K1, HCV-negative rates were
   14.2\% in the IFN-alone group and 45.5\% in the combination group,
   showing a significant difference. In patients with other HCV genotypes,
   HCV-negative rates did not different between the two groups. These
   results suggest that combination therapy with IFN and AZT may be an
   effective treatment for chronic type C hepatitis caused by the K1 type
   virus, although further studies on larger number of patients will be
   needed to obtain definite conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The thrombospondins are a family of related glycoproteins found in the
   embryonic extracellular matrix. To date, five members of this family
   have been identified. Thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 have similar
   primary structure, but are expressed in different tissues at different
   times during development. Thrombospondins-3, -4, and cartilage
   oligomeric protein belong to a second thrombospondin subgroup in which
   the carboxyl-half of each molecule is most similar to thrombospondin-1
   and -2. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of a novel probe to
   avian thrombospondin-4. We have used this probe to determine the origins
   of thrombospondin-4 in the chick embryo by in situ hybridization.
   Thrombospondin-4 transcripts first appear in the mesenchyme surrounding
   bone anlage coinciding with the initial stages of osteogenesis. The
   expression in osteogenic tissues is transient: thrombospondin-4 mRNAs
   are not seen in the osteoblasts of bone collars in developing long
   bones. This pattern is distinct from avian thrombospondin-2, which is
   expressed in perichondrium and embryonic fibrous connective tissues. Our
   observations indicate that connective tissues are the principal site of
   thrombospondin-4 expression in the chick. The diverse origins of
   different thrombospondin gene family members imply distinctive roles for
   these proteins related to the growth and differentiation of cartilage,
   tendons, and bone. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In 3 experiments the authors examined the effects of surface shape on
   the detection of surfaces in structure from motion displays.  In
   Experiment 1 they found the number of points necessary to distinguish
   simple quadratic surfaces from points randomly placed in a volume to be
   low, in the range of 4-6 points.  In Experiment 2 they found that a
   hyperbolic shape is harder to detect than an arch or parabolic shape and
   that more curved shapes are easier to detect than less curved shapes. 
   In Experiment 3 they found that detection of sinusoidal shapes increases
   with increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency, confirming previous
   results with motion parallax displays.  This pattern of results is
   consistent with a model in which triangular surface patches are fit
   through adjacent triples of points and displays with smaller mean
   orientation changes between neighboring triangles are judged to be
   surface displays.}},

Abstract = {{Although absence of the coronary sinus is widely recognized in hearts
   with isomerism of the right atrial appendages, little attention has been
   paid to the fashion of the venous return from the heart itself, In this
   study, the arrangement of coronary venous return was investigated in 99
   specimens with isomeric right and 49 with isomeric left appendages, In
   the normal heart, the coronary veins consist of a circumflex component
   within the atrioventricular groove and longitudinal components on the
   ventricular mass, The circumflex venous system was seen in 44 hearts
   with isomerism of left appendages (90\%), but 23 of these hearts lacked
   the anatomic features of the coronary sinus, Circumflex veins were
   entirely lacking in the other 10\% of hearts with isomeric left
   appendages and in all those with isomeric right appendages, In these
   hearts, longitudinal veins drained independently into the atria in three
   patterns, The first was a direct connection, with the venous orifice
   opening between the trabeculations of the atrial wall immediately having
   crossed the atrioventricular groove, The second was a crooked return,
   with the vein running an intramural course along the atrioventricular
   groove. The third was a distant connection, reaching superiorly to the
   smooth-walled atrial component after running an intramural course.
   Intramural courses were seen in 19\% of the longitudinal veins, such
   veins being found in 62\% of all hearts with no circumflex venous
   system, These findings, which to the best of our knowledge have never
   previously been recognized in detail, almost certainly have potential
   surgical significance.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated 37 cases of coronary angiography in patients undergoing
   carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The severity of coronary stenosis was
   estimated by Gesini's scoring system. There was no correlation between
   the severity of carotid stenosis and that of coronary stenosis, but
   those patients who had a history of coronary artery disease, carotid
   bruit or intracranial artery stenoses presented significant severe
   coronary stenosis in most cases. Even in the patients who had no history
   of coronary artery disease (n = 26), 13 patients (50\%) had stenotic
   lesions shown by coronary angiography.
   Eight patients required treatment for their coronary stenotic lesions: 5
   were treated with percutaneuos transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
   and 3 with coronary artery bypass grafting.
   Intraoperative occlusion tests monitored by EEG and SEP showed abnormal
   findings in 6 CEA operations. One of these patients received PTCA before
   CEA, and had a good clinical course during and after the CEA procedure.
   In conclusion, in patients undergoing CEA there is frequently

Abstract = {{The concept of a reversible desensitization of the myocardial
   contractile apparatus for calcium by 2,3 Butanedione Monoxime (BDM) as a
   method to improve the myocardium's tolerance to cold ischemia was
   evaluated in normal pig hearts (n = 14). The results were compared to
   those obtained after application of Bretschneider's HTK cardioplegic
   solution.
   Methods: Series I) After BDM treatment (concentrations: 0-30 mmol/L) the
   isometric force output and the intracellular calcium transients
   (measured using the FURA-2 ratio method) of electrically driven (1 Hz)
   isolated left-ventricular muscle strips excised from beating pig hearts
   (n = 14) were recorded simultaneously in order to analyse the mode of
   action of BDM; Series II) The cardioprotective effects of BDM (30
   mmol/L) and Bretschneider's cardioplegic solution (HTK) were compared in
   a large-animal model: after `'in situ perfusion'' of pig hearts with
   either 2000 ml ice-cold BDM solution (30 mmol/L) (n = 7) or 2000 ml HTK
   (n = 7) the hearts were explanted and stored at 4 degrees C in the same
   solutions for up to 42 h. The contractile properties of muscle fibres,
   excised after storage periods of 8, 24, and 42 h from these hearts were
   analyzed in terms of isometric force development and isotonic
   shortening. 280 muscle fibres from 14 pigs were used for measurements.
   Results: Series I) In pig myocardium a dose-dependent reduction of
   isometric force development was found after BDM application. The shape
   and the amplitude of the intracellular calcium transient were also
   affected by BDM. At 30 mmol/L BDM no force development could be elicited
   despite the presence of an intracellular calcium transient (amplitude <
   70 \% of the control). Series II) Shortening, calcium transient, and
   force of left-ventricular muscle strips of pig myocardium excised after
   storage periods for up to 42 h showed complete recovery when BDM was
   applied. In contrast HTK perfusion allowed complete recovery of these
   parameters when the storage period did not exceed 6 hours.
   Conclusion: Under the given experimental conditions reversible
   desensitization of the contractile apparatus for calcium results in a
   considerable prolongation of the tolerance to cold ischemia in explanted
   pig hearts. The present study shows that the protective effects of BDM
   are not only present when isolated muscle fibres were stored (and the
   extracellular space is large) but also after storage of complete hearts
   in a solution containing BDM. Thus BDM may become a useful agent to
   enlarge the storage period of donor hearts in heart transplantation
   considerably.}},

   RAD27/ERC11/YKL510, the yeast homolog of the gene encoding flap
   endonuclease 1,FEN-1. cln1 cln2 rad27/erc11 cells arrest in S phase;
   this cell cycle arrest is suppressed by the expression of CLN1 or CLN2
   but not by that of CLN3 or the hyperactive CLN3-2, rad27/erc11 mutants
   are also defective in DNA damage repair, as determined by their
   increased sensitivity to a DNA-damaging agent, increased mitotic
   recombination rates, and increased spontaneous mutation rates, Unlike
   the block in cell cycle progression, these phenotypes are not suppressed
   by CLN1 or CLN2. CLN1 and CLN2 may activate an RAD27/ERC11-independent
   pathway specific for DNA synthesis that CLN3 is incapable of activating,
   Alternatively, CLN1 and CLN2 may be capable of overriding a checkpoint
   response which otherwise causes cln1 cln2 rad27/erc11 cells to arrest,
   These results imply that CLN1 and CLN2 have a role in the regulation of
   DNA replication. Consistent with this, GAL-CLN1 expression in
   checkpoint-deficient, mec1-1 mutant cells results in both cell death and
   increased chromosome loss among survivors, suggesting that CLN1
   overexpression either activates defective DNA replication or leads to
   insensitivity to DNA damage.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle force is proportional to the physiological cross-sectional area
   (PCSA), and muscle velocity and excursion are proportional to the fiber
   length. The length of the sarcomeres is a major determinant of both
   force and velocity. The goal of this study was to characterize the
   architecture of the human pterygoid muscles and to evaluate possible
   functional consequences for muscle force and muscle velocity. For the
   heads of the lateral and medial pterygoid, the length of sarcomeres and
   of fiber bundles, the PCSA, and the three-dimensional coordinates of
   origin and insertion points were determined. Measurements were taken
   from eight cadavers, and the data were used as input for a model
   predicting sarcomere length and active muscle force as a function of
   mandibular position. At the closed-jaw position, sarcomeres in the
   lateral pterygoid (inferior head, 2.83 +/- 0.1 mu m; superior head, 2.72
   +/- 0.11 mu m) were significantly longer than those in the medial
   pterygoid (anterior head, 2.48 +/- 0.36 mu m; posterior head, 2.54 +/-
   0.38 mu m). With these initial lengths, the jaw angle at which the
   muscles were capable of producing maximum active force was estimated to
   be between 5 degrees and 10 degrees. The lateral pterygoid was
   characterized by relatively long fibers (inferior, 23 +/- 2.7 mm;
   superior, 21.4 +/- 2.2 mm) and a small PCSA (inferior, 2.82 +/- 0.66
   cm(2); superior, 0.95 +/- 0.35 cm(2)), whereas the medial pterygoid had
   relatively short fibers (anterior, 13.5 +/- 1.9 mm; posterior, 12.4 +/-
   1.5 mm) and a large PCSA (anterior, 2.47 +/- 0.57 cm(2); posterior, 3.53
   +/- 0.97 cm(2)). The mechanical consequence is that the lateral
   pterygoid is capable of producing 1.7 times larger displacements and
   velocities than the medial pterygoid, whereas the medial pterygoid is
   capable of producing 1.6 times higher forces. The model showed that jaw
   movement had a different effect on active force production in the
   muscles.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage-dependent K+ channels in the basolateral membrane of hair cells
   in guinea-pig cochlea might contribute to the non-linear current-voltage
   relationships in these hair cells and, thereby, to generation of the
   extracellular summating potential (SP). To evaluate the role of K+
   channels in the generation of the SP the perilymphatic perfusion
   technique was used to introduce the K+-channel blocker
   tetraethylammonium (TEA) into the cochlea. Sound-evoked cochlear
   potentials were measured subsequently. Without blocking nerve activity
   TEA induced reversible shifts of the SP in the negative direction,
   irrespective of whether we recorded from scala vestibuli or scala
   tympani. Shifts in the negative direction were probably due to TEA
   acting directly on the afferent fibres, since removal of nerve activity
   by the potent Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) prevented TEA from
   shifting the SP in the negative direction. Once nerve activity had been
   removed by TTX, administration of TEA caused a small decrease in the
   magnitude of the SP, both in scala vestibuli and in scala tympani,
   irrespective of its polarity. The decrease was significant for the
   highest test frequencies only (8-12 kHz), and completely reversible. The
   rapidly activated K+ channel in the inner hair cell (IHC) is probably
   blocked by TEA and this blocking might be responsible for the small
   decrease in magnitude of the SP. The asymmetric contribution from this
   K+ channel to the IHC's current-voltage relationship seems to be only
   partly responsible for the generation of the SP, since blocking of this
   K+ channel with TEA caused relatively small decreases in the amplitude
   of the SP. TEA did not affect the endocochlear potential.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviridae
   demonstrate a strong preference for the A-nucleotide, which can account
   for up to 40\% of the viral RNA genome. The biological mechanism
   responsible for this nucleotide bias is currently unknown. The increased
   A-content of these viral genomes corresponds to the typical use of
   synonymous codons by all members of the lentiviral family (HIV, SIV,
   BIV, FIV, CAEV, EIAV, visna) and the human spuma retrovirus, but not by
   other retroviruses like the human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and
   HTLV-II. In this article, we analyzed A-bias for all codon groups in all
   open reading frames of several lentiviruses. The extent of lentiviral
   codon bias could be related to host cellular translation. By calculating
   codon bias indices (CBIs), we were able to demonstrate an inverse
   correlation between the extent of codon bias and the rate of translation
   of individual reading frames in these viruses. Specifically, the shift
   toward A-rich codons is more pronounced in pol than in gag lentiviral
   genes. Since it is known that Gag synthesis exceeds Pol synthesis by a
   factor of 20 due to infrequent ribosomal frame-shifting during
   translation of the gap-pol mRNA molecule, we propose that the
   aminoacyl-tRNA availability in the host cell restricts the lentiviral
   preference for A-rich codons. In addition, less A-nucleotides were found
   in regions of the viral genome encoding multiple functions; e.g.,
   overlapping reading flames (tat-rev-env) or in genes that overlap
   regulatory sequences (nef-LTR region). Finally, the characteristics of
   lentiviral codon usage are presented as a phylogenetic tree without the
   need for prior sequence alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was used to examine genetic variation and
   population structnre of screwworm flies in foul populations from Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil. The total DNA of 405 individuals was digested with
   15 restriction endonucleases and probed with five cloned HindIII
   fragments representing the entire mitochondrial genome of Cochliomyia
   hominivorax. The survey revealed that four enzymes (HaeIII, HindIII,
   MspI, and PvuII) were suitable to detect mtDNA variation among all
   populations. Based on the fragment patterns obtained for these four
   enzymes, a total of 15 haplotypes in combination was detected.
   Heteroplasmic individuals for the PvuII pattern were obtained in one of
   the populations. The estimated average for nucleotide sequence
   divergence (delta) was 0.92\%. The cladogram of the geographical
   distribution among the observed haplotypes suggests that the sampled
   screwworms probably belong to a single evolutionary lineage with
   populations interconnected by reduced gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The biochemical properties of several pp60(v-src) substrates believed to
   participate in src-mediated transformation were examined in cells
   expressing a kinase-active, transformation-defective v-src allele
   (v-src-F172 Delta/Y416F) and its parental allele, v-src-F172 Delta, a
   host-range-dependent allele that transforms chicken cells to a fusiform
   morphology, but does not transform rat cells. Because pp60(v-src-F172
   Delta) is dependent on autophosphorylation for transforming ability,
   these alleles provide a unique opportunity to examine the role of
   pp60(v-src) autophosphorylation in regulating substrate interactions.
   Increased pp125(FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation and high levels of
   ppb0(v-src)-associated phosphotidylinositol-3' kinase activity were
   detected specifically in chicken cells exhibiting round, refractile
   transformation but not in cells transformed to a fusiform morphology.
   Increased pp125(FAK) kinase activity, but not increased pp125(FAK)
   tyrosine-phosphorylation correlated with pp60(v-src) autophosphorylation
   and increased anchorage-independent growth. Thus, pp125(FAK) and PI3'K
   may participate in morphological transformation by v-src. Furthermore,
   association of phosphorylated SHC with the adapter GRB2 correlated with
   increased anchorage-independent growth (and autophosphorylation) in both
   rat and chicken cells independent of the morphological phenotype
   induced. Therefore, host-range dependence for transformation may he
   regulated through association of SHC with GRB2 thus implicating SHC as a
   crucial substrate for src-dependent transformation.}},

   100 amino acids were detected, all of which are completely confined to
   the 12 . 5 kbp region. Two ORFs (D1271 and D1286) correspond to
   previously sequenced genes (PPH22 and VMA1 or TFP1, respectively). ORF
   D1298 shows the characteristics of alpha-isopropylmalate and homocitrate

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Breakage rates of particles in a ball mill change with instantaneous
   particle size distribution in the mill. Slurry density and the presence
   of a grinding aid also affect breakage rates substantially. The effect
   of these variables, which constitute the mill environment, on breakage
   rates has been quantified with a unique estimation method known as the
   G-H method. This method enables the estimation of breakage rates of all
   size intervals by a simple linear graphical scheme. In general, breakage
   rates of coarse particles increase in the presence of fine particles,
   while the rates of fine particles remain relatively unaffected. Grinding
   aid restores the fluidity of the solid-liquid mixture even at very high
   percent solids and so the rate of grinding returns to `normal' from
   `erratic' behavior.}},

   patients had a distinctive clinical pattern compared with the other 120

   more rapid onset of weakness (3.9 versus 6.1 days, P = 0.002), an
   earlier nadir (6.3 versus 9.1 days, P < 0.001), an initially predominant
   distal weakness (67\% versus 27\%, P < 0.001), sparing of the cranial
   nerves (26\% versus 68\%, P < 0.001) and the disease was more often
   preceded by a gastro-intestinal illness (41\% versus 13\%, P = 0.001)
   often caused by a Campylobacter jejuni infection (67\% versus 28\% in
   the other Guillain-Barre syndrome patients, P < 0.001). High titres of
   anti-GM1 antibodies were also significantly more common in motor
   Guillain-Barre syndrome patients (42\% versus 5\%, P < 0.001).
   Electromyographic data of the motor Guillain-Barre syndrome patients at
   nadir revealed little or no evidence for demyelination. Abundant
   denervation activity was present in half of the patients. The response
   to immune globulin treatment was good but with plasma exchange
   significantly fewer motor Guillain-Barre syndrome patients reached the
   stage of independent locomotion after a follow-up period of 6 months
   especially if the acute motor neuropathy occurred after a C. jejuni
   infection. The distinctive clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory
   features of motor Guillain-Barre syndrome patients show that the acute
   motor neuropathy represents a specific subgroup within the
   Guillain-Barre syndrome and recognizing these patients may have

Abstract = {{A study of blood protein adsorption to procoagulant surfaces utilizing a
   coagulation time assay, contact angles, Wilhelmy balance tensiometry,
   and electron spectroscopy (ESCA) is presented. Using a new contact angle
   method of measuring protein adsorption termed `'adsorption mapping'' it
   was demonstrated that protein-adsorbent surfaces were inefficient
   activators of the intrinsic pathway of the plasma coagulation cascade
   whereas water-wettable, protein-repellent surfaces were efficient
   procoagulants. Repeated use of fully water-wettable (spreading) glass
   procoagulants in the coagulation time assay demonstrated that putative
   `'activating sites'' were not consumed in the coagulation of
   platelet-poor porcine plasma. Furthermore, these procoagulant surfaces
   retained water-wettable surface properties after incubation with blood
   proteins and saline rinse. The interpretation of these observations was
   that plasma and serum proteins were not adsorbed to water-wettable
   surfaces. However, ESCA of these same surfaces revealed the presence of
   a thin protein layer. Wilhelmy balance tensiometry resolved these
   seemingly divergent observations by demonstrating that protein was
   `'associated'' with a bound hydration layer, but not formally adsorbed
   through a surface dehydration or ionic interaction mechanism. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{1. Females of the aphid hyperparasitoid Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis)
   search successfully for hosts during both day and night. Oviposition
   numbers per host patch did not differ significantly between day and

   2. D.carpenteri females also displayed a nocturnal flight activity,
   showing that they are not only capable of searching on a given host
   plant but also of dispersing between host plants.
   3. Nocturnal oviposition activity was mainly influenced by egg load.
   Females with a high egg load laid more eggs at night than females with a
   comparatively low egg load. Thus, D.carpenteri females may use nocturnal
   foraging to compensate for the lack of oviposition opportunities during
   day.
   4. D.carpenteri females which foraged continuously for hosts both day
   and night (= for 24 h per day) benefitted from an 1.4-fold increase in
   lifetime reproductive success when compared to females which foraged
   only by day (= for 16 h per day).
   5. The benefit of night foraging for this species is a significantly
   increased reproductive success.}},

   as part of the international, multisite DSM-IV field trial for autism
   and related conditions were examined and cases that met DSM-IV criteria
   for CDD were identified. Results: In 16 cases the clinician had given a
   CDD diagnosis; in an additional 10 cases criteria for the condition were
   met even though this diagnosis was not given by the clinician rating the
   case. Conclusions: The available data suggest that CDD cases can be
   differentiated from those with autism; these two groups appear to differ
   in important ways. The identification of cases of CDD may be of
   particular importance for research.}},

Abstract = {{In the US, concrete containment buildings for commercial nuclear power
   plants have steel liners that act as the internal pressure boundary. The
   liner abuts the concrete, acting as the interior concrete form. The
   liner is attached to the concrete by either studs or by a continuous
   structural shape (such as a T-section or channel) that is either
   continuously or intermittently welded to the liner. Studs are commonly
   used in reinforced concrete containments, while prestressed containments
   utilize a structural element as the anchorage. The practice in some
   countries follows the US practice, while in other countries the
   containment does not have a steel liner. In this latter case, there is a
   true double containment, and the annular region between the two
   containments is vented.
   This paper will review the practice of design of the liner system prior
   to the consideration of severe accident loads (overpressurization loads
   beyond the design conditions).
   An overpressurization test of a 1:6 scale reinforced concrete
   containment at Sandia National Laboratories resulted in a failure
   mechanism in the liner that was not fully anticipated. Post-test
   analyses and experiments have been conducted to understand the failure
   better. This work and the activities that followed the test are
   reviewed. Areas in which additional research should be conducted are
   given.}},

Abstract = {{Fatty acids are the main fuel for the myocardium in vivo. They increase
   oxygen consumption, but the regulation of their beta-oxidation is not
   well known, Since Ca2+ and matrix volume have been implicated in the
   regulation of fatty acid oxidation in liver mitochondria, we set out to
   investigate the effects of Ca2+ on cellular respiration and energetics
   in the isolated perfused rat heart when oxidizing a short-chain fatty
   acid. Infusion of hexanoate increased oxygen consumption, while stepwise
   changes in the perfusate Ca2+ concentration in the range 0.5-2.5 mM
   caused the mechanical work output and oxygen consumption to change in
   parallel, Hexanoate addition increased the cellular energy state as
   determined by P-31 NMR and evaluated from the cytosolic
   {[}ATP]/{[}ADP].{[}Pi] ratio. During fatty acid infusion the energy
   state decreased slightly upon Ca2+-induced inotropy, and after
   discontinuation of the hexanoate infusion the de-energization was more
   pronounced. The fatty acid caused an extensive partially reversible
   reduction of navoproteins and NAD with a slight tendency for oxidation
   during Ca2+-induced inotropy. The data are in agreement with the notion
   that oxygen consumption during fatty acid oxidation is mainly determined
   by the energy expenditure, even in the presence of Ca2+-induced
   alterations in the inotropic state, The constancy of the redox states of
   mitochondrial flavins and NADH/NAD during large changes in oxygen
   consumption is interpreted as indicating stabilization of the
   mitochondrial redox states by Ca2+-linked regulation. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the maternal and fetal effects of three
   anesthetic methods used randomly in women with severe preeclampsia who
   required cesarean delivery.
   Methods: Eighty women with severe preeclampsia, who were to be delivered
   by cesarean, were randomized to general (26 women), epidural (27), or
   combined spinal-epidural (27) anesthesia. The mean preoperative blood
   pressure (BP) was approximately 170/110 mmHg, and all women had
   proteinuria. Anesthetic and obstetric management included
   antihypertensive drug therapy and limited intravenous (IV) fluid and
   drug therapy.
   Results: The mean gestational age at delivery was 34.8 weeks. All
   infants were born in good condition as assessed by Apgar scores and
   umbilical arterial blood gas determinations. Maternal hypotension
   resulting from regional anesthesia was managed without excessive IV
   fluid administration. Similarly, maternal BP was managed without severe
   hypertensive effects in women undergoing general anesthesia. There were
   no serious maternal or fetal complications attributable to any of the
   three anesthetic methods.
   Conclusion: General as well as regional anesthetic methods are equally
   acceptable for cesarean delivery in pregnancies complicated by severe
   preeclampsia if steps are taken to ensure a careful approach to either

   closure model for the turbulent transport and dissipation of aircraft
   vortices. When the aircraft wake has decayed to background levels of
   turbulence, droplet trajectory calculations are continued with a Markov
   type of Lagrangian model for particle dispersion in a turbulent
   atmosphere. Modelled predictions for off-target drift, and foliage and
   ground deposit within a 400 m fetch are compared with field trial data
   for six different spray experiments each for insecticide application
   (foliage area index: 3.2 m(2) foliage per m(2) ground) and for herbicide
   application (foliage area index: 0.48 m(2) foliage per m(2) ground).
   Model predictions of the downwind location of peak canopy deposit are
   within 18\% and 20\% of the experimental values for the insecticide and
   herbicide cases, respectively, on average. Canopy deposit predictions
   are 10\% higher and 26\% lower on average than experimental values, for
   insecticide and herbicide tests, respectively. Ground deposit
   predictions for the herbicide tests are 12\% higher than experimental
   values, on average, but for the insecticide tests, computed values were
   significantly higher than measured values partly because the
   measurements in that case are not accurate. Model predictions in general
   agree very well with experiments for a wide range of atmospheric
   stability values and it is concluded that the model is an ideal method
   of evaluating and optimizing aerial spray applications.}},

Abstract = {{In fetal rat lung the amounts of mRNAs encoding fatty acid synthase
   (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP citrate lyase (ACL) increase
   in late gestation and drop around birth. To study the mechanism of the
   perinatal decrease, pregnancy was prolonged from 22 (term) to 25 days in
   rats with daily injections of progesterone. Progesterone did not affect
   the levels of lipogenic enzyme mRNAs in fetal lung prior to term, but
   significantly delayed the perinatal decrease in the levels of lung FAS
   and ACC mRNA. Although for ACL mRNA abundance the differences were not
   statistically significant, its patterns in the control and progesterone
   groups were similar to those of FAS and ACC mRNA. Malic enzyme mRNA did
   not change between 20 and 25 days after conception in either group.
   These results suggest that the decrease in FAS and ACC mRNA at term can
   be partially explained by labor, delivery, air-breathing or switch from
   carbohydrate to fat metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach based on augmented Lagrangian
   relaxation for short term generation scheduling problem with
   transmission and environmental constraints. In this method, the system
   constraints, e.g. load demand, spinning reserve, transmission capacity
   and environmental constraints, are relaxed by using Lagrangian
   multipliers, and quadratic penalty terms associated with system load
   demand balance are added to the Lagrangian objective function. Then the
   decomposition and coordination technique is used, and non-separable
   quadratic penalty terms are replaced by linearization around the
   solution obtained from the previous iteration. In order to improve the
   convergence property, the exactly convex quadratic terms of decision
   variables are added to the objective function as strongly convex,
   differentiable and separable auxiliary functions. The overall problem is
   decomposed into N subproblems, multipliers and penalty coefficients are
   updated in the dual problem and system constraints are satisfied
   iteratively. The corresponding unit commitment subproblems are solved by
   dynamic programming, and the economic dispatch with transmission and
   environmental constraints is solved by an efficient network flow
   programming algorithm. The augmented Lagrangian relaxation method
   enhanced by decomposition and coordination technique avoids oscillations
   associated with piece-wise linear cost functions. Numerical results
   indicate that the proposed approach is fast and efficient in dealing
   with numerous system constraints.}},

   exhibited less locomotor activity, more defecation, and less entry to
   the center square areas than did the control females. No such difference
   was found in males. In the Morris maze, Se-deficient females showed
   slight but significant impairment during the initial phase of the
   trials. The behavioral changes in OFF and the maze might have been due
   to an altered reactivity to a novel environment, although this
   possibility needs further confirmation. The obtained data showed that

   When a higher beam intensity from the H--ion source becomes available,
   KENS-II can be upgraded to 1 MW. On the other hand, at the Japan Atomic
   Energy Research Institute, the construction of a high-power proton linac
   (1.5 GeV, 10 mA) is being planned for nuclear transmutation. By
   accelerating an H--beam simultaneously with protons and constructing a
   compressor ring, we can expect a 1-3 MW pulsed source. As another
   option, by utilizing a fraction of the direct proton pulses from the
   linac (about 10 pulses out of 100), we can expect an intense pulsed
   cold-neutron source (time-averaged cold neutron flux: 1/2 to 1/3 ILL,

Abstract = {{The pancreatic duct from the splenic lobe, the largest lobe of the
   pancreas in the mouse, was ligated at 6 weeks of age, with histological
   and cytological changes in the organ examined 1 day to 16 weeks after
   the ligation. Changes in the volumes of the pancreatic lobe, exocrine
   tissue, and interstitial tissue as well as relative total numbers of
   each cellular element in the organ after duct ligation were
   stereologically obtained using serial sections of the whole pancreas.
   Cell sizes, degenerated cell and mitotic cell indices, and nuclear
   densities of the acinar and ductal cells were also obtained.
   After duct ligation, the volume of the pancreas increased by
   interstitial edema in the first 2 days but rapidly decreased thereafter
   due to atrophy of the exocrine tissue, amounting to 10\% or less of
   normal volume by 7 days. The acinar cells showed an accumulation of the
   zymogen granules, cytoplasmic condensation and a pyknotic figure of the
   nucleus; they then were thoroughly deleted with appearance of numerous
   macrophages. This cell death was suggested to be due to apoptosis.
   On the other hand, the ductal cells remained in the atrophic pancreas
   and proliferated with mitotic figures to two times the normal frequency
   at 3 days, and then formed duct-like structures lacking in the acinar
   cells. After 2 week, the ductal cells slowly decreased in number also
   due to cell death, but the pancreas became gradually enlarged by
   intralobular fatty replacement, to reach a volume approximating that of
   normal 8 weeks after duct ligation.
   The stereological method serves for the correct evaluation of cell
   dynamics including the deletion and proliferation of the cells in the
   whole organ.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: (1) to examine areas of controversy which arise in the
   occupational health course curriculum, and (2) to identify best
   practices in addressing and resolving those controversies.
   Methods: A literature review reveals that occupational health practice
   and policy contain many controversies. The BSc and MSc occupational
   health course curricula at the Nottingham Trent University contain
   toxicology, epidemiology, occupational hygiene, and occupational health
   policy. These subjects raise questions which may be controversial and
   have been so identified by students-through the collection,
   interpretation, dissemination and presentation of data; different
   methodologies; funding of particular types of occupational health
   research; use of data in setting standards, and making policy. Case
   studies on coal mining, coal gas industry and formaldehyde are used on
   the courses to examine the controversial topics raised by students.
   Results: Evaluations reveal that controversy should be openly
   acknowledged in the teaching of occupational health. Those providing
   courses need to be aware of the tensions and problems which may arise
   when controversy emerges on courses. Methods are available for raising
   the subject and dealing with it as a positive pedagogic tool. This
   entails the use of case studies which examine several different
   perspectives and approaches to the controversy linked to comparative and
   historical studies.
   Conclusions: The teaching of occupational health to clinical and
   non-clinical students, from a range of backgrounds, is not a value-free
   activity. Controversial questions central to key topics in occupational
   health relating to science and technology as well as policy will always
   emerge. These Should be openly recognised and discussed on courses
   through, for instance, case study material which identifies and analyses
   a range of approaches to the subject.}},

Abstract = {{Neo-Piagetians have claimed memory span to be the missing link between
   psychometrically defined intelligence and cognition, i.e., to be the
   most important human limitation in reasoning and problem solving.
   Changes in children's logical abilities are contingent upon a
   maturational increase in memory span. In research done by Pascual-Leone
   the memory span maximum became the mental energy operator. By applying
   the Bose-Einstein-occupancy model of quantum statistics to learning
   experiments, Pascual-Leone obtained very good agreement between
   empirical findings and Bose-Einstein predicted probabilities.
   Multiplying memory span by mental speed (bits processed per unit of
   time), operationally defined as reading rate, and using the entropy
   formula for indistinguishable quantum particles (bosons), the so-called
   Erlangen school of information psychology calculates short-term memory
   storage capacity and, by IQ testing, numerically obtains the same result
   as Pascual-Leone with learning tests. If we understand memory span as
   the quantum number of a harmonic oscillator, we have a third way to get
   this very same result from evoked potentials of the EEG, now in terms of
   power spectrum density of the EEG.}},

Abstract = {{Compaction implies an increase in soil bulk density and associated with
   this are increases in soil strength, and decreases in air permeability

   compaction and then proceeds to consider the effects of that compaction
   on the biotic activity in the soil. The elongation of roots through soil
   is considered in detail and we draw attention to controversy in the
   literature and the current debate on the appropriateness of models based
   on the traditional Lockhart approach to root elongation. A model of root
   elongation which can be used in practice is also discussed. Soil fauna
   considered include earthworms, which can physically move soil and micro
   fauna which cannot. Consideration of microbial activity and biological
   interactions shows that the effect of compaction on a given soil depends
   on its management history, Further research is required to develop
   systems of agriculture which are sustainable and ecologically sound,
   because the effects of tillage and compaction on biological processes in
   the soil are only partly understood.}},

Abstract = {{A set of two-locus descent measures are derived for loci on sex-linked
   and autosomal loci, with a population structure which includes finite
   population size, migration, and extinction and recolonization. Two-locus
   descent measures which involve sex chromosomes increase much faster with
   inbreeding than those for autosomes. For loose recombination, the
   two-locus descent measures are shown to be closely approximated by the
   product of the appropriate one-locus measures. The distribution and
   partitioning of variance within and among populations is derived,
   including additive-by-additive epistatic genetic variance. The variance
   among populations available to group selection is much higher in the
   homogametic sex with epistasis involving sex chromosomes or
   haplodiploids. The amount of additive genetic variance within
   populations due to sex chromosomes or haplodiploids can be significantly
   increased as a result of population bottlenecks and the conversion of
   epistatic genetic variance. The proportion of epistatic genetic variance
   which is converted to additive variance is greater in the homogametic
   sex than in the heterogametic sex, by as much as a factor of 2. (C) 1995

   Materials and Methods: Our series includes 83 individuals who underwent
   transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal percutaneous cryoablation of
   the prostate. Prostate specific antigen levels, biopsy results and
   complications were assessed at 3 months.
   Results: Of 61 biopsies 8 (13.1\%) were positive for carcinoma (half
   showed stage D disease). Of patients with stages T1 to T3 cancer 92.6\%
   were free of disease at 3 months. Prostate specific antigen levels were
   significantly decreased by an average of 1.90 ng,/ml. (p<0.05). Major
   complications were infrequent, including bladder perforation in 1
   patient, urethral strictures in 3, bladder outlet obstruction in 2 and
   partial incontinence in 2. Impotence was frequent but transient.
   Conclusions: Transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal percutaneous
   cryoablation of the prostate produces few major complications and
   appears at 3 months to be effective in eradicating local prostate
   tumors. Longer followup is required to test the original hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Many questions to be tackled by scanning force microscopy (SFM) require
   the comparison of several nontopographic signals, like electrical
   conductance, friction, and elasticity. Especially in biology, which is
   our main field of interest, most of these signals are superimposed. To
   disentangle them, it is advantageous to measure them simultaneously.
   Because all known SFMs; home-built or commercial, allow either no or
   only very few such signals to be measured simultaneously, we developed
   the new multimode SFM. Moreover, we have applied new modes which measure
   breakdown voltages of thin insulators and static friction. The presented
   SFM is designed to investigate such properties of biological material,
   simultaneously. In addition, the instrument uses some new features, not
   used elsewhere: The elasticity signal is utilized for a reverse feedback
   during contact loss which makes imaging with very small forces
   practicable. The elasticity signal is further used to perform a very
   smooth approach, to prevent damage to tip and sample. Features like a
   movable sample stage, light microscopic access, and enhanced computer
   control using a Macintosh IIfx are described. The liquid cell is
   designed such that no seal is necessary which would disturb the scanner
   movement. As an application requiring these features, results obtained
   on a DPPC Langmuir-Blodgett film in the two phase coexistence region on
   a partly conductive support are shown. One can distinguish areas in the
   liquid expanded phase from areas in the liquid condensed phase using the
   information contained in the topographic, elastic, frictional, and
   conductivity signals. Correct interpretation was only possible using the
   simultaneously collected different signals. (C) 1995 American Institute

Abstract = {{The development over time of antibodies to human papillomavirus type 6
   (HPV 6) was studied prospectively in a group of 26 condyloma patients
   receiving multiple treatments, as well as in 17 healthy subjects with a
   new HPV 6 infection. The condyloma patients provided serum samples
   during 2-12 visits over a period of 1-20 months, and the levels of IgA,
   IgG and IgM antibodies to HPV 6, 11 and 16 capsids, and to HPV 6-derived
   peptide antigens were determined. Among the capsid antibodies, the IgG
   and IgA responses against HPV 6 were the most prominent, whereas IgM was
   detected only in a few patients. During follow-up, seroconversion to HPV
   capsids was found in six patients and antibody peaks disappeared during
   follow-up in nine patients, There was no association between serology
   and cure of the wart.
   One hundred twenty subjects who reported multiple sexual partners, but
   found negative for HPV DNA at multiple anogenital and oral sites,
   provided serum samples and swabs for HPV DNA analysis at 2-7 visits
   during 4-74 months. Seventeen subjects acquired HPV 6 DNA and were
   included in the study. Serum IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies to HPV 6
   capsids were induced concomitantly with the acquisition of viral DNA (P
   = 0.02, 0.002 and 0.006, respectively), and declined again when the
   viral DNA was no longer detectable.
   In conclusion, antibodies to HPV 6 did not predict the clinical course
   of condylomatous disease, but appear to be useful mainly as
   epidemiological markers of viral exposure. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Cultured epithelial autograft (CEA) has been used as an adjunct in burn
   wound coverage at the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre
   since 1988, and has been available to all patients admitted with
   significant burn injuries. During the 5-year period from 1988 to 1992
   inclusive, 28 patients treated with CEA survived long enough for
   assessment. The mean age was 35.3 years,vith a mean total body surface
   area burn of 52.2\% and a mean total full thickness injury of 42.4\%.
   CEA was applied to wounds covering between 2\% and 35\% body surface
   area (BSA; mean 10.4\%) after excision to fat or fascia. Most wounds had
   interim homograft coverage. Preservation of homograft dermis was
   attempted in three patients at the time of removal without effect. The
   mean CEA `'take'' was 26.9\% of the grafted area. Eight patients had
   50\% or greater take and were discharged with between 1 and 19\% BSA
   covered with CEA. Thirteen patients had no take on wounds between 2 and
   16\% BSA. Overall mortality in burn patients treated at the Vancouver
   Hospital and Health Sciences Centre from 1988 to 1992 was not
   significantly different from 1983 to 1987 with the populations being
   similar in terms of total BSA burns, age, inhalation injury, and
   homograft availability, When compared to a matched control population
   from the preceding 5 years, when CEA was not available, there was no
   significant difference in duration of hospital stay or number of
   autograft harvests. However, approximately one more debridement without
   autograft harvest per CEA patient occurred. Timing and depth of wound
   excision, interim coverage, type of dressing, and wound microbiology
   were not found to influence good versus poor take. The anterior trunk
   and thighs were the best recipient sites. Subjective differences between
   CEA and meshed autograft were noted. The results show that after 5 years
   of use, CEA engraftment continues to be unpredictable and inconsistent,
   and hence, it should be used as only a biologic dressing and
   experimental adjunct to conventional burn wound coverage with split
   thickness autograft.}},

   to an enhanced loading rate. We measure the loading rate as a function

   determines the contribution to the loss rates from excited-state
   collisions. We find a substantial difference between the collisional
   loss rates for the two isotopes.}},

Abstract = {{Two recent developments in neutral-network control are presented. First,
   a `'Fully-Connected Architecture'' (FCA) is developed for Erse with
   backpropagation (BP). This FCA has functionality beyond that of a
   layered network, and these capabilities are shown to be particularly
   beneficial for central tasks. A complexity control method is applied
   successfully to manage the extra connections provided, and prevent
   over-fitting. Second, a technique that extends BP learning to
   discrete-valued functions (DVFs) is presented. This algorithm is
   applicable whenever a gradient-based optimization is used for systems
   with DVFs. The modification to BP is very small simply requiring
   replacement of the DVFs with continuous approximations and injection of
   noise on the forward sweep.
   The viability of both of these neural-network developments is
   demonstrated by applying them to a thruster-mapping problem
   characteristic of space robots. Real-would applicability is shown via an
   experimental demonstration on a 2-D laboratory model of a free-flying
   space robot.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of photochemically grown native oxides on Hg1-xCdxTe (x
   = 0.3) has been analyzed and depth profiled using x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The oxide films
   were grown in either N2O or O-2 ambients, and differences in the
   oxidation process were examined by varying the time and temperature of
   oxide growth. Under all growth conditions, oxides grown in an O-2
   ambient exhibited a higher Hg concentration in the bulk oxide region
   when compared to N2O grown oxides. The Hg/Te ratio of all the oxides was
   found to be less than the starting Hg1-xCdxTe substrates and, in some
   cases, this may be leading to an accumulation of Hg in the
   oxide/Hg1-xCdxTe interface region. For growths at higher temperatures
   (similar to 75 degrees C), the excess Hg was seen to move from the
   oxide/Hg1-xCdxTe interface region to the oxide surface. In O-2 ambients,
   the Hg accumulated art the surface of the oxide whereas for growths in
   N2O, it was lost to the ambient. Previous results on photochemical
   oxidation of Hg1-xCdxTe show an inverse relationship between oxide
   growth rate and temperature.(1) Evidence obtained in this study from
   oxide compositions, depth profiles and annealing at higher temperatures,
   suggest that this relationship between oxide growth rate and temperature
   is primarily due to temperature induced differences in the oxidizing
   ambient, and not the result of a change in the film growth mechanism due
   to changing diffusion characteristics with temperature.}},

   the cleanability testing of food processing equipment. Photobacterium
   leiognathi ATCC 33469 has been suggested as an indicator organism in

   h or 24 h at room temperature on various surfaces, clean or milk-soiled,
   by immersing the surfaces in luminous medium inoculated with P.
   leiognathi. The surfaces were then rinsed or cleaned using a CIP
   procedure before the hygienic status was determined using conventional
   plating, bioluminescence output and image analysis.
   Rinsing did not eliminate the bacterium from the surfaces nor did the
   CIP procedure when 24-h biofilms were used, as was readily seen after
   enrichment in luminous medium. In image analysis the biofilm showed a
   spotlike growth pattern which was most evident on stainless steel. The
   advantage of P. leiognathi in the cleanability assessment, which is

Abstract = {{Background. Tumor viruses are known to have a role in the pathogenesis
   of many types of benign and malignant human tumors. The possible roles
   of these viruses in the development of human pituitary tumors have not
   been investigated.
   Methods. The polymerase chain reaction was used to screen human
   pituitary tumors for human papillomaviral (HPV) and Polyomaviral DNA
   sequences. Sets of consensus primers, which are capable of amplifying
   HPV Types 16, 18, and 33 and polyomavirus BK, JC, and SV40, were used in
   these experiments.
   Results. Amplification products were not detected using HPV consensus
   primers in 30 tumors. Twenty-six of 30 tumors demonstrated an
   amplification product with polyomaviral primers that hybridized to SV40
   and BK internal probes and was confirmed to be SV40 in one tumor by
   direct sequencing. Ten normal postmortem pituitary samples then were
   examined similarly with Polyomaviral consensus primers; 8 of 10 normal
   samples demonstrated a similar amplification product that also
   hybridized with SV40 and BK internal probes by Southern blotting.
   Polyomaviral DNA sequences in normal and tumor samples were not present
   at levels detectable by genomic Southern blotting. Expressed viral
   protein (large T antigen) was not demonstrated in positive samples by
   Western blot analysis.
   Conclusions. These findings, that polyomaviral DNA sequences are
   detectable at low levels in certain normal tissues, are in agreement
   with those of other groups and, to the authors' knowledge, serve as the
   first report of polyomaviral latency in human pituitary tissue. A role
   for polyomaviruses in pituitary tumorigenesis could not be established
   in this analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To identify factors associated with undervaccination at 3
   months and 24 months among low-income, inner-city Latino and
   African-American preschool children.
   Design. Interviews with a representative sample of inner-city families
   using a cross-sectional, multi-stage, cluster-sample design combined
   with a replicated quota sampling approach.
   Setting. South Central and East Los Angeles areas in inner-city Los
   Angeles.
   Population. Eight hundred seventeen Latino and 387 African-American
   families with children between 12 and 36 months of age.
   Main Outcome Variables. Being fully immunized or up-to-date (UTD) at 3
   months (1 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and 1 oral polio vaccine)
   and 24 months of age (4 diphtheria-tetanus-p ertussis vaccines, 3 oral p
   olio vaccines, and 1 measles-mumps-rubella vaccine).
   Methods. Logistic regressions of UTD immunization status at 3 and 24
   months by population and health care system factors.
   Results. Seventy percent of Latino children and 53\% of African-American
   children were UTD at 3 months of age. At 24 months of age, 42\% of
   Latino children and 26\% of African-American children were UTD on their
   immunizations. Receipt of the first immunizations by 3 months was
   associated with smaller family size, and evidence of connection to
   prenatal care. Latino children were less likely to be UTD at 24 months
   if they obtained well child fare from private providers versus public
   clinics (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.45, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   0.26, 0.79). There was also a trend for Latino children to be less well
   immunized if they were in health maintenance organizations versus public
   clinics (0.31,.0.05 < P <.1). African-American children were more likely
   to be UTD at 24 months if they were UTD at 3 months (OR = 5.56, 95\% CI
   = 1.43, 21.6), had more health visits (OR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.01, 1.27),
   and were less likely to be UTD at 24 months if they were on Medicaid
   versus private insurance (OR = 0.26, 95\% CI = 0.08, 0.90).
   Implications. Both African-American and Latino children in inner-city
   Los Angeles have low immunization rates at 3 and 24 months. Prenatal
   care and family size are strongly associated with being UTD by 3 months;
   however, family and child characteristics are relatively unimportant
   predictors of being UTD at 24 months of age. Important risk factors for
   underimmunization at 2 years of age in the inner-city, low-income
   communities studied include type of health insurance and source of well
   child care, with the public sector having higher rates than private
   doctors' offices or health maintenance organization/managed care plans.}},

Abstract = {{A basic helix-loop-helix phosphoprotein gene, G0S8, was recently
   isolated by differential screening of cDNA from human blood mononuclear
   cells stimulated with a T cell mitogen and cycloheximide. In this study,
   G0S8 expression was examined in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells
   by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR). G0S8 expression was observed in most fresh samples of
   acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (28/30) and most cases of adult acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (9/11) regardless of clinical
   classification. G0S8 mRNA was also detected in all cases tested of
   chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. However, G0S8
   expression was not defected in CML patients in chronic phase, nor in
   normal bone marrow or other hematopoietic cells. G0S8 has been mapped
   using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to human chromosome
   1q31, the same site reported for the B cell homolog BL34/1R20 and within
   a region implicated in the development of hematological malignancies.
   The consistent observation of G0S8 mRNA in patient samples of acute
   leukemia suggests that G0S8 expression may either play a role in
   leukemogenesis or represent a common consequence of dysregulated growth.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of three-dimensional perturbed velocity and three-dimensional
   perturbed current density on the beam-wave interaction of dielectric
   Cherenkov maser is analysed by use of the self-consistent linear field
   theory. Three distinct cases are considered. First, the propagation of
   the electron beam in an annular dielectric liner enclosed by a loss-free
   conducting wall is investigated. The dispersion equation and the
   simultaneous condition of the beam-wave interaction are derived. It's
   clearly shown that the instability of the interaction results from the
   coupling of the TM mode in the dielectric lined slow-wave waveguide to
   the beam mode via the electron beam. And the coupling is proportional to
   the density of the beam. The growth rate of the wave produced by the
   electron beam are obtained. Then, the case of a relativistic electron
   beam guided by a longitudinal magnetic field in the same slow-wave
   structure is examined. The motion of electrons could be approximated to
   be one-dimensional when the simultaneous condition of the beam-wave
   interaction of dielectric Cherenkov maser is satisfied. Finally, the
   effect of the background plasma on the instability of the beam-wave
   interaction is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-The aim was to define the long term prognosis of isolated
   ventricular septal defect (VSD) with anteriorly malaligned outlet
   septum.
   Design-Cohort study.
   Setting-University hospital, tertiary medical care centre.
   Patients-between July 1986 and June 1993, 63 patients were studied with
   an isolated VSD and anteriorly malaligned outlet septum (59
   perimembranous; 4 muscular outlet).
   Main outcome measures-The diagnosis of septal malalignment, aneurysmal
   transformation, right ventricular obstruction, subaortic ridge, and
   aortic valve prolapse was based on echocardiographic criteria, then
   confirmed by angiography in 33 patients and by surgery in 28. An
   actuarial curve for each event was obtained by Kaplan-Meier
   non-parametric analysis and the significance was examined by log-rank
   test.
   Results-Aneurysmal transformation decreased the size of the VSD in 52\%
   of the patients, but was also associated with the appearance of
   subaortic ridge (p < 0.05). Progressive obstruction in the right
   ventricle was observed in 51\%, more often in those without aneurysmal
   transformation (p < 0.05). Aortic valve prolapse was quite common
   whether or not aneurysmal transformation occurred (33\% and 23\%,
   respectively). This was attributed to the location of the VSD and the
   anterior malalignment of the outlet septum. Surgery was performed in 28
   patients at a median age of 50 months because of significant left to
   right shunt (n = 5), or the development of obstruction in right
   ventricle (n = 9), aortic valve prolapse (n = 3), or combinations (n =
   11). The presence of subaortic ridge per se was not considered to be a
   surgical indication.
   Conclusions-Anteriorly malaligned VSDs have variable presentation.
   Careful echocardiographic evaluation is needed to identify various
   combinations of progressive right ventricular obstruction, aneurysmal
   transformation, subaortic ridge, or aortic valve prolapse, In extreme
   cases a patient may have a pathology complex comprising right
   ventricular outflow obstruction, subaortic ridge, aortic valve prolapse,
   and anteriorly malaligned VSD.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene appear to be important in
   the development of many human tumors. The wild-type p53 gene has a
   polymorphism at codon 72 that presents the arginine (CGC) or proline
   (CCC) genotype, which recently has been reported to be associated with
   genetically determined susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancers.
   To determine whether this p53 genotype influences individual risk of
   urologic cancer and/or its progression, we used polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis to
   assay the allelic frequencies of this polymorphism in 85 renal cell
   carcinoma patients, 151 urothelial cancer patients, 33 testicular cancer
   patients, 28 prostatic cancer patients and 56 patients without
   neoplastic disease. The allelic distributions of the three genotypes
   (Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, Pro/Pro) in patients with renal cell carcinoma
   (29.4\%, 55.3\%, 15.3\%), urothelial cancers (45.7\%, 39.7\%, 14.6\%),
   testicular cancer (45.4\%, 48.5\%, 6.1\%) or prostate cancer (42.9\%,
   50.0\%, 7.1\%) did not differ significantly from those in the normal
   controls. However, Pro/Pro genotype in renal cell carcinoma and
   urothelial cancer (smoking-related cancers) was more frequent than that
   in prostate cancer and testicular cancer (smoking-unrelated cancers)
   with borderline significance (P = 0.0881). There was no particular
   correlation between frequency of the three genotypes and grade or stage
   of each type of tumor. The association of genetic predisposition to
   urologic cancers with p53 gene codon 72 polymorphism is not so clear as
   the previous study of Japanese lung cancer patients, but this
   polymorphism may play some role in urothelial cancers and renal cell
   carcinoma, in which smoking is an epidemiological risk factor.}},

Abstract = {{Astrophysical observations indicate that the `'local universe'' has a

   local underdense region, the Hubble expansion may not be representative
   of the global behavior. Utilizing an underdense sphere embedded in a
   flat universe as the model of our `'local universe,'' we show that the
   local Hubble constant would be 1.2-1.4 times larger than the global
   value on scale of similar to 80 Mpc, depending on the variation of
   Omega(0). This may account for the recent measurements of the
   unpleasantly large Hubble constant of similar to 80 km s(-1) Mpc(-1)
   using the Cepheid variables in the Virgo cluster and the relative

Abstract = {{We describe a concept for an instrument to measure 2-D space plasma
   distributions by remote sensing of neutral atoms. The instrument
   measures in one dimension, and from a spinning spacecraft one obtains
   2-D (line-of-sight) maps of the neutral flux. Because we want to employ
   this instrument for measurements in the magnetosphere, the main species
   of interest are neutral H and O atoms with kinetic energies ranging from
   about 10 eV to 1 keV. The instrument makes use of a low-work-function
   surface to convert neutral atoms efficiently to negative ions. The ions
   are then accelerated away from the surface and brought to an
   intermediate focus by a large aperture lens. After further acceleration,
   the ions are deflected by a spherical electrostatic analyzer into a
   time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Mass resolution of the device is
   sufficient to resolve H, D, He, and O. Energy and azimuth angle
   information are obtained by position imaging of the secondary electrons
   produced at the carbon foil. The large geometric factor combined with
   simultaneous angle-energy-mass measurement eliminates the need for
   cycling and provides the necessary high sensitivity for imaging at short
   time intervals. On a spinning spacecraft this instrument is capable of
   producing 2-D maps of low-energy neutral atom fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred consecutive uncemented Porous Coated Anatomic total hip
   arthroplasties performed in 91 patients who obtained prospective serial
   clinical and radiographic evaluation during a minimum 7-year followup
   period were studied for the occurrence, extent, and progression of
   localized periprosthetic bone loss (osteolysis). Periprosthetic bone
   loss occurred around the femoral component in 11 hips, the acetabular
   component in 2 hips, and both components in 2 hips during the followup
   interval. The bone loss was progressive in 6 hips (2 of 11 femoral
   cases, 2 of 2 acetabular cases, and 2 of 2 both component cases). It
   frequently occurred around components that showed no evidence of
   acetabular migration or femoral subsidence (11 of 15 cases). The average
   age at surgery of patients in the bone loss group was 10 gears younger
   than the nonbone loss group (in the 100 hip cohort). Clinically, most
   patients with bone loss were asymptomatic, with the average Harris hip
   rating of 92.4 points (range, 85-99 points). With this particular device
   at this interval of followup (7 years), the acetabular and the proximal
   femoral osteolytic lesions are of greatest concern. Wear of the
   acetabular component was greater for cases with osteolysis than for
   those without osteolysis, but the difference was not significant.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of Na+,K+ -ATPase activity by hyperglycemia could be an
   important etiological factor of chronic complications in diabetic
   patients, The biochemical mechanism underlying hyperglycemia's
   inhibitory effects has been thought to involve the alteration of the
   protein kinase C (PKC) pathway since agonists of PKC can normalize
   hyperglycemia-induced inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity,
   Paradoxically, elevated glucose levels and diabetes have been shown to
   increase PKC activities in vascular cells, The present study tested the
   hypothesis that the inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity is mediated by
   the sequential activation of PKC and cystolic phospholipase A(2)
   (cPLA(2)). In cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells
   (VSMC),increasing glucose levels in the medium from 5.5 to 22 mM
   elevated cPLA(2) activity and increased {[}H-3]arachidonic acid release
   and PGE(2) production by 2.3-, 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, Similar
   increases in cPLA(2) activity were also induced by elevated glucose
   levels in human VSMC and rat capillary endothelial cells, The activation
   of cPLA(2) was mediated by PKC since the increases in cPLA(2)
   phosphorylation and enzymatic activity were inhibited by the PKC
   inhibitor GFX. In contrast, elevation of glucose levels decreased
   Na+,K+-ATPase activity as measured by ouabain-sensitive Rb-86 uptake by
   twofold in rat VSMC, Surprisingly, both PMA, a PKC agonist, and GFX, a
   PKC inhibitor, were able to prevent glucose-induced decreases in Rb-86
   uptake, Further, the PLA(2) inhibitor AACOCF(3) abolished both
   glucose-induced activation of cPLA(2), and the decrease in Rb-86 uptake,
   These data indicated that hyperglycemia is inhibiting Na+,K+-ATPase
   activity by the sequential activation of PKC and cPLA(2), resulting in
   the liberation of arachidonic acid and increased the production of
   PGE(2), which are known inhibitors of Na+, K+- ATPase.}},

Abstract = {{A conducting platinum cluster compound K1.64Pt(C2O4)(2) was
   electrochemically synthesized on a glassy carbon electrode through the
   electrooxidation of K2Pt(C2O4)(2) in an aqueous medium using single
   potential step and cyclic voltammetry methods. The precursor
   K2Pt(C2O4)(2) was prepared by a ligand exchange reaction between C2O42-
   and PtCl42-. During single potential step experiments, the electrolytic
   current corresponding to the oxidation of K2Pt(C2O4)(2) increased
   dramatically after a sharp decrease at the beginning (due to the
   formation of conducting K1.64Pt(C2O4)(2) on the surface of the working
   electrode). Two kinds of mechanism account for the current transients at
   the different applied potentials. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted with
   K1.64Pt(C2O4)(2) on the surface of the working electrode and a
   steady-state diffusion current was observed. Since the material grew in
   a fibrous manner, each conducting fiber which was in contact with the
   electrode could serve as an ultramicroelectrode. The behavior of the
   working electrode was thus changed from a plain to an
   ultramicroelectrode array.}},

   institutes and the other 15\% from two national hospitals and two
   commercial diagnostic laboratories. The followings were found. Three
   major diseases caused by adenovirus were upper respiratory tract
   infection, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis. Patients of upper
   respiratory tract infection numbered 6,837 (40\% of all patients due to
   adenovirus), the identified serotypes being in order of frequency types
   3, 2, 1, and 5. Those of gastroenteritis numbered 1,636 (9.5\%). From
   40\% of the gastroenteritis patients, adenovirus was detected by
   electron microscopy or immunochemical methods without cultivation. From
   the remaining 60\%, virus was isolated in tissue culture; the serotypes
   of the isolates resembled those causing upper respiratory tract
   infection. Patients of conjunctivitis numbered 3,437 (20\%), the
   frequency being in order of types 3, 4, 8, 37, and 19. Conjunctivitis
   due to types 3 and 4 prevailed every summer; type 3 was isolated often
   from children with pharyngo-conjunctival fever and the other four types
   were mostly from adults with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Type 3 had a
   unique feature not seen in other types: it was most frequently isolated,
   causing upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis,
   conjunctivitis, and pharyngo-conjunctival fever. Reports on isolation of
   type 7, which has been reported to cause severe pneumonia in many other
   countries, were as few as 28 (0.2\%).}},

   show that this regulation is mediated by the trp RNA-binding attenuation
   protein. Deletion and point mutations indicated that regulation is
   dependent on a series of G/UAG trinucleotide repeats surrounding the
   putative ribosome-binding site for trpG. Our results are consistent with
   a model in which the tryptophan-activated trp RNA-binding attenuation
   protein and ribosomes compete for binding to trpG mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of electron-electron interaction on the electronic structure
   of a three-dimensional model quantum box are studied. The potential in
   the lateral plane of the quantum box is taken to be a two-dimensional
   harmonic potential, and an infinite quantum-well potential is used to
   represent the confinement in the vertical direction. Three-dimensional
   two-electron wave functions are constructed by the configuration
   interaction technique. Exchange and correlation are found to affect the
   electronic structure strongly. The effect of the finite thickness of the
   quantum box on the electronic structure is examined. It is shown that
   the electron-electron interaction can induce interesting polarization
   effects not only in the lateral plane but also in the vertical direction
   of the quantum box. Numerical results based on GaAs material parameters

Abstract = {{The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is increasing all over the world,
   including in countries with a high standard of living and good social
   security, Denmark represents such a region, Furthermore, it is a small
   country (5 million inhabitants) with a long tradition in TB control,
   including a centralization of the bacteriological diagnostic facility,
   The present study was intended to analyze the transmission of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a country in which TB has low endemicity
   by a combination of conventional epidemiological approaches and DNA
   fingerprinting techniques, whereby individual bacterial strains can be
   traced, M. tuberculosis isolates from 92\% of all new cases of
   bacteriologically verified TB in Denmark during 1992 were subjected to
   IS6110 DNA fingerprinting to visualize the DNA restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of the isolated strains, The data
   obtained from the RFLP analyses were interpreted by using demographic
   data, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and residence, for the patients, The
   risk factors among the patients for being part of an active chain of
   transmission, as opposed to demonstrating reactivation of a previously
   acquired latent infection, were estimated by statistical analyses. The
   magnitude of TB transmission in 1992 in Denmark was determined, and
   transmitted infections were shown to comprise at least one quarter of
   the total number of cases, Almost half of the TB cases involved patients
   of foreign origin, However, most of these isolates showed unique DNA
   fingerprint patterns and were rarely part of an active chain of
   transmission, The major chains of recent transmission were localized to
   distinct geographical regions in the country, TB is frequent among
   immigrants, especially from Asia and Africa, but it is apparently
   readily suspected, diagnosed, and treated by the health care system,
   Danish patients with pulmonary symptoms are not primarily suspected to
   have TB and, therefore, play an important role in recent TB transmission
   in Denmark.}},

   Both the spatial and the temporal correlation properties are considered.
   The correlation functions are shown to be stationary in general, which
   demonstrates the solitary behavior of quantum fundamental solitons and
   indicates their stability in propagation. Explicit evaluation of the
   correlation functions in some limit cases enables us to make comparisons
   between the classical and the quantum-mechanical results. Conditions
   leading to the classical limit are derived and the intrinsic quantum
   phenomena are identified. Of great importance is the contribution of the

   adaptive estimators, based on identification of the most recent

Abstract = {{Although the mitochondrial uridine insertion/deletion, guide RNA
   (gRNA)-mediated type of RNA editing has been described in Crithidia
   fasciculata, no evidence for the encoding of gRNAs in the kinetoplast
   minicircle DNA has been presented. There has also been a question as to
   the capacity of the minicircle DNA in this species to encode the
   required variety of gRNAs, because the kinetoplast DNA from the C1
   strain has been reported as essentially containing a single minicircle
   sequence class. To address this problem, the genomic and mature edited
   sequences of the MURF4 and RPS12 cryptogenes were determined and a gRNA
   library was constructed from mitochondrial RNA. Five specific gRNAs were
   identified, two of which edit blocks within the MURF4 mRNA, and three of
   which edit blocks within the RPS12 mRNA. The genes for these gRNAs are
   all localized with identical polarity within one of the two variable
   regions of specific minicircle molecules, approximately 60 bp from the
   `'bend'' region. These minicircles were found to represent minor
   sequence classes representing approximately 2\% of the minicircle DNA
   population in the network. The major minicircle sequence class also
   encodes a gRNA at the same relative genomic location, but the editing
   role of this gRNA was not determined. These results confirm that
   kinetoplast minicircle DNA molecules in this species encode gRNAs, as is
   the case in other trypanosomatids, and suggest that the copy number of
   specific minicircle sequence classes can vary dramatically without an
   overall effect on the RNA editing system.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the mechanism of trophoblast adhesion to fibronectin, we
   cultured blastocysts in serum-free medium on proteolytic fibronectin
   fragments containing its major functional domains, and localized
   fibronectin-binding integrins in outgrowing trophoblast cells by
   immunofluorescent staining. Outgrowth comparable to that obtained with
   intact fibronectin was observed using a 120 kD chymotryptic fragment
   containing the central cell-binding domain (FN-120) and the Arg-Gly-Asp
   (RGD) recognition sequence. A 40 kD COOH-terminal chy motryptic fragment
   of fibronectin containing both a heparin-binding region and an alternate
   (non-RGD) cell-binding site was inactive in supporting trophoblast
   adhesion. Three synthetic peptides derived from the heparin-binding
   domain, including the CS1 alternate cell-binding site, were also unable
   to promote trophoblast cell adhesion. A 75 kD recombinant protein,
   ProNectin F, containing 13 copies of the cell recognition epitope of
   fibronectin, Val-Thr-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Ala-Ser, vigorously
   supported blastocyst outgrowth. Blastocyst outgrowth was not
   significantly different when surfaces were precoated with cellular
   fibronectin, which contains an alternatively spliced type III repeat and
   is the form actually encountered in vivo. Several putative fibronectin
   receptors were localized in trophoblast outgrowths by immunofluorescent
   labeling. Antibodies reactive with integrin subunits alpha 3, alpha 5,
   alpha IIb, alpha v, pi and beta 3, but not alpha 4, all bound to
   trophoblast cells. Antibodies raised against either the beta 1 or beta 3
   integrin subunits significantly inhibited fibronectin-mediated
   outgrowth. These findings demonstrate the key role of the central
   cell-binding domain of fibronectin in trophoblast adhesion, and suggest
   four RGD-binding integrins, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha IIb
   beta 3, and alpha v beta 3, that could mediate trophoblast adhesion in
   vitro and may play an important role during implantation. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Bed topography and transverse sediment sorting in an alluvial channel

   channel bend with a constant radius of curvature. In addition, bed
   elevations across various sections of the bend were measured, and
   bed-surface sediment were sampled at the peak and end of the hydrograph
   in each experiment. Experimental results indicated that the
   characteristics of the hydrograph have prominent influences on bed
   topography and transverse sediment sorting. Those cases with a higher
   ramping rate of the hydrograph have greater deposition heights near the
   inner bank and larger scour depths near the outer bank. Furthermore, the
   sediment is finer near the inner bank and coarser near the outer bank in
   cases with a higher ramping rate. The bed deformation and sediment-size
   variation correlated well with the unsteady-flow parameter defined in

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the accepting powers of one-way alternating
   finite automata with counters and stack-counters (1afacs's) which
   operate in realtime. (The difference between `'counter'' and
   `'stack-counter'' is that the latter can be entered without the contents
   being changed, but the former cannot.) For each k greater than or equal
   to 0 and l greater than or equal to 0 ((k,l)double dagger(0,0)), let
   1AFACS(k,l,real) denote the class of sets accepted by realtime one-way
   alternating finite automata with k counters and l stack-counters, and
   let 1UFACS(k,l,real) (1NFACS(k,l,real)) denote the class of sets
   accepted by realtime one-way alternating finite automata with k counters
   and l stack-counters which have only universal (existential) states. We
   first investigate a relationship among the accepting powers of realtime
   1afacs's with only universal states, with only existential states, and
   with full alternation, and show, for example, that for each k greater
   than or equal to 0 and l greater than or equal to 0((k,l)double
   dagger(0,0)), 1UFACS(k,l,real) boolean OR 1NFACS(k,l,real) not equal
   subset of 1AFACS(k,l,real). We then investigate hierarchical properties
   based on the number of counters and stack-counters, and show, for
   example, that for each k greater than or equal to 0 and l greater than
   or equal to 0 ((k,l)double dagger(0,0)), and each XE(\{U,N\}, 1XFACS
   (k+1,l,real)-1AFACS (k,l,real)double dagger phi. We finally investigate
   a relationship between counters and stack-counters, and show, for
   example, that for each k greater than or equal to 0, l greater than or
   equal to 0 and m greater than or equal to 1, and each X is an element
   of\{U,N\}, 1XFACS(k,l+m,real)-1AFACS (k+2m - 1,l,real)double dagger phi.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{223-233}},

Abstract = {{Motor unit synchronization was estimated from the surface
   electromyograms (EMG) of the first dorsal interosseus muscle of human
   volunteers by a simplified surface-EMG technique (Milner-Brown et al.
   1973, 1975). Single motor units were identified from intramuscular
   recordings and were used to obtain a spike-triggered average of the
   surface-EMG. The discharge rate of a reference motor unit was controlled
   at two levels (high and low), and the effect of motor unit activity on
   the surface-EMG estimate of synchronization was studied in 56 motor
   units. The surface-EMG estimate of motor unit synchronization was
   significantly higher when the reference motor unit discharged at the
   high rate than when it discharged at the low rate. A regression analysis
   indicated that the synchronization ratio calculated from the surface EMG
   was significantly correlated with the level of EMG activity in the
   muscle. Motor unit synchronization was also estimated from surface-EMG
   measurements that were derived by computer simulation. The simulation
   permitted manipulation of motor unit activity (discharge rate and
   recruitment) with a complete absence of synchrony among the units in the
   pool. The stimulated surface-EMG index was influenced by an artifact
   associated with signal rectification, and this effect changed
   non-monotonically with motor unit activity. Furthermore, the increase in
   the motor unit activity reduced the signal-to-noise ratio of the
   spike-triggered surface EMG average, and consequently decreased the
   sensitivity of the surface-EMG index as an estimate of motor unit
   synchronization. We conclude that the simplified surface-EMG method
   (Milner-Brown et al. 1973, 1975) does not provide a useful index of
   motor unit synchronization due to its inability to accurately
   distinguish the synchronization from methodological effects related to a
   rectification artifact and variation in the signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Much of the understanding about the cardiac interval-force
   relationship of the whole heart, including mechanical restitution and
   postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP), has been inferred from isolated
   muscle studies. We tested whether results from isolated muscles about
   intracellular Ca2(+)({[}Ca2+](i)) transients underlying the
   interval-force relationship can be substantiated in whole hearts.
   Additionally, we investigated whether Ca2+ antagonists could alter
   {[}Ca2+](i) transients underlying mechanical restitution and
   postextrasystolic potentiation. Methods: {[}Ca2+](i) transients were
   studied in isolated perfused rat hearts by surface fluorometry and
   Indo-1. Using computer-controlled pacing protocols, we performed
   restitution curves for left ventricular developed pressure and
   {[}Ca2+](i) (developed pressure and {[}Ca2+](i) plotted as a function of
   extrasystolic intervals), To quantify restitution curves, we fitted
   monoexponential functions to plots and analyzed their shift and slope.
   Then, we used Ca2+ antagonists, low extracellular Ca2+({[}Ca2+](0)) and
   PESP to modify restitution curves. {[}Ca2+](i) transients in isolated
   rat hearts were interpreted as Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic
   reticulum. Results: Interval-dependent changes in developed pressure
   were strongly correlated to interval-dependent changes in the amplitude
   of {[}Ca2+](i) transients in isolated whole rat hearts. Additionally,
   nifedipine and low {[}Ca2+](0) led to similar downward shifts but not to
   a changed slope of restitution curves for {[}Ca2+](i). On the other
   hand, PESP increased the slope of restitution curves for {[}Ca2+](i),
   Furthermore, the effect of PESP on developed pressure was blunted by
   high concentrations of Ca2+ antagonists. Conclusions: The results from
   isolated muscles about {[}Ca2+](i) transients underlying the
   interval-force relationship could be substantiated in whole hearts.
   Additionally, low {[}Ca2+](i) (induced by nifedipine or low {[}Ca2+](0))
   decreased the maximal Ca2+ release of the sarcoplasmic reticulum but did
   not change the release kinetics. On the other hand, PESP presumably
   accelerated Ca2+ release kinetics of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) inhibits the proteolytic
   activity of several matrix metalloproteinases centrally involved in
   tumor invasion and metastases, The purpose of this study was to
   determine the origin of TIMP-1 mRNA production in both human colorectal
   cancer (CRC) and metastatic liver lesions as well as define the
   relationships between TIMP-1 RNA expression and standard
   clinicopathological variables of CRC, Total cellular RNA, extracted from
   56 CRC and 10 liver metastases, were examined by Northern blot
   hybridization, The mean/normal mucosa fold increase of TIMP-1 RNA was
   significantly elevated in both CRC (12.1 +/- 1.7) and liver metastases
   (10.0 +/- 3.6), No relationship was noted between TIMP-1 expression and
   tumor size, location nor differentiation. Based on lymph node metastases
   status, significantly higher TIMP-1 RNA levels were found in CRC with
   metastases than in those without metastases (15.6 +/- 3.3 versus 7.9 +/-
   1.3) (P = 0.04), Similarly, TIMP-1 RNA levels were higher in primary CRC
   with distant metastases than those without distant metastases (17.6 +/-
   4.1 versus 9.3 +/- 1.9) (P = 0.04), In situ hybridization localized
   TIMP-1 mRNA predominantly in tumor stroma within spindle fibroblast-like
   cells rather than in cancer cells themselves, The correlation between
   the increased TIMP-1 mRNA level and advanced CRC stage noted in this
   study reflects a possible growth-promoting function for TIMP-1 in human
   CRC.}},

   concentrations in the water-deprived camels were significantly higher,
   rate of drug elimination was slower, the volume of distribution was
   significantly smaller, and total body clearance was significantly slower

   were lower in the water deprived camels after i.m. dosing, the mean

   significantly smaller than in the normal camels, Water-deprivation was
   thought to cause reduced rate of tylosin elimination by the liver, as
   was shown for antipyrine - a drug which is eliminated from the body
   exclusively by the liver. Redistribution of tylosin in tissues
   concomitant with a greater proportion of drug in blood and extracellular
   fluid of water-deprived camels was suggested as a partial explanation
   for the higher serum drug levels seen after i.v. dosing. The low i.m.

Abstract = {{Ciguatera fish poisoning is an important public health problem wherever
   humans consume tropical and subtropical fish. It accounts for over half
   of fish-related poisonings in the United States but is uncommonly
   diagnosed and underreported. Produced by dinoflagellates, ciguatoxin
   accumulates up the food chain in herbivorous and carnivorous fishes.
   Cnidaria (jellyfish and related invertebrates) have not previously been
   associated with direct ciguatera intoxication in humans. We report the
   first case of ciguatera fish poisoning associated with cnidarian
   ingestion. A 12-year-old Tongan female presented to our Emergency
   Department with mid-abdominal pain, nausea, change in mental status, and
   new-onset movement disorder after ingestion of jellyfish imported from
   American Samoa. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by strongly positive
   serum identification of ciguatoxin and related polyether toxins
   (including okadaic acid) with a rapid extraction method (REM) and highly
   reliable solid-phase immunobead assay (S-PIA) performed by the Food
   Toxicology Research Group, University of Arizona. Ciguatera
   pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis
   (including consideration of palytoxin poisoning), and treatment are
   briefly reviewed. We emphasize the growing incidence of ciguatera fish
   poisoning outside `'high-risk'' areas, In regions with immigrant
   populations, privately imported exotic fish may be toxin vectors. Marine
   species other than carnivorous fish are now suspect in human ciguatera
   intoxication, Reliable tests can aid in premarket fish testing,
   diagnosis, and follow-up of ciguatera fish poisoning. The global
   prevalence of marine toxins demands fishermen, consumers, and physicians
   maintain a high index of suspicion for ciguatera fish poisoning.}},

Journal = {{ANESTHESIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evidence suggests that inhalational anesthetics interact
   with the nitric oxide-guanylyl cyclase signaling pathway in the central
   nervous system and that the inhibition of this pathway in brain may
   result in an anesthetic, analgesic, or sedative effect, The mechanism of
   the effects of inhalational anesthetics on this signaling pathway is not
   clear, This study attempted to determine whether inhalational
   anesthetics directly affect soluble or particulate guanylyl cyclase
   activity in a partially isolated enzyme system.
   Methods: The effects of halothane (0.44-4.4\%), enflurane (1.34-6.7\%),
   and isoflurane (0.6-5.0\%) on basal or stimulated soluble or particulate
   guanylyl cyclase activity were examined, Soluble guanylyl cyclase was
   isolated from whole rat brain and was stimulated by sodium nitroprusside
   or nitric oxide. Particulate guanylyl cyclase was isolated from rat
   olfactory bulb and was stimulated by rat atrial natriuretic
   peptide((1-28)). Cyclic guanosine monophosphate content was measured by
   radioimmunoassay, The concentrations of anesthetics in the incubation
   solution were confirmed by gas chromatography methods,
   Results: None of the three anesthetics affected the activity of basal or
   stimulated soluble or particulate guanylyl cyclase at the concentrations
   examined in the current experimental conditions.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that halothane, enflurane, and
   isoflurane do not directly interact with soluble or particulate guanylyl
   cyclases of rat brain.}},

Abstract = {{WE have recently shown that light, over a narrow range of low

   amacrine cells of the chicken retina. In this paper, we show that over
   the same range of low light intensities the rate of melatonin synthesis
   in both the retina and the pineal of the chicken is suppressed. We
   further show that the effects of light on the pineal at these low
   intensities are mediated by the retina and not by direct actions on the
   pineal. Combined with our evidence that dopaminergic pathways within the
   retina are involved in controlling the state of activity of the pineal,
   these results suggest, but do not prove, that the change in state of a
   microcircuit within the retina involving the photoreceptors,

   the reaction p((p) over right arrow, pi(0)) from threshold to 1 GeV have
   been measured. The outgoing pi(0) was detected by a 4 pi neutral meson
   spectrometer. Our data are compared with the corresponding np-->NN pi(+)
   reactions. The isoscalar partial cross sections are extracted from the
   relevant total cross sections. They are significant throughout the whole
   energy range. Below the Delta-region, energy-integrated differential
   cross sections show a large anisotropy difference between the neutral
   and charged pion channels, respectively. A partial-wave fit shows that
   the initial T = 0 state is dominated by the D-3(1) wave in this energy
   region. Finally, predictions of phenomenological models give reasonable
   good account of the measured observables but cannot reproduce the sign
   of the asymmetries.}},

Abstract = {{A QUANTITATIVE study of the distribution of dendritic spines was carried
   out in three orders of dendritic branches of granule cells from the
   dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus. Golgi-stained preparations (7-19
   neurones in each of seven rats) were analysed using computerized
   microscopy. Identification of spines and quantification of stem-spine
   geometry was performed using a segmentation algorithm and a line
   skeleton transformation of dendritic images. Analysis of data using the
   statistics of point processes revealed that, in all three branch orders,
   the distribution of visible spines along dendrites was not evenly
   random, but included dense clusters of spines surrounding the dendritic
   stem (spine `collars'). Three-dimensional reconstructions from serial
   ultrathin sections have confirmed the presence of such spine groups. We
   speculate that spine collars represent a functional element in which
   associative synaptic plasicity is fostered by the proximity of
   individual synapses.}},

   explants from adult rats that closely mirror cell-cell interactions and
   in vivo tissue relationships within this ganglion provide a model for
   testing trophic factors. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT-3
   and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were tested for their ability,
   both individually and in combination, to support neuronal survival. NT-3
   was the strongest individual promoter of survival, while CNTF (a

Abstract = {{Purpose/Objective: To determine if the radiosensitivity of normal human
   skin fibroblasts, measured in early passage cultures, is significantly
   correlated with the degree of acute or late normal skin damage in
   patients treated for breast cancer with radiotherapy.
   Methods and Materials: In the 1970s, a series of breast cancer patients
   was treated at the Department of Oncology in Gothenburg, Sweden with
   postoperative irradiation to the parasternal region. Patients were
   treated bilaterally using different fractionation schedules and doses to
   the right and left fields. Peak acute reactions were scored on a
   six-point scale, and skin erythema was measured by reflectance
   spectrophotometry. Telangiectasia was graded over time on a six-point
   scale. In April 1992, two small skin biopsies were obtained from 22
   patients in two treatment groups (;i.e., four dose-fractionation
   schedules) and, using either delayed or immediate plating, fibroblast
   radiosensitivity was measured in early passage cultures by clonogenic
   survival, after high and low dose-rate irradiations. Survival at 2.0 Gy
   (SF2) was calculated from complete survival curves.
   Results: To test assay reproducibility, SF2 values derived from paired
   biopsies of the same patient (12 cases) were compared. A reasonably good
   correlation (p = 0.075) was obtained for SF2s determined by high
   dose-rate irradiations with immediate plating, but not for delayed
   plating or low dose-rate treatments. The median coefficient of variation
   in the replicate SF2s after high dose-rate treatment and immediate
   plating was 13\%, suggesting that the poor correlation In paired SF2
   values is due to the magnitude of the uncertainty in SF2 relative to the
   overall spread in SF2 values between patients (CV = 28\%). Individual
   SF2 values and averaged values from patients with data from two biopsies
   were compared with the acute and late clinical reactions. A significant
   negative correlation was found between SF2 and relative clinical
   response, but only when averaged high dose-rate SF2 values and
   telangiectasia scores were compared. There was no significant
   correlation between average SF2 values and acute responses or between
   individual SF2 measurements and either the acute or late clinical
   response.
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the degree of late
   telangiectasia is at least partially dependent upon the intrinsic
   cellular radiosensitivity of normal fibroblasts, but the relationship is
   not clear cut. Multiple replicate assays are necessary to obtain
   reliable estimates of fibroblast SF2 values using current techniques.}},

   LiBr and NMP stirred over P2O5 were used as mobile phases for four of
   the polyimides; NMP with 0.06 M LiBr tetrahydrofuran (THF) and
   chloroform served as mobile phases for the other two polyimides. For all
   the samples the stationary phase in the SEC columns was cross-linked
   polystyrene beads. Molecular weight averages of the polyimides were
   calculated using universal SEC calibration with polystyrene standards in
   each solvent. The agreement of the calculated molecular weight averages
   in the different solvents confirms that the universal SEC calibrations
   are Valid for these semiflexible polymers. There was good agreement with
   weight-average molecular weights obtained by low-angle laser light
   scattering (LALLS) performed in pure NMP. Intrinsic viscosity and
   molecular weight data for a series of nine samples of one polyimide
   covering a M(w) = 20,000-70,000 g mol(-1) interval were treated to
   obtain Mark-Houwink-Sakurada constants. Unperturbed chain dimensions of
   this polyimide were obtained by application of the Stockmayer-Fixman
   extrapolation procedure to these data. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   of amounts of evolutionary change that have accumulated along analogous
   branches in the host and parasite trees provides a direct assessment of
   relative rates of evolution in the two groups. Far such a comparison to
   be meaningful, the features compared in the hosts and parasites should
   be genetically based, evolutionarily homologous, and should evolve in a
   roughly time-dependent fashion within each group. Nucleotide sequences
   encoding homologous genes in hosts and parasites are an ideal source of
   data for comparative studies of evolutionary rates. Recent studies of

   copies. Germ line mutations have not to be inherited, they can result
   from a spontaneous mutation occurring during gametogenesis in one
   parent. Persons with an inherited or de-novo germ line mutation have

   channel KAT1 is structurally more similar to animal
   depolarization-activated (outward-rectifying) K+ channels than to animal
   hyperpolarization-activated K+ channels. To gain insight into the
   structural basis for the opposite voltage dependences of plant
   inward-rectifying and animal outward-rectifying K+ channels, we
   constructed recombinant chimeric channels between the
   hyperpolarization-activated K+ channel KAT1 and a Xenopus
   depolarization-activated K+ channel. We report here that two of the
   chimeric constructs, which contain the first third of the KAT1 sequence,
   including the first four membrane-spanning segments (S1-S4) and the
   linker sequence between the fourth and fifth membrane-spanning segments,
   express functional channels that retain activation by hyperpolarization,
   but not depolarization. These two chimeric channels are no longer
   selective for K+. The chimeras are selective for cations over anions and
   are permeable to Ca2+. Therefore, unlike animal
   hyperpolarization-activated K+ channels, in which the carboxyl terminus
   is important for inward rectification induced by Mg2+ and polyamine
   block, the plant KAT1 channel has its major determinants for inward
   rectification in the amino-terminal region, which ends at the end of the

   For each packing, the relationship between mobile phase flow-rate,
   column backpressure, and radial compression pressure is determined. A
   model is proposed to explain this relationship and determine the radial
   compression pressure needed to maintain the column effectively
   compressed at each operating flow-rate. The chromatographic efficiency
   of these columns is also determined. When an adequate radial compression
   level is used, the efficiency of the preparative-scale system is nearly
   the same as that of analytical-scale columns. Applying incremental
   levels of radial compression can also lead to a restoration of the
   efficiency of columns whose performance was degraded by operation at low

   major heat shock factor regulating the heat stress response. However, on
   transient expression in Drosophila and human cells, ATHSF1 fails to
   exhibit proper regulation, as demonstrated by constitutive binding to
   DNA, and by constitutive expression of a chloramphenicol
   acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of the
   Drosophila hsp70 promoter. These results suggest that the regulation of
   ATHSF1 is normally dependent on a specific factor that inhibits the
   DNA-binding and transcriptional activities under non-heat shock
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To assess the prevalence and severity of acne vulgaris in
   adolescent students.
   Method. 867 students in Auckland sixth and seventh form classes were
   interviewed on the subject of acne vulgaris. Of these 847 students were
   examined and graded for severity of their acne using a modification of
   the Leeds technique which ranks severity according to number, extent and
   nature of the acne lesion.
   Results. Ninety-one percent of males and 19\% of females had some acne.
   Severe acne was present in 6.9\% males and 1.1\% females. Severe and
   moderately severe acne was significantly more common in males (OR = 2.6
   95\% Cl 1.78 < OR < 3.9). In the univariate analysis there was no
   association of moderately severe and severe acne with parental
   occupational group nor ethnicity.
   Conclusion. Moderate and severe acne is a common finding in Auckland
   senior high school classes with males being more affected than females.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the molecular basis for differences in the
   characteristics of bombesin (Bn) and m3 muscarinic cholinergic (m3 ACh)
   receptors, chimeric Bn receptors possessing cytoplasmic domains from the
   m3 ACh receptor were produced. The receptors were expressed in CHO-KI
   cells and binding, structural, and signal transduction characteristics
   were analyzed. Cell lines bearing chimeric Bn receptors possessing m3
   ACh receptor domains in place of either the second cytoplasmic loop
   (BM2L), the third cytoplasmic loop (BM3L), or both loops (BM23L) each
   bound I-125-bombesin with a single affinity that was approximately the
   same as that of the Bn receptor (5-10 nM). However, Bn receptors
   possessing the m3 ACh third cytoplasmic loop were severely affected in
   other respects, Internalization of ligand in Bn and BM2L cells was rapid
   and extensive (>80\% of bound I-125-bombesin was acid-resistant). In
   contrast, internalization was dramatically reduced in BM3L and BM23L
   cells (similar to 20\% of bound I-125-bombesin was acid-resistant). In
   Bn or BM2L cells 10 nM bombesin stimulated similar to 10-fold increases
   in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Activation of Bn receptors also
   induced an increase in arachidonic acid release (478 +/- 32\% of
   control, n = 3) and large increases in intracellular Ca2+. In contrast,
   in BM3L or BM23L cells, bombesin had no significant effect on
   phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Furthermore, BM3L receptor activation
   did not increase arachidonic acid release. However, BM3L and BM23L cells
   showed a small increase in intracellular Ca2+ at high concentrations of
   bombesin. These data indicate that the third cytoplasmic loop alone, or
   together with the second cytoplasmic loop, was not sufficient to
   transfer the characteristics of G protein interaction between m3 ACh and
   bombesin receptors. Furthermore, for the Bn receptor, ligand
   internalization does, whereas formation of the high affinity binding
   state does not, appear to require activation of G proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of the oral bacterium Streptococcus sobrinus HG977 onto glass
   (water contact angle 0 degrees) and onto FEP-Teflon
   (fluoroethylenepropylene; water contact angle 110 degrees)was studied in
   a parallel-plate flow chamber in the presence and absence of polyclonal
   antibodies (pAb) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) adsorbed onto the
   cells. The zeta potentials of the bacteria ranged from -7.1 to -8.5 mV
   at pH 6.8 and were not affected by the presence of pAb or mAbs.
   Hydrophobicity (by water contact angles) increased from 30 degrees (no
   antibodies) to 88 degrees in the presence of pAb adsorbed onto the
   bacterial cell surface. The untreated S. sobrinus had a greater tendency
   to adhere to glass (44.5 x 10(6) cm(-2)) than to FEP-Teflon (18.3 x
   10(6) cm(-2)), in accordance with thermodynamic modelling. After
   preincubation of S. sobrinus with pAb, its clear preference for adhesion
   to glass disappeared as expected from its increased hydrophobicity.
   Although for S. sobrinus preincubated with OMVU10 no difference was
   found in hydrophobicity in comparison to the untreated bacteria, the
   number of bacteria adhering to glass decreased to 10.2 x 10(6) cm(-2)
   Formation of bacterial aggregates was found when S. sobrinus,
   preincubated with pAb or OMVU10, adhered to glass and FEP. This was also
   observed when untreated bacteria adhered to glass coated with OMVU10, or
   to FEP coated with OMVU10 or pAb. Adhesion in these experiments is
   therefore thought to occur via near-neighbour collection induced by the
   presence of pAb or mAbs. Low numbers of bacteria were removed from glass
   after draining the flow cell, whereas high numbers of untreated bacteria
   and bacteria preincubated with OMVU10 were removed from FEP. S. sobrinus
   cells preincubated with pAb were not removed but piled up. It was
   concluded that the adhesion of untreated S. sobrinus and S. sobrinus
   preincubated with pAb is in accordance with thermodynamic modelling,
   based on the overall wettability of the cell surfaces, whereas the
   adhesion of S. sobrinus preincubated with OMVU10 may be through
   localized interactions, not expressed in overall surface properties.}},

Abstract = {{Cys662 is one of the 12 cysteine residues proposed to be co-ordination
   sites for binding of three Zn(II) in Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase
   I. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to convert Cys662 to
   either serine or histidine. The mutant enzymes were overexpressed and
   purified to homogeneity. Analysis of the purified enzymes demonstrated
   that the mutations resulted in loss of one tightly bound Zn(lI). In vivo
   complementation tests and in vitro relaxation activity assays at
   different temperatures showed that the partial relaxation activities
   retained in the two mutant enzymes were temperature sensitive.
   Fluorescence measurements indicated that the wild-type and mutant
   enzymes have structural differences. When DNA cleavage specificity was
   examined, the mutant enzymes were found to have altered cleavage site
   preferences. The preferred cleavage sites of the wild-type enzyme all
   had a cytosine residue four nucleotides to the minus side of the break.
   The cleavage sites produced by the mutant enzymes did not show a
   preference for cytosine at that position. (C) 1995 Academic Press

Abstract = {{The laser photolytic production of the IO radical from N2O/I-2/N-2
   mixtures was used to measure the radical absorption spectrum from 340 to
   450 nm. Two new absorption peaks at 403 and 411 nm were observed along
   with an underlying continuum starting at about 420 nm and extending to
   about 350 nm. An absorption cross section of (2.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(-17)
   cm(2), in good agreement with previous measurements, was determined for
   the (4-0) band head at 427.2 nm. From the rate of formation of IO and
   the rate of loss of I-2, rate constants for the reactions O + I-2 --> IO
   + I and O + IO --> O-2 + I of (1.4 +/- 0.4) x 10(-10) and (1.2 +/- 0.5)
   x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1), respectively, were derived. Finally, from the
   rate of decay of IO, a rate constant for the reaction IO + IO -->
   products of (8.0 +/- 1.8) x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1) was obtained. All of the
   uncertainties expressed are 2 standard deviations derived from the

Abstract = {{The effect of opioids on NO production by LPS-stimulated murine
   macrophages 5774 has been investigated. Morphine (mu and k opioid
   receptor agonist), DAGO (selective mu receptor agonist) and U50-488H
   (selective k receptor agonist), added (10(-10)-10(-6) M) to the cells
   0.5 h before activation with LPS, significantly inhibited NO production.
   This effect was reverted by naloxone (10(-12)-10(-8) M), an opioid
   specific antagonist. In contrast, DPDPE and deltorphin II respectively
   delta(1) and delta(2), receptor agonists (10(-10)-10(-6) M) did not
   affect NO generation. Morphine was not able to inhibit NO production
   when added after LPS challenge. The results of the present study
   indicate that opioids are able to inhibit NO formation in LPS-activated
   macrophages through the involvement of specific opioid receptors.
   Moreover, the ability of morphine to inhibit NO production only when
   given before LPS challenge suggests that the opiate inhibits the
   induction but not the activity of the inducible NO synthase. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{High-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of H-1 nuclei directly bonded to
   N-14 nuclei can be extracted from two-dimensional H-1/N-14 heteronuclear
   correlation spectra of single crystal samples. The H-1 resonances are
   asymmetric triplets, since the heteronuclear dipole-dipole interaction
   between a spin one-half H-1 and a spin one N-14 is influenced by the
   large N-14 quadrupole coupling constant and can be observed in both N-14
   fundamental (Delta m = 1) and N-14 overtone (Delta m = 2) spectra. N-14
   fundamental spectra have two resonances for each magnetically distinct
   N-14 nucleus, each of which is a doublet in the heteronuclear
   correlation spectra; the asymmetric H-1 triplets can be reconstructed
   from the doublets of both resonances. N-14 overtone spectra are simpler,
   since they have a single asymmetric H-1 triplet associated with a single
   N-14 resonance for each magnetically distinct N-14 nucleus. H-1 chemical
   shift frequencies, the splittings from H-1/N-14 heteronuclear
   dipole-dipole couplings, N-14 quadrupole splittings, and N-14
   second-order shifts can all be measured with both fundamental and
   overtone H-1/N-14 heteronuclear correlation spectra. In addition, the
   H-1 and N-14 resonance frequencies for the bonded hydrogen and nitrogen
   nuclei are correlated in these spectra. The spectral parameters from
   asymmetric H-1/N-14 triplets are demonstrated to offer substantial
   advantages over those of the corresponding symmetric N-14/H-1 doublets
   for determining structures of peptides by solid-state NMR spectroscopy,
   even though both sets of parameters arise from the same dipole-dipole
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The histone fold motif has previously been identified as a structural
   feature common to all four core histones and is involved in both
   histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions. Through the use of a novel
   motif searching method, a group of proteins containing the histone fold
   motif has been established, The proteins in this group are involved in a
   wide variety of functions related mostly to DNA metabolism. Most of
   these proteins engage in protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, as
   do their core histone counterparts. Among these, the CCAAT-specific
   transcription factor CBF and its yeast homologue HAP are two examples of
   multimeric complexes with different component subunits that contain the
   histone fold motif. The histone fold proteins are distantly related,
   with a relatively small degree of absolute sequence similarity. It is
   proposed that these proteins may share a similar three-dimensional
   conformation despite the lack of significant sequence similarity.}},

Abstract = {{Meteorological observations from the Viking landers showed that
   baroclinic waves an Mars are much more periodic than those seen on
   Earth. A global circulation model of the Martian atmosphere, with
   simplified parametrizations of heating and friction, has been used to
   examine baroclinic waves in the parameter range appropriate to the
   Martian atmosphere. Two distinct flow regimes are found to be dependent
   on the magnitude of thermal and frictional dissipation. The flow is
   composed of small-amplitude disturbances propagating around a zonally
   oriented midlatitude jet in an irregular fashion or a highly persistent
   large-amplitude zonal wavenumber 3 wave. The large-amplitude waves are
   much like those seen in differentially heated rotating annuli. It is
   shown that the large amplitude waves are not the linearly most unstable
   modes of the system, rather nonlinear effects are dominant. Attractor
   reconstructions, using empirical orthogonal functions, show the regime
   transition as a bifurcation from a messy aperiodic attractor to, what is
   essentially, a limit cycle. Analysis of the potential vorticity budgets
   of the large-amplitude waves shows that a large free mode component is
   present. A mechanism is suggested whereby the sources and sinks of
   potential vorticity balance departures from the free mode form, thus
   maintaining the large-amplitude waves.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of concomitant intravenous administration of acetazolamide on
   cyclosporin's pharmacokinetic parameters has been studied in rabbits.
   The study design was parallel: the control group of six rabbits received
   cyclosporin alone, while cyclosporin and acetazolamide were
   co-administered to six rabbits in the second group. Serial blood samples
   were collected for 24 h following administration of drugs. Cyclosporin
   concentrations were determined using a specific monoclonal
   radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters of cyclosporin were derived
   using compartmental and non-compartmental techniques. Concomitant
   administration of acetazolamide with cyclosporin resulted in a
   significant increase in the terminal elimination half-life of
   cyclosporin, a significant decrease in cyclosporin total body clearance,
   and a significant increase in the steady-state volume of distribution
   relative to the control group. The mean residence time of cyclosporin in
   the peripheral tissue was dramatically increased with the administration
   of acetazolamide. The results of this investigation demonstrate a
   possible interaction between acetazolamide and cyclosporin. The most
   plausible explanation for this is an alteration in the disposition
   kinetics of cyclosporin. Adjusting the dose of cyclosporin may be
   required in patients with uveitis receiving both cyclosporin and
   acetazolamide.}},

Abstract = {{When platelets are stimulated by the addition of thrombin, a series of
   temporally linked signaling events are initiated. Some of the early
   events are needed to engage the integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa in a
   high-affinity state. This in turn leads to aggregation, which initiates
   a wave of events distinct from those triggered by thrombin. Platelet
   responses are sensitive to protein serine/threonine phosphatase
   inhibitors, but which events are dependent on protein phosphatase
   activity is not known. In the present studies, the effect of the
   phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A on aggregation-induced signaling was
   examined. The addition of 0.2 unit/mL thrombin caused
   aggregation-dependent redistribution of cytoskeletal proteins (actin
   binding protein, talin, vinculin, and alpha-actinin), glycoproteins
   (GPIIb-IIIa, PECAM), and signaling molecules (PI3-kinase, pp60(c-src))
   to the cytoskeletal fraction of platelets. Addition of 1-2 mu M
   calyculin A blocked the ability of 0.2 unit/mL thrombin to induce
   aggregation and the association of these molecules with the
   cytoskeleton. Aggregation (60-80\% of control) was restored if 1 unit/mL
   thrombin was added, but there was no corresponding redistribution of
   actin binding protein, talin, vinculin, alpha-actinin, GPIIb-IIIa,
   PECAM, PD-kinase, and pp60(c-src) to the cytoskeleton. Treatment of
   platelets with calyculin A resulted in an increase in the
   phosphorylation state of a membrane skeletal protein of 50 kDa. These
   data strongly suggest that platelet aggregation is dissociable from
   aggregation-induced signaling, which is dependent on type 1 and 2A
   phosphatase activities.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation shows that the alpha(2) beta(2) tryptophan synthase
   bienzyme complex from Salmonella typhimurium is subject to monovalent
   metal ion activation, The effects of the monovalent metal ions Na+ and
   K+ were investigated using rapid scanning stopped-flow (RSSF),
   single-wavelength stopped-flow (SWSF), and steady-state techniques. RSSF
   measurements of individual steps in the reaction of L-serine and indole
   to give L-trytophan (the beta-reaction) as well as the reaction of
   3-indole-D-glycerol 3'-phosphate (IGP) with L-serine (the alpha
   beta-reaction) demonstrate that monovalent metal ions such as Na+ and K+
   change the distribution of intermediates in both the transient and
   steady states, Therefore the metal ion effect alters relative
   ground-state energies and the relative positions of ground- and
   transition-state energies. The RSSF spectra and SWSF time courses show
   that the turnover of indole is significantly reduced in the absence of
   either Na+ or K+, The alpha-aminoacrylate Schiff base species, E(A-A),
   is in a less active state in the absence of monovalent metal ions. Na+
   decreases the steady-state rate of IGP cleavage (the alpha-reaction) to
   about 30\% of the value obtained in the absence of metal ions,
   Steady-state investigations show that in the absence of monovalent metal
   ions the alpha- and alpha beta-reactions have the same activity. Naf
   binding gives a 30-fold stimulation of the alpha-reaction when the
   beta-site is in the E(A-A) form. This study demonstrates that the
   presence of saturating amounts of monovalent metal ions is an important
   element both for catalysis at the beta-site and for the allosteric
   linkage between the alpha- and beta-sites in the bienzyme complex.
   Theoretical models that describe the monovalent metal ion effect are
   discussed and tested with the help of computer simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Diseases that affect the striatum produce movement disorders, for which
   rats have been a useful model. To determine the organization of
   functional, neural activity in the rat striatum related to motor
   activity, we used electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and
   {[}C-14]deoxyglucose autoradiography. The stimulation produced movements
   of each of three body regions. Both the motor and somatosensory cortex
   were activated. Image analysis was used to objectively localize peak
   activation and to provide a map for further stereotaxic and localization
   studies. In the anterior striatum, in the dorsolateral sector, regions
   of peak activation were well separated for each body region: the
   hindlimb peak activation was dorsomedial, the forelimb ventrolateral and
   vibrissae medial. Also, the activation fields were larger in anterior
   than in posterior striatum. Furthermore, activation ipsilateral to
   movement was present and the peak localization was offset from peaks
   contralateral to movement. In addition, there were activation regions in
   lateral striatum where body region representations may overlap. This is
   the first demonstration of a global striatal somatotopy that separates
   the limbs and vibrissae in rats. The functional average revealed by the
   deoxyglucose autoradiography showed a predominant isotropic or rod-like
   representation of sensorimotor activity for the limbs in striatum during
   movement and confirms aspects of the anatomy known for the
   corticostriate system in primates: metabolism was `patchy,' and extended
   throughout long anteroposterior domains in striatum. These extensive and
   patchy arrangements suggest integrative, combinational and/or
   associative networks.}},

Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of the somata originating the corticospinal tract was
   examined in 24 species of mammals to identify commonalities and major
   sources of variation among the different species. Horseradish peroxidase
   was applied to a hemisection of the spinal cord at the C1-C2 junction.
   After tetramethylbenzidine processing, the labeled somata throughout the
   cerebral cortex were plotted and counted. Then, 23 morphological
   characteristics of the corticospinal somata were examined, including
   their number, size, and density across the cortical surface.
   The results show that morphological characteristics of corticospinal
   somata are closely related to an animal's body, brain, and cerebral
   cortex size. That is, mammals with large neocortical surfaces tend to
   have larger as well as more corticospinal somata; mammals with large
   bodies tend to have corticospinal somata that are less densely
   distributed. Moreover, the probable increase in the ratio of local
   noncorticospinal somata to corticospinal somata implies that the
   evolution of the corticospinal tract was accomplished by an increase in
   `'support'' or `'server'' cells as well as an increase in the size of
   the tract itself.
   The results also show that several characteristics are reliably related
   to an animal's taxonomic classification and hence its ancestry.
   Comparisons among three mammalian lineages indicate that some
   characteristics may have changed uniquely in the anthropoid primate
   lineage, and thus, presumably, in the human lineage. The results suggest
   that if morphological characteristics of the corticospinal tract
   important in the evolution of the specialized motor abilities in
   anthropoid primates are sought, then examination of the role of changes
   in soma diameter, rostral (motor)/caudal (sensory) ratios of density,
   concentration, surface density, and volume density may be more
   instructive than examination of the total number of corticospinal
   neurons alone. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   is not straightforward because the orientation of the impact parameter
   is not known a priori: it must be estimated event by event from the
   particles produced in the collision, and these estimates are generally
   subject to large statistical fluctuations due to the finite

Abstract = {{Simulations, described in the previous paper, by nonequilibrium
   molecular dynamics of stress relaxation in a model polymer melt of
   freely jointed chains with N = 200 bonds exhibited an incipient plateau,
   followed by a period in which the relaxing stress corresponded to the
   entropic stress with an entanglement length of N-e = 40 bonds. This
   paper describes two types of diagnostic subroutines used to search for
   the entanglements or obstacles responsible for these phenomena. The
   first examined the rate of separation of initially neighboring
   interchain atom pairs but did not serve to uncover many topological
   entanglements. The second introduced a measure of time-averaged atomic
   mobility and found that intrachain atoms of relatively low mobility
   tended to cluster in groups along the chain. The average spacing between
   clusters appears to introduce a new length scale in polymer melts that
   is independent of the conventional picture of interchain entanglements.

Abstract = {{Transport of iron(III) hydroxamates across the inner membrane of
   Escherichia coli depends on a binding protein-dependent transport system
   composed of the FhuB,C and D proteins. The FhuD protein, which is
   synthesized as a precursor and exported through the cytoplasmic
   membrane, represents the periplasmic binding protein of the system,
   accepting as substrates a number of hydroxamate siderophores and the
   antibiotic albomycin. A FhuD derivative, carrying an N-terminal His-tag
   sequence instead of its signal sequence and therefore not exported
   through the inner membrane, was purified from the cytoplasm. Functional
   activity, comparable to that of wild-type FhuD, was demonstrated for
   this His-tag-FhuD in vitro by protease protection experiments in the
   presence of different substrates, and in vivo by reconstitution of iron
   transport in a fhuD mutant strain. The experimental data demonstrate
   that the primary sequence of the portion corresponding to the mature
   FhuD contains all the information required for proper folding of the
   polypeptide chain into a functional solute-binding protein. Moreover,
   purification of modified periplasmic proteins from the cytosol may be a
   useful approach for recovery of many polypeptides which are normally
   exported across the inner membrane and can cause toxicity problems when
   overproduced.}},

   polyelectrolytes in solution. The fundamental model for polyelectrolytes
   in solution is studied, Specifically, simulations are performed for
   multichain systems of a flexible chain model of charged polymers. The
   full Coulomb interactions of the monomers and counterions are treated
   explicitly. Experimental measurements of the osmotic pressure and the
   structure factor are reproduced. The simulations reveal a new picture of
   the chain structure based on calculations of the structure factor,
   persistence length, end-to-end distance, etc. We present a detailed
   discussion of the chain structure and a comparison with present
   theories. In contrast to the predicted dilute limit of rodlike chains,
   we find that the chains have significant bending at very low densities.
   Furthermore, the chains contract significantly before they overlap. We
   also show that counterion condensation dramatically alters the chain
   structure. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{The beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the lepidopteran insect
   cell line Sf21 has been studied using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides
   and chromogenic synthetic glycosides as substrates. Ultracentrifugation
   experiments indicated that the insect cell beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase
   exists in a soluble and a membrane-bound form. This latter form
   accounted for two-thirds of the total activity and was associated with
   vesicles of the same density as those containing GlcNAc transferase I.
   Partial membrane association of the enzyme was observed with all
   substrates tested, i.e. 4-nitrophenyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminide,
   tri-N-acetylchitotriose, and an N-linked biantennary
   agalactooligosaccharide. Inhibition studies indicated a single enzyme to
   be responsible for the hydrolysis of all these substrates. With the
   biantennary substrate, the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase exclusively
   removed beta-N-acetylglucosamine from the alpha 1,3-antenna.
   GlcNAcMan(5)GlcNAc(2), the primary product of GlcNAc-transferase I, was
   not perceptibly hydrolyzed.
   beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidases with the same branch specificity were also
   found in the lepidopteran cell lines Bm-N and Mb-0503. In contrast,
   beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities from rat or frog (Xenopus
   laevis) liver and from mung bean seedlings were not membrane-bound, and
   they did not exhibit a strict branch specificity. An involvement of this
   unusual beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in the processing of
   asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in insects is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is suggested to play
   an important role in both the antiviral and antiproliferative arms of
   the interferon response. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms
   underlying PKR's growth regulatory properties, we examined the
   biological and biochemical properties of PKR variants containing either
   a mutation in catalytic domain II (PKR-M1) or a deletion of RNA binding
   domain I (PKR-M7) in both reticulocyte translation extracts and in vitro
   kinase assays with purified reagents and compared these results with
   those using the same mutants stably expressed in vivo. While wild-type
   PKR (PKR-WT) efficiently inhibited mRNA translation in a reticulocyte
   extract, the inactive PKR-M1 had no effect. The PKR-M7 mutant was
   modestly inhibitory in this assay. The PKR-M1 variant was able to
   reverse the translational inhibitory effects and increased eukaryotic
   initiation factor (eLF)-2 alpha phosphorylation levels caused by
   addition of double stranded RNA to reticulocyte extract, whereas PKR-M7
   could not. Both PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 functioned as transdominant inhibitors
   of PKR-WT in our in vitro kinase assays. While the inhibition by PKR-M1
   required a vast excess of mutant to shut down PKR function, PKR-M7
   inhibited PKR-WT at approximately stoichiometric levels. To complement
   these experiments, we compared growth rates and alpha phosphorylation
   levels in transformed cell lines overexpressing either PKR-M1 or PKR-M7.
   Levels of endogenous eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation were significantly more
   diminished in PKR-M7 overexpressing cells compared with PKR-M1. These
   paradoxical data will be discussed in terms of the potential molecular
   mechanisms underlying malignant transformation caused by the PKR
   variants.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of the erratic seasonal variation in the sizes of some insect
   pest populations are largely unknown, but they are believed to be
   associated, at least in part, with environmental change. The attendant
   lack of predictability makes the control of insect pests difficult,
   resulting in substantial losses. In a model simulation study, using
   parameter values based on field data, it is shown that under certain
   conditions a population experiencing regular periodic cycles (therefore
   being predictable) can become chaotic (i.e. erratic) in the absence of
   changes in environmental factors. Moreover, after a time the population
   returns to regular stable cycles. The process recurs and represents an
   intrinsic characteristic of the system. This phenomenon, known as
   intermittency, occurs when certain variables have values that place the
   system near the transition point between order and chaos. This discovery
   may help explain the erratic behaviour of some insect pest population
   and aid in developing better biological control measures. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{A high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass
   spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) method is presented that allows rapid and
   accurate determination of amino acid chiral purity in a peptide.
   Peptides are hydrolyzed in hydrochloric acid-d(1)/acetic acid-d(4) and
   then converted to diastereomers by derivatization with
   1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5 -L-alanine amide (FDAA, Marfey's reagent).
   Mixtures of D- and L-amino acid diastereomeric pairs are resolved in one
   chromatographic separation using conventional reversed-phase
   high-performance liquid chromatography. Hydrolysis in a deuterated
   solvent is necessary because the original ratio of D-/L-amino acids
   present in a peptide changes during acid hydrolysis due to racemization.
   Peptide hydrolysis in deuterated acids circumvents this problem by
   labeling each amino acid that racemizes with one deuterium at the
   ct-carbon. An increase in molecular mass of one atomic mass unit allows
   racemized amino acids to be distinguished from non-racemized amino acids
   by mass spectrometry. This procedure was used to determine the chiral
   purity of each amino acid in a purified, hexapeptide by-product
   (Arg-Lys-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr) present in a kilogram batch of the synthetic
   pentapeptide, thymopentin (Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr).}},

Abstract = {{2',3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddC) is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits HIV-1
   replication in vitro and is currently used in AIDS therapy. This
   compound exerts a delayed cytotoxicity due to inhibition of
   mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) synthesis. We have found that long term
   exposure of U937 human monoblastoid cells to ddC allowed the selection
   of a drug-resistant cell line (U937-R) with 66\% mDNA normal ddC
   transport and altered deoxycytidine kinase kinetic properties. In this
   paper we show that U937-R cells contain an increased number of
   mitochondria per cell and a reduced copy number of mDNA/mitochondria.
   Furthermore, the intracellular concentrations of deoxycytidine
   5'-triphosphate (dCTP) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP)
   are also reduced although with a higher dCTP/ddCTP ratio in U937-R
   compared to the parental cells. This mechanism of drug resistance, with
   drug-resistance based on viral mutations, can provide an explanation for
   drug failure in antiviral therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent mitogen for many cell
   lineages including fetal cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, bFGF has been
   shown to modify gene expression, in vitro, in adult nonproliferative
   ventricular myocytes. This effect is suspected to be partly responsible
   for the genetic modifications that occur in vivo under
   pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia or pressure overload and
   that lead to myocardial hypertrophy. However, little is known about the
   first steps of the molecular mechanisms that take place soon after cell
   activation by bFGF. In this study, using bio chemical and
   electrophysiological approaches, we have established, on cardiomyocytes
   cultured from neonatal rat ventricles, that (i) differentiated beating
   cells express at least two classes of bFGF-receptors having high and low
   affinity (K-d = 10 +/- 2 pM and 1 +/- 0.5 nM); (ii) the stimulation of
   these bFGF receptors promotes an increase in the beating frequencies of
   cultured cardiomyocytes (40 +/- 10\%); (iii) bFGF provokes the
   activation of poorly specific and voltage-independent calcium channels
   (12pS); (iv) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate enhances similar bFGF-induced
   Ca2+ currents and is therefore suspected to be a second messenger
   triggering this activation. These results support the presence, in
   cultured cardiomyocytes, of new calcium channels whose activation after
   bFGF binding may be partly responsible for the cell response to this
   growth factor.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of confluent cultures of JAR human placental choriocarcinoma
   cells with staurosporine caused a marked stimulation of serotonin
   transport activity in these cells, The stimulatory effect was noticeable
   at nanomolar concentrations of staurosporine, and a treatment time of >4
   h was required for staurosporine to elicit the effect, At 40 nM and with
   a treatment time of 16 h, the stimulation of the transport activity was
   3.5-6.0-fold, None of the several other protein kinase inhibitors tested
   had similar effect except KT 5720, a protein kinase A inhibitor, which
   showed a small but significant (similar to 1.4-fold) stimulatory effect
   at a concentration of 5 mu M. Blockade of RNA synthesis and protein
   synthesis in the cells prevented completely the stimulation of the trans
   port activity induced by staurosporine. The stimulation was observed not
   only in intact cells but also in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from
   staurosporine-treated cells, The stimulation was accompanied by a
   5-7-fold increase in the steady state levels of the trans porter
   specific mRNAs, by a 7-fold increase in the maximal velocity of the
   transport process, and by a 6-fold increase in the transporter density
   in the plasma membrane, Even though both staurosporine and cholera toxin
   had similar effects on the serotonin transport activity in these cells,
   the effect was not additive when the cells were treated with both
   reagents together. While treatment of the cells with cholera toxin
   markedly elevated intracellular levels of cAMP, staurosporine did not
   have any effect on the cellular levels of this cyclic nucleotide. It is
   concluded that staurosporine up-regulates the serotonin transport
   activity in JAR cells by increasing the steady state levels of the
   serotonin transporter mRNA and by the consequent increase in the
   transporter density in the plasma membrane and that the process involves
   a cAMP-independent signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Leishmania parasites are exposed to pronounced changes in their
   environment during their life cycle as they migrate from the sandfly
   midgut to the insect proboscis and then into the phagolysosomes of the
   vertebrate macrophages. The developmental transformations that produce
   each life cycle stage of the parasite may be signaled in part by binding
   of environmental ligands to receptors which mediate transduction of
   extracellular signals. We have identified a family of five clustered
   genes in Leishmania donovani which may encode signal transduction
   receptors. The coding regions of two of these genes, designated rac-A
   and rac-B, have been sequenced and shown to code for proteins with an
   NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain, an intervening putative transmembrane
   segment, and a COOH-terminal domain that has high sequence identity to
   the catalytic domain from adenylate cyclases in other eukaryotes. We
   have expressed the receptor-adenylate cyclase protein (RAC)-A protein in
   Xenopus oocytes and demonstrated that it functions as an adenylate
   cyclase. Although RAC-B exhibits no catalytic activity when expressed in
   oocytes, co-expression of RAC-A and RAC-B negatively regulates the
   adenylate cyclase activity of RAC-A, suggesting that these two proteins
   interact in the membrane. Furthermore, a truncated version of RAC-A
   functions as a dominant negative mutant that inhibits the catalytic
   activity of the wild type receptor. The rac-A and rac-B genes encode
   developmentally regulated mRNAs which are expressed in the insect stage
   but not in the mammalian host stage of the parasite life cycle.}},

   portal vein contractions induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
   (PMA), noradrenaline, endotllelin-1 or KCl, with IC(50)s of 86 nM, 13 mu
   M, 11 mu M and 9 mu M, respectively. Jatrophone was equipotent to H-7,
   but 100 to 500 fold less potent than staurosporine. Jatrophone, H-7 and
   staurosporine, also dose-dependently inhibited rhythmic contractions of
   the rat portal-mesenteric vein with IC(50)s of 15 mu M, 9 mu M and 75
   nM, respectively. Jatrophone, H-7 and staurosporine caused graded
   relaxations of preparations contracted with endothelin-1 or PMA with
   IC(50)s of 12 and > 1000 mu M, 8 and 13 mu M and 7 and 12 nM,
   respectively. All three compounds caused graded inhibition of
   caffeine-induced contractions in Ca2+-free solution containing EGTA. The
   similarity between the vasorelaxant actions of jatrophone, staurosporine
   and H-7 in rat portal vein suggests that jatrophone acts, at least in
   part, through inhibition of PKC-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, like the
   PKC inhibitors, its vasorelaxant action may also involve other
   mechanisms unrelated to protein kinase C inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{Barley straw and a preparation of perennial ryegrass were sequentially
   extracted with oxalic acid, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and a
   `'cellulolytic'' enzyme preparation Driselase and the fractions studied
   by methylation analysis, C-13 NMR and other methods. Oxalic acid, as
   expected, solubilised the bulk of the arabinose and ferulic acid in both
   samples, although appreciable amounts of xylose were also solubilised.
   DMSO yielded polymeric lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC), both of
   which consisted predominantly of a beta(1 --> 4) xylan. From the results
   of methylation analysis, sensitivity to oxalic acid hydrolysis and
   size-exclusion chromatography after alkaline hydrolysis, it was evident
   that lignin polymers were attached to arabinosyl acid xylosyl residues
   by both ester and aryl-ether linkages. After cellulolytic hydrolysis of
   the residues, thioacidolysis analysis of the lignin component in the
   DMSO-soluble and Driselase-insoluble fractions from ryegrass revealed
   differences in every measurable aspect. The DMSO-soluble lignin was
   found to be more highly condensed, have a higher S/G ratio and have a
   higher terminal G/internal G ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Using cyclic voltammetry as a probe of surface morphology combined with
   AES and LEED, a detailed study is presented of the growth of
   well-defined rhodium films on Pt(111). Deviations from strictly
   layer-by-layer growth, as predicted by theoretical plots of the rhodium
   302 eV AES peak-to-peak intensity versus time, were elucidated by
   voltammetry. It was shown that the structure of the rhodium film was
   temperature dependent. For T less than or equal to 400
   K,''pseudo''-Frank-van der Merwe behaviour is observed whereby the
   second rhodium monolayer begins forming prior to the completion of the
   first with both layers giving rise to pseudomorphic (1 x 1) islands. At
   higher substrate temperatures, the ratio of the amount of second layer
   to first layer rhodium (for a fixed exposure) increases and at the
   highest temperatures investigated, evidence for the existence of bulk
   rhodium microcrystallites was deduced from LEED and voltammetry. The
   behaviour of rhodium contrasts significantly with palladium on Pt(111)
   which previously was shown to display good layer-by-layer growth
   irrespective of temperature or coverage, in agreement with expectations
   based on lattice mis-match and surface energy criteria. The differences
   between rhodium and palladium may be understood in terms of the
   increased strain associated with rhodium films and more especially, the
   larger surface energy of rhodium as compared to platinum.}},

   ACCRETION DISK}},

Abstract = {{Hubble Space Telescope time-resolved spectroscopic and ground-based
   R-band photometric data of UX UMa during eclipse are presented and
   discussed. The spectroscopy covers the C IV lambda 1550 and He II lambda
   1640 spectral regions. The eclipses in the UV continuum are deep, nearly
   reaching the zero level at mid-eclipse phases. Sharp ingress and egress
   features reveal the occultation of the white dwarf at disk center but
   there is no evidence of the orbital hump or of the bright spot. The
   steep ultraviolet eclipse light curves are used to estimate the radius
   of the white dwarf and to constrain the binary parameters. We find M(1)
   = M(2) = 0.47 M. and i = 71.degrees 0 +/- 0.degrees 6. The white dwarf
   contributes with similar or equal to 25\% of the light at 1600 Angstrom.
   If the inner disk is optically thick it has a temperature of T-wd
   greater than or similar to 65,000 K. Velocity-resolved light curves in
   the C IV lambda 1550 line show evidence of rotational disturbance and a
   strong orbital modulation is seen in the line center light curve.
   Maximum-entropy eclipse mapping techniques are used to solve for a map
   of the disk brightness distribution and for fluxes of an additional
   uneclipsed component in 18 narrow UV bands and in the R band. The
   angular scale of the disk and the distance to UX UMa are estimated from
   a color-magnitude diagram by a method similar to cluster main-sequence
   fitting. We find D = 345 +/- 34 pc. The radial temperature profiles
   derived from the UV continuum maps range from 8000 K in the outer disk
   regions to 30,000 K in the inner disk and reasonably follow the T
   proportional to R(-3/4) law for steady mass accretion at a rate of M =
   10(-8.0+/-0.2) M. yr(-1). The comparison of R-band eclipse maps from
   observations 2 months apart indicates changes in the structure of the
   outer disk which are probably due to small changes (less than or similar
   to 20\%) in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star.
   The maps in the C IV and He II line profiles are affected by emission
   from the disk wind. The radial temperature profiles of both line center
   maps show a flat slope. It is suggested that at low velocities the
   eclipsed part of the line emission arises from an opaque and extended
   region with a rather uniform spatial intensity distribution as projected
   in the plane of the sky. When plotted as a sequence of spatially
   resolved spectra these lines appear in absorption at disk center and
   change to emission in the outer disk regions besides showing large
   uneclipsed components. This behavior is similar to that found by Rutten
   et al. for the Balmer lines and suggests that these optical lines may
   also have a wind component.
   We obtain a revised ephemeris for the times of minimum and an upper
   limit for secular period changes of \textbackslash{}P\textbackslash{} <
   1.3 x 10(-12) s s(-1). The mass transfer rate inferred from this limit
   is an order of magnitude smaller than the value derived from the eclipse
   mapping, suggesting that the high mass transfer rate of UX UMa is not
   the consequence of its secular period decrease.}},

   c-Jun proto-oncogene product. Heterodimerization with activating
   transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) alters the DNA-binding specificity of
   c-Jun, allowing its targeting to several cAMP responsive element
   (CRE)related sequences, which control a subset of AP-1-responsive genes,
   Here me show that a c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimer binds to the AP-1 site (nPA
   5'-TRE) essential for the activity of the human urokinase enhancer,
   conferring on this element several distinctive regulatory properties.
   The c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimer was identified by binding competition
   assays, u.v. cross linking, and monospecific antibodies, In vitro
   binding studies revealed that the uPA 5'-TRE sequence is recognized by
   the cyclic AMP-unresponsive ATF-2 factor, but not by the cyclic
   AMP-inducible CREB, In addition, in vivo studies suggest that ATF-2 can
   mediate, at the same time, the activation of the c-Jun/ATF-2 site and
   the repression of the canonical. collagenase AP-1 site. We report that
   heterodimerization with c-Fos does not increase the binding of c-Jun to
   the uPA 5'-TRE, in contrast to the increased binding at a consensus AP-1
   site. Our data further suggest that c-Fos can act as a repressor of the
   c-Jun/ATF-2 binding site, revealing an important functional difference,
   with respect to canonical AP-I elements.}},

Abstract = {{In recent papers, Kumar and Sloan introduced a new collocation-type
   method for numerical solution of Hammerstein integral equations. Kumar
   studied a discretized version of this method and obtained
   superconvergence rate for the discrete approximation to the exact
   solution. In this paper, the asymptotic error expansion of a discrete
   collocation-type method for Hammerstein integral equations is obtained.
   We show that when piecewise polynomials of degree p - 1 are used and
   numerical quadrature is used to approximate the definite integrals
   occurring in this method, the approximation solution admits an error
   expansion in powers of the step-size h. For a special choice of
   collocation points and numerical quadrature rule, the leading terms in
   the error expansion for the collocation solution contain only even
   powers of the step-size h, beginning with a term h(2p). Thus
   Richardson's extrapolation can be performed on the solution, and this
   will increase the accuracy of numerical solution greatly. Some numerical
   results are given to illustrate this theory.}},

Title = {{AN X-RAY AND OPTICAL STUDY OF THE DWARF GALAXY NGC-1569 - EVIDENCE FOR A
   STARBURST-DRIVEN OUTFLOW}},

Abstract = {{Supernova-driven outflows produced by intense bursts of star formation
   can drastically affect the structure and subsequent evolution of dwarf
   galaxies. Extensive mass loss from such systems may also provide an
   important source of chemical enrichment for the intergalactic medium.
   Despite the potential importance of these outflows, there is a very
   limited amount of direct observational evidence for their existence. One
   of the clearest signatures of a starburst-driven outflow is the X-ray
   emission from the hot gas that drives the outflow. We have therefore
   undertaken an X-ray imaging and optical spectroscopic investigation of
   the nearest and best-studied starbursting dwarf galaxy NGC 1569 using
   the HRI on ROSAT and the Ritchey-Chretien spectrograph on the KPNO 4 m
   telescope, respectively. We find that at least half the keV X-ray
   emission of NGC 1569 is associated with a diffuse halo that is some 3.'8
   x 2.'2 similar to 2.4 x 1.5 kpc in size. Kiloparsec-scale `'spurs'' of
   diffuse X-ray emission extend outward along or near the optical minor
   axis of the galaxy. These diffuse X-ray spurs are morphologically
   associated with the well-known system of H alpha filaments. Previous
   kinematic studies have suggested that the H alpha filament system is a
   bipolar outflow. Our new optical spectroscopic data show that the H
   alpha emission comprises two kinematically distinct components: a
   quiescent system about 1 kpc in size responsible for about 75\% of the H
   alpha emission and a fainter and more complex system over 2 kpc in size
   with radial velocities of as much as +/-200 km s(-1) relative to v(sys).
   The latter appears to define expanding hollow structures consisting of
   several kiloparsec-scale `'superbubbles.'' The dynamical age of the
   high-velocity system (similar to 10(7) yr) is similar to various
   estimates of the age of the starburst. We also see very broad wings
   (full width at zero intensity of 1400-2300 km s(-1)) on the H alpha
   emission-line profile at the location of super starcluster A, suggestive
   of recent supernova activity there.
   We argue that the starburst in NGC 1569 is driving an outflow of the
   interstellar medium on a global scale. Our simple models suggest that
   the X-ray emission is too bright to come primarily from the hot tenuous
   supernova-heated gas in the interior of a superbubble, unless this gas
   is evaporating or ablating cool dense material. This latter material may
   be the outer shell of the superbubble or interstellar clouds that have
   been engulfed by the superbubble. The high-velocity H alpha filaments
   probably correspond to the shocked and accelerated ambient material in
   the superbubble's outer walls, while the low-velocity material may be
   massive photoionized clouds in the starbursting galactic disk. The
   observed expansion speeds probably exceed the galactic escape velocity.
   It seems likely that the expanding material will ultimately `'blow out''
   of the interstellar medium, and in so doing may allow most of the metals
   created by the starburst to escape from the galaxy. It is less clear
   whether the outflow will lead to the ejection of most or ah of this
   galaxy's interstellar medium, though it appears at least energetically
   feasible. We briefly discuss the significance of these results for ideas
   about the evolution of dwarf galaxies.}},

Volume = {{448}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the compact,
   luminous star cluster R136 in the LMC that were taken with the
   refurbished HST and new Wide Field/Planetary Camera. These images allow
   us to examine the stellar population in a region of unusually intense
   star formation at a scale of 0.01 pc. We have detected stars to 23.5 in
   F555W and have quantified the stellar population to an M(555,0) of 0.9
   or a mass of 2.8 M(.). Comparisons of HR diagrams with isochrones that
   were constructed for the HST flight filter system from theoretical
   stellar evolutionary tracks reveal massive stars, a main sequence to at
   least 2.8 M(.), and stars with M(555,0) greater than or equal to 0.5
   still on pre-main sequence tracks. The average stellar population is fit
   with a 3-4 Myr isochrone. Contrary to expectations from star formation
   models, however, the formation period for the massive stars and lower
   mass stars appear to largely overlap. We have measured the IMF for stars
   2.8-15 M(.) in three annuli from 0.5-4.7 pc from the center of the
   cluster. The slopes of the IMF in all three annuli are the same within
   the uncertainties, thus, showing no evidence for mass segregation beyond
   0.5 pc. Furthermore, the combined IMF slope, - 1.22 +/- 0.06, is close
   to a normal Salpeter IMF. The lower mass limit must be lower than the
   limits of our measurements: less than or equal to<2.8 M(.) beyond 0.5 pc
   and less than or equal to 7 M(.) within 0.1 pc. This is contrary to some
   predictions that the lower mass limit could be as high as 10 M(.) in
   regions of intense massive star formation. Integrated properties of R136
   are consistent with its being comparable to a rather small globular
   cluster when such clusters were the same age as R136. From the surface
   brightness profile, an upper limit for the core radius of 0.02 pc is
   set. Within a radius of 0.4 pc we estimate that there have been roughly
   20 crossing times and relaxation should be well along. Within 0.5 pc
   crowding prevents us from detecting the intermediate mass population,
   but there is a hint of an excess of stars brighter than M(555,0) = -5
   and of a deficit in the highest mass stars between 0.6 pc and 1.2 pc.
   This would be consistent with dynamical segregation.}},

Abstract = {{The isomerization and decomposition of 3,5-dimethylisoxazole were
   studied behind reflected shocks in a pressurized driver single pulse
   shock tube over the temperature range 880-1050 K and overall densities
   of similar to 2.5 x 10(-5) mol/cm(3). The main thermal reaction of
   3,5-dimethylisoxazole is an isomerization to 2-methyl-3-oxobutyronitrile
   (CH3COCH(CH3)CN). Acetonitrile, which is the main decomposition product
   in the system, is obtained from 3,5-dimethylisoxazole by a unimolecular
   process: 3,5-dimethylisoxazole --> CH3CN + CH3CHCO. The unimolecular
   decomposition of the thermally excited isomer, (CH3COCH(CH3)CN)(\#) -->
   CH2CH2CN + CH3CO, is assumed to be the source for a large concentration
   of free radicals and for carbon monoxide. Thus, ethane, methane, and
   carbon monoxide are the major products among the species without
   nitrogen. It is believed that hydrogen cyanide, acetaldehyde, and
   2-buten-3-one, which are found in the postshock mixtures, are obtained
   by a four-center unimolecular elimination from
   2-methyl-3-oxobutyronitrile from both the thermally excited state (low
   temperatures) and a state of thermal equilibrium (high temperatures).
   The isomerization reaction, which involves cleavage of the N-O bond and
   migration of a methyl group from position 3 to 4 in the ring, is a
   first-order process with a rate constant given by k(1st) = 10(15.90)
   exp(-61.5 x 10(3)/RT) s(-1) where R is expressed in units of cal/(K
   mel). The overall decomposition of 3,5-dimethylisoxazole in terms of a
   first-order rate constant is given by k(total) = 10(15.57) exp(-59.5 x
   10(3)/RT) s(-1). A reaction scheme containing 26 species and 32
   elementary reactions was constructed to describe the overall mechanism
   of 3,5-dimethylisoxazole decomposition and isomerization.}},

Abstract = {{The family of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases appear to play a
   central role in relaying signals generated by receptor protein tyrosine
   kinases (RPTK) from the cell surface to the nucleus, We previously
   demonstrated that undifferentiated and mitotically active crypt cells
   have high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (DR Burgess, W
   Jiang, S Mamajiwalla and W Kinsey. 1989, J. Cell Biol., 109: 2139)
   possibly due to the activation of RPTKs and also have high pp60(mapk)
   protein tyrosine kinase activity (CA Cartwright, SN Mamajiwalla, SA
   Skolnik, W Eckhart and DR Burgess, 1993. Oncogene. 8: 1033) when
   compared to differentiated, non-mitotic villus cells. Since activation
   of RPTKs leading to cell proliferation or differentiation involves
   activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, we chose to determine in this
   study if the activity of the MAP kinases were also regulated during
   differentiation of normal adult enterocytes. Our data show that although
   the 42 kD MAP kinase (p42(mapk)) was expressed in both crypt and villus
   cells, it was phosphorylated on tyrosine and active only in the crypt
   cells, Our data further suggest that p42(mapk) is inactivated during
   differentiation, possibly by a protein tyrosine phosphatase,
   Immunofluorescence studies revealed that p42(mapk) localized to the
   nuclei in both undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes and
   colocalized with phosphotyrosine containing proteins at the region of
   the junctional complex, These results suggest that p42(mapk) and its
   regulators are tightly controlled during enterocyte differentiation in
   vivo and implicate p42(mapk) as a key regulatory molecule in the normal
   development of the epithelium.}},

   The DOS histogram of periodic (Gly-X-Y) triplets (similar to the
   previous six-component case) shows only very narrow peaks in both the
   valence band and conduction band regions. As a next step the 20 possible
   different triplets have been arranged in a (composition restricted)
   random manner (338 triplets). The DOS histogram shows in these cases
   essentially broader allowed energy regions and a much lower number of
   very narrow peaks than in the previous six-component case. Therefore we
   can conclude that if one were able to calculate the DOS of real collagen
   (with 20 different amino acid residues), the DOS histograms, the
   Anderson localization and the hopping frequencies would be very similar
   to those in random polypeptides.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyllin (CHL), a water-soluble sodium and copper derivative of

   In the present study, we have found the protective properties of CHL
   against vinyl carbamate, p-nitrophenyl vinyl ether and their
   electrophilic epoxides. CHL exhibited dose-related inhibition of his(+)
   reversion in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 induced by these mutagens.
   Formation of DNA adducts from vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCO) and
   2'-(4-nitrophenoxy)oxirane (NPO) was also markedly attenuated in the
   presence of CHL. Oral administration of CHL prior to the topical
   application of each of the above carcinogens resulted in significant
   reduction in both incidence and multiplicity of skin tumors in mice. The
   effective protection by CHL against VCO and NPO suggest that its
   formation of inactive complexes with these carcinogens is mediated by
   mechanisms other than pi-pi interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Inner product mapping (IPM) has been proposed as a hybridization-based
   method for achieving low-cost, high-throughput, high-resolution
   radiation hybrid (RH) mapping of clones. Using Alu-PCR products of
   chromosome 11-specific clones, we serially hybridized a set of RHs
   against gridded filters of YACs having an average size of 350 kb, We
   then combined these hybridization data with preexisting RH map data to
   build an inner product map, This binning of 865 YACs provides the first
   high-resolution large-scale (>twofold redundancy) clonal coverage of
   human chromosome 11 and is the first inner product map ever constructed.
   We verified the accuracy and precision of this chromosome 11 map by
   performing a novel likelihood analysis on independent YAC hybridization
   data. These results establish that IPM is a highly rapid, inexpensive,
   accurate, and precise large-scale long-range mapping method,
   particularly when preexisting RH maps are available, and that IPM can
   replace or complement more conventional short-range mapping methods, IPM
   may enable the rapid construction of sequence-ready maps and the binning
   of expressed sequences. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a rapid and sensitive method to isolate sets of
   high-affinity binding sites for sequence-specific DNA binding proteins,
   The DNA binding domain of the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli
   as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Binding reactions are
   set up with total soluble extract from induced bacteria and a
   double-stranded oligonucleotide for which the central 32 bp have been
   randomized. To ensure stringent conditions, binding is done in the
   presence of high levels of poly(dI:C), The GST fusion protein is
   recovered by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose, Following extensive
   washing of the Sepharose beads, the bound oligonucleotides are rescued
   by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The amplified material is
   used in the next cycle of selection and amplification, Approximately
   five cycles are needed to obtain a pure population of high-affinity
   sites, which are then cloned and sequenced. This procedure should be
   applicable to any sequence-specific DNA binding protein for which the
   cDNA is available and which can be expressed in bacteria in a functional

Abstract = {{The redox gradient along the sinusoid in the rat liver was studied using
   a redox scanner, a device based on tissue fluorescence scanning
   spectroscopy measuring the fluorescence signals of oxidized flavoprotein
   (FP) and reduced pyridine nucleotide (PN). The FP/(FP + PN) ratio
   reflects the mitochiondrial redox state in the liver tissue. The
   distribution of mitochondrial redox state on the scanned area is
   expressed as two-dimensional gray-scale images with a 20 mu m
   resolution. Using this instrument, we have scanned a 2.5 X 2.5 mm area
   of the frozen rat liver sample to investigate the redox gradient within
   acini and the effects of glucagon on the changes in the redox
   distribution. The redox images obtained in the perfused livers showed
   mosaic patterns implicating a regular heterogeneity of redox state in an
   acinus. The analysis of gradient curve, furthermore, clarified that the
   redox level in an acinus decreased sigmoidally from the periportal to
   the pericentral region. Glucagon, which has been reported to reduce the
   intracellular redox state, decreased the redox potential in whole acini,
   especially, in the periportal region, when compared with the perfusion
   without glucagon. These results strongly indicate an intraacinus
   heterogeneity of glucagon function, with glucagon selectively operating

   not exist everywhere over the earth, but rather only over the North
   Atlantic Ocean and its bordering continental regions of North America,
   Europe, and northern Africa. We proposed three possible causes for our
   finding: (1) random radiative forcing of the climate system, that is,
   climatic noise, (2) oscillatory forcing external to the climate system,
   such as by a variation in solar irradiance, and (3) an oscillation
   internal to the climate system, perhaps not unlike that of the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation, but with a longer timescale. In this paper we
   critically examine the first hypothesis. Our analysis shows that this
   hypothesis can be rejected at a very high level of statistical
   confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene lethal(2) giant larvae
   (D-lgl) of Drosophila leads to malignant transformation of the
   presumptive adult optic centers in the larval brain and tumours of the
   imaginal discs. These from the disorganization of a in which the D-LGL
   protein participates. Here we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding
   the human homologue to the D-lgl gene designated as hugl. The hugl cDNA
   detects a locus spanning at least 25 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome
   band 17p11.2-12, which is centromeric to the p53 gene and recognizes a
   4.5 kb RNA transcript. The hugl gene is expressed in brain, kidney and
   muscle but is barely seen in heart and placenta. Sequence analysis of
   the hugl cDNA demonstrates a long open reading frame, which has the
   potential to encode a protein of 1057 amino acids with a predicted
   molecular weight of 115 kDaltons (kD). To further substantiate and
   identify the HUGL protein, we have prepared polyclonal rabbit antibodies
   against synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino and carboxyl
   termini of the conceptual translation product of the hugl gene. The
   affinity-purified anti-HUGL antibodies recognize a single protein with
   an apparent molecular weight of similar to 115 kD, Similar to the
   Drosophila protein, HUGL is part of a cytoskeletal network and, is
   associated with nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain and a kinase that
   specifically phosphorylates HUGL at serine residues.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroform, formaldehyde and ions of copper(II) and mercury(II) were
   tested as preservatives of water samples for determination of non-ionic
   surfactants (NS). River water (Warta River, Poznan) was used as
   hydrobiological background. Mainly the concentration of `'native'' NS
   from river water was measured, but in two series of experiments spikes
   of Triton X-100 and Marlipal 1618/25 were used. Indirect tensammetric
   measurements (ITM) were applied for control of the NS concentration.
   Formaldehyde is the most effective compound among the tested
   preservatives. A concentration of 1\% is sufficient for long-term
   storage while 0.1\% is sufficient for short-term storage (up to 6 days).
   Copper (II) (50 mg l(-1)) or mercury(II) (25 mg l(-1)) may be used for
   short-term storage of water samples while chloroform used alone is
   ineffective. It may be used together with cooling of a sample (4 degrees
   C) for short-term storage, however, such a pretreatment of samples is
   more complicated than the use of other preservatives. Refrigeration (4
   degrees C) used alone is ineffective. The results concerning high spikes
   of Triton X-100 show better preservation than the samples containing
   only `'native'' NS. Therefore, the experiments with spikes of
   surfactants may lead to too optimistic conclusions as for preservation
   of a water samples. Adsorptive stripping tensammetry was applied for
   observation of biodegradation of spikes of Marlipal 1618/25 both in
   preserved and non-preserved samples. The high potential of this
   technique for the examination of biodegradation has been demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We present Crab pulsar light curves and spectra over the similar to 50
   keV to 10 GeV range from Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory observations made
   during MJD 48,373-48,406 (1991 April 27-1991 May 30 except for COMPTEL
   which started observations on April 28). The overall pulse
   phase-averaged spectrum is not well fitted by a single power law, but a
   broken power law does fit well, of the form F = A(E/E(B))((-alpha 1));
   A(E/E(R))(-alpha 2) photons cm(-2) s(-1) MeV(-1) fits well (chi(min)(2),
   = 16, 26 degrees of freedom {[}dof]), where alpha(1) is the spectral
   index for E less than or equal to E(B) and alpha(2) for E > E(B). For
   the normalization values to the spectra quoted here, we report
   phase-averaged intensities, and we applied an estimate to the
   uncertainty of the absolute calibration of 10\%.
   The best-fit values for the parameters with 68\% uncertainties are A =
   0.064 +/- 0.006, E(B) = 0.12 +/- 0.03 MeV, alpha(1) =
   1.71(+0.15)(-0.19), and alpha(2) = 2.21 +/- 0.02. The outer gap model
   (with gap parameter equal to 0.38, and a normalization factor of 1.08)
   provided to us by Ho describes the data with an accuracy of better than
   20\%, but the formal chi(min)(2), is too high with a value of 68 for 28
   dof. We derive a statistically equivalent result for the broken power
   law when we include lower energy data from the OSO 8 satellite.
   A broken power-law fit to the phase-resolved spectra (peak 1, the
   bridge, and peak 2) resulted in the following: for peak 1, A = 0.026 +/-
   0.003, E(B) = 0.098 +/- 0.02 MeV, alpha(1) = 1.77(-0.25)(+0.188),
   alpha(2) = 2.09 +/- 0.01, chi(min)(2) = 45, 26 dof; for the bridge, A =
   0.001 +/- 0.0001, E(B) = 0.45(-0.15)(+0.85) MeV, alpha(1) = 1.75 +/-
   0.12, alpha(2) = 2.53(-0.12)(+0.10) chi(min)(2), d, = 16, 23 dof; and
   for peak 2, A = 0.02 +/- 0.002, E(B) = 0.13(-0.012)(+0.020) MeV,
   alpha(1) = 1.71 +/- 0.09, alpha 2 = 2.25 +/- 0.02, chi(min)(2) 21, 26
   dof. For peak 1 only, the fit is greatly improved by using an outer gap
   model. The resultant values are a gap parameter of 0.450 +/- 0.003 with
   a normalization of 0.22 +/- 0.02, chi(min)(2). = 32, 28 dof.
   The separation of the pulse peaks is difficult to quantify objectively
   because the peaks are not symmetrical. When we use the maximum intensity
   values of each peak to determine the centroids, we find an
   energy-independent phase difference of 0.405 +/- 0.006 for the CGRO data
   (50 keV to 10 GeV) and 0.402 +/- 0.002 when other data were included
   covering the range from 0.5 to 300 keV. The energy-independent value of
   the phase of peak 1 relative to the radio is -0.003 +/- 0.012, where the
   uncertainty includes the absolute timing uncertainty.
   When the pulse shapes are characterized by asymmetric Lorentzian shapes,
   within the statistical uncertainty of the fits the widths of the peaks
   in the similar to 100 keV light curve are consistent within a factor of
   about 1.25 with the widths of the peaks in the similar to 100 MeV light
   curve.
   We discuss these results within the context of a bulk relativistic
   motion beaming model.}},

Abstract = {{Resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy of metalloporphyrins can provide
   detailed information about the oxidation state, coordination number, and
   spin state of the central metal ion: These data have been of particular
   value in the study of natural and model heme systems. Core-size
   correlations, plots of the porphyrin-ring center to pyrrole nitrogen
   (Ct-N) distances versus rR frequencies, are frequently utilized to
   assess structural properties or to confirm spectral assignments.
   However, in most cases, such plots for beta-pyrrole-substituted
   porphyrins are limited by the use of Ct-N distances derived from the
   crystal structures of meso-tetraphenylporphyrins. Because of
   well-documented structural and spectroscopic differences in these two
   classes of porphyrins, the utility of such core-size correlations may be
   impaired. Here we report the crystal structures of three new

   compounds that are a high-spin pentacoordinate, a low-spin
   hexacoordinate, and a high-spin hexacoordinate, respectively. The rR
   properties of these three compounds together with rR data of two
   crystallographically defined intermediate-spin, tetracoordinate ferrous
   complexes, Fe(OEP) and Fe(OEC), are presented. The latter is a chlorin,
   i.e., a dihydroporphyrin, complex. The present rR data for these
   crystallographically characterized complexes permit the first rigorous
   test of earlier Ct-N vs nu correlations in that the spectroscopic and
   structural parameters are from the same compounds in the same
   crystalline phase and yield a new core-size correlation for
   beta-pyrrole-substituted metalloporphyrins. With the present analysis as
   a foundation, rR spectroscopic studies may be extended to simple
   complexes in solution as well. as heme proteins in the determination of
   core sizes and in facilitating spectral assignments.}},

Abstract = {{Liposomes are biocompatible materials that show promise as vehicles for
   drug delivery, inhibitors of cell adhesion, and carriers for the
   introduction of genetic material into cells. In this paper, we describe
   the synthesis and characterization of a new class of polymerized
   liposome particles (paramagnetic polymerized liposome (PPL), Figure 1)
   that have lanthanide ion chelates as head groups and that can be easily
   visualized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The R(1) molar
   relaxivity was found to depend primarily on the linker length (m) and on
   the surface metal density and only weakly on particle size. PPLs
   containing 10 mol \% of compound 1b (m = 2) and 90 mol \% of compound 3
   had a R(1) = 12.2 mM(-1) s(-1), while PPLs with 10 mol \% compound 1a (m
   = 1) and 90 mol \% of compound 3 had a R(1) = 5.7 mM(-1) s(-1). PPLs
   with 10 mol \% of compound 1a and 90 mol \% of compound 4 had a R(1) =
   8.9 mM(-1) s(-1), while PPLs with 50 mol \% of compound 1a and 50 mol \%
   of compound 4 had a R(1) = 4.3 mM(-1) s(-1). A biotinylated lipid
   (compound 2) was also incorporated into the particle without affecting
   R(1) relaxivities for use as a marker for histochemical studies. We have
   also for the first time used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to
   investigate the size and nature of these particles in an aqueous
   environment. We feel that these new materials may prove useful for the
   in vivo investigation of liposome formulations as vehicles for
   therapeutic applications and for evaluating tissue pathology with MRI.}},

Abstract = {{The Ca2+-binding properties of photosystem II were investigated with
   radioactive Ca-45(2+). PS II membranes, isolated from spinach grown on a
   medium containing Ca-45(2+), contained 1.5 Ca2+ per PS II unit.
   Approximately half of the incorporated radioactivity was lost after
   incubation for 30 h in nonradioactive buffer. About 1 Ca2+/PS II bound
   slowly to Ca2+-depleted membranes in the presence of the extrinsic 16-
   and 23-kDa polypeptides in parallel with restoration of oxygen-evolving
   activity. The binding was heterogeneous with dissociation constants of
   60 mu M (0.7 Ca2+/PS II) and 1.7 mM (0.3 Ca2+/PS II), respectively,
   which could reflect different affinities of the dark-stable S-states for
   Ca2+. The reactivation of oxygen-evolving activity closely followed the
   binding of Ca2+, showing that a single exchangeable Ca2+ per PS II is
   sufficient for the water-splitting reaction to function. In PS II,
   depleted of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides, about 0.7 exchangeable
   Ca2+/PS II binds with a dissociation constant of 26 mu M, while 0.3 Ca2+
   binds with a much weaker affinity (K-d > 0.5 mM). The rate of binding of
   Ca2+ in the absence of the two extrinsic polypeptides was significantly
   higher than with the polypeptides bound. The rate of dissociation of
   bound Ca2+ in the dark, which had a half-time of about 80 h in intact PS
   II, increased in the absence of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides and
   showed a further increase after the additional removal of the 33-kDa
   protein and manganese. The rate of dissociation was also significantly
   faster in weak light than in the dark regardless of the presence or
   absence of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides. Removal of the 33-kDa
   donor-side polypeptide together with the two lighter ones led to a
   reduction in the amount of bound Ca2+, while practically no Ca2+ bound
   after treatments to dissociate also the manganese of the water-oxidizing
   site.}},

Abstract = {{Enzymes efficiently catalyze reactions by stabilizing inherently
   unstable transition states. For cysteine proteases, part of the
   stabilization is provided by a region of the enzyme termed the oxyanion
   hole. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate further the
   role of the oxyanion hole of papain in the binding of putative
   transition stare analog inhibitors of cysteine proteases. The
   dissociation constants K-i(obs) for inhibition of wild-type and mutant
   enzymes (Glnl9Ala, Glnl9Glu, and Glnl9His) by the aldehyde
   Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO and the nitrile MeOCO-Phe-Gly-CN have been determined in
   the pH range 3.5-9.0. For the peptide nitrite inhibitor, mutation of
   Gln19 was found to cause important increases in K-i(obs) and thioimidate
   adducts with the papain mutants Glnl9Ala and Glnl9Glu are less stable by
   1.4-2.6 kcal/mol. However, for the peptide aldehyde inhibitor, the
   mutations resulted in a small but significant increase in stability of
   the tetrahedral hemithioacetal adduct (0.4-1.2 kcal/mol). In that
   respect, the hemithioacetal formed between papain and a peptide aldehyde
   cannot be considered a good model of the transition state for cysteine
   protease-catalyzed reactions. The influence of the mutations on the pH
   dependency of inhibition also indicates that with respect to oxyanion
   hole interaction, the inhibition of papain by peptide nitriles is a
   process closer to that of substrate hydrolysis than is the inhibition by
   the corresponding peptide aldehydes. The nature of the intermediates and
   transition states in hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by cysteine
   proteases, as well, as the use of enzyme-inhibitor adducts as their
   models, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Phase separation of binary polymer mixtures was numerically simulated by
   solving the time-dependent Langevin equation with Flory-Huggins free
   energy in two dimensions by using a finite difference method. Spinodal
   decomposition following structure coarsening was calculated. Simulation
   results were verified by evaluating the evolution of the wave number
   obtained from the calculated phase structure by Fourier transformation.
   Then, computer experiments were carried out to investigate effects of
   volume fraction and polymer characters, the number of segments, and
   solubility parameter on morphology. The phase separation time, when the
   phase began to separate, decreased with deviating volume fraction from
   0.5 and with decreasing number of segments and difference between
   solubility parameters. The difference between solubility parameters had
   the largest influence on the phase separation time among them and had
   two effects, the acceleration of phase separation and the restriction of
   structure coarsening. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   produce an ATP-inhibitable activity with a pharmacological activation by
   pinacidil as previously described but instead a G-protein activated
   inward-rectifier. While oocyte expression of single subunits is
   infrequent and relatively modest in intensity, expression of GIRK1,2,
   GIRK1,4 and GIRK2,4 mixtures leads to routine and robust expression of
   K+ channels indicating that heterologous subunit assembly is necessary
   for activity. Activity of GIRK1,2 GIRK1,4 and GIRK2,4 channels required
   the presence of Am acting as an activator at the cytoplasmic face and is

Abstract = {{The U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) conducts research to develop simple and
   practical computer-based tools to assist mine planners in assessing the
   structural stability of underground mine structures. One area of
   research is focusing on developing a numerical procedure that will
   anticipate rock mass behaviour surrounding underground mine openings
   prior to and during actual mining. This paper briefly overviews our
   experience with existing ADINA material models, presents an example of
   how two-dimensional boundary-element models are coupled with
   two-dimensional finite-element models to simulate an approximate
   three-dimensional situation, and demonstrates the use of a simplified
   progressive failure procedure. Outputs from plan-view, linear-elastic,
   boundary-element models executed at different mining stages are used as
   input to detailed, section-view, finite-element ADINA models to estimate
   to what degree and extent the immediate roof and floor strata and the
   coal pillar ribs surrounding an excavated area will weaken or fail for a
   given set of mining parameters. Using a pseudo-elastic approach, elastic
   rock mass properties are continually updated as different zones are
   predicted to fail. The procedure is relatively easy to use and is being
   designed to work interactively with the user. Inputs include parameters
   easily obtained from the field and rock mechanics laboratories.
   Specialized preprocessing and post-processing PC-based graphics software
   tailored specifically to mine geometries has been developed and is
   described. Examples of computer-generated output from sample models
   representing typical mining situations are presented and results
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Genistein, an isoflavonoid derivative initially described as an in vitro
   protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also inhibits mammalian DNA
   topoisomerase II both in vitro and in vivo. From a human leukaemic T
   cell line (CCRF-CEM), two genistein-resistant cell lines, which grow in
   the presence of 50 and 150 mu M genistein, respectively, were selected
   and designated CEM/GN(50) and CEM/GN(150). Flow cytometry and karyotype
   analyses revealed that more than 95\% of the parental cells were
   tetraploid whereas both resistant sublines were essentially diploid and
   were likely derived from the diploid fraction in the initial population.
   The CEM/GN cells were 3- to 4-fold resistant to genistein, and highly
   cross-resistant to certain metabolic inhibitors such as
   cytosine-arabinoside (50-fold) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (5000-fold).
   This resistance was associated with a markedly decreased uptake of
   thymidine and a 10-fold reduction in thymidine kinase activity. The
   CEM/GM cells were also 15- to 30-fold cross-resistant to topoisomerase
   inhibitors (etoposide, m-AMSA, 2-Me-9-OH-ellipticinium). Comparison of
   topoisomerase II activities in the sensitive and resistant cells showed:
   (i) an approximatively 2-fold reduced decatenation activity in nuclear
   extracts from the resistant cells; (ii) an approximate 30\% reduction in
   DNA-protein cross-links in etoposide-treated resistant cells; and (iii)
   a markedly reduced expression of the topoisomerase II beta isoform.
   These data, consistent with our previous results, indicate that the
   cytotoxicity of genistein is at least in part related to its capacity to
   inhibit DNA topoisomerase II.}},

Abstract = {{Prostaglandin E receptor EP3D is coupled to stimulation and inhibition

   To examine the roles of the interaction of the carboxylic acid of an
   agonist and its putative binding site, the arginine residue in the
   seventh transmembrane domain of EP3D, in receptor-G protein coupling, we
   have mutated the arginine to the non-charged glutamine. TEI-3356, an EP3
   agonist with a negatively charged the carboxylic acid, and TEI-4343, a
   non-charged methylester of TEI-3356, inhibited the forskolin-stimulated
   cAMP formation in the same concentration-dependent manner, but
   stimulation of basal cAMP formation and Ca2+ mobilization by TEI-4343
   was much lower than that by TEI-3356. In the mutant receptor, both
   TEI-3356 and TEI-4343 showed the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP
   formation in the same profile, but did not stimulate basal cAMP
   formation or Ca2+ mobilization. These findings suggest that the
   interaction between the carboxylic acid of agonist and the arginine
   residue is important in signal transduction for adenylate cyclase
   stimulation and Ca2+ mobilization but not for adenylate cyclase
   inhibition. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{It has previously been demonstrated that cells can bind antibody-coated
   beads; this effect can be used to enhance the fractionation of cells
   using magnetic fields or by centrifugation on isopycnic, isotonic
   density gradients. As a general rule, the higher the expression of
   surface antigens the more beads bind to cells. However, we have also
   noted that other factors also affect the number of beads found bound to
   cells. Experiments have been carried out to determine what factors
   affect binding of antibody-coated beads to cells. The optimum conditions
   for binding of antibody-coated beads to MOLT-4 T cells were found to be,
   namely, a 20:1 bead to cell ratio in a 1 ml incubation volume, with
   continuous end-over-end mixing for 1 h at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, the
   optimum centrifugation conditions at which the samples were separated on
   isopycnic, isotonic density gradients were determined as 220 x g(max)
   for 90 min, at 20 degrees C. The results indicate the preferred
   conditions that are necessary to achieve optimum bead binding by cells
   and their subsequent fractionation. Different antibody-coated beads were
   examined including Dynabeads M-450, used as a known standard. In
   addition we describe, as a possible alternative to Dynabeads, dense
   polystyrene beads, for the separation of cells on the basis of the
   immunological identity of the surface of cells using density

Abstract = {{Expression of clinical findings of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1) and
   type 2 (WS2) is extremely variable. Using our collection of 26 WS1 and 8
   WS2 families, we analyzed the occurrence, severity, and symmetry of
   clinical manifestations associated with WS. We found significant
   differences between WS1 and WS2 in deafness, and in pigmentary and
   craniofacial anomalies. Factor analysis was used to identify
   manifestations which covaried, resulting in 2 orthogonal factors. Since
   mean factor scores were found to differ when compared between WS1 and
   WS2, we suggest that these factors could be useful in distinguishing WS
   types. We found that the WS gene was transmitted from mothers more often
   than from fathers. We also extensively examined the W-Index, a
   continuous measure of dystopia canthorum. Our data suggest that use of
   the W-Index to discriminate between affected WS1 and WS2 individuals may
   be problematic since 1) ranges of W-Index scores of affected and
   unaffected individuals overlapped considerably within both WS1 and WS2,
   and 2) a considerable number of both affected and unaffected WS2
   individuals exhibited W-index scores consistent with dystopia canthorum.
   Misclassification of families may have implications for risk assessment
   of deafness, since WS2 families have been reported to have greater
   incidence of deafness, as confirmed in our study. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{For several superconducting niobium disks, the de field-cooled
   magnetization (FCM) shows a paramagnetic response below their
   superconducting transition temperature T-c approximate to 9.2 K when the
   applied magnetic filed is normal to the disk. At 8.6 K, the FCM reaches
   a maximum in fields of 5 to 10 Oe and becomes diamagnetic for fields
   larger than 20 Oe. This FCM behavior is qualitatively similar to the
   paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) recently observed in high-T-c cuprate
   superconductors. Various surface treatments to the Nb disks result in
   changes in both the zero-field-cooled magnetization and the FCM,
   including the disappearance of the PME.}},

   to the pericentric region of chromosome 17. Here, we describe the
   cloning and sequencing of exon22 regions from three of these NOS2-like
   sequences, We have also mapped another NOS2-like sequence to human
   chromosome 14. Since there are multiple NOS2-like sequences present in
   the human genome, we have also carried out Zoo Blot hybridisation
   analysis using a NOS2 cDNA probe. Our data suggest that duplication of
   NOS2-like sequences occurred very recently in primate evolution. (C)

Abstract = {{The microstructures and mechanical properties of hot and cold sputtered
   Al-1 wt.\%Si and Al-1 wt.\%Si-0.5 wt.\%Cu films were studied.
   Transmission and scanning electron microscopies were used to examine the
   grain size, precipitate morphology and surface structure of the films.
   Stress measurements using a substrate curvature technique and hardness
   measurements made by nanoindentation were employed to study the
   mechanical properties. The cold sputtered films show a smaller grain
   size than the hot sputtered films before and after annealing, whereas
   the precipitate morphology looked the same after annealing for both
   films. Stress/temperature curves of AlSi and AlSiCu films are very
   similar on heating and on cooling above 220 degrees C. However, below
   this temperature the tensile stresses in the AlSiCu films increase
   sharply with decreasing temperature compared with the AlSi films. This
   effect is normally attributed to precipitation hardening of Al2Cu
   precipitates which form below 250 degrees C. However, there is evidence
   for a second explanation. The steep rise in stress can be caused by the
   end of diffusional relaxation. Calculations show that the breakdown of
   thermal activation of diffusional processes occurs in the same
   temperature range.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) with bone marrow
   stroma, mediated by adhesion molecules, are assumed to be critically
   important to the regulation of hematopoiesis. However, the specific
   roles of individual adhesion molecules involved in these interactions
   are poorly understood. Here, a monoclonal antibody, MEM-59, recognizing
   CD43, an adhesion molecule highly expressed on HPC, is shown to induce
   apoptosis in this cell population. This process operates at the
   single-cell level, and its initiation requires crosslinking of surface
   CD43 and the presence of cytokines, In contrast to HPC, more
   differentiated cells originating from this primitive cell population, as
   well as peripheral lymphocytes, do not undergo apoptosis in response to
   the CD43-mediated stimulation, Thus, CD43 may function as a negative
   regulator of early hematopoietic events, delivering a signal for
   apoptosis of HPC. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effect of cellular proliferation and cell
   cycle stage on the ability of postirradiation 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to
   radiosensitize cultured human colon adenocarcinoma Clone A cells.
   Methods and Materials: Cell survival curves were generated for
   irradiated: (a) log- and plateau-phase Clone A cells; and (b) Clone A
   cells separated by centrifugal elutriation into the various phases of
   the cell cycle; with and without postirradiation treatment with 100 mu
   g/ml 5-FU.
   Results: Postirradiation treatment with 5-FU sensitized proliferating
   cells to a greater degree than it sensitized cells growing in plateau
   phase, The beta component of cell kill in log-phase cells was increased
   by a factor of 1.5 with a sensitizer enhancement ratio of 1.21 at the
   0.01 survival level, Plateau-phase cells showed less radiosensitization
   (sensitizer enhancement ratio of 1.13 at the 0.01 survival level);
   however, there was a mild increase in both cu and beta kill in
   plateau-phase cells, Elutriated G(1) cells were the most radiosensitive,
   independent of treatment with 5-FU. The phase of the cell cycle had
   little effect on the ability of fluorouracil to radiosensitize Clone A
   cells.
   Conclusion: Proliferating cells are more susceptible to
   radiosensitization with 5-FU than plateau-phase cells are, but this
   effect appears to be independent of the phase of the cell cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties of excitons in thin layers are significantly
   different from those in bulk crystals. In particular, we study the case
   of a bulk material of thickness comparable with the wavelength of the
   excitonic transition confined on one or on both sides by appropriate
   Bragg reflectors. If-the cavity resonance quasimode is carefully tuned
   on the excitonic transition, strong exciton-photon coupling takes place
   and produces a Rabi-like splitting as large as that observed in
   quantum-well-implanted microcavities and comparable optical absorption.
   In addition, the polaritonic spatial dispersion and the quantization of
   the exciton center-of-mass motion introduce remarkable fine structures
   which are absent in the quantum-well case. We demonstrate the above
   effects from a spectroscopic analysis of GaAs cavities and compare them
   with those displayed by quantum-well-implanted microcavities.}},

Abstract = {{One mechanism of the immune suppression in HIV infection has been
   postulated as being caused by the interaction of HIV envelope
   glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 molecules. Thus, pretreatment of purified
   peripheral blood T cells or CD4(+) T cell clones with gp120 (or an
   anti-CD4 mAb) results in inhibition of anti-CD3 mAb-induced
   proliferative responses. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the
   interacting pairs of costimulatory molecules, CD28-B71 (CD80) and CD40
   ligand (CD40L)-CD40, to elucidate further the mechanism of HIV
   gp120-induced inhibitory effects on T cell functions. Interactions
   between CD28-B71 and CD40L-CD40 were found to be essential for the
   anti-CD3 mAb-induced T cell proliferation, as demonstrated by
   up-regulation of B71 and CD40L and the ability of anti-B71 and
   anti-CD40L mAbs to inhibit this response. Pretreatment of CD4(+) T cells
   with gp120 before CD3 ligation with anti-CD3 mAb resulted in failure of
   up-regulation of CD40L on T cells and B71 on APC. Exogenous addition of
   anti-CD28 mAb overcame the inhibitory effect of gp120 on anti-CD3
   mab-induced T cell proliferation. We conclude that binding of gp120 to
   CD4 molecules on T cells may interrupt the sequential cascade of
   intercellular interaction involving 1) Ag/MHC class II-TCR/CD4, 2)
   CD40L-CD40, and 3) B71-CD28. These studies indicate that the CD4-gp120
   interaction results in dysregulation of expression of costimulatory
   molecules, CD40L, and B71 expression on T cells and APC, respectively,
   thereby contributing to the T cell hyporesponsiveness in HIV infection.}},

   field theories perturbatively in the canonical ensemble, unexpected new
   difficulties arise in comparison with the usual grand canonical
   treatment. The purpose of this paper is to expose these difficulties and
   show how they can be remedied, thus recovering a well-defined
   description of plasmas even in a finite-size, canonical ensemble
   setting. For definiteness, a specific model is considered, namely,
   (1+1)-dimensional QCD with SU(2) color; however, the treatment presented
   should be applicable also to higher-dimensional systems with different
   types of Coulomb interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies include anticardiolipin (aCL) and
   lupus anticoagulant (LA) antibodies. LA antibodies recognize the complex
   of lipid-bound (human) prothrombin, in this way inhibiting the
   phospholipid-dependent coagulation reactions, whereas aCL antibodies are
   directed towards beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI) bound to an anionic
   lipid surface. According to their behavior in coagulation reactions, we
   have divided aCL antibodies into two groups: aCL-type A, which inhibit
   the phospholipid-dependent coagulation reactions because they enhance
   the binding of beta 2-GPI to the procoagulant phospholipid surface; and
   aCL-type B antibodies, which are devoid of anticoagulant properties. We
   report the distinctive laboratory and clinical profiles of 25 patients
   with well-characterized, phospholipid-dependent inhibitor of
   coagulation. Fourteen patients had LA antibodies (aCL-type B were
   concomitantly present in 10 cases, while in the other four, aCL titer
   was normal), and the other 11 had aCL-type A antibodies. The laboratory
   evaluation of the two groups showed the dilute Russell viper venom time
   (dRVVT) to be the most abnormal coagulation test in the aCL-type
   A-positive group, whereas the kaolin clotting time (KCT) was the most
   abnormal assay in the LA-positive group. In fact, the ratios of the
   coagulation times of patient plasma over normal pooled plasma (mean rt
   standard deviation) for LA versus aCL-type A antibodies were 1.48 +/-
   0.27 versus 2.20 +/- 0.42, P = .0001, and 2.22 +/- 0.42 versus 1.50 +/-
   0.42, P = .0003, for the dRVVT and KCI, respectively. No differences
   were observed either in the ratios of the activated partial
   thromboplastin times and the prothrombin times or the plasma levels of
   beta 2-GPI and prothrombin. Conversely, aCL titers were significantly
   higher in aCL-type A-positive patients (147 +/- 44 U) than in the
   LA-positive group (61 +/- 55 U; P = .0003). We ruled out the possibility
   that platelet contamination of plasma could account for the observed
   coagulation profiles, as the two patterns were reproduced in
   platelet-free plasma. In addition, we performed clotting tests in plasma
   in the presence of phospholipids and calcium after addition of factor
   IXa or factor Xa. The assay performed with factor Xa was more sensitive
   to the presence of aCL-type A antibodies, while the assay performed with
   factor IXa was preferentially sensitive to LA-containing plasmas,
   supporting the earlier findings with the dRVVT and KCT assays.
   Clinically, the two groups of patients were significantly different only
   with respect to the history for thrombosis, which was positive in 3 of
   14 LA-positive cases (21\%) versus 8 of 11 aCL-type A-positive patients
   (73\%; P = .0308). These clinical and laboratory associations, which
   must be validated on larger groups of patients, might be helpful in the
   identification of those aPL-positive patients at particular risk for
   thromboembolic events. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

   with that found in previous reports. Twenty children, all with Hb SS,
   died (1.1 deaths per 100 person-years among SS patients). Infection,
   most commonly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae,
   caused 11 deaths. Two children died of splenic sequestration, 1 of
   cerebrovascular accident, and 6 of unclear causes. Two patients
   underwent cholecystectomies, and 17 underwent splenectomies after one or

Abstract = {{Early endothelial injury may play a role in the development of
   transplant arteriosclerosis. The present study documents early
   endothelial changes using a rat aortic graft model. Abdominal aortic
   allografts from PVG rats were orthotopically transplanted to DA rats.
   Controls were DA to DA transplants. Endothelial cell (EC) injury,
   regeneration, and leukocyte infiltration in the intima were evaluated
   using scanning electron microscopy and histological and
   immunocytochemical techniques. Nontransplanted aortic segments showed
   partial loss of ECs after 1 or 2 hr of preservation. Control isografts
   demonstrated extensive EC denudation and neutrophil adherence to
   residual ECs at 1 day post-transplantation. After 3 days, isografts
   showed continued regeneration of ECs in the central area and ingrowth of
   endothelium from both damped sites in the recipient aorta.
   Reendothelialization was complete by day 14. Allografts showed similar
   findings to isografts up to day 3. In contrast to isografts, however,
   there was a secondary EC loss beginning at day 7. Monocytes/macrophages
   and T cells were noted to be adherent to residual ECs in 7- and 14-day
   allografts. At 20 days, ECs were absent from the luminal surface in the
   center of allografts. Endothelium did extend from clamped sites toward
   the midgraft region as in isografts. By 60 days allografts were
   completely reendothelialized. These results demonstrate that in both
   isografts and allografts there is initial EC loss due to mechanical
   trauma and ischemia/reperfusion injury, followed by partial
   reendothelialization. This latter process continues unabated in
   isografts, whereas in allografts the secondary EC loss occurs due to an
   allogenic response. This is followed by complete reendothelialization
   that occurs during the concurrent development of significant intimal
   hyperplasia.}},

   growth factor (EGF)-induced growth and thyroid-stimulating hormone
   (TSH)-induced differentiation in primary cultures of sheep and human
   thyrocytes. The K-m remained unaltered. This up-regulation required the
   presence of insulin. The TSH-induced rise in myo-inositol transport
   commenced 8 to 16 h after the initial stimulus and achieved a plateau at
   24 h. In human thyrocytes the change in V-max. was accompanied by an
   increase in the steady-state levels of mRNA for the myo-inositol
   transporter following treatment with either ligand. Examination of the
   metabolites of mya-inositol showed few significant changes after

   maintenance of the intracellular concentration of myo-inositol as the
   cells enlarge in preparation for cell division. In TSH-treated cells,
   however, up-regulation of myo-inositol transport was linked with
   increased myo-inositol cycling across the cell membrane, increased
   phospholipase A(2)-mediated turnover of phosphatidylinositol and a
   concomitant increase in arachidonic acid turnover. Increased levels of

Abstract = {{Recently, we reported successful growth of high-quality GaAs/Si
   epilayers by using a very thin amorphous Si film as buffer layer. In
   this paper, the impurity properties of this kind of GaAs/Si epilayers
   have been studied by using PL spectrum, SIMS and Hall measurement.
   Compared to a typical PL spectrum of the GaAs/Si epilayers grown by
   conventional two-step method, a new peak was observed in our PL spectrum
   at the energy of 1.462 eV, which is assigned to the band-to-silicon
   acceptor recombination. The SIMS analysis indicates that the silicon
   concentration in this kind of GaAs/Si epilayers is about 10(18) cm(-3).
   But its carrier concentration (about 4 x 10(17) cm(-3)) is lower than
   the silicon concentration. The lower carrier concentration in this kind
   of GaAs/Si epilayer can be interpreted both as the result of higher
   compensation and as the result of the formation of the donor-defect
   complex. We also found that the high-quality and low-Si-concentration
   GaAs/Si epilayers can be regrown by using this kind of GaAs/Si epilayer
   as substrate. The FWHM of the X-ray (004) rocking curve from this
   regrowth GaAs epilayer is 118 `', it is much less than that of the first
   growth GaAs epilayer (160 `') and other reports for the GaAs/Si epilayer
   grown by using conventional two-step method (similar to 200 `').}},

Abstract = {{The luminescence spectra of the Eu3+-doped rare earth oxyfluorides
   REOF:Eu3+ (RE=La, Gd and Y) were measured at room and liquid nitrogen
   temperatures. The interpretation of the spectra and the simulation of
   the F-7(J) (J=0-5) Stark levels were carried out with the aid of
   phenomenological crystal field (CF) theory for the C-3v symmetry of the
   RE(3+) site. The best-fit set of the six non-zero CF parameters yielded
   the r.m.s. deviations 8, 11 and 10 cm(-1) between the experimental and
   calculated energy levels for YOF, GdOF and LaOF respectively. The
   strength of the CF effect increases from the LaOF to the YOF host. The
   X-ray powder diffraction data for LaOF and GdOF were analysed by the
   Rietveld profile refinement method. From these results the CF parameters
   were calculated with a modified point charge model. The parameters of
   ranks four and six were reproduced quite close to the experimental
   values. The calculated \textbackslash{}B-0(2)\textbackslash{} values
   were too large, evidently owing to short-range covalency effects.}},

Abstract = {{The isolation and cloning of the ligand for the cytokine receptor, Mpl,
   have been recently described. In this report we present details of the
   purification of this novel cytokine (megakaryocyte growth and
   development factor {[}MGDF]) from aplastic canine plasma. Two forms of
   canine MGDF, with apparent molecular weights of 25 kD and 31 kD and
   sharing a common N-terminal amino acid sequence, were isolated. The sole
   contaminant detected in purified 25-kD or 31-kD MGDF was canine Ig.
   Canine MGDF is characterized as a human megakaryocyte colony-stimulating
   factor that acts synergistically with human recombinant stem cell factor
   but not interleukin-3. MGDF also appears to be physiologically regulated
   in response to platelet demand, In canine and murine models, serum
   levels of MODE activity peak during the thrombocytopenic periods after
   irradiation, 5-fluorouracil, or antiplatelet antisera injections. These
   data indicate that the megakaryocyte-stimulating activity that
   accumulates in plasma in response to platelet losses is a novel cytokine
   that functions through an interaction with the Mpl cytokine receptor.

Abstract = {{To assess the relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
   throughout life and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers, the authors
   conducted in-person interviews with 41 male and 69 female never-smoking
   lung cancer cases and 117 male and 187 female never-smoking controls
   between 1983 and 1990 as part of a hospital-based case-control study of
   tobacco-related cancers. Cases had newly diagnosed, histologically
   confirmed primary carcinoma of the lung. Controls were matched to cases
   on age (+/-5 years), sex, race, hospital, and year of interview.
   Subjects were asked about environmental tobacco smoke exposure in
   childhood, in adulthood at home, in different jobs, and in
   transportation and social situations. In addition to amount smoked by
   family members in the subject's presence, subjects were asked to rate
   the intensity of each exposure, and married subjects were asked whether
   their spouse smoked in the bedroom, Several independent indicators of
   exposure to smoking by spouses were strongly correlated, thereby
   increasing confidence in the classification of exposure status. The
   reproducibility of environmental tobacco smoke variables was good for
   qualitative measures (yes/no), in agreement with previous studies, There
   were few associations of exposure in specific settings with lung cancer,
   Males whose wives smoked had an odds ratio of 1.60 (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 0.67-3.82) and females whose husbands smoked had an odds
   ratio of 1.08 (95\% CI 0.60-1.94). While this study had limited sample
   size, the pattern of odds ratios shows little indication of an
   association of environmental tobacco smoke with lung cancer in

Abstract = {{We have investigated the chemisorption of Cl atoms on the Si(100)-2X1
   surface using a semiempirical self-consistent molecular-orbital method.
   Cl atoms are found to saturate the dangling bonds of the surface Si
   symmetric dimer atoms in an off-normal direction in the equilibrium
   geometry. A low-energy diffusion path exists between these sites via a
   saddle point at the bridge-bonded site, consistent with the proposal of
   Boland based on scanning tunneling microscopy observations. The
   bridge-bonded site can also act as the attack site for further
   chemisorption of Cl on the dimer whose dangling bonds are already
   saturated by Cl atoms. This leads to bond lengthening and weakening of
   the Si-Si dimer bond and can contribute to subsequent bond breaking and
   redimerization yielding a mixture of monochloride and dichloride bonding
   configurations on the surface. The dichloride unit (SiCl2), in turn,
   exhibits bond weakening of the Si backbonds and this finding provides
   strong evidence for the spontaneous etching phenomena observed for
   halogens on Si(100) by Chander, Li, Rioux, and Weaver.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The p53 tumor suppressor gene has been well studied in
   epithelial ovarian cancers. However, little is known of the expression
   of this gene in ovarian germ cell tumors. The authors attempted to
   investigate whether p53 alterations occurred in this group of tumors.
   Methods. Twenty-two patients with malignant ovarian germ cell tumors
   were included in this study. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was
   performed on paraffin embedded tissue of each case. Single-strand
   conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene was
   performed on 9 of the 22 tumors where genomic DNAs were obtained from
   the frozen tissue samples. Three tumors that revealed focal p53
   positivity by immunostaining were studied further with direct DNA
   sequencing.
   Results. Overexpression of p53 was not observed in all of the 22 ovarian
   germ cell tumors; only 3 were found to have nuclear staining in a small
   fraction of the malignant cells (<5\% in 1 immature teratoma, 5-10\% in
   2 yolk-sac tumors). Among the nine frozen tumors subjected to
   single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, none revealed p53
   mutation in exons 4-9. There was no p53 mutation detected by DNA
   sequencing of the three tumors with focal immunoreactivity.
   Conclusions. Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene may not be
   associated with the pathogenesis of ovarian germ cell tumors. Instead,
   genetic changes such as inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes
   and/or activation of some protooncogenes need to be studied to determine
   the genetic mechanisms of the tumor development.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to systematically characterize the excitable
   gap and conduction properties of the reentrant circuit during
   atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Previous studies
   have attempted to analyze these properties by introducing single
   ventricular extrastimuli during tachycardia. These studies have been
   limited, however, by the inability of single extrastimuli to engage the
   circuit in the majority of patients studied. Thus, in most cases, the
   nature of the excitable gap and the conduction properties of the
   anterograde and retrograde limbs of the circuit during tachycardia
   remain undefined. In this series, 11 patients with typical AVNRT were
   studied. During tachycardia, bath single and double ventricular
   extrastimuli (the first extrastimulus acting as a conditioning stimulus)
   were used to scan diastole. The resetting response of the reentrant
   circuit, as well as the conduction properties of the retrograde fast and
   anterograde slow pathways, was recorded and analyzed. Whereas strial
   pre-excitation and resetting of the reentrant circuit could he
   demonstrated in only 1 patient with single ventricular extrastimuli,
   resetting was achieved in all 11 patients with closely coupled double
   ventricular extrastimuli. Over the full range of coupling intervals
   used, no retrograde delay in fast pathway conduction could be
   demonstrated before tachycardia termination or ventricular
   refractoriness. Penetration of the reentrant circuit resulted in a
   progressive increasing delay in the anterograde of portion of the
   subsequent return cycle and an increasing resetting response pattern in
   all cases. Thus, the reentrant circuit during AVNRT demonstrates
   heterogeneous excitability. While the fast pathway remains fully
   excitable during tachycardia, the slow pathway uniformly demonstrates
   decremental conduction, resulting in an increasing resetting response
   pattern. An increasing resetting response pattern does not preclude the
   presence of fully excitable tissue within a reentrant circuit.}},

Abstract = {{1. Puberty onset in female mice is accelerated by exposure to
   conspecific adult male urine, which acts through the vomeronasal organ
   and the accessory olfactory system. A distinctive component of adult
   male mouse urine is the major urinary protein complex (MUP), which is a
   lipocalin; it has a hydrophobic pocket that binds small endogenous
   volatile molecules. The MUP gene family also codes for a hexapeptide,
   which has four residues in common with the N-terminal region of MUP.
   2. MUP, the volatiles bound to MUP and the MUP-related hexapeptide have
   been tested for the induction of puberty acceleration by measuring the
   increase in uterus weight related to the first pro-oestrus phase. MUP,
   together with its bound volatiles, induces puberty acceleration. Its
   activity is retained even when the volatiles have been removed either by
   organic extraction or competition displacement with a high-affinity
   ligand.
   3. MUP-related hexapeptide also induces puberty acceleration in female
   mice. In contrast, the odorants bound to MUP do not exert this effect.
   4. It is proposed that the vomeronasal organ contains receptors that
   recognize the short N-terminal consensus sequence, N-Glu-Glu-Ala-X-Ser
   (where X is a polar residue), common to both MUP and the hexapeptide.}},

   and/or whether additional non-Ha-ras 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
   (DMBA) initiation target genes exist in mouse skin, which could
   cooperate with v-Ha-ras to increase the frequency of initiation, rate of
   promotion, or risk of malignant conversion, we treated TG.AC mouse skin
   with a single subthreshold dose of DMBA, This was followed by limited
   TPA or diacylglycerol promotion to select for cells with additional
   genetic alterations over those cells containing the v-Ha-ras transgene
   only, DMBA-treated/TPA-promoted TG.AC mice demonstrated a 10-fold
   increase in the average number of papillomas per mouse, a greater
   incidence of papilloma bearing-mice, and an increased papilloma growth
   rate when compared to acetone-treated/TPA-promoted TG.AC mice. These
   profound changes in papilloma frequency and growth occurred in the
   absence of the characteristic DMBA-induced A(182)-->T mutation in
   c-Ha-ras acid immunohistochemical nuclear staining for p53 protein,
   DMBA-treated/acetone-promoted TG.AC mice did not develop any tumors.
   Limited promotion with the model diacylglycerol,
   sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol, similarly produced an average of 10-fold more
   papillomas in DMBA-treated mice than in
   acetone-treated/sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol-promoted TG.AC mice,
   DMBA-treated/TPA-promoted TG.AC mice developed their first malignancy by
   16 weeks, and by 30 weeks, 50\% of the mice developed
   malignancies,,whereas no malignancies were observed in
   acetone-treated/TPA-promoted TG.AC mice. These results indicate that
   there exist unidentified DMBA initiation target genes in TG.AC mouse
   skin that cooperate with mutant Ha-ms to increase papilloma frequency,
   growth, and malignant conversion, and that promoter treatment can
   influence malignant conversion by selecting for cells with multiple
   genetic alterations.}},

Abstract = {{Propagation of disturbances through a uniform region of a relaxing gas
   in a duct with spatially varying cross section is analysed using the
   methods of relatively undistorted waves and weakly nonlinear geometrical
   optics. Particular attention is focused on situations when the
   disturbance amplitude is finite, arbitrarily small and not so small. In
   certain situations a complete history of the evolutionary behaviour of
   waves including weak shocks can be traced out. The asymptotic decay laws
   for weak shocks in a non-relaxing gas are exactly recovered. The damping
   effects of relaxation and non-planar wavefront configurations on the
   distortion, attenuation and shock formation of pulses, as they
   propagate, are described in detail. In the small-amplitude
   high-frequency limit, a solution up to the second order is obtained and
   numerical computations are carried out for typical values of the
   physical parameters involved in the solution. Transport equations are
   derived for signals having all possible wave modes which are mutually
   coupled and interact resonantly among themselves. The progressive wave
   approach describes the far field behaviour which is governed by the
   generalized Burger's equation.}},

Abstract = {{A general expression for the k . p Hamiltonian in crystals with linear
   topological defects such as dislocations, disclinations, and
   dispirations has been found. It has been shown to contain gauge
   potential terms corresponding to a non-Abelian gauge group, E(3), which
   is the proper Euclidean group. The gauge field is confined within the
   cores of topological defects and influences the carriers in the bulk of
   the crystal through the gauge potential which extends beyond it. A
   general expression for the gauge potential A(r) is presented, For a
   crystal that contains only dislocations the gauge group E(3) degenerates
   into T(3), the Abelian subgroup of translations. The corresponding gauge
   potential becomes (A) over cap(r) = i beta(T)(r)((p) over cap/HBAR-k
   alpha), where k(alpha) is the electron wave vector related to the point
   in the Brillouin zone for which the k . p Hamiltonian is written, (p)
   over cap is the momentum-operator matrix in the basis of Bloch functions
   corresponding to k(alpha), and beta(r) is the distortion tenser.}},

Abstract = {{We examined chemotaxis of human plasma cells (PCs) in response to
   extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) in the human PC cell lines FR4ds
   and OPM-1ds. The FR4ds cells expressed beta 1(+), beta 3(-), alpha 2(-),
   alpha 3(-), alpha 4(+), alpha 5(+), alpha 6(+), and alpha v(+)
   integrins, whereas the OPM-1ds cells expressed beta 1(+), beta 3(-),
   alpha 2(-), alpha 3(+), alpha 4(+), alpha 5(-), alpha 6(+), and alpha
   v(+). Fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) promoted the chemotaxis of the
   PCs. An inhibitory assay with anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies
   (MoAbs) showed that anti-alpha 4 MoAb partially inhibited the chemotaxis
   of FR4ds and completely inhibited the chemotaxis of OPM-1ds. Anti-alpha
   5 MoAb alone had no effect on either of these two lines. Nevertheless,
   anti-alpha 5 MoAb completely inhibited chemotaxis when it was added with
   anti-alpha 4 in FR4ds, demonstrating a novel complementary role of VLA-5
   toward VLA-4 in the chemotaxis induced by FN. LN facilitated chemotaxis
   both in OPM-1ds expressing alpha 3 and alpha 6 integrins and in FR4ds
   expressing alpha 6 integrin alone. Anti-alpha 6 MoAb completely
   inhibited FR4ds chemotaxis, whereas anti-alpha 3 and -alpha 6 MoAb had
   synergistic inhibitory effects on the chemotaxis of OPM-1ds. These
   results indicated that the distribution of PCs in human tissue are
   determined by at least two factors: the concentration of the ECM
   proteins FN and LN and the expression of integrins. (C) 1995 by The

Abstract = {{In Ag-presenting cells, MHC class II molecules bind antigenic peptides
   in endocytic compartments and transport them to the cell surface for
   presentation to CD4(+) T cells. Newly synthesized class II alpha beta
   heterodimers associate with a third polypeptide, invariant chain (li),
   in the endoplasmic reticulum. This association may prevent class II
   molecules from binding peptides until they are transported to endocytic
   compartments where li is proteolyzed. Signals in the li cytosolic tail
   are believed to be responsible for the targeting of class II-li
   complexes to endocytic compartments, but it is unclear whether this
   targeting event occurs at the trans face of the Golgi or at the plasma
   membrane. In this report, we address whether the endosomal localization
   signal in the li cytosolic tail can be functionally substituted with a
   tyrosine-based signal for rapid internalization from the cell surface. A
   chimeric protein was generated in which the li cytosolic tail was
   replaced in its entirety with the cytosolic tail from transferrin
   receptor. In cells expressing this chimeric form of li, newly
   synthesized class II-li complexes travel rapidly to the cell surface and
   are internalized efficiently, but li proteolysis is delayed and class II
   Ag presentation is inhibited. These results suggest that targeting class
   II-li complexes to early/recycling endosomes from the cell surface does
   not in itself lead to li proteolysis; subsequent delivery to later
   endosomes may be required. The data suggest that signals for this
   targeting event may lie in residues 18 to 29 of the li cytosolic tail.}},

   GM-CSF promoter, PEBP2 alpha A1, alpha B1, and alpha B2 proteins bound

Abstract = {{Although psychotropic drug use has been associated with increased risk
   of falls in long-term care settings, this association may be confounded
   by the high prevalence of dementia and depression and other fall risk
   factors. This question was addressed in a prospective cohort study of
   recurrent falls among 282 ambulatory residents of 12 Tennessee nursing
   homes during 1991-1992, Eligible subjects were greater than or equal to
   65 years of age, ambulatory, able to provide study data, and expected to
   remain in the nursing home for greater than or equal to 3 months.
   Baseline data collected for each cohort member included symptoms of
   dementia (cognitive impairment and behavior problems) and depression,
   medication use, and other potential fall risk factors, Falls were
   ascertained from facility incident reports and nursing home charts.
   During follow-up, 111 residents had greater than or equal to 2 falls, an
   incidence rate of 54.9 recurrent falls per 100 person-years. With the
   use of Cox proportional hazards modeling, the authors found incidence
   density ratios (95\% confidence intervals (CI)) showing that the
   following risk factors were independently associated with recurrent
   falls: age greater than or equal to 75 years (1.66 (1.01-2.72)); greater
   than or equal to 4 assisted activities of daily living (1.94
   (1.09-3.47)); middle (2.08 (1.20-3.61)) and upper (2.54 (1.44-4.49))
   tertiles of balance impairment; fall in the 90 days preceding assessment
   (2.01 (1.32-3.06)); and upper tertile of behavior problems (1.65
   (1.03-2.64)). The rate of recurrent falls increased tenfold as the
   number of these risk factors increased from 0 to 5 (21.4 to 231.5 per
   100 person-years, p < 0.0002). After controlling for symptoms of
   dementia and depression and other fall risk factors, the incidence
   density ratio for recurrent falls in baseline regular psychotropic drug
   users (n = 178) compared with nonusers (n = 104) was 1.97 (95\% CI
   1.28-3.05). Within groups defined by number of other independent fall
   risk factors present, regular psychotropic users had a recurrent fall
   rate that was greater than that for nonusers: 44.1 versus 22.9 per 100
   person-years (p = 0.03) in the low risk (less than or equal to 2
   factors) group and 98.7 versus 64.3 (p = 0.08) in the high risk (>2
   factors) group. The attributable risk of recurrent falls for regular
   psychotropic drug users was 36\%, which suggests optimal management of
   psychopharmacotherapy is an essential component of fall prevention
   programs for ambulatory nursing home residents.}},

   of BF2+ implanted in Si substrates and linewidth on TiSi2 silicidation
   and the phase transition from C49 to C54. BF2+ implantation suppresses
   both silicidation and the phase transition, and the phase transition is
   also markedly suppressed on narrow lines. As a result, all the C49 TiSi2
   remains for 0.5 mu m lines with BF2+ dose of 2 x 10(15) cm(-2) after the
   2nd rapid thermal annealing (800 degrees C, 30 s). Furthermore, we have
   found that the grains of C49 TiSi2 are preferentially oriented to highly
   implanted substrates. This indicates that the phase of these grains is
   stable thermally and difficult to transform to C54 phase.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that surfactant protein A (SP-A) derived
   from alveolar-proteinosis patients activates rat alveolar macrophages.
   However, it is not known if normal rat, dog and human SP-A can also
   stimulate alveolar macrophages. As alveolar-proteinosis SP-A has a
   slightly different structure from ordinary SP-A, it would be possible
   that the ascribed alveolar-macrophage-stimulating properties of SP-A are
   restricted to alveolar-proteinosis SP-A. To clarify this issue, we
   isolated SP-A from normal rat and dog pulmonary surfactants, using the
   same isolation technique commonly used for the isolation of
   alveolar-proteinosis SP-A, i.e. by butanol precipitation In contrast
   with human alveolar-proteinosis SP-A, rat and dog SP-A obtained thus
   could not activate rat alveolar macrophages to produce oxygen radicals
   or enhance the phagocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled
   herpes simplex virus. However, rat, dog and normal human SP-A isolated
   by a novel method, involving extraction from pulmonary surfactant by
   using n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and subsequent purification by
   cation-exchange chromatography, were able to elicit an oxidative burst
   in rat as well as normal human alveolar macrophages. In addition, dog
   and rat SP-A obtained thus stimulated the phagocytosis of herpes simplex
   virus by rat alveolar macrophages. These findings indicate that normal
   human, rat and dog SP-A have the same alveolar-macrophage-stimulating
   properties as human alveolar proteinosis SP-A. Dog and rat SP-A isolated
   by this novel method had the same Ca2+-dependent self-aggregation and
   lipid-aggregation properties as SP-A isolated by butanol precipitation.
   The new and milder isolation procedure yielded SP-A of high purity, as
   judged by SDS/PAGE and ELISA.}},

   formation, but rare-earth complexes with the same composition and

   individual features of the alkali cations. Three types of coordination
   of the Ln atoms by nitrate group were found: monodentate, bidentate and

Abstract = {{Medical records of 30 dogs with histologically confirmed sebaceous
   adenitis that were treated with isotretinoin or etretinate were

   with the general hospital population. Thirteen dogs had concurrent
   pyoderma.
   The retinoids were administered for a minimum of 2 months. Dosage for
   the 13 dogs treated with isotretinoin only ranged from 0.8 to 3.5 mg/kg
   of body weight/d (mean, 1.4 mg/kg/d). Dosage for the 10 dogs treated
   with etretinate only ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 mg/kg/d (mean, 1.1 mg/kg/d).
   Two dogs were first given isotretinoin (mean dosage, 1.5 mg/kg/d) and,
   when they did not respond, were subsequently given etretinate (mean
   dosage, 0.85 mg/kg/d). Five dogs were first given etretinate (mean

   given isotretinoin (mean dosage, 1.6 mg/kg/d).
   For the 20 dogs treated with isotretinoin, 1 was lost to follow-up, 9 of

   of scaling and extent of alopecia, compared with pretreatment
   appearance). For the 17 dogs treated with etretinate, 9 had a successful

Abstract = {{The association of paraquat dication (methylviologen) with simple
   neutral pi-donor molecules is generally quite weak (K-assn < 16 M(-1))
   in polar, aprotic solvents. A new type of neutral paraquat receptor is
   described whose structure incorporates two dative B-N dipoles fixed in
   convergent orientations that are complementary with the two cationic
   centers of paraquat. The receptor binds paraquat
   bis(hexafluorophosphate) as a 1:1 complex with an association constant
   of 320 M(-1) in acetone as determined by H-1 NMR titration experiments.
   The complex is held together by a combination of intermolecular forces:
   (i) ion-dipole stabilization due to the negative ends of the two dative

Abstract = {{A conserved NPX(2-3)Y sequence that is located in the seventh
   transmembrane helix of many G protein-coupled receptors has been
   predicted to participate in receptor signaling and endocytosis, The role
   of this sequence (NPLFY) in angiotensin II receptor function was studied
   in mutant and wild-type rat type la angiotensin II receptors transiently
   expressed in COS-7 cells. The ability of the receptor to interact with G
   proteins and to stimulate inositol phosphate responses was markedly
   impaired by alanine replacement of Asn(298) and was reduced by
   replacement of Pro(299) or Tyr(302). The F301A mutant receptor exhibited
   normal G protein coupling and inositol phosphate responses, and the
   binding of the peptide antagonist, {[}Sar(1),Ile(8)]angiotensin II, was
   only slightly affected, However, its affinity for angiotensin II and the
   nonpeptide antagonist losartan was reduced by an order of a magnitude,
   suggesting that angiotensin II and losartan share an intramembrane
   binding site, possibly through their aromatic moieties. None of the
   agonist-occupied mutant receptors, including Y302A and triple alanine
   replacements of Phe(301), Tyr(302), and Phe(304), showed substantial
   changes in their internalization kinetics, These findings demonstrate
   that the NPLFY sequence of the type 1a angiotensin II receptor is not an
   important determinant of agonist-induced internalization, However, the
   Phe(301) residue contributes significantly to agonist binding, and
   Asn(298) is required for normal receptor activation and signal
   transduction.}},

Abstract = {{The lumazine synthase/riboflavin synthase complex of Bacillus subtilis
   consists of an icosahedral capsid of 60 beta subunits surrounding a core
   of three alpha subunits. The beta subunits catalyze the condensation of
   5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (PYR) with
   3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHB) yielding
   6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. This intermediate is converted to
   riboflavin by the alpha subunits via an unusual dismutation. The second
   product of this reaction is PYR, which is also a substrate of the beta
   subunits and can be recycled in the catalytic process.
   Sigmoidal kinetics would be expected for the formation of riboflavin
   from PYR and DHB and are indeed observed with mixtures of artifactual
   beta(60) capsids and alpha subunit trimers. In contrast, the formation
   of riboflavin from PYR and DHB by the native alpha(3) beta(60) is
   characterized by a finite initial rate, which is similar to the rate of
   lumazine formation. Most notably, the rate of riboflavin formation has
   its maximum value at t = 0 and decreases dramatically after the
   consumption of PYR and DHB despite the presence of transiently formed
   lumazine. These data suggest that a significant fraction of DHB is
   converted to riboflavin by substrate channeling, which is conducive to
   an improved overall catalytic rate of riboflavin formation at low
   substrate concentrations. The channel is leaky, and the intermediate
   lumazine is therefore transiently accumulated in the bulk solution. The
   partitioning factor relating the direct formation of riboflavin via
   substrate channeling and the formation of transient
   6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine increases at low concentrations of the
   substrates PYR and DHB and has a maximum value at pH 7.5. Channeling
   appears to result from the compartmentalization of the alpha subunits
   inside the icosahedral beta subunit capsid whose catalytic sites are
   located close to the inner capsid surface.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallizing proteins presents long-standing problems with sluggish
   kinetics and competing growth-limiting factors in solution. This work
   examines potential limiting factors arising from protein-water
   interactions and protein-protein aggregation. Since a hydrated shell
   shields bare protein contacts, multiple layers of highly viscous water
   impose restrictions on protein addition. If proteins attach to the
   crystal as aggregates, they are found to be particularly sensitive to
   misalignments and denaturation. The modelling extends to include the
   protein's shape as a fractal, the number of its binding sites and
   possible effects of flow-induced shear. It concludes that: (i) when
   protein-water interactions are taken into account, convective shear
   approaches velocities of the order of magnitude that alter protein
   kinetics; (ii) protein aggregation puts narrow tolerances on correct
   molecular alignments; and (iii) a protein's characteristic `stringy'
   shape as a fractal can favour aggregates compared with the monomer as a
   growth unit. A model for protein addition as an extensible, tethered
   molecule is proposed and examined against flow strengths and random
   thermal vibrations. Comparison of the protein model with experimental
   lysozyme results suggests that forced fluid flows as small as 100 mu m
   s(-1) can disrupt protein attachment and thus detrimentally limit

Abstract = {{Determination of the atmospheric concentrations and lifetime of
   trichloroethane (CH3CCl3) is very important in the context of global
   change. This halocarbon is involved in depletion of ozone, and the
   hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations determined from its lifetime
   provide estimates of the lifetimes of most other hydrogen-containing
   gases involved in the ozone layer and climate. Global measurements of
   trichloroethane indicate rising concentrations before and declining
   concentrations after late 1991. The lifetime of CH3CCl3 in the total
   atmosphere is 4.8 +/- 0.3 years, which is substantially lower than
   previously estimated. The deduced hydroxyl radical concentration, which
   measures the atmosphere's oxidizing capability, shows little change from
   1978 to 1994.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by olfactory
   keratin(+) basal cells was investigated in vitro. In primary cultures
   from embryonic day 14.5 or newborn mouse olfactory epithelium (OE), flat
   keratin(+) basal cells were negative for NCAM-immunostaining.
   Transforming-growth factor-beta 1, beta 2 (TGF-beta 1, beta 2) or a high
   concentration of Ca2+ induced these cells to express NCAM. We obtained a
   cell line, designated DBC1.2 from embryonic day 14.5 mouse OE. All
   DBC1.2 cells were positive for keratin-immunostaining, whereas nearly
   all cells were negative for NCAM-immunostaining. Therefore, DBC1.2 cells
   seemed to derive from dark basal cells, DBC1.2 cells were also induced
   to express NCAM by the treatment with TGF-beta s or a high Ca2+
   concentration. Western blotting revealed that the components of the NCAM
   expressed by DBC1.2 were 120 and 140 kDa, but not 180 kDa, isoforms.
   Since NCAM is the cell adhesion molecule mainly expressed in nervous
   tissues, these results suggest a cell lineage relationship or

Abstract = {{Herbimycin A is an ansamycin antibiotic isolated as an agent that
   reverses morphological transformation induced by v-src. Although
   herbimycin A is widely used as a tool for inhibiting multiple tyrosine
   protein kinases and tyrosine kinase-activated signal transduction, its
   mechanism of action is not well defined and includes a decrease in both
   tyrosine kinase protein levels and activity (Uehara, Y., Murakami, Y.,
   Sugimoto, Y., and Mizuno, S, (1989) Cancer Res. 49, 780-785). We now
   show that herbimycin A induces a profound decrease in the total cellular
   activity of transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, such as
   insulin-like growth factor, insulin, and epidermal growth factor
   receptors. A substantial proportion of the in vivo inhibition could be
   explained by an increase in the rate of degradation, The enhanced
   degradation of insulin-like growth factor-insulin receptor was prevented
   by inhibitors of the 20S proteasome, whereas neither lysosomotropic
   agents nor general serine- and cysteine-protease inhibitors were active
   in preventing receptor degradation induced by herbimycin A. Moreover, in
   a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line defective in the E1-catalyzed
   activation of ubiquitin, herbimycin A treatment at the restrictive
   temperature did not result in the degradation of insulin receptor, These
   results suggest that herbimycin A represents a novel class of drug that
   targets the degradation of tyrosine kinases by the 20S proteasome. The
   ubiquitin dependence of this process indicates that this degradation of
   tyrosine kinases might involve the 20S proteasome as the proteolytic
   core of the ubiquitin-dependent 26S protease.}},

   From the vibrationally state-resolved energy and angular spectra of the

   the CM system. Absolute units are obtained by using elastic H- + He
   scattering as a reference system. The measurements allow detailed
   conclusions concerning the reaction mechanism. By integrating over
   angles and summing over partial cross sections (for individual v' states
   of the HD product molecule), we determine the absolute total cross
   section of the reaction. The reaction has a threshold at E(rel) = 0.42
   +/- 0.12 eV. The cross section rises to a maximum of 2 x 10(-16) cm(2)
   at 1.5 eV and then rapidly decreases again. The present results resolve
   a discrepancy between two previous measurements bearing on the

Abstract = {{A lysophospholipase-transacylase (h-LPTA) was purified to homogeneity
   from a clinical isolate of Candida albicans (C. albicans) that had high
   extracellular phospholipase activity (strain 16240). The purified enzyme
   was a glycoprotein with molecular mass of 84 kDa on sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activities of
   the enzyme were 117 mu mol/min per mg protein for fatty acid release and
   459 mu mol/min per mg protein for phosphatidylcholine (PC) formation. An
   apparent K-m of the hydrolase activity of the enzyme for
   1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-palmitoyl-lyso-PC) was 60.6
   mu M. The enzyme had a pH optimum at 6.0, Transacylase activity of the
   enzyme was partially inhibited by palmitoylcarnitine (35\% inhibition)
   and N-ethylmaleimide, In contrast, the hydrolase activity of the enzyme
   was stimulated by palmitoylcarnitine but was partially inhibited by
   N-ethylmaleimide, The enzyme exhibited broad specificity to
   lyso-phospholipids, The h-LPTA activity was not dependent on divalent
   cations (Ca2+ acid Mg2+) and was not inhibited by addition of EDTA or
   EGTA. These results show that C. albicans strain 16240 with high
   extracellular phospholipase activity produced h-LPTA in large amount.
   This enzyme is biochemically distinct from the LPTA enzyme previously
   isolated from C. albicans 3125.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature monitoring during photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical
   5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) cream application was performed on 22
   patients with solar keratoses (SK) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The
   lesions were located on the forehead, nose, ear and cheek. Temperature
   measurements during photoirradiation, with a power density of 100
   mW/cm(2) from an incoherent light source (light delivery system for
   PDT), were carried out by noncontact (infrared thermal imaging
   radiometer) and contact (thermocouple) methods. Thermal imaging analysis
   revealed nonuniform temperature distribution in the irradiated areas.
   The temperature gradually increased from the peripheral to the central
   zone of the area. The results showed that photoirradiation induced
   heating of the skin tumors to 39.5-42.5 degrees C during the PDT
   procedure. The temperature of normal skin areas disposed symmetrically
   to the lesions on the contralateral side at the same conditions of
   irradiation (without prior ALA application) was about 42-43.5 degrees C.
   The surface temperature differences (Delta T) between the normal and
   tumor tissues after 10 min of irradiation were 3.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C in
   the forehead areas, 2.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C in the nose areas and 0.8 +/-
   0.3 degrees C in the ear areas.}},

Abstract = {{Although combination therapy using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
   (HMG-Co-A) reductase inhibitors and fibrates is efficacious in combined
   hyperlipidemia, such treatment has been associated with myopathy. For
   this reason, we studied the effects of fluvastatin and gemfibrozil,
   alone or in combination, on muscle. A total of 21 patients with combined
   hyperlipidemia were recruited who were matched for age, body mass index,
   and baseline levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
   triglycerides, creatine phosphokinase, and myoglobin. Patients were
   randomized to three groups for 6-week treatment with fluvastatin at 40
   mg/day, gemfibrozil at 600 mg twice daily, or a combination of the two
   drugs. Parameters for muscle damage were rises in levels of serum
   creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin compared with pre-exercise levels;
   these were assessed 1 hr and 8 hr after a 45 min lean body mass
   standardized ergometer test, which was performed before and after
   treatment in all patients. Biopsies from the quadriceps muscle were
   taken 48 hr after each test. Fluvastatin lowered total cholesterol and
   LDL-C by 23\% and 35\%, respectively (p <0.01), with no effects on
   triglycerides and HDL-C. Gemfibrozil lowered triglycerides by 40\% (p
   <0.01) but did not lower total cholesterol or LDL-C significantly. The
   combination therapy decreased total cholesterol LDL-C, and triglycerides
   by 28\%, 29\%, and 39\%, respectively (p <0.05). Pre-exercise creatine
   phosphokinase and myoglobin levels were not affected by treatment in any
   group. The mean +/- SEM peak creatine phosphokinase rise (8 hr after
   exercise) did not differ significantly before or after treatment with
   fluvastatin or combination therapy, but was reduced after treatment with
   gemfibrozil (43.3 +/- 13.8 vs 23.0 +/- 6.9 U/liter; p <0.05). Peak
   myoglobin rise (1 hr after exercise) was similar before and after
   treatment with fluvastatin and gemfibrozil, but was lower after
   combination therapy. Two patients had abnormal muscle histology (atrophy
   of type 2 fibers) before therapy, whereas after treatment only 1 patient
   taking fluvastatin and 1 taking gemfibrozil had abnormal histology. In
   conclusion, 8-week combination therapy with fluvastatin plus gemfibrozil
   is effective in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and has no adverse
   effects on muscle.}},

Abstract = {{It has been known for some time that zinc, as well as most transition
   metal ions, is capable of binding to the DNA bases, However, little is
   known about the presence and distribution of metal binding sites along
   naturally occurring genomic DNA molecules, In this paper, the
   interaction of zinc with the Xenopus 5S-RNA gene has been studied and
   several metal binding sites have been identified on the basis of the
   changes in chemical reactivity observed in the presence of the metal,
   The strongest zinc-binding sites of the Xenopus 5S-RNA gene correspond
   to GGG trinucleotide repeats, Some GG dinucleotides also show a
   significant affinity for zinc, Interestingly, the binding site for
   TFIIIA, a zinc-finger transcription factor, contains several sites with
   strong zinc affinity, In particular, a TGGGA sequence which is essential
   for the binding of TFIIIA shows the strongest affinity for zinc, The
   conformational properties of this DNA sequence, together with the high
   electronegative potential of GGG runs, is likely to determine its strong
   affinity for zinc, The possible biological relevance of these results is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptional induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene in response to
   serum growth factors is mediated in part by a ternary complex that forms
   on the serum response element (SRE) within its promoter, This complex
   consists of Elk-1, serum response factor (SRF) and the SRE, Elk-1 is
   phosphorylated by MAP kinase, which correlates with the induction of
   c-fos transcription, In this study we have investigated the
   protein-induced DNA bending which occurs during the formation and
   post-translational modification of the ternary complex that forms at the
   c-fos SRE, Circular permutation analysis demonstrates that the minimal
   DNA-binding domain of SRF, which contains the MADS box, is sufficient to
   induce flexibility into the centre of its binding site within the SRE,
   Phasing analysis indicates that at least part of this flexibility
   results in the production of a directional bend towards the minor
   groove, The isolated ETS domains from Elk-1 and SAP-1 induce neither DNA
   bending nor increased DNA flexibility, Formation of ternary complexes by
   binding of Elk-1 to the binary SRF:SRE complex results in a change in
   the flexibility of the SRE, Phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAP kinase
   (p42/ERK2) induces further minor changes in this DNA flexibility,
   However, phasing analysis reveals that the recruitment of Elk-1 to form
   the ternary complex affects the SRF-induced directional DNA bend in the
   SRE. The potential roles of DNA bending at the c-fos SRE are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Filaggrin, the intermediate filament aggregating protein of epidermis,
   is the product of proteolytic processing of the precursor profilaggrin,
   which consists of 10-20 tandem filaggrin domains. The proteolytic
   processing sites in mouse and rat profilaggrin have been previously
   reported. Mouse filaggrin is N-terminally blocked, Rat filaggrin is
   N-terminally ragged, making it heterogeneous. Human filaggrin, in
   addition to being N-terminally blocked and potentially ragged at the
   amino terminus, is heterogeneous due to sequence variation between one
   filaggrin domain and another along the profilaggrin gene, This
   complexity has made more difficult the analysis of processing sites in
   human profilaggrin. We have identified the amino terminus of human
   filaggrin by applying a general method we have developed for the
   recognition of amino-terminal peptides in digests of N-terminally
   blocked proteins. This method compares the peptides in an acetylated and
   an unacetylated tryptic digest of the protein during their separation by
   liquid chromatography on-line with electrospray mass spectrometry. In
   this comparison only the original blocked amino-terminal peptides appear
   unchanged between the two profiles, Human filaggrin was found to have a
   heterogeneous N-terminus, as a result both of sequence heterogeneity and
   of ragged processing; it is blocked by a pyrrolidonecarboxyl group
   derived from glutamine. By comparison to the termini of rat and mouse
   filaggrins, implications for the processing of human profilaggrin are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Rocking curves acquired with thermal energy He-atom scattering indicate
   that for small 2D Ag islands grown on Ag(100) at 200 K, the apparent
   step height normal to the surface is reduced by about 0.6 Angstrom
   compared to the step height calculated on the basis of bulk separation.
   For higher growth temperatures this effect is not observed. SPA-LEED
   measurements indicate that this behavior cannot be explained with a
   corresponding relaxation of island atoms. Rather, it may be attributed
   to a smoothening of the electronic corrugation (Smoluchowski effect),
   which is probed by the He atoms and which can be expected to occur for
   small and/or closely spaced islands. The dependence on the growth
   temperature indicates that this effect is, indeed, related to the size
   and proximity of the islands, being most pronounced for closely spaced
   islands consisting of a few tens of atoms only. These findings suggest
   that the difference between the morphology of the electron density
   contours, probed by methods which are sensitive to the density of
   valence electrons, such as atom scattering or scanning tunneling
   microscopy, and the morphology at the atomic core level is significant
   for small metal structures on metal surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent experiment, Ma et al. measured the temperature dependence of
   the gap anisotropy of oxygen-annealed Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Their
   measurements were taken along the two directions Gamma-M and Gamma-X.
   They found that the gap along both directions is nonzero at low
   temperatures and that the ratio of the two gaps is strongly temperature
   dependent. We show, using Ginzburg-Landau theory, that this behavior can
   be obtained if one assumes the existence of s-wave and d-wave components
   for the order parameter. Our theory predicts orthorhombic anisotropy in
   the gap, and a somewhat anomalous behavior for the electronic specific
   heat below T-c in this material. Since recent experiments indicate
   nearly pure d-wave symmetry for YBa2Cu3O7, this would imply that
   different high-T-c materials have substantially different order
   parameter symmetries.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular protein MDM2 can bind to the tumor suppressor gene product
   p53 and abrogate its transcriptional activity. in addition, p53 can
   regulate expression of the mdm2 gene. We and others have previously
   shown that p53 is present at high levels in adenovirus-transformed cells
   which express the larger E1B protein. In view of these observations the
   expression of MDM2 in a panel of adenovirus transformed human cell lines
   has been examined. Two major species (98K and 80K) were detected,
   together with a number of minor species of higher and lower molecular
   weight While there was little variation in levels of 98K protein between
   cell lines, appreciable differences in the expression of the 80K
   component were apparent. There was no correlation between MDM2 and p53
   expression in any of the adenovirus transformants, nor with the viral
   proteins expressed. The pattern and level of MDM2 detected was similar
   to that seen in human tumor cell lines and in human fetal tissue.
   Northern blot analysis suggested that MDM2 expression was regulated al
   the transcriptional level. Stable interactions were observed between p53
   and MDM2 in the adenovirus-transformed cell lines and in Ad5 E1 HEK 293
   cells a ternary complex of p53, MDM2, and the Ad5 E1B 58K protein was
   demonstrated. In view of the lack of correlation between the level of
   p53 and MDM2 in adenovirus E1-transformed cells, the capacity of p53 to
   cause transcriptional activation was assessed using transfected CAT
   constructs linked to p53 responsive elements. p53 transcriptional
   activity was similar in all of the cell lines examined and did not
   correlate with protein expression. It is concluded, on the basis of all
   of these data, that the high concentrations of p53 found in adenovirus
   transformants are not transcriptionally active and have no influence on
   MDM2 expression. However, when expression of p53 was increased following
   infection with mutant adenoviruses, which do not express the larger E1B
   proteins, there was an appreciable increase in p53 transcriptional
   activity and in the levels of all of the MDM2 components. (C) 1995

   T-cell subsets were used to separate highly purified CD4(+) and CD8(+)
   cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 35 individuals previously
   shown to be infected with HTLV-II. The purified T-cell subsets were
   analyzed for HTLV-II provirus (pol and tax gene sequences) by polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) and cultured to determine virus expression by
   p24(gag) antigen detection. On the basis of PCR amplification in the pol
   and tax gene regions, both CD8(+) subsets (89 to 91\%) and CD4(+)
   subsets (54 to 80\%) from most infected subjects demonstrated HTLV-II
   provirus, irrespective of the Viral genotype. Analysis of cultured
   lymphocytes demonstrated a higher spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation
   (17986 +/- 4675 cpm) and p24(gag) antigen production (median 115 pg/ml;
   range 14-1360 pg/ml) in CD8(+) cells compared to CD4(+) cells (2333 +/-
   826 cpm; p24(gag) antigen: 9 pg/ml; 2-250 pg/ml), suggesting a higher
   proviral load in CD8 cells. Limiting cell-dilution PCR analysis
   indicated that the CD8(+) subset carried a higher HTLV-II provirus
   burden than the CD4(+) subset in vitro infection of purified CD4(+) and
   CD8(+) lymphocytes with irradiated HTLV-II cell lines resulted in
   productive infection of both subsets. Cell sorting and PCR analysis of
   lymphocyte subsets from 4 HTLV-II-infected subjects further demonstrated
   that in addition to CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets, both CD45RO(+) and
   CD45RO(-) and non-T-cells (CD14, CD16, and CD19) carried HTLV-II

Abstract = {{Compressional velocity structure of the crust and-the upper mantle in
   southeastern Europe (broader Aegean area) is studied by inverting
   residuals of the first P arrivals from earthquakes in this region (16
   degrees E-31 degrees E, 34 degrees N-43 degrees N). The data used are
   from regional events recorded by the permanent network of stations
   during the period 1971-1987, enriched with data from experiments with
   portable seismographs in four regions of this broad area. This study
   confirms the strong variations of crustal thickness in this area as well
   as the subduction of the eastern Mediterranean lithosphere under the
   southern Aegean and gives further detailed information on the crustal
   and upper mantle structure of the area. Important new information is the
   existence of a low-velocity crustal layer in western Greece and Albania
   and that the velocity anomaly in the mantle under the southern Aegean
   extends much farther and deeper to the northeast than the Benioff zone
   of the intermediate depth earthquakes indicates. Furthermore, evidence
   is presented about the possible existence of older subduction in the
   northern Aegean and about the influence of the tectonic regime on the
   velocity field.}},

Abstract = {{The emissions from a petrol-driven private car with a cold engine are
   considerably greater than that of the same vehicle with a hot engine,
   regardless of whether or not a catalytic convertor is installed. For
   this reason, the first part of the project has studied the proportion of
   total emissions that are due to driving with a cold engine. When all
   private cars are equipped with catalytic convertors, the total emissions
   of CO and HC will decrease to similar to 43\%, in comparison with the
   situation in which no vehicles are equipped with catalytic convertors.
   The distribution of the total emissions will be 60\% and 40\%, when
   driving with cold and hot engines, respectively. This is in spite of the
   fact that petrol-driven private cars only drive with cold engines for
   9\% of the time. In the future, one of our major tasks will be to reduce
   emissions resulting from driving with a cold engine. Thirty-four percent
   of all emissions results from journeys up to 6 km, with distributions of
   27 and 7\% points for cold and hot engines, respectively, when all
   vehicles are fitted with catalytic convertors. In the effort to limit
   emissions, there is therefore clear potential for replanning short
   journeys and using some other, less polluting, form of transport.}},

Abstract = {{Due to 3' end modifications, mammalian U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is
   heterogeneous in size. The major form terminates with five U residues
   and a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, but multiple RNAs containing up to 12 U
   residues have a 3'-OH end. They are labeled in the presence of
   {[}alpha-P-32]UTP by the terminal uridylyl transferase activity present
   in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. That these forms all enter the U6
   snRNA-containing particles, U4 . U6, U4 . U5 . U6, and the spliceosome,
   has been demonstrated previously. Here, we report an interaction between
   the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C protein, an
   abundant nuclear pre-mRNA binding protein, and the U6 snRNAs that have
   the longest uridylate stretches. This U6 snRNA subset is free of any one
   of the other snRNPs, since anti-Sm antibodies failed to
   immunoprecipitate hnRNP C protein. Furthermore, isolated U4 . U6 snRNPs
   containing U6 snRNAs with long oligouridylate stretches are disrupted
   upon binding of hnRNP C protein either purified from HeLa cells or
   produced as recombinant protein from Escherichia coli. In view of these
   data and our previous proposal that the U6 snRNA active in splicing has
   3'-OH end, we discuss a model where the hnRNP C protein has a decisive
   function in the catalytic activation of the spliceosome by allowing the
   release of U4 snRNP.}},

Abstract = {{The presumption of intercontinental distributions of many species of
   Anomopoda has been reinforced by their considerable morphological
   uniformity and ease of passive dispersal via ephippial eggs. To test the
   validity of this dogma, genetic variation among taxa in the cladoceran
   genus Simocephalus was examined on a continental scale. Genetic
   variability (percentage polymorphic loci = 8.8\%, individual
   heterozygosity = 3.4\%) was comparable to that determined on a local
   scale in Simocephalus and somewhat less than for other zooplankton
   groups. Four species complexes were distinguished allozymically with
   unique allelic substitutions found for at least two loci between these
   taxa. Eight species in North America were differentiated within these
   complexes (Nei s genetic distance, D > 0.30), all of which were clearly
   separated from two European species. Both S. cf, vetulus and S. cf.
   serrulatus are broadly distributed in North America, and intraspecific
   divergence is relatively low. In contrast, S. cf. congener and S. cf.
   exspinosus represent species complexes, both consisting of several
   species, differentiated allozymically and morphologically. The concept
   of generalist species with moderate genetic variation throughout a broad
   range and specialist species, genetically depauperate, with restricted
   distributions, is explored.}},

Abstract = {{Aurin tricarboxylic acid (ATA), a general nuclease inhibitor, was
   reported to prevent PC12 cells from cell death caused by serum
   starvation (1). In our study, ATA also protected PC12 cells, but not
   NIH3T3 cells, from serum-starved cell death. When we investigated the
   mechanism of action of ATA on these cells, ATA was found to increase
   tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells. Further
   investigation on tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins revealed that ATA,
   similar to nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor, induced
   tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Since the
   tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases is thought
   to play an important role in growth factor-dependent signal pathways,
   this finding suggests that the action of ATA on PC12 cells is mediated
   by tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, similar 60 growth factor signaling.
   In addition, we found that She proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
   and phospholipase C-gamma were also phosphorylated in ATA-treated PC12
   cells. These key proteins in signal transduction pathways are known to
   associate with ligand-activated growth factor receptors and are
   phosphorylated on tyrosine. Thus, the phosphorylation of these three
   proteins by ATA stimulation supports the speculation that ATA activates
   a certain receptor tyrosine kinase.}},

   ({[}Ac-DNal(1),DCpa(2),DPal(3),Aph(5)(Atz),DAph(6)(Atz),ILys(8),DAla(10)
   ]GnRH) was synthesized, characterized, and tested in a rat antiovulatory
   assay (AOA). Selected analogues were also tested in both an in vitro
   dispersed rat pituitary cell culture assay for inhibition of
   GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone release and an in. vitro histamine
   release assay. The duration of action of some of the most potent and
   safest analogues in those assays was also determined in the castrated
   male rat in order to measure the extent (efficacy and duration of
   action) of inhibition of luteinizing hormone release. Structurally, this
   series of analogues has novel substitutions (X and Y) in the structure
   of the azaline B precursor:
   {[}Ac-DNal(1),DCpa(2),DPal(3),-Aph(5)(X),DAph(6)(Y),ILys(8),DAla(10)]GnR
   H. These substitutions were designed to confer increased hydrophilicity
   as compared to that of azaline B (determined by relative retention times
   on a C-18 reverse phase column using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer
   at pH 7.3) or to make them more easily accessible synthetically. Some
   bulky substituents were introduced in order to probe the spatial
   limitations of the receptor's cavity. These substitutions include
   acylated 4-aminophenylalanine at positions 5 and/or 6 (29 analogues),
   N-alpha-methylated backbone substitutions (six analogues),
   N-omega-isopropylaminophenylalanine at position 8, and hydrophilic amino
   acids at position 1. Out of 20 novel analogues tested for long duration
   position 8, and hydrophilic amino acids at position 1. Out of 20 novel
   analogues tested for long duration of action in this series, only seven
   ({[}Ac-DNal(1),DCpa(2),DPal(3),Aph(5),DAph(6),ILys(8),DAla(10)]GnRH,

   to those of azaline B. The others were one-half to one-tenth as
   effective as azaline B. N-alpha-Methylated backbone substitutions at
   position 5 yielded analogues that were significantly more hydrophilic
   presumably because of the breakage of the NH alpha-Tyr(5) to Arg(8)-CO
   hydrogen bond reported to stabilize a beta-turn encompassing residues
   5-8 and which favored beta-sheet formation as shown earlier by Haviv et
   al.(2) This substitution resulted, however, in an increased potency in
   the histamine release assay and in significantly shorter duration of
   action.(3) Similarly, attempts at replacing isopropyllysine in position
   8 by either isopropyl-4-aminophenylalanine or
   isopropyl-4(aminomethyl)phenylalanine resulted in loss of potency in the
   AOA.
   Changes in chirality at position 1 or 10 resulted in analogues that were
   one-tenth and one-half as potent, respectively, as acyline. Introduction
   of a relatively hydrophilic acetylated residue in position 1
   (Ac-4-aminophenylalanine, Ac-2-quinolylalanine, Ac-3-quinolylalanine)
   also resulted in potent analogues in the AOA in the latter two cases
   (yet very short acting in the case of
   ({[}Ac-D2Qal(1),DCpa(2),DPal(3),Aph(5)(Atz),DAph(6)(Atz),ILys(8),DAla(10
   )]-GnRH). Introduction of either mesityl, (2-chlorophenyl)isourea, or
   (3-chlorophenyl)isourea as a substituent on the 4-amino function at
   residues 5 and 6 of the azaline B precursor was considerably less
   successful. In this article, we describe in details, improved synthetic
   protocols for all novel amino acis, N alpha-methylation of amino acids
   on the resin, and elimination of the undesired N omega-methylation of
   pyridylalanine at position 3 as the result of base treatment (piperidine
   or hydrazine) during the deprotection of the Fmoc group or formation of
   the triazole moiety in the presence of CH2Cl2.}},

Abstract = {{The principal (alpha 1) subunit of purified skeletal muscle
   dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) calcium channels is present in
   full-length (212 kDa) and COOH-terminal truncated (190 kDa) forms, which
   are both phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK) in
   vitro. Immunoprecipitation of the calcium channel from rabbit muscle
   myotubes in primary cell culture followed by phosphorylation with cA-PK,
   sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and
   two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed comparable
   phosphorylation of three COOH-terminal phosphopeptides found in the
   purified full-length alpha 1 subunit. Stimulation of muscle myotubes
   with a permeant cAMP analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine
   3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, prior to immunoprecipitation of alpha 1
   results in a 60-80\% reduction of cA-PK catalyzed `'back''
   phosphorylation of each of these sites in vitro in calcium channels
   purified from the cells, indicating that these sites are phosphorylated
   in vivo in response to increased intracellular cAMP. Serine 687, the
   most rapidly phosphorylated site in the truncated 190-kDa alpha 1
   subunit, was observed as a minor phosphopeptide whose level of
   phosphorylation was not significantly affected by stimulation of
   endogenous cA-PK in the myotubes. The COOH-terminal sites, designated
   tryptic phosphopeptides 4, 5, and 6, were identified as serine 1757
   (phosphopeptides 4 and 6) and 1854 (phosphopeptide 5) by a combination
   of protease cleavage, phosphorylation of synthetic peptides and fusion
   proteins, specific immunoprecipitation, and phosphopeptide mapping.
   Phosphorylation of serines 1757 and 1854 in the COOH-terminal region of
   the 212-kDa alpha 1 subunit in intact skeletal muscle cells may play a
   pivotal role in the regulation of calcium channel function by cA-PK.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate, phosphate and sulphate incorporated in the aragonitic skeletons
   of coral (Porites) were analyzed by ion chromatography (IC). All anion
   analyses were performed using a Dionex 4500i IC system with Dionex
   columns, conductivity detector and computer interface, The anions were
   separated on an AS4A separator column behind an AG4 guard column, and
   the background conductivity of the eluent was suppressed using an AMMSII
   membrane suppressor. The suppressor was continually regenerated using an
   anion membrane suppressor regenerant cartridge and H2SO4. The eluent
   used was 1.8 mM Na2CO3-1.7 mM NaHCO3. Bleached, oven-dried coral powder
   (200 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 30\% HCl (Merck Suprapur) and
   diluted to 100 ml. Standards were also prepared in HCl, and the
   linearity was excellent for each anion (r(2) > 0.999) over the range
   20-100 ng/g (ppb) for nitrate, 100-500 ng/g for phosphate and 0.5-12.0
   mu g/g (ppm) for sulphate. All samples and standards were passed through
   a chloride-removal cartridge (Dionex OnGuard AG) prior to injection.
   This cartridge consisted of silver and its sole purpose was to remove
   Cl- which might otherwise overwhelm the separator column. Using a 250-mu
   l injection loop, the detection limits were approximately 5 ng/g for
   nitrate and 10 ng/g for phosphate. The analytical procedure variability
   was 9\% for nitrate, 2\% for phosphate and 0.5\% for sulphate. The
   concentrations of these species in the corals varied from 0.2 to 18 ppm,
   8 to 118 ppm and 560 to 590 ppm, respectively. Coral samples taken from
   three coral heads at the Grande Riviere Noire Bay (slabs 1Ks, 5Ks, 6Ks)
   averaged 4.5 +/- 0.5 ppm nitrate and 55 +/- 1 ppm phosphate, compared
   with 2.2 +/- 0.5 ppm nitrate and 16 +/- 1 ppm phosphate for the samples
   taken further out in the lagoon (slabs 7Ks and 11Ks). Thus, the nitrate
   and phosphate concentrations clearly distinguish between corals taken
   from the bay, which are closer to anthropogenic N and P inputs, from
   samples collected from the lagoon, which are further from such N and P
   sources. To estimate the possible importance of organically bound
   phosphorus, samples were also treated with H2O2. Following dissolution
   in HCl, 1 ml of 30\% H2O2 (Merck Suprapur) was added, and the samples
   were heated at 50 degrees C for 3 h. The instrument was calibrated using
   standards prepared in HCl-H2O2. The phosphate concentrations measured in
   the samples dissolved in HCl-H2O2 were up to 100\% higher than those
   dissolved in HCl alone, suggesting that organically bound phosphorus
   contributes significantly to the total phosphorus concentrations of the
   corals.}},

Abstract = {{In a prior study, we found that the processed-form of human
   interleukin-1 beta (mature IL-1 beta) is secreted to a significantly
   greater extent than the precursor form of the protein, indicating that
   the precursor domain acts in some manner to reduce the secretory
   potential of the protein, In view of this observation, we sought to
   define the sequence(s) in the IL-1 beta precursor that limit the
   secretion of the protein as well as the sequences in the mature protein
   that promote secretion, The P388D1 murine macrophage cell line and the
   Jurkat human T cell line were transiently transfected with cDNA
   expression vectors encoding truncated forms of human precursor IL-1 beta
   proteins, lacking either the first 76, 94, 99, or 104 amino acids, The
   removal of increasing numbers of precursor amino acid residues resulted
   in a graded increase in the secretion of the truncated precursor IL 1
   beta proteins from both cell lines, The minimal region of the precursor
   sequence required to inhibit the optimal secretion of IL-1 beta occurs
   between amino acids 100 and 104 for P388D1 cells and 95-99 for Jurkat
   cells, Deletion of the amino acids within these regions increased the
   secretion level of the truncated proteins to that of mature IL-1 beta,
   Mutagenesis of the mature IL-1 beta sequence revealed that a region of
   basic amino acids may play an important role in the optimal secretion of
   mature IL-1 beta in P388D1 cells, but not in Jurkat cells. Based on the
   differences in the structural requirements for IL-1 beta secretion in
   P388D1 and Jurkat cell lines, it is likely that the secretion of IL-1
   beta may be subject to multiple levels of regulation that are
   differentially operative in different cell types.}},

   histidine residue (57)] occurring in the active site by a fluorescence
   method. It was shown that the decrease in the fluorescence intensity,
   which is induced by the formation of a covalent bond with the boronic
   acid moiety, is well correlated with the inhibitory effect estimated by
   kinetic measurements. The inhibitory effect appeared in the order 2a <
   2c much less than 2b (K-i = 1.6 x 10(-6) mol dm(-3)). Interestingly, the
   inhibitory effect was further intensified by added saccharides. In
   particular, the combined system of 2b and D-glucose strongly inhibited
   the enzyme reaction, the inhibitory effect (K-i = 1.1 x 10(-7) mol
   dm(-3)) being stronger than that of a specific inhibitor, chymostatin
   (K-i = 4.8 x 10(-7) mol dm(-3)). Hence, saccharides act as a
   `co-inhibitor' in the boronic acid inhibition system. This is a novel
   and efficient inhibition system for alpha-chymotrypsin (and probably
   more generally for other peptidases).}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II) unwinds both DNA and RNA (Zhang, S.,
   and Grosse, F. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 3906-3912). Here, we report on
   the molecular cloning and sequence determination of the complementary
   DNA (cDNA) coding for this DNA and RNA helicase. The full-length cDNA
   sequence was derived from overlapping clones that were detected by
   immunoscreening of a calf thymus cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda
   gt11. This cDNA was 4,528 bases in length, which corresponded well with
   a 4.5-4.7-kilobase-long mRNA as detected by Northern blot analysis. The
   open reading frame of NDH II cDNA predicts a polypeptide of 1287 amino
   acids and a calculated molecular mass of 141,854 daltons. NDH II is
   related to a group of nucleic acid helicases from the DEAD/H box family
   II, with the signature motif DEIH in domain II. Two further proteins of
   this family, i.e. human RNA helicase A and Drosophila Maleless (Mle)
   protein, were found to be highly homologous to NDH II. With RNA helicase
   A, there was 91.5\% identity and 95.5\% similarity between the amino
   acid residues; with Mle protein, we observed a 50\% identity and an 85\%
   similarity. Antibodies against human RNA helicase A crossreacted with
   NDH II, further supporting that NDH II is the bovine homologue of human
   RNA helicase A. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a mainly nuclear
   localization of NDH II. A role for NDH II in nuclear DNA and RNA
   metabolism is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription factor DRTF1/E2F is implicated in the control of
   cellular proliferation due to its interaction with key regulators of
   cell cycle progression, such as the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor
   gene product and related pocket proteins, cyclins and cyclin-dependent
   kinases. DRTF1/E2F DNA binding activity arises when a member of two
   distinct families of proteins, DP and E2F, interact as DP/E2F
   heterodimers. Here, we report the isolation and characterisation of a
   new member of the E2F family of proteins, called E2F-5. E2F-5 was
   isolated through a yeast two hybrid assay in which a 14.5 d.p.c. mouse
   embryo library was screened for molecules capable of binding to murine
   DP-1, but also interacts with all known members of the DP family of
   proteins. E2F-5 exists as a physiological heterodimer with DP-1 in the
   generic DRTF1/E2F DNA binding activity present in mammalian cell
   extracts, an interaction which results in co-operative DNA binding
   activity and transcriptional activation through the E2F site. A potent
   transcriptional activation domain, which functions in both yeast and
   mammalian cells and resides in the C-terminal region of E2F-5, is
   specifically inactivated upon pocket protein binding. Comparison of the
   sequence with other members of the family indicates that E2F-5 shows a
   greater level of similarity with E2F-4 than to E2F-1, -2 and -3. The
   structural and functional similarity of E2F-5 and E2F-4 defines a
   subfamily of E2F proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Secretin is a gastrointestinal hormone responsible for the regulation of
   bicarbonate, potassium ion and enzyme secretion from the pancreas. A
   cDNA encoding the human secretin receptor was isolated from a human
   pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell-line cDNA library using polymerase chain
   reaction and library screening techniques. The cDNA isolated is 1717 bp
   in length encoding a 440 amino acid long polypeptide. Computer analysis
   of the receptor indicated that it is a member of the
   glucagon-VIP-secretin receptor family and is a G-protein coupled
   receptor containing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The
   receptor was subsequently expressed in COS-7 cells and was able to bind
   specifically to human secretin with high affinity as indicated by the
   competitive displacement assay. The human secretin receptor was found to
   be functionally coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase resulting
   in the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in a dose-dependent manner. By
   Northern blot analysis, a 1.8 Kb mRNA was detected in human pancreas and
   intestine, while weak hybridization signals were detected in human
   colon, kidney and lung. Functional characterization of this receptor
   should enhance our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology
   of human secretin, its structure-function, receptor interaction and
   receptor tissue distribution. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome band 9p21-22 is frequently altered by nonrandom
   abnormalities, mainly deletions, in hemopoietic malignancies of the
   lymphoid lineage. We have analysed a translocation t(9;14)(p21-p22;q11)
   in a B-cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Location of the 14q11
   breakpoint within the TCR-alpha/delta locus allowed the isolation of a
   fusion transcript composed of a 3' segment containing part of the
   constant region of the TCR-alpha gene and a 5' segment from chromosome
   9, designated 0.18. This 0.18 segment was also part of cDNAs isolated
   from two tumoral B-cell lines (RPMI-8226, Raji). In both cases, 0.18 was
   juxtaposed 5' to a sequence corresponding to exons 2 and 3 of the
   p16(INK4)/MTS1 gene which is located on band 9p21-22. Unexpectedly, none
   of the two ATG codons found in 0.18 was in phase with that of the exons
   2 and 3 of p16(INK4)/MTS1. Furthermore, in vitro translation product of
   a RPMI-8226 cDNA clone generated a product that was not
   immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific of the C-terminal end of the
   p16(INK4)/MTS1 protein. Evidence for similar transcripts in non tumoral
   lymphoid B cells (unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and
   lymphoblastoid cell lines) were obtained by using amplimers
   representative of the 0.18 segment and the p16(INK4)/MTS1 exon 2.
   Altogether, these data are consistent with the existence of a new type
   of p16(INK4)/MTS1 transcript whose significance is discussed.}},

   environmental samples, to be obtained in pure culture, Recently, in situ
   16S ribosomal RNA analyses of samples from the Obsidian hot pool at
   Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, revealed a variety of archaeal
   sequences, which,were all different from those of previously isolated
   species(3,4). This suggests substantial diversity of archaea with so far
   unknown morphological, physiological and biochemical features, which may
   play an important part within high-temperature ecosystems, Here we
   describe a procedure to obtain pure cultures of unknown organisms
   harbouring specific 16S rRNA sequences identified previously within the

   photolysis, and their lifetimes have been measured using selective hole
   transfer quenching with anisole. In the deactivation of the D-2 State of
   c-St(.+), the internal conversion competes with the isomerization to
   t-Sr-.+ in a quantum yield of 0.49 +/- 0.12 and conversion to another
   product as a minor process, whereas the D-2 states of t-Sr-.+ and CB.+
   are only deactivated via internal conversion. Lifetimes of the t-Sr-.+
   and c-Sr-.+ D2 states are estimated to be approximately 240 and 120 ps,
   respectively, while that of the CB.+ D2 state is approximately 380 ps.
   The shorter lifetime of the c-Sr-.+ D-2 state is attributed to
   isomerization and conversion to another product via twisting about the
   central C=C double bond. The analogous process in CB is severely
   hindered by structural constraints. The transient phenomena of the D2
   states of c-Sr-.+, t-Sr-.+, and CB.+ are compared in terms of thier

   ADM (treatment III), 16 mg per kg as free ADM, to rats, using HPLC

   area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUG, 159 vs 351 mu g min
   ml(-1)), terminal half-life (t(1/2), 65.2 vs 633 min), mean residence
   time (MRT, 27.5 vs 541 min) and apparent volume of distribution at
   steady state (V-ss, 2480 vs 22 800 ml kg(-1)) were significantly higher,
   however, the total body clearance (CL, 101 vs 45.6 ml min(-1) kg(-1)),
   renal clearance (CL(R), 9.81 vs 2.27 ml min(-1) kg(-1)), nonrenal
   clearance (CL(NR), 90.8 vs 42.8 ml min(-1) kg(-1)) and the amount of ADM
   excreted in urine (X(u), 496 vs 297 mu g) were significantly lower in

   fact that some of the ADM-loaded liposomes (formed by hydration of
   ADM-loaded proliposomes) were entrapped in tissues and the rest were in
   plasma (higher MRT and V-ss in treatment II), and ADM was slowly
   released from ADM-loaded liposomes (higher t(1/2) in treatment II): In
   the present HPLC assay, the concentrations of ADM represent the sum of
   free ADM and ADM loaded in liposomes (higher C-p and AUC, slower CL in
   treatment II). After 1 min i.v. infusion, some pharmacokinetic
   parameters, such as t(1/2), MRT and X(u) were significantly different
   between treatments I and III, but not as distinct between treatments I
   and II. 30 min after i.v. infusion, the amount of ADM remaining in lymph
   node and the lymph node to plasma ratio were significantly higher in
   treatment II than in treatment I. This suggested that the i.v.
   administration of ADM-loaded proliposomes might have a better lymph node
   targeting ability than free ADM. The mean amount of ADM loaded in
   ADM-loaded proliposomes was 4.09 mg per g proliposome.}},

Abstract = {{The plasma elimination kinetics and intestinal absorption kinetics of
   acetaminophen sulfate (APAPS), a major conjugated metabolite of
   acetaminophen (APAP), indispensable for the kinetic elucidation of
   drug/APAPS interactions, were examined in rats. Plasma elimination
   kinetics of APAPS after i.v. administration could be described by a
   two-compartment model with linear parameters to the dose. The
   deconjugation of intravenously administered APAPS, i.e., the formation
   of APAP, was recognized in neither plasma, urine nor bile. Approx. 80\%
   of intravenously administered APAPS was excreted as the unchanged form
   in the urine in 4 h while biliary excretion was only a few percent of
   the dose. Plasma profiles of APAPS after oral administration showed two
   peaks, but the second one disappeared when the rat was pretreated with
   kanamycin sulfate. However, APAPS permeation through the small- and the
   large-intestinal walls determined in situ was not altered after
   kanamycin treatment. High APAPS-hydrolyzing activities present in the
   cecal and colonic contents and the feces, but not in the
   small-intestinal contents, completely disappeared after kanamycin
   treatment. Thus, part of the orally administered APAPS was absorbed as
   the unchanged form from both the small and large intestines, and
   considerable amounts of the remainder were absorbed from the large
   intestine as APAP after enzymatic hydrolysis by the intestinal
   microflora during transit through the lower bowel.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior and frequency response of harmonically excited
   piecewise linear and/or non-linear systems has been the subject of
   several recent investigations. Most of the prior studies employed
   harmonic balance or Galerkin schemes, piecewise linear techniques,
   analog simulation and/or direct numerical integration (digital
   simulation). Such techniques are somewhat limited in their ability to
   predict all of the dynamic characteristics, including bifurcations
   leading to the occurrence of unstable, subharmonic, quasi-periodic
   and/or chaotic solutions. To overcome this problem, a parametric
   continuation scheme, based on the shooting method, is applied
   specifically to a periodically excited piecewise linear/nonlinear
   system, in order to improve understanding as well as to obtain the
   complete dynamic response. Parameter regions exhibiting bifurcations to
   harmonic, subharmonic or quasiperiodic solutions are obtained quite
   efficiently and systematically. Unlike other techniques, the proposed
   scheme can follow period-doubling bifurcations, and with some
   modifications obtain stable quasi-periodic solutions and their
   bifurcations. This knowledge is essential in establishing conditions for
   the occurrence of chaotic oscillations in any non-linear system. The
   method is first validated through the Duffing oscillator example, the
   solutions to which are also obtained by conventional one-term harmonic
   balance and perturbation methods. The second example deals with a
   clearance non-linearity problem for both harmonic and periodic
   excitations. Predictions from the proposed scheme match well with
   available analog simulation data as well as with multi-term harmonic
   balance results. Potential savings in computational time over direct
   numerical integration is demonstrated for some of the example cases.
   Also, this work has filled in some of the solution regimes for an impact
   pair, which were missed previously in the literature. Finally, one main
   limitation associated with the proposed procedure is discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Activated versions of ras and mos oncogenes subvert the signal
   transduction pathway by mimicking transducers at the plasma membrane and
   cytosol respectively. Radicicol (UCS1006), an antifungal antibiotic, had
   the ability to suppress transformation by ras and mos oncogenes in a
   rapid, reversible and dose-dependent manner. UCS1006 inhibited MAP
   kinase activity (both ERK1 and ERK2) in untransformed as well as uas and
   mos transformed cells. However, ERK2 but not ERK1 activity was
   constitutively elevated in ras and mos transformed cells used in this
   study. In addition, a 62 kDa (kilodalton) phosphoprotein was identified
   whose tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by UCS1006, in both ras and
   mos transformed cells. This 62 kDa phosphoprotein, which was found to be
   heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine residues only in the ras and mos
   transformed cells but not in untransformed NIH3T3 cells, was identical
   to the previously described GAP-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein, p62,
   that is the major target for phosphorylation in cells transformed by
   tyrosine kinase oncogenes. These results suggest that agents such as
   radicicol can suppress transformation by diverse oncogenes such as src,
   ras and mos at least in part by inhibiting the function of key signal
   transduction intermediates such as MAP kinase and GAP-associated p62.}},

   in deuterated acetonitrile. The lanthanide-induced shifts (LIS) observed
   in the spectra of the paramagnetic complexes (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb,
   Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb) are analyzed using a linear least-squares
   procedure involving the five componenents of the traceless part of the
   magnetic susceptibility tenser as fitting parameters (C-13 data is
   limited to Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu). No assumptions are made regarding
   the orientation of the molecular coordinate system and principal
   magnetic axis system in this method of analysis. Furthermore, by using a
   linear least-squares fitting of the data, we establish that it is
   possible to allow a computer program to permute LIS values over any
   number of nuclei and determine which particular assignment gives the
   best fit of the LIS data. A new method of evaluating the contact
   component of the LIS in the proton spectra is introduced. Molecular
   mechanics calculations are combined with analyses of LIS data to
   determine structures of the complexes in solution. Through such an
   approach, we establish that the eight-coordinate lanthanide ions are
   encapsulated by the octadentate macrocyclic ligand, with the four
   nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms situated at the vertices of a
   distorted square antiprism having C-4 symmetry (the rotational angle
   between the two square pyramids is 47 degrees). The lanthanide ions lie
   above the plane of nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle, with the distance
   decreasing from 1.74 to 1.41 Angstrom across the lanthanide series. The
   distance to the mean plane of donor oxygen atoms increases from 0.63 to
   0.83 Angstrom across the series. The Ln(3+)-N and Ln(3+)-O bond
   distances range from 2.82 to 2.54 Angstrom and 2.47 to 2.21 Angstrom,
   respectively. The NMR data establish that each complex exists in
   solution as a single pair of enantiomers. Analysis of the LIS data
   establishes that the isomer with each ethylenediamine ring of the

Abstract = {{High resolution variable energy photoelectron spectra using synchrotron
   radiation, of valence, inner valence, and core levels of gas phase heavy
   metal carbonyl compounds {[}e.g. W(CO)(6), Re(CO)(5)X (X = Cl, Br,
   Re(CO)(5)] are reported. The high resolution (0.1 eV) metal 4f core
   level spectra show, for the first time, vibrational splitting. In
   addition, ligand field broadening is shown to be an important
   contributor to the 4f linewidth, especially for Os(CO)(5). The greatly
   improved resolution also provides much narrower 4f shake-up peaks in
   W(CO)(6) than have been observed with laboratory X-ray sources. The
   complete inner valence spectra are interpreted using the inner valence
   spectrum of CO and the only previously reported complete inner valence
   spectrum of a metal carbonyl {[}Cr(CO)(6)]. The variable energy of
   synchrotron radiation is especially important for assigning the valence
   metal d orbitals {[}in, for example, CpM(CO)(3), M = Mn, Re] using the
   enhancement of metal d cross sections after the excitation of the core p

Abstract = {{The effect of nuclear Ca2+ uptake inhibitors on the Ca2+-activated DNA
   fragmentation in rat liver nuclei was investigated. The addition of Ca2+
   (40 mu M) into the reaction mixture containing liver nuclei in the
   presence of 2.0 mMATP caused a remarkable increase in nuclear DNA
   fragmentation. This Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation was not seen in the
   absence of ATP, because nuclear Ca2+ uptake is not initiated without ATP
   addition. Moreover, the presence of various reagents (10 mu M
   arachidonic acid, 2.0 mM NAD(+), 10 mu M zinc sulfate and 0.2 mM
   N-ethylmaleimide), which could inhibit Ca2+-APase activity and Ca2+
   uptake in the nuclei, produced a significant inhibition of the
   Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation in the nuclei. The results show that
   the Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation is involved in the uptake of Ca2+
   by the nuclei, suggesting a role of Ca2+ transport system in the
   regulation of liver nuclear functions.}},

Abstract = {{In most allopolyploid plants, only homogenetic chromosome pairing occurs
   in meiosis, as a result of the recognition of genome differentiation by
   the genetic system regulating meiotic chromosome pairing. The nature of
   differentiation between chromosomes of closely related genomes is
   examined here by investigating recombination between wheat chromosome 1A
   and the closely related homoeologous chromosome 1A(m) of Triticum
   monococcum. The recognition of the differentiation between these
   chromosomes by the Ph1 locus, which prevents heterogenetic chromosome
   pairing in wheat, is also investigated. Chromosomes 1A and 1A(m) are
   shown to be colinear, and it is concluded that they are differentiated
   `'substructurally.'' This substructural differentiation is argued to be
   recognized by the Ph1 locus. In the absence of Ph1, the distribution and
   frequencies of crossing over between the 1A and 1A(m) homoeologues were
   similar to the distribution and frequencies of crossing over between 1A
   homologues. The cytogenetic and evolutionary significance of these
   findings is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A combined chemical and enzymatic procedure has been developed to
   synthesize macroscopic poly{[}(R)-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) granules
   in vitro. The granules form in a matter of minutes when purified
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from Alcaligenes eutrophus is
   exposed to synthetically prepared (R) -3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A,
   thereby establishing the minimal requirements for PHB granule formation.
   The artificial granules are spherical with diameters of up to 3 mu m and
   significantly larger than their native counterparts (0.5 mu m). The
   isolated PHB was characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, gel-permeation
   chromatography, and chemical analysis. The in vitro polymerization
   system yields PHB with a molecular mass > 10 x 10(6) Da, exceeding by an
   order of magnitude the mass of PHAs typically extracted from
   microorganisms. We also demonstrate that the molecular mass of the
   polymer can be controlled by the initial PHA synthase concentration,
   Preliminary kinetic analysis of de novo granule formation confirms
   earlier findings of a lag time for the enzyme but suggests the
   involvement of an additional granule assembly step. Minimal requirements
   for substrate recognition were investigated. Since substrate analogs
   lacking the adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety of (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl
   coenzyme A were not accepted by the PHA synthase, we provide evidence
   that this structural element of the substrate is essential for
   catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic mutation of the variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin genes
   occurs in vivo at rates that have been estimated to be between 10(-3)
   and 10(-4) per bp per generation, To study this process in vitro, the
   18.81 pre-B-cell line and hybrids derived by fusing 18.81 to the NSO
   myeloma fusion partner were transfected with a mu heavy-chain construct
   containing a nonsense mutation in the V region (Vn) or the constant
   region (Cn). Mutation was quantitated by reversion analysis using the
   ELISA spot assay to detect single cells secreting IgM. Fluctuation
   analysis revealed that V-region mutations spontaneously occurred in
   18.81 cells al an average rate of 5.8 x 10-6 per bp per cell generation
   and in selected 18.81-NSO hybrids at greatly increased rates of 1.6 x
   10(-3) to 5.8 x 10(-4) per bp per generation, The Vn construct also
   rever ted frequently in transgenic mice, indicating that it contained
   sufficient information to mutate at high rates both in vivo and in
   vitro. Sequence analysis of reverted genes revealed that reversion was
   due to point mutations. Since the rates and nature of the mutations that
   are occurring in these transfected genes are similar to those reported
   in vivo, it Should be possible to use this system to identify the
   cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors that are responsible for
   V-region somatic hypermutation.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other second
   messenger-activated protein kinases modulates the activity of a variety
   of effector proteins including ion channels. Anti-peptide antibodies
   specific for the alpha 1 submits of the class B, C or E calcium channels
   from rat brain specifically recognize a pair of polypeptides of 220 and
   240 kDa, 200 and 220 kDa, and 240 and 250 kDa, respectively, in
   hippocampal slices in vitro. These calcium channels are localized
   predominantly on presynaptic and dendritic, somatic and dendritic, and
   somatic sites, respectively, in hippocampal neurons. Both size forms of
   alpha(1B) and alpha(1E) and the full-length form of alpha(1C) are
   phosphorylated by PKA after solubilization and immunoprecipitation,
   Stimulation of PKA in intact hippocampal slices also induced
   phosphorylation of 25-50\% of the PKA sites on class B N-type calcium
   channels, class C L-type calcium channels and class E calcium channels,
   as assessed by a back-phosphorylation method. Tetraethylammonium ion
   (TEA), which causes neuronal depolarization and promotes repetitive
   action potentials and neurotransmitter release by blocking potassium
   channels, also stimulated phosphorylation of class B, C and E alpha 1
   subunits, suggesting that these three classes of channels are
   phosphorylated by PKA in response to endogenous electrical activity in
   the hippocampus. Regulation of calcium influx through these calcium
   channels by PKA may influence calcium-dependent processes within
   hippocampal neurons, including neurotransmitter release,
   calcium-activated enzymes and gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{The heritability and heteromorphic appearance of chromosomal banding
   patterns induced through in situ digestion with the restriction enzyme
   AluI were studied by analyzing the chromosomes of 25 monozygotic and 25
   dizygotic twin pairs selected at random from a juvenile twin registry. A
   total of 19 AluI banding variants were found to be heteromorphic, with
   the pericentromeric region of chromosome 3 and the satellites of
   chromosome 22 being most and least heteromorphic, respectively. As
   expected, the correlations of the semi-quantitative scores for each of
   the chromosomal variants were significantly higher between MZ twin pairs
   (ranging from 0.48 to 0.95) than DZ twin pairs (ranging from - 0.02 to
   0.69), suggesting that genetic factors play an important role in their
   appearance. This finding was confirmed in a model fitting analysis in
   which the heritabilities of the AluI-induced chromosome variants were
   found to range from 70 to 96\% for 12/13 heteromorphisms studied. These
   consistent findings are significant in that these variants may be useful
   for family studies in clinical genetics. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The mangrove corbiculid, Geloina erosa has the ability to secrete
   periostracumlike organic sheets within the shell. The organic sheets are
   formed only in the portion where extensive shell dissolution has
   occurred. Organic sheets primarily coat the borings by microorganisms
   which transmit the stimulus from outer environments to mantle
   epithelium. They also have an important role in retarding the rate of
   shell dissolution. Numerous tubules are formed in the inner shell layer
   of the umbonal region. Each tubule contains a funnel-shaped projection
   of the mantle. These projections may have a sensory function, although
   no receptor cells have been observed. When the projection detects shell
   dissolution through a tubule, the epithelial cells around it may be able
   to secrete an organic sheet temporarily during the course of secretion
   of calcium carbonate. Adhesive epithelium exists on the side of each
   projection. Such projections may have developed primarily for adhesion
   to the shell. Secretion of organic sheets and secondary function of
   epithelial cells in Geloina can be interpreted as adaptations to acidic
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The twilight zone of a cave, an environment transitional between the
   well-illuminated environment outside the cave and the dark environment
   of the cave interior, is one of the most unusual microenvironments of
   the karst terrain. Walls in the twilight zone of caves on Grand Cayman
   and Cayman Brac are coated with a biofilm that incorporates a diverse
   assemblage of epilithic microbes and copious mucus. Most microbes are
   different from those found elsewhere in the karst terrains of the Cayman
   Islands, probably because they have adapted to life in the poorly
   illuminated twilight zone.
   None of the microbes employ an endolithic life mode, and less than 10\%
   of them show evidence of calcification. The biofilm does, however,
   provide a medium in which a broad spectrum of destructive and
   constructive processes operate. Etching, the dominant destructive
   process, produces residual dolomite, residual calcite, blocky calcite,
   and spiky calcite. Constructive processes include precipitation of
   calcite, dolomite, gypsum, halite, and sylvite. Although filamentous
   microbes are common, examples of detrital grains trapped and bound to
   the substrate are rare. Destructive processes are more common than
   constructive ones.}},

Abstract = {{A single female of Nautilus belauensis laid 43 eggs in the Shima

   Three of the eggs maintained at an average 24.4 degrees C hatched, and
   the hatchlings (designated nautilus A, B, and C) survived 32 to 73 days.
   Nautilus A, B, and C had shell diameters of 3.24, 3.30, and 3.18 cm,
   respectively, a few days after hatching, which increased to 3.70, 3.86,
   and 3.29 cm at death. The number of septa is 11 in B and 10 in C. A
   narrowing of the angular distance occurred between septa 6 and 7 in B
   and 7 and 8 in C and thereafter until death. The nepionic constriction
   is present in the body chamber of both shells. Hatching is estimated to
   have occurred after the formation of septum 9. The delta(18)O 80 values
   of septa show an overall average close to zero both in B and C. The
   delta(13)C profile undergoes a dramatic 4 parts per thousand negative
   shift in septa 6 and 7 in B and in septa 4 through 6 in C. The shift may
   have been caused by partial ingestion of egg capsules by the embryos
   prior to hatching. The delta(13)C of septa 1-3 and 8-10 or 8-11 is close
   to the inferred delta(13)C of dissolved CO2 of the culture water. The
   estimated average rate of apertural growth is 0.20 mm/day in B and 0.28
   mm/day in C. The soluble and insoluble proteins of the shell matrix are
   separated into three to four fractions by SDS gel electrophoresis.
   Immunohistochemical analysis shows that synthesis and secretion of the
   soluble and insoluble shell matrix occur in the outer mantle epithelium
   away from the mantle edge.}},

Abstract = {{A modified seismic design concept is introduced for precast concrete
   frames in which beam plastic hinges with reduced yield capacities are
   constructed away from the precast beam-column connections arranged at
   the column faces. Plastic hinge location and yield capacity are employed
   as the basic parameters of an analytical survey in which the inelastic
   dynamic responses of a conventional precast frame and its modified
   counterparts are calculated and compared under two earthquake
   excitations by using a general purpose computer program for dynamic
   analysis of inelastic frames {[}1, 2]. An optimum design is obtained by
   providing plastic hinges on precast beams located at one depth away from
   the beam ends, in which primary (negative) bending moment yield
   capacities are reduced between one-third and one-quarter of the beam
   design end moments. With such plastic hinge configurations, precast
   beam-column connections at the column faces can be designed to remain
   elastic under strong earthquake excitations.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{177-187}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{A computer program is described for analysing the behaviour of flexible
   retaining walls. This program is efficient, versatile and easy to use
   and is considered to provide a powerful tool for completing design of
   earth-retaining structures. A novel method is adopted for forming the
   soil stiffness and earth pressure limits that differs significantly from
   the traditional subgrade reaction approach. Three stiffness matrices are
   used in the analysis. One matrix represents the wall in bending while
   the other two represents the soil on each side of the wall. Each soil
   stiffness matrix is assembled using pre-calculated flexibility matrices
   obtained from finite element computations for elastic soil blocks. The
   solution procedure involves combining the stiffness matrix of the wall
   and soil system and computing the displacements from a knowledge of the
   stress changes due to excavation. An iterative approach is adopted to
   apply the correcting forces at locations that reach active or passive
   states, thus resulting in correct displacements for plastic conditions
   that cannot be accounted for by the elastic soil blocks. The model is
   shown to provide matching results against a finite-element model under
   plane strain conditions and depict the response of a wall rotated about
   its base in a laboratory model test. Application of the proposed model
   within the context of a practical project has demonstrated its role both
   as a predictive tool and as a theoretical model for performing
   sensitivity analysis and establishing practical guidelines to control
   magnitude and mode of wall deflections.}},

Abstract = {{The possible presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid IGABA) specific binding
   sites on human spermatozoa was investigated. Swim-up preparations of
   human spermatozoa were incubated with radiolabelled GABA in the presence
   of unlabelled GABA, alternatively displacers of GABA(A/B) receptors and
   GABA transport proteins. The results indicate that GABA specific binding
   sites are present on the surface of human spermatozoa, and that these
   binding sites possibly indicate the presence of GABA transport proteins.
   Furthermore, GABA at different concentrations was added to swim-up
   preparations of human spermatozoa. Possible effects of GABA on sperm
   motility, hyperactivation and acrosome reaction were explored. No
   significant differences were observed between treated groups and
   controls concerning motility parameters and hyperactivation. Incubation
   with GABA did not cause any increase in spontaneous acrosome reaction.
   However, spermatozoa treated with the calcium ionophore A-23187 showed a
   small but significantly increased ability to undergo the acrosome
   reaction following preincubation in 10(-4) M GABA (P < 0.05).}},

   SYNDROME - ROLE OF SOLAR-RADIATION IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ATYPICAL MOLES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{31-36}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is not known why melanocytic nevi (MN) become dysmorphic
   (atypical) in patients with the atypical mole syndrome (AMS). A complex
   origin for acquired MN has been postulated. Genetic predisposition,
   solar radiation, and/or the formation of a sun-induced circulating
   mitogenic factor may contribute to the formation of MN.
   Objective: This study was undertaken to help elucidate the pathogenesis
   of atypical MN in patients with AMS.
   Methods: The number of common and atypical MN was determined for a
   defined sun-protected area on the buttocks in 150 patients with AMS
   (cases) and 150 control subjects without AMS. Patients and control
   subjects were matched for age and sex and were classified into risk
   groups for the development of malignant melanoma according to the Rigel
   classification.
   Results: MN on the buttocks were found in 23\% of patients with AMS and
   9\% of control subjects (p < 0.003). In patients versus control subjects
   the mean number (1.3 vs 1.2, respectively) and mean diameter (5.7 vs 5.9
   mm, respectively) of MN on the buttocks did not differ significantly.
   The MN in both patients and control subjects were not atypical
   clinically. The odds ratio for having AMS if MN were present on the
   buttocks was calculated to be 1.56 (95\% confidence interval, 1.25 to
   1.95).
   Conclusion: Although the patients were 2.6 times more likely to have MN
   on their buttocks than the control subjects, clinically the MN did not
   differ significantly in number or appearance from those found on the
   buttocks of control subjects. It is hypothesized that the formation of
   some atypical MN requires direct solar radiation for their phenotypic
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{The relative impacts of regional and generalized adiposity on insulin
   sensitivity have not been fully defined. Therefore, we investigated the
   relationship of insulin sensitivity (measured using hyperinsulinemic,
   euglycemic clamp technique with {[}3-H-3]glucose turnover) to total body
   adiposity(determined by hydrodensitometry) and regional adiposity. The
   latter was assessed by determining subcutaneous abdominal,
   intraperitoneal, and retroperitoneal fat masses (using magnetic
   resonance imaging) and the sum of truncal and peripheral skinfold
   thicknesses, 39 healthy middle-aged men with a wide range of adiposity
   were studied. Overall, the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal fat
   constituted only 11 and 7\% of the total body fat. Glucose disposal rate
   (R(d)) and residual hepatic glucose output (rHGO) values during the 40
   mu/m(2) . min insulin infusion correlated significantly with total body
   fat (r = -0.61 and 0.50, respectively), subcutaneous abdominal fat (r =
   -0.62 and 0.50, respectively), sum of truncal skinfold thickness (r =
   -0.72 and 0.57, respectively), and intraperitoneal fat (r = -0.51 and
   0.44, respectively) but not to retroperitoneal fat. After adjusting for
   total body fat, the R(d) and rHGO values showed the highest correlation
   with the sum of truncal skinfold thickness (partial r = -0.40 and 0.33,
   respectively). We conclude that subcutaneous truncal fat plays a major
   role in obesity-related insulin resistance in men, whereas
   intraperitoneal fat and retroperitoneal fat have a lesser role.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber reinforced plastic tendons (CFRP) were used for the first
   time in Canada to pretension six girders of a concrete highway bridge,
   built in the City of Calgary, Alberta. The bridge was constructed using
   13 T-bulb Section pretensioned precast concrete girders in each span.
   Continuity of the two spans was achieved by using post-tensioned steel
   tendons extending along the entire length of the bridge.
   This paper summarizes an experimental program conducted to study the
   behaviour of four pretensioned concrete T-beams of the same span-depth
   ratio as the bridge girders. The beams were rested to examine the
   various limit slate behaviors, ultimate capacities, and failure modes.
   Two beams were tested in static, and two were tested under cyclic
   loading. After completion of 2 million cycles, the beams were loaded to
   failure to evaluate the effect of fatigue loading on the behavior of the
   beams. Predicted values based on the compatibility and equilibrium
   approach, and measured values, are compared and discussed A ductility
   model is proposed for beams prestressed by FRP tendons. Design
   recommendations,and construction details of concrete beams prestressed
   by CFRP tendons are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The cytoskeleton pellet from etiolated pea stems was resuspended in a
   buffer containing 400 mM potassium acetate and a neutral detergent,
   ultracentrifuged to remove ribosomes, and dialyzed against a
   cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer. This caused the formation of a
   colloidal complex containing actin, tubulin, streptavidin-binding
   proteins and some other unidentified proteins. The complex enabled
   ribosomes from pea stem and wheat germ to sediment at somewhat lower g
   forces. Heparin, high concentrations of K+, and protease K strongly
   inhibited this ribosome-sedimenting activity. Treatment of the complex
   with 400 mM KOAc caused the release of a predominant 42.5 kDa protein
   and the simultaneous release of ribosome-sedimenting activity. We also
   isolated a similar protein having ribosome-sedimenting activity from the
   cytoskeleton of corn endosperm using the same method.}},

   library constructed from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) olfactory
   rosettes. The clone, designated 30c7, was completely sequenced by
   automated DNA sequencing and was found to share significant homology
   with rat and bovine PLCs of the 61 isotype. In situ hybridization showed
   that 30c7 transcripts were expressed in a small subpopulation of

   epithelium. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that the
   enzyme was also expressed in several additional tissues, including
   brain, gill, heart, liver and skeletal muscle. These results suggest
   that the PLC encoded by clone 30c7 is expressed in several tissues and

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Plasma fibronectin is an opsonic glycoprotein, normally
   synthesized by the liver, which decreases subsequent to severe liver
   damage and low levels of which may contribute to reticuloendothelial
   system dysfunction by compromising opsonic activity, This may result in
   an increased frequency of infection and death. The present study was
   conducted to evaluate the association of plasma fibronectin activity
   with infection and mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure.
   Methods: Plasma fibronectin was estimated serially in 69 consecutive
   patients with fulminant hepatic failure, nine patients with
   uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis and 32 normal, volunteers.
   Results: Plasma fibronectin levels in patients w ith fulminant hepatic
   failure (85.6+/-75.8 pg/ml) were significantly lower than in patients
   with uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis (295,5+/-88.5 mu g/ml) and
   healthy volunteers (362.6+/-69.2 mu g/ml). Forty-nine (72\%) patients
   with fulminant hepatic failure died. The initial values of fibronectin
   in fulminant hepatic failure did not correlate with mortality Patients
   with fulminant hepatic failure who survived showed a progressive rise in
   the fibronectin levels compared to the absence of an increase in
   fibronectin levels in the non-survivors. The mortality in patients with
   fulminant hepatic failure with infection (24/27) was significantly
   higher (p<0.05) compared to those without infection (25/42), Initial
   fibronectin levels in patients with infection (70.3+/-54.2 mu g/ml) were
   significantly lower (p<0.05) than in those without infection
   (92.3+/-64.4 pg/ml). We conclude that plasma fibronectin levels in
   patients with fulminant hepatic failure are decreased compared to
   healthy subjects and the absence of an increase in levels indicates a
   poor prognosis, Low levels of fibronectin are associated with an
   increased incidence of infection, which increases the mortality in these
   patients.

Abstract = {{Selected aneuploidies can be rapidly diagnosed by the analysis of
   fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of
   chromosome-specific and highly polymorphic small tandem repeats (STRs).
   The quantitative STR patterns obtained from samples of normal
   individuals are markedly different from those seen when patients with
   aneuploidies involving chromosome X, or trisomies of chromosomes 21 and
   18, are tested. For example, while samples from normal subjects - tested
   with a chromosome 21-derived STR (D21S11) - show two fluorescent PCR
   peaks with similar activities in a 1:1 ratio, the analysis of samples
   from patients with trisomy 21 reveals the presence of either three peaks
   (ratio 1:1:1), or two peaks with a ratio of 2:1. The use of an internal
   non-polymorphic marker allows identification of trisomic samples with
   three copies of the same allele. This rapid approach (24 hours) is
   particularly valuable when applied to prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal
   abnormalities since it reduces the time of anxiety of the parents
   waiting for the results of the conventional cytogenetic tests, which

Abstract = {{The electrical stimulation of the trigeminal fibers determines the
   inhibition of the voluntary contraction of the temporal muscle. This
   response, called `'exteroceptive suppression'' (ES), is divided in two
   periods of electric silence respectively named ES1 and ES2. The period
   ES2, could represent an antinociceptive reflex of the brainstem, and is
   being revealed an important method in the study of the
   pathophysiological mechanisms of the pain.
   In the present work we focussed on the perspectives of its employment in
   the tension type headache and his change in relation to the prophylactic
   treatment employed.
   The obtained data, confirming preceding observations, show the
   implication of central mechanisms in the pathophysiology of the tension
   type headache and the simple mechanism of contraction of the muscular
   pericranial system, several times supposed in past, must be correct. The
   period of temporal suppression could represent an interface among
   tensive and psycogenic factors and, reflecting a `'dysfunction'' of the
   endogenous system in the control of the pain, implicate a pathogenetic
   central mechanism in the tension type headache.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of minimal changes in circulating plasma endothelin-l (ET-1)
   was studied in 12 healthy subjects receiving either 60 min of ET-1 (0.2
   pmol . kg(-1). min(-1)) or physiological saline intra venously. Blood
   was drawn from arterial, renal, and central hepatic vein catheters.
   Arterial ET-l-like immunoreactivity (ET-1-LI) increased from 4.7 +/- 0.4
   (SE) to 8.6 +/- 1.0 pmol/l during ET-1 infusion. After 10 min, plasma
   ET-1-LI had increased to 6.12 +/- 0.29 pmol/l. For comparison the plasma
   ET-I-LI level was 12.9 +/- 4.2 pmol/in five patients with sepsis
   syndrome. Mean arterial blood pressure rose from 92 +/- 3 to 99 +/- 4
   mmHg. Estimated splanchnic and renal blood flows fell by 18 +/- 5 and 10
   +/- 3\%, respectively, and splanchnic glucose production fell by 42 +/-
   6\% within 10 min of the ET-1 infusion and differed compared with
   corresponding control values. Only estimated splanchnic blood flow had
   increased 60 min after the ET-1 infusion. No change in splanchnic uptake
   of lactate or glycerol was seen. In conclusion, we suggest that
   circulating ET-1 with small or no demonstrable change in plasma
   concentration interferes with vasoactivity and splanchnic glycogenolyses
   in health and possibly pathophysiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic properties of maraging steels have been investigated as a
   function of nickel concentration. The alloys nickel content varied from
   12 to 24 wt pet, while other alloying constituents were kept at a level
   maintained in the 18Ni-2400 MPA-grade maraging steel. The magnetic
   properties were determined following aging for 1 hour in the temperature
   range of 450 degrees C to 750 degrees C. In every alloy investigated,
   the coercive field increased with aging temperature, reaching a maximum
   around 670 degrees C +/- 30 degrees C. The saturation magnetization
   values were lowest around temperatures where maximum coercive field was
   observed. The coercive field increased from similar to 55 to similar to
   175 Oe (similar to 4380 to similar to 13,900 amp/meter) and the
   corresponding saturation magnetization decreased from similar to 18,500
   to similar to 4000 G (similar to 1.85 to similar to 0.4 T) in the alloys
   containing 12 and 24 wt pet Ni, respectively. The reverted austenite
   increased from 25 vol pet at 12 wt pet Ni to 100 vol pet at 24 wt pet
   Ni. The hardness and Charpy impact strength of the alloys have also been
   determined. An attempt has been made to correlate magnetic properties
   with different phase transformations occurring in maraging steels.}},

   one of the first broadly based groups able to provide voters with an
   alternative, group-based linkage to their legislators.  Within Congress,
   parties were surprisingly unorganized, allowing the GAR to strengthen
   its independence from strictly partisan coalitions.  The author draws

Abstract = {{Three approaches are presented to treat anisotropic scattering in

   approaches, anisotropic scattering contributions are homogenized and
   incorporated into the collision term. The numerical solutions of these
   equations are implemented in the CRONOS code for pressurized water
   reactor core calculations and are done with a finite element spatial
   approximation and the discrete ordinates methods (S-N) for the angular
   variable. Numerical results are presented for critical problems

   has been studied. An association constant of 16.7 (+/-3) x 10(3) M(-1)
   was obtained for the complex at 20 degrees C with a stoichiometry of
   1:1. From the effect of temperature on the binding process, the standard
   enthalpy change for the binding is calculated to be Delta H-0 = -18 +/-
   3 kJ mol(-1) and the standard entropy change Delta S-0 = 19 +/- 12 J K-1
   mol(-1). The tryptophan fluorescence of the protein can be described by
   a sum of three exponentials. Upon TNS binding, the average fluorescence
   lifetime of the protein in the complex changes much less than the
   fluorescence intensity. The bound TNS is therefore a very efficient
   acceptor for the protein fluorescence. The TNS bound to orosomucoid
   presents two fluorescence lifetimes 11 and 4.3 ns. The possible origins

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that coffee consumption and cigarette smoking are
   associated with time to conception, we analyzed data collected from
   1,341 primigravidas participating in the Child Health and Development
   Studies in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1959 and 1966. Women were
   interviewed in person about their reproductive and medical history,
   habits (smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption), and sociodemographic
   characteristics. Logistic regression models showed that after adjusting
   for covariates, women who smoked cigarettes had about one-half the
   fertility {[}odds ratio (OR) = 0.5-0.6] of nonsmoker-noncoffee drinkers
   for times to conception of 6 and 12 months, regardless of whether they
   drank coffee. On the other hand, coffee consumers who did not smoke did
   not have decreased fertility compared with nondrinkers who did not smoke
   (adjusted OR = 1.0-1.2). Coffee drinking did not increase the risk of
   delayed conception among smokers over the risk posed by the smoking
   exposure by itself(adjusted OR = 0.6-0.8). We observed an effect of
   smoking even at low doses (1-9 cigarettes per day). The present study
   acids to the evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and
   reduced fertility.}},

Abstract = {{A simple two-dimensional model for the deformation of auxetic
   microporous polymers (those with a negative Poisson's ratio) has been
   developed. This model network of rectangular nodules interconnected by
   fibrils has been further developed to include the possibilities of
   fibril hinging, flexure and stretching. Expressions for strain-dependent
   Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus have been derived and compared with
   experimental results on microporous PTFE and UHMWPE. A combination of
   the hinging mode followed by the stretching mode of deformation can be
   used to explain the general features of the experimental data for these
   auxetic polymers. The force coefficients governing the different modes
   of deformation are dependent on fibril dimensions and intrinsic material
   properties. By varying the geometry of the network, the model can be
   used to predict different combinations of Poisson's ratio with modulus,
   from large positive through to large negative values.}},

Abstract = {{Alanine uptake into liver plasma membrane vesicles was studied at
   different stages of postnatal rat development. Before weaning, alanine
   hepatic uptake showed lower values for the global K-M than after weaning
   (0.34, 0.77, 1.45, and 1.61 mM for 1-, 15-, and 28-d-old and adult rats,
   respectively). Alanine uptake capacity increased progressively until
   reaching maximum values in the adult state (values for V-max: 0.078,
   0.199, 0.317, and 0.613 nmo1 alanine/mg protein/3 s for 1-, 15-, and
   28-d-old and adult rats, respectively). These results seem to point to a
   prevalence of a high affinity, low capacity alanine transport component
   (traditionally assumed to be attributable to system A) in newborn and
   suckling rats, in agreement with our previous results on isolated
   hepatocytes (Martinez-Mas JV, Casado J, Felipe A, Marin JJG,
   Pastor-Anglada M: Biochem J 293: 819-824, 1993). The suckling-weaning
   developmental transition seems to play a role in establishing the
   pattern of adult hepatic alanine transport characterized by a higher
   capacity but a lower affinity (because most alanine is taken up by
   system ASC) inasmuch as K-M values show a 100\% increase after weaning,
   although V-max values continue to increase steadily until the adult age.}},

Abstract = {{Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are hunted throughout most of their range.
   In addition to hunting, polar bears of the Beaufort Sea region are
   exposed to mineral and hydrocarbon extraction and related human
   activities such as shipping, road building, and seismic testing. As
   human populations increase and demands for polar bears and other arctic
   resources escalate, reliable estimates of survivorship of polar bears
   are needed to predict and manage the impacts of those activities. We
   used the Kaplan-Meier model to estimate annual survival (with 95\%
   confidence intervals) for radio-collared female polar bears and their
   dependent young that were followed during a 12-year study in the Alaskan
   Beaufort Sea. Survival of adult female polar bears was higher than had
   been previously thought: (\$) over cap S = 0.969 (range 0.952-0.983). If
   human-caused mortalities were deleted, the computed survival rate was
   0.996 (0.990-1.002). Survival of young from den exit to weaning was
   0.676 (0.634-0.701). Survival during the second year of life, 0.860
   (0.751-0.903), was substantially higher than during the first year,
   0.651 (0.610-0.675). Shooting by local hunters accounted for 85\% of the
   documented deaths of adult female polar bears. Conversely, 90\% of
   documented losses of young accompanying radio-collared females were not
   directly caused by humans. Deaths of dependent young were independent of
   litter size (P = 0.36), indicating that parental investment in single
   cubs was not different from investment in Litters of two or more.
   Precise estimates of the survival of independent juveniles and adult
   males still need to be developed.}},

   Uighurs, Kazakhs, Hui, and Han, it finds enormous differences in
   fertility between the nationalities in the presence of high levels of
   fertility control. Also, for all four nationalities the extent of
   fertility control is dependent on the sex of surviving children. Women
   who had no previous sons, or who had many daughters, were likely to
   continue to try to have children even at ages and parities past which
   they would normally have stopped childbearing. Finally,
   disproportionately feminine sex ratios at birth are found for couples
   who have had several sons and no daughters. Hence, researchers
   interested in the question of unusual sex ratios at birth in China need
   to account for `missing boys' as well as `missing girls'.}},

   greater than or equal to r, with the equalities if and only if F is the
   projective space and L the hyperplane bundle (this is a sort of

   the structure of the morphism phi itself in the case in which all fibers

Abstract = {{Data from a random sample of mothers and children participating in a
   study on the sequelae of low birth weight were used to examine potential
   risk factors of maternal smoking.  It was hypothesized that maternal
   smoking will vary by race, age, education, psychiatric status,
   employment status, single mother status and indicators of the burden of
   child care.  Low education, young age, current psychiatric disorder and
   having a child with a psychiatric disorder or a physical illness
   predicted maternal smoking.  The association of maternal smoking with
   other factors, specifically maternal employment and indicators of the
   burden of child care, varied between blacks and whites.  Single mother
   status and having pre-school children in the home was associated with a
   higher odds ratio for smoking in whites, but not in blacks.  On the
   other hand, maternal employment was associated with a lower odds ratio
   for smoking in blacks only.  This study identified common and
   race-specific predictors of smoking in white and black mothers.  It
   emphasizes the need for a greater understanding of the social context of
   maternal smoking in different ethnic populations, and highlights the

   The values of the ionic conductivities, activation energies and glass

   vapor state, confirming previous results obtained with illite as the
   sorbent. They also provide evidence for an additional sorbed species
   that accumulates at a rate quite different from those of the other two.
   Features characteristic of this species persist in the spectra for
   periods of days after desorption is initiated. The results are
   interpreted in the context of sorbent porosity and the existence of a
   network of narrow pores that limits the rates of both sorption and
   desorption for the persistent species.}},

Abstract = {{The response of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release to haemodynamic
   influences after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has not been fully
   examined. We measured plasma concentrations of ANP and assessed
   haemodynamic changes 60-120 min after DC cardioversion in 22 patients
   with non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation. Passive leg elevation to
   enhance volume expansion was performed 60 min after DC cardioversion.
   Sinus rhythm was restored in 18 of the 22 patients (successful DC
   cardioversion group). The control group consisted of seven patients with
   non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation who did not undergo DC
   cardioversion (atrial fibrillation control group). In the successful DC
   cardioversion group, the mean pulmonary artery wedge wedge pressure
   decreased significantly 15 min after cardioversion (P<0.05) and then
   remained unchanged. Plasma concentrations of ANP also decreased
   significantly 15 min after cardioversion (P<0.05). Furthermore, there
   was an additional significant decrease in ANP levels for up to 60 min
   after cardioversion (P<0.05 from 15 min). Passive leg elevation for 15
   min led to an increase in the mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure
   (P<0.01) and right atrial pressure (P<0.05), but did not result in
   increased plasma concentrations of AHP (47.1 +/- 27.6 vs 43.9 +/- 34.4
   pg . ml(-1), mean +/- SD, P=ns). In the atrial fibrillation control
   group, passive leg elevation increased the mean pulmonary artery wedge
   pressure (P<0.01), the mean right atrial pressure (P<0.05) and plasma
   concentrations of ANP (139.9 +/- 85.8 vs 168.1 +/- 108.2, P<0.05). In
   summary, after successful DC cardioversion of non-valvular chronic
   atrial fibrillation, plasma concentrations of ANP decreased in
   conjunction with decreased mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The
   response of ANP release to volume expansion expansion, however, appears
   to be dysregulated in this patient population.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The goal of fertilization is the union of one, and only one, sperm
   nucleus with the female pronucleus within the activated oocyte. For this
   to occur successfully, several events must transpire, including the
   incorporation of the entire spermatozoon into the oocyte, the completion
   of meiotic maturation with the extrusion of the second polar body, the
   metabolic activation of the previously quiescent oocyte, the
   decondensation of the sperm nucleus and the maternal chromosomes into
   the male and female pronuclei respectively, and the cytoplasmic
   migrations of the pronuclei, which bring them into apposition. Defects
   in any of these events are lethal to the zygote and might prove to be
   causes of infertility. In this study, the microtubules and DNA were
   imaged in inseminated human oocytes that had been discarded as
   unfertilized. The presence and number of incorporated sperm tails were
   also documented using a monoclonal antibody specific for the
   post-translationally modified acetylated-alpha-tubulin found in the
   tail, but not the oocyte, microtubules. An analysis of 211 oocytes from
   failed in-vitro fertilizations from 58 patient couples resulted in the
   determination of several previously undetectable phases at which
   fertilization arrests: (i) metaphase II arrest; (ii) arrest after the
   successful incorporation of the spermatozoon; (iii) arrest after the
   formation of the sperm aster; (iv) arrest during mitotic cell cycle
   progression; and (v) arrest during meiotic cell cycle progression. Data
   on polyspermy and arrested embryonic development are also presented.
   These results have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of
   female, as well as male, infertility. They also provide a rationale for
   the reasonable use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) therapy,
   although they suggest that cases intractable to this approach will be
   found. Concerns are raised about the use of seemingly `unfertilized' but
   inseminated oocytes for subsequent re-inseminations, ICSI or even
   research, since the fertilization process might have arrested after
   sperm penetration. These results demonstrate that the proper union of
   the parental genomes requires a series of cytoskeletal-mediated events
   on the oocyte surface and within the oocyte proper, and that failure at
   any phase results in the arrest of human fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to demonstrate global and regional cerebral
   blood flow (rCBF) changes during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in six
   patients with narcolepsy using SPECT and Tc-99m-HMPAO. Methods: Global
   and hemispheric HMPAO uptake as well as regional (RI) and asymmetry
   indices were estimated and compared between polysomnographically
   verified sleep onset (SO)REM and wakefulness. Results: The estimated
   global HMPAO uptake did not differ between the two conditions indicating
   a similar overall cortical activity. During (SO)REM sleep, hemisphere
   HMPAO uptake as well as calculated RI, especially in the supratemporal
   plane, were significantly higher on the right side than contratateral.
   This indicates an initially right-sided cerebral activation and a
   special involvement of the right, nondominant hemisphere during dreaming
   which is responsible for visual-spatial perceptions. Furthermore,
   increased RI in superior parietal regions during sleep were evident and
   were explained by an activation of associative areas. In thalamic
   regions, decreased RI were found during sleep, which may reflect
   thalamic dysfunction. Conclusion: A definite assignment of these CBF
   alterations to (SO)REM sleep might be problematic because of unstable
   boundaries between sleep stages in narcolepsy. On the other hand,
   specificity of such CBF changes for narcolepsy requires further study.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the scatterometer radar cross-section
   distributions and wind stress spatial variability across a sea surface
   temperature (SST) front under different wind directions and synoptic
   scale atmospheric forcings. Shipboard meteorological measurements in
   concert with airborne K-u-band (14.0 Ghz) rotating scatterometer data
   show evidence of mesoscale circulation near the front during low ambient
   winds (4 m/s) blowing from the cold side of the SST front to the warm
   side. The mesoscale signature is characterized by a 25-35 degrees
   counterclockwise shift in the wind direction and a maximum of 4.9 dB
   increase in the backscattering cross section across the front. The
   mesoscale circulation is reduced when the wind direction reverses, and
   the ambient wind flow increases to 13.6 m/s. The maximum cross-section
   change across the front is reduced to 3.6 dB. The azimuthal
   characteristics of the scatterometer data are compared with the
   predictions of two scatterometer model functions. According to the
   models, the anisotropy of the short waves is inversely related to the
   wind speed, such that the short wave directional spreads tend to broaden
   as the wind speed increases. The scatterometer data, however, show
   greater short-wave anisotropy at the higher wind speeds. This measured
   difference could be caused by current velocity changes or by longwave
   directional changes across the front.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of periodontitis is generally made on the basis of a
   clinical examination supported by radiographic evidence of bone loss.
   Recent guidelines promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administration
   recommend that periapical radiographs be ordered on the basis of
   clinical signs and symptoms indicating the probable presence of disease.
   This study evaluated the effectiveness of the FDA Guidelines for
   ordering radiographs for new adult dental patients as related to
   assessment of the periodontal condition of the patient. We examined 490
   patients and determined the periapicals needed to supplement the
   posterior bitewings based upon the patient's clinical findings. We
   measured the reduction in the number of radiographs ordered as well as
   the extent of missed alveolar and furcation bone loss resulting from the
   use of the selected set of radiographs compared with a complete set.
   Four hundred thirty-three subjects had at least one clinical sign of
   periodontitis present in their mouths, and 264 demonstrated radiographic
   evidence of alveolar bone loss. Of the 460 subjects on whom periodontal
   probing was conducted, two-thirds demonstrated periodontal probing
   depths in excess of 3 mm; almost half showed evidence of bleeding upon
   probing. Individuals with clinical signs of periodontitis had, on
   average, 10 periapicals ordered-more than twice the number as those with
   no sign of periodontitis. Of the 2,415 teeth with radiographic findings
   of proximal or furcal bone loss, 152 sites of bone loss (6\%) were
   missed when the selected set of films plus the posterior bitewings was
   used.}},

Abstract = {{The products of the gas-phase reactions of O-3 with 1-pentene, 1-hexene,
   1-heptene, 1-octene, 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene, cyclopentene, and
   1-methylcyclohexene have been investigated at room temperature and 740
   Torr total pressure of air in the presence of cyclohexane or n-octane to
   scavenge OH radicals. Products were identified and quantified by gas
   chromatography and in situ Fourier transform infrared absorption
   spectroscopy. In the presence of cyclo-hexane, cyclohexanone and
   cyclohexanol were observed as products, showing the formation of OH
   radicals from these O-3 reactions. The OH radical formation yields
   derived were as follows: 1-pentene, 0.37; 1-hexene, 0.32; 1-heptene,
   0.27; 1-octene, 0.18; 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene, 0.50; cyclopentene, 0.61;
   and 1-methylcyclohexene, 0.90, all with estimated overall uncertainties
   of a factor of similar to 1.5. The carbonyl products identified and
   quantified were as follows: from 1-pentene: butanal, 0.541 +/- 0.065,
   and HCHO, 0.595 +/- 0.055; from 1-hexene: pentanal, 0.518 +/- 0.095, and
   HCHO, 0.575 +/- 0.057; from 1-heptene: hexanal, 0.582 +/- 0.078, and
   HCHO, 0.533 +/- 0.049; from 1-octene: heptanal, 0.527 +/- 0.070, and
   HCHO, 0.519 +/- 0.054; from 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene: 3-methyl-2-butanone,
   0.391 +/- 0.050, and HCHO, 0.776 +/- 0.071; from cyclopentene: butanal,
   0.195 +/- 0.027; and from 1-methylcyclohexene: 5-acetylpentanal, 0.100
   +/- 0.024. For the 1-alkenes, the sum of the two carbonyl products
   expected from the decomposition of the initially formed primary ozonide
   is 1.1 +/- 0.1, consistent with the presently believed reaction
   mechanism. The 3-methyl-2-butanone and HCHO yields from
   2,3-dimethyl-1-butene show that the primary ozonide decomposes
   preferentially to HCHO plus the dialkyl-substituted
   {[}(CH3)(2)CHC(CH3)OO]{*} biradical rather than to
   3-methyl-2-butanoneplus the {[}CH2OO]{*} biradical.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, rigid-body

   canard-controlled store from an open-flow rectangular cavity at a
   freestream Mach number of 1.2. The transient flowfield was computed
   using a diagonal scheme in an overset mesh framework, with the resultant
   aerodynamic loads used as the forcing functions in the nonlinear
   dynamics equations. The proportional and rate gyro sensitivities were
   computed via pole placement techniques for the linearized dynamical
   equations, in which computed aerodynamic stability derivatives were
   used, In two dimensions, a comparison between full and linearized now
   equations for a perturbed pinned missile was made, and a controlled
   store was found to possess improved separation characteristics over a
   canard-fixed store, in three dimensions, trajectory comparisons with
   quasisteady wind-tunnel data for the canard-fixed case were made,
   Comparisons of canard-fixed and canard-active simulations showed that
   controlled store offers only modest improvements in cavity separation
   characteristics for these high-ejection rate cases.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal variability of precipitating stratocumulus
   layers is examined using aircraft observations, satellite retrievals of

   observations show large horizontal variations in cloud thickness and
   precipitation, with local rain rates 4-5 times larger than the
   replacement moisture flux, and evidence for precipitation scavenging of
   small cloud droplets. The satellite observations show that, despite this
   local water loss, the distribution of cloud optical thickness remains
   nearly constant over the course of a day, indicating that on larger
   scales precipitation removal and cloud-top entrainment are in
   approximate balance with the vapor flux. The authors apply analytic and
   numerical models of steady-state precipitation to the observed
   microphysical conditions, and find that the models can match the drop

Abstract = {{The present study is concerned with the stochastic formulation of the
   failure of solids with microcracks. The analysis is directed towards the
   development of microcracks in a given material structure due to the
   application of an external constant load. The formulation is based on
   the theory of stochastic population processes and that of point
   processes. The consideration of certain aspects of the `'extreme value''
   theory is however necessary in characterizing the evolution of the
   microcrack population. It is shown to be convenient to first consider a
   collection of microcracks in a specific material domain (microdomain)
   which is regarded as a `'family of objects'' and represented by its
   state so that: \{z(1),z(2)...,z(n)\} = z subset of Z subset of X, where
   Z is the state space and X a general probabilistic function space.
   Governing equations for the development of microcracks are derived and
   the results of the analysis are then compared with experimental
   observations obtained from short-time creep tests on a class of high

   0.5Fe(2)O(3)-0.1Bi(2)O(3)-0.4ZnO sputtered at high temperatures. The
   samples were deposited in a mixed oxygen-argon atmosphere at substrate
   temperatures T-s = 325-525 K. Films are X-ray amorphous and paramagnetic
   for T-s less than or equal to 475 K. For T-s = 525 K, 50 nm
   microcrystals of an unidentified phase are detected by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD). Magnetic measurements were done on this film for static fields as
   high as 30 kG and temperatures over the range 5-300 K. Curves of
   magnetization versus temperature for field-cooled and zero-field-cooled
   conditions separate at a specific temperature T-f. Below T-f, hysteresis
   and remanence are observed in the static field dependence of the
   magnetization. The superparamagnetic behavior is attributed to clusters
   with a mean diameter of 7 nm which are not identified by XRD.}},

Abstract = {{The main problems presented by superficial bladder carcinoma, its high
   recurrence rate and multifocal appearance, require treatment of the
   bladder as a whole. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one such experimental
   treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma, involving the
   administration of a photosensitizer that accumulates in the tumor
   tissue, and subsequent irradiation of the tumor with light. Since the
   photosensitizers used in PDT suffer from several drawbacks, new
   photosensitizers are being sought. Drug delivery systems are also being
   investigated for the administration of hydrophobic photosensitizers and
   enhancement of photodynamic efficiency and tumor selectivity. In this
   study we examined a new photosensitizer, tetramethyl hematoporphyrin
   (TMHP), in two human bladder cancer cell lines. In the first pair of the
   experiments, TMHP was bound to unilamellar liposomes. Cellular uptake,
   dark toxicity and photodynamic efficiency were then studied.
   Fluorescence microscopy showed TMHP localization in the cytoplasm in a
   perinuclear region, sparing the nucleus. Dark toxicity occurred after
   incubation of cells with TMHP above a concentration of 20 mu g/ml.
   Irradiation was carried out using an argon-pumped dye laser emitting a
   wavelength of 630 nm at a fluence of 3.6 and 7.2 J/cm(2). Before
   irradiation, cells were incubated with TMHP at concentrations of 2.5 and
   5 mu g/ml for 1 h. Cell survival rates after incubation with 5 mu g/ml
   TMHP and irradiation at 7.2 J/cm(2) were 15.7\% of control cells for Rec
   and 4.5\% for Waf cells. Uptake studies showed a higher intracellular
   TMHP concentration in Waf than in Rec cells. This correlates with the
   higher PDT efficiency seen in Waf cells. Our results show that TMHP can
   be encapsulated into unilamellar liposomes without losing its
   photodynamic efficiency. TMHP is taken up by human bladder carcinoma
   cells after an incubation time of only 1 h. This short incubation time
   seems to be appropriate for an intravesical instillation of the
   photosensitizer for PDT in bladder cancer patients. Intravesical
   instillation might demonstrate higher phototoxic efficiency with reduced
   side effects. TMHP acts as a potent photosensitizer and shows drug- and
   light-dose-dependent cell destruction. Thus, TMHP has the potential for
   use in PDT in bladder cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic regime of formation waters in the post-Devonian
   sedimentary succession was studied for an area of about 120,000 km(2) in
   southwestern Alberta using approximately 15,000 drillstem tests and
   13,000 formation-water analyses. The salinity of formation waters
   generally increases both northward and with depth from 5000 mg/L to more
   than 100,000 mg/L. Based on flow characteristics and driving mechanisms,
   the sedimentary succession can be divided into two
   megahydrostratigraphic groups overlain by an unconfined aquifer at the
   top. The Mississippian-to-Mannville (Cretaceous) hydrostratigraphic
   group is basically an open hydrodynamic system dominated by aquifers.
   The flow of formation waters is driven by basin-scale topography, and
   part of a basin-scale flow system with recharge at high elevations in
   the south and southwest discharge at low elevations in the
   north-northeast. The Cretaceous Colorado-to-Edmonton hydrostratigraphic
   group is largely a closed hydrodynamic system dominated by aquitards.
   The flow in aquifers is driven westward downdip, toward the thrust and
   fold belt, by large-scale underpressuring caused by erosional rebound in
   thick shales. In places, pressures reach lower values than those
   corresponding to the lowest basin elevation located far to the north.
   This flow system is in a transient state of mechanical and hydrodynamic
   adjustment to the present topography. The different flow pattern in the
   two megahydrostratigraphic successions has consequences for hydrocarbon
   exploration in terms of secondary migration paths and possible
   hydrodynamic entrapment of hydrocarbons.}},

   centre of the plane defined by an N2O2 square-planar coordination
   geometry. The coordination sphere (N3O) of each terminal copper(II) can
   be described as strongly distorted tetrahedral. The cyclic voltammograms
   of the complexes demonstrated two quasi-reversible reductions in which

Abstract = {{Beaver (Castor canadensis Kuhl) and willow (Salix spp,) are important
   components of riparian restoration on degraded western rangelands, Land
   managers need quantitative information to evaluate carrying capacity and
   potential habitat quality for beavers in riparian-willow systems, Our
   objectives were to determine the best model to predict biomass
   components of coyote willow (S, exigua Nuttall) from basal stem
   diameters and compare model predictions to diameter class averages, The
   study was conducted in a shrub-steppe ecosystem of northwestern
   Colorado, We estimated oven-dried weights of annual and total beaver
   food and total live biomass by diameter class from a sample of 160
   willow stems. Several variants of a logistic function were fit with
   nonlinear least squares regression to select a model that best predicted
   mean biomass by stem diameter, A four-parameter logistic model provided
   the best fit for all 3 stem components. Predicted biomass estimates of
   beaver food and total live biomass had smaller standard errors than
   sample means for all 10 stem diameter class midpoints, Percentage of
   stem weight that was beaver food varied from 93.6\% for the smallest
   stems to 12.2\% for the largest, We concluded that the logistic model
   provided reliable estimates of beaver food biomass and could be used
   with food consumption rates and stem density data to evaluate carrying
   capacity for beaver or test assumptions in the beaver habitat

Abstract = {{Objective-To identify the factors influencing participation in a single
   topic audit initiated by a medical audit advisory group.
   Design-Interview and questionnaire survey of general practitioners who
   had been invited to take part in an audit of vitamin B-12.
   Setting-All 147 general practices in Leicestershire.
   Main outcome measures-Aspects of structure, attitude, and behaviour that
   influenced participation or non-participation.
   Results-75 practices completed the audit, 49 withdrew after initial
   agreement, and 23 refused to take part at the outset. Participants were
   more likely than those who refused to view the advisory group as useful
   or a threat and to have positive thoughts about audit but less likely to
   have previously undertaken audit entailing implementation of change.
   Participants were more likely than those who withdrew to have positive
   thoughts about audit and to have discussed whether to take part within
   the practice but were less likely to view the advisory group as useful.
   The most common reason given for withdrawal was lack of time.
   Conclusions-Participation was influenced by attitudes towards audit in
   general and the advisory group in particular and by aspects of behaviour
   such as communication within the practice. Practical support and
   resources may help some practices undertake audit, but advisory groups
   must also deal with attitudes and unsatisfactory communication in
   practice teams.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The responsiveness of luminosity-type horizontal cells, recorded
   intracellularly from isolated hybrid bass retinas, decreased after
   superfusion for 2 h in constant darkness. Responsiveness was
   subsequently increased (light-sensitized) up to 10-fold after exposure
   to several short (similar to 0.5 min) periods of continuous
   illumination. The increase in horizontal cell responsiveness following
   light-sensitization was due to an increase of peak response amplitude
   rather than a reduction of peak response time. The increased
   responsiveness after light-sensitization was intensity-dependent with
   brighter sensitizing stimuli causing a greater increase than dimmer
   stimuli. The extent of LHC dark-suppression was affected by the time of
   day, being greater when induced during the night than during the day.
   However, there was no significant difference in horizontal cell
   responsiveness after light-sensitization in retinas studied during the
   night compared to those studied during the day The responsiveness of
   light-sensitized horizontal cells from isolated hybrid bass retinas was
   found to be suppressed by relatively brief periods of darkness. The
   responsiveness of horizontal cells, that were first light-sensitized,
   decreased by more than 50\% following only 5 min of darkness.
   Suppression of light-sensitized horizontal cell responsiveness after
   such a short time in the dark has not been described in other teleost
   retinas. The suppression of light-sensitized horizontal cell
   responsiveness in hybrid bass retinas may be rapid in comparison to
   other teleosts.}},

Abstract = {{A series of liquid crystalline polyurethanes of different both flexible
   spacer length and mesogenic group content was studied by means of

   the separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from their mixtures with

   polyurethane chain on the polyurethane free volume size and free volume
   distribution was determined on the basis of the positron annihilation
   lifetime spectra. In the positron annihilation lifetime spectra measured
   for the samples under study two long components of several nanoseconds,
   characteristic of o-Ps decaying by pick-off, occurred. The correlation
   of the values of the o-Ps lifetime with the size of the free volume
   region allowed to recover the free volume distributions with the use of
   the method employing the numerical Laplace inversion technique. The
   obtained results were compared with the diffusion data on the mobility
   of liquid hydrocarbons in the liquid crystalline polyurethanes enabling
   the correlations between polymer structure and its transport properties

Abstract = {{The study examined the feasibility of differentiating frontotemporal
   dementia from Alzheimer's disease on the basis of retrospective
   historical information obtained from relatives of patients. A structured
   questionnaire was devised of patients' symptoms, with emphasis on those
   cognitive and neuropsychiatric features found in earlier prospective
   clinical studies to distinguish the two conditions. The questionnaire
   was given to close relatives of deceased patients in whom the diagnosis
   of non-Alzheimer's frontotemporal degeneration or Alzheimer's disease
   had been verified at necropsy. The interviewer had no previous contact
   or knowledge of those patients, nor clinical experience of patients with
   frontotemporal dementia. The questionnaire elicited a distinct profile
   of responses for the two diagnostic groups with emphasis on early
   personality change, unconcern, and socially inappropriate behaviour in
   frontotemporal dementia and disturbance in memory and topographical
   orientation prominent in patients with Alzheimer's disease. A scoring
   system separated out individual patients with frontotemporal dementia
   from those with Alzheimer's disease. It is concluded that it is possible
   to obtain useful information about the precise pattern of dementia from
   informants even many years after the patient's death. The questionnaire
   provides the foundation of a diagnostic instrument for use in family
   history studies of dementia.}},

Abstract = {{The merging of communications and computing has spurred the development
   of broadband networking technologies. ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)
   has been proposed as a primary standard for combining different traffic
   types over a single bearer network to achieve a truly `multiservice'
   capability However this technology is notoriously difficult to model and
   understand as it is not hierarchical nor well behaved, but more chaotic
   and self-organising. So a representative ATM-backboned network has been
   constructed - the `futures test bed' - giving 700 people their own
   broadband connection, capable of providing a range of future services.
   The purpose of this test bed is to provide both a platform for the
   development of broadband applications, and a means for assessing the
   capabilities of ATM. This paper discusses the design and implementation
   of the network and considers some of the potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Primitive reflexes, also known as higher cerebral, developmental or
   release reflexes, are present in foetal and infant life, and are found
   in certain organic brain diseases. They are normally regarded as
   non-localising signs of cerebral immaturity or dysfunction which are
   uncommon in the normal population. The main aims of this study were to
   find out whether recent reports of an association between primitive
   reflexes and severity of cognitive impairment in dementia and between
   primitive reflexes and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia could be
   replicated in a younger population of schizophrenic patients.
   Forty-eight schizophrenic patients (mean age 51 years) were assessed for
   primitive reflexes, involuntary movements and cognitive function, and
   58\% exhibited at least one primitive reflex and 23\% at least two. No
   association was found between primitive reflexes and cognitive
   impairment or between primitive reflexes and tardive dyskinesia. These
   results fail to support the hypothesis that the presence of primitive
   reflexes in some schizophrenic patients indicates a vulnerability to
   tardive dyskinesia and intellectual decline with advancing age, but
   long-term prospective studies would be required to test this hypothesis
   adequately. Nevertheless, these findings support the notion of
   neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative brain disease in at least a
   proportion of patients with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the fungi associated with the tropical weed Lantana camara
   was conducted during 1988 and 1989 in part of its native range in
   southern Brazil. The sampling activity was concentrated mainly in the
   state of Rio de Janeiro, covering 70 sites located in different climatic
   or ecological zones. The survey continued and was extended to the Amazon
   and northeast regions. Nine fungal species were identified as members of
   the mycobiota, including the previously undescribed fungi:
   Ceratobasidium lantanae-camarae sp. nov., Dendryphiella aspera sp, nov.
   and Micropulstulomyces mucilaginosus gen. et sp. nov. Perisporiopsis
   lantanae, which has not been recorded previously in Brazil, has its
   anamorph described for the first time. The rusts Aecidium lantanae,
   Prospodium tuberculatum and Puccinia lantanae, as well as
   Mycovellosiella lantanae, Pseudocercospora guianensis and Anhellia
   lantanae were also recorded. Field observations suggest that several
   fungal pathogens have potential as classical biocontrol agents of the
   weed in the Old World tropics: Ceratobasidium lantanae-camarae and
   Puccinia lantanae in lowland humid climates; Mycovellosiella lantanae,
   Prospodium tuberculatum and Micropustulomyces mucilaginosus in more

Abstract = {{A comparison of three commercially available assays for growth hormone
   (Pharmacia hGH RIA, IDS Gamma-BCT GH and Delfia 22 kDa hGH) were used to
   measure growth hormone (GH) secretion in 26 short children after
   pharmacological stimulation. The IDS Gamma-BCT assay was compared with
   Pharmacia assay in 15 provocative tests (13 children; n = 94). The
   Pharmacia assay showed a strong positive proportional bias and this was
   particularly marked at GH > 20 mU/L; the mean difference between the
   assays at GH < 10 mU/L was 12\%. The IDS Gamma-BCT assay was also
   compared with the Delfia 22 kDa assay in 18 provocative tests (13
   children; n = 100). Results from the IDS assay was higher throughout the
   range 0-90 mU/L with a mean difference of 11.4\% in the range 10-90

Volume = {{149}},

Pages = {{751-757}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine current levels of pediatric faculty stress
   experienced by pediatric faculty and to examine contributors to and
   consequences of this stress.
   Design: Random survey, using attitude questionnaire.
   Setting: Twenty-six medical school-based pediatric programs nationwide.
   Participants: Two hundred fifty-two full-time pediatric faculty members.
   Main Outcome Measures: Stress level; importance of specific sources of
   stress and fulfillment; satisfaction with time allotted to various
   activities; social support; satisfaction with career choices.
   Results: The return rate was 64\%. Forty-six percent of respondents
   reported `'high'' or `'very high'' levels of usual stress; 64\% were
   stressed beyond a `'comfortable'' level at least `'frequently.'' Women
   (P<.05), assistant or associate professors (P<.001), and faculty on the
   tenure track (P<.006) reported feeling `'overstressed'' more often.
   Major sources of stress were pressure to do research, family needs
   (48\%), and lack of personal time (40\%). About half (51\%) agreed that
   the recent emphasis on reducing resident stress has led to increased
   pressure on faculty members. Frequency of feeling overstressed was
   reduced if respondents felt valued by their chairperson (P<.001) and by
   other faculty (P<.01). Within the last year, 47\% had considered moving
   to another medical school. Another 43\% had considered leaving academia.
   The more frequently the respondent felt overstressed, the more likely he
   or she was to have considered such changes (P<.001).
   Conclusions: The stress currently experienced by pediatric faculty is
   substantial and seems to affect longterm commitment to academic
   medicine. Creative solutions to this issue should be explored.}},

Abstract = {{The monoclonal antibody (mAb) B9E, which reacts with a cell wall surface
   determinant of Candida albicans serotype A, and a polyclonal
   monospecific antiserum against the antigen 6 (IF6) were used to
   investigate the expression of the antigens responsible for the serotype
   specificity in C. albicans under different growth conditions. By
   indirect immunofluorescence, both antibodies reacted with the cell wall
   surface of serotype A yeast cells and germ tubes grown in vitro but no
   reactivity was observed with serotype B yeast cells. In some cases, only
   a weak reactivity restricted to a zone close to the parent yeast cell
   was observed in serotype B germ tubes stained with mAb B9E. Both
   antibodies reacted strongly with yeast cells and germ tubes present in
   kidney abscesses from rabbits infected with both serotypes, but only
   serotype A yeast cells and germ tubes present in smears from patients
   with vulvovaginal candidiasis reacted with B9E and IF6 antibodies. The
   expression of antigens reactive with both antibodies was modulated by
   the ph of the environment in which the fungus was grown. Both antibodies
   showed a similar pattern of reactivity when studied with a
   spectrofluorometer. Serotype A yeast cells showed maximum reactivity
   when cells were grown on Sabouraud dextrose broth supplemented with
   yeast extract at ph 4.6. The lowest reactivity was observed in cells
   grown at ph 2.0. Conversely, the reactivity of serotype B yeast cells
   increased at alkaline ph values, the highest being in cells grown at ph
   values of 7.2 and 9.5. A precise use of the methods employed in studies
   on C. albicans serotype prevalence will be important to avoid the
   influence of ph on the expression of antigens conferring serotype
   specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory diseases of the renal glomerulus and tubulointerstitium are
   characterized by destructive and restorative processes. These
   alterations are mediated by soluble molecules, including cytokines that
   instruct target cells to alter their proliferation, differentiation
   phenotype, secretion and migration. One of these cytokines is tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). Its expression within the glomerulus
   has been observed in both resident cells and infiltrating
   monocytes/macrophages in response to cell stimulation with chemicals,
   immune complexes, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and advanced
   glycosylation end products. Its release can be amplified by deposits of
   terminal complement proteins (C5b-9) or formation of platelet-activating
   factor and reactive oxygen species, and, on the contrary, blunted by
   that of prostaglandins or anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and
   IL-10. The roles of TNF alpha in the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases
   include reduction of blood flow and filtration rate, alteration of the
   barrier function of capillary wall, formation of capillary thrombi and
   infiltration of the structure by blood-borne cells. Expression of TNF
   alpha has been observed in tubulointerstitium as well, mainly in
   proximal tubular epithelial cells. In vitro, this expression can be
   amplified by IL- and, inversely, suppressed by immunosuppressive drugs.
   Roles of TNF alpha in tubulointerstitium remain largely undefined, but
   may include infiltration of the interstitium by inflammatory cells and
   alteration in tubular transport of fluid and electrolytes. Extensive
   study will be necessary to further elucidate intracellular signals
   induced by TNF alpha binding to target cells within the kidney and thus
   to establish possibilities of therapeutic intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) has received increased attention,
   especially as a bail-out procedure after failed balloon angioplasty.
   However, this technique may also be burdened by severe pitfalls. We
   report a patient with a balloon-resistant left coronary artery lesion
   subsequently treated with DCA. Despite its over-the-wire guidance, as
   the rotating cutter was advanced, it deviated from its intra housing
   course and intruded into the vascular wall. Dislocation of the rotating
   blade was due to pressure from hard plaque tissue. After having
   carefully pulled back the complete catheter system, a severe spasm of
   the left main stem occurred, which was reversed by intracoronary
   nitroglycerine. The final angiography showed a left coronary artery
   without significant, residual stenosis. The case report underscores that
   DCA passes must be performed under continous fluoroscopic control,
   especially for balloon-resistant lesions because of the unpredictability
   of DCA-imminent complication. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare communication patterns of
   adolescent girls and their mothers versus friends to find evidence of
   stylistic differences. Fifty-six girls in two age groups-preadolescent
   and midadolescent-participated in discussions about four hypothetical
   issues with either their mothers or close friends. Conversations were
   coded for various features of temporal communication style:
   interruptions, overlaps between turns, and simultaneous speech. Girls of
   both ages and their friends exhibited a fast-paced conversation style
   which included frequent interruptions and simultaneous speech and the
   tendency to use overlaps between turns, and this tendency increased from
   pre- to midadolescence. In contrast, mothers exhibited a style
   characterized by slower pacing and pausing and infrequent interruptions
   and simultaneous speech. As a result of these stylistic differences,
   daughters ended up interrupting their mothers more than mothers
   interrupted daughters. These results are discussed in terms of the
   possible meanings of interruptions in conversation.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy-induced anemia in children with cancer is usually of acute
   onset. To investigate an alternate treatment to transfusion (Tx), we
   undertook a phase I-II clinical trial of daily administrations of
   recombinant erythropoietin (rHEPO). Patients with a hemoglobin (Hgb)
   value < 75 g/l were treated for 14 days in cohorts of 3 at escalating
   daily doses of 25, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100 U/kg respectively. The
   maximum-tolerated dose was not encountered. Of 18 courses given to 15
   children aged 0.5-18 years, 7 (39\%) were associated with increased or
   stable Hgb levels (courses without Tx), while 11 (61\%) were terminated
   by a Tx, without evidence of a dose-response relationship. Changes in
   mean Hgb levels and absolute reticulocyte counts were paralleled by
   those of mean white blood cell, platelet, and absolute neutrophil counts
   during the first 7 days and when the end-points of the study were
   reached. Numbers of circulating burst-forming units-erythroid remained
   low throughout courses without Tx. No cumulative increase of serially
   determined serum EPO levels were observed and serum ferritin levels were
   elevated in both groups of courses.
   We conclude that daily administrations of rHuEPO were safe but
   ineffective in our trial. Recovery of chemotherapy-induced
   myelosuppression appeared to be the rate-limiting factor for the
   outcome, without evidence of an enhanced stimulation of erythropoiesis.
   The lack of a proliferative response of specific progenitor cells
   suggested a mechanism of transient primary resistance to rHuEPO. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper develops a fuzzy logic-based control design methodology for a
   large class of nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed
   control design approach combines the powerful tools of fuzzy logic and
   approximate reasoning with the advanced mathematical synthesis
   techniques used in variable structure control systems theory. The
   rationale for the proposed control design approach is motivated by the
   results of a recent study that has rigorously established some
   connections between fuzzy logic and variable structure control systems.
   The results of this paper represent a step in the right direction for
   systematic design of a less expert-dependent fuzzy logic control. To
   illustrate the merits of the new control approach, the latter is applied
   to a 2 degree of freedom robot manipulator. Preliminary simulation
   results suggest that the proposed control design deals effectively with
   the chattering problem encountered when the classical variable structure
   control is used alone.}},

Abstract = {{Although administration of FSH to porcine granulosa cells in static
   primary cultures increased accumulation of cAMP in the culture medium
   and cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (SCC) mRNA in
   the cells, the importance of the physiologically pulsatile pattern of
   FSH secretion in regulating the expression of specific genes required
   for ovarian steroidogenesis is unknown, To evaluate the impact of the
   mode of FSH delivery on ovarian target cell responses, we examined cAMP
   production and SCC mRNA accumulation in granulosa cells perifused with
   continuous or pulsatile FSH stimuli. Porcine granulosa cells were plated
   onto Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads, placed into perifusion columns, and
   perifused at 25 or 37 degrees C with 190 mu l/min Eagle's minimum
   essential medium (MEM) or MEM containing 100 ng/ml ovine (o) FSH
   delivered continuously, or 100 or 600 ng/ml oFSH delivered in 15-min
   pulses every 90 or 180 min. After perifusion, total RNA was isolated
   from granulosa cells for Northern analysis of specific SCC mRNA
   normalized to the constitutively expressed cyclophilin mRNA. Cyclic AMP
   in control columns remained basal throughout the perifusion. In
   contrast, cAMP increased 10- to 15-fold within 30-50 min of the onset of
   tonic FSH delivery. This increase in cAMP was maintained at 25 degrees
   C, but gradually decreased to a 2-fold increase in columns perifused at
   37 degrees C. Release of cAMP increased 5- to 7-fold in response to 100
   ng/ml oFSH pulses given at 90 or 180 min intervals, and 15- to 20-fold
   in response to 600 ng/ml oFSH pulses, and decreased to near. control
   levels between FSH pulses. The magnitude of the cAMP response to
   successive pulses was maintained at 25 degrees C, but diminished at 37
   degrees C such that the final pulse of FSH resulted in a 2-fold increase
   in cAMP.
   Tonic oFSH delivery and 90-min pulses of 100 ng/ml oFSH both increased
   SCC mRNA (1.9- and 2.1-fold, respectively; p < 0.05). Pulses of 100
   ng/ml oFSH given every 180 min, or 600 ng/ml given every 90 or 180 min
   did not increase SCC mRNA (p > 0.1), These data indicate that SCC mRNA
   can be increased by both continuous delivery and frequent (90 min)
   pulses of a low dosage of FSH, but not by relatively infrequent (180
   min) pulses of FSH, or high dosages of FSH al either pulse frequency.
   Thus, up-regulation of SCC mRNA in granulosa cells appears to be
   dependent on both the amplitude (concentration) and frequency of FSH
   exposure. Furthermore, treatments that increased the accumulation of SCC
   mRNA similarly evoked widely differing temporal patterns of cAMP
   production, suggesting a dissociation between the time course and/or
   amount of cAMP generated, and the ability of FSH to increase SCC mRNA
   accumulation. We conclude that both continuous FSH delivery and an
   appropriate temporal pattern and concentration of pulsatile FSH delivery
   to granulosa cells can induce expression of SCC mRNA despite widely
   differing cAMP signals.}},

   vasoconstrictor actions of angiotensin II (ANG II) prompted an
   investigation of the effects of the heptapeptide on the maintenance of
   elevated blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
   ANG-(1-7) (24 mu g . kg(-1). h(-1)) was infused into the jugular vein of
   13-wk-old SHR (n = 64), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY, n = 50), and Sprague-Dawley
   (SD, n = 18) rats for 2 wk, with the use of osmotic minipumps. Blood
   pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, plasma vasopressin, and urinary
   excretion of prostaglandin E(2) and 6-ketoprostaglandin F-1 alpha
   (8-keto-PGF(1 alpha)) were measured at days 2, 7, and 12 of the
   infusion. In SHR, ANG-(1-7) caused a sustained and significant reduction
   in plasma vasopressin concentration that was associated with an increase
   in urinary prostaglandin E(2) and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) excretion at day 2
   after the commencement of the infusion. These changes were accompanied
   by diuresis and natriuresis during the first 3 days of infusion in SHR
   but not in WKY or SD rats. Direct measurements of arterial pressure
   confirmed the lowering effect of ANG-(1-7) on systolic pressure of SHR
   on day 2 of treatment with a restoration of the pressure by days 7 and
   12. These findings, along with our previous demonstration that ANG-(1-7)
   is an active depressor peptide in the intact animal, suggest that
   ANG-(1-7) may play a significant role as a vasodepressor system opposing
   the hemodynamic actions of ANG II in this genetic form of experimental
   hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Chemically based resistance of plants to herbivorous insects is today
   essentially synonymous with allelochemically based resistance; the
   importance of plant secondary compounds in determining patterns of
   host-plant utilization has been established in a wide variety of
   insect-plant interactions. In contrast, primary metabolites, those
   involved in fundamental plant physiological processes, are rarely
   considered to be major determinants of host-plant resistance despite the
   fact that, as insect nutrients, they can have profound effects on
   behavior and physiology. The degree to which variation in plant primary
   metabolism results from the selective impact of herbivory may be greatly
   underestimated in that the biosynthetic and structural diversity of
   primary metabolites and the consequences of that diversity on herbivores
   are rarely taken into account in most studies of insect preference and
   performance. Qualitative and quantitative variation in the production of
   primary metabolites can result from herbivore selection pressure if
   production of primary metabolites is under genetic control and if plant
   fitness in the presence of herbivores is associated in a predictable way
   with genetically based primary metabolite variation. Variation in
   primary metabolism is likely to be particularly effective as a defense
   against highly oligophagous herbivores with limited mobility, especially
   those confined to structures containing allelochemicals that could
   neutralize the benefits associated with compensatory feeding.}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopical investigation, radiologic examination, electron
   microscopy, rhodamin B staining and hardness determination of the dentin
   (KHN) suggested that `'neck lesion'' occurs in leopards and also in

   Based on these results, it is concluded that the osteoclastic resorption
   processes (external/internal root resorption) in the cat jaw are not
   restricted to the destruction of the hard tooth substance on the neck of
   the teeth, but that in most cases roots and periodontium (cement,
   periodontal membrane, tooth socket) are involved and that the resorption
   process starts in the apical regions. Cause is always a cronic
   inflammation of the periodontium.
   Thus it is comprehensible that rarely, ii ever, filling therapy can be
   considered in the early phase of a resorptive process. in every case,
   the situation of the whole tooth and the surrounding bony and fibrous
   structures must be evaluated radiologically. It must, however, be
   considered that not all lesions are radiographically visible. Origin and
   activity of the osteoclasts are described. Further studies of teeth with
   odontoclastic lesions as well as of the respective surrounding tissue
   are needed to further elucidate this disease.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the rostral wiping reflex, RWR, in intact grass frogs allowed
   us to Identify two of its forms: flexor and extensor reflexes (FWR and
   EWR, respectively). Reflex fields of FWR and EWR considerably overlap;
   when the common zones are stimulated, both reflex forms can be observed.
   `'Mixed'' forms of the reflex are also possible. The probability of
   Initiation of a certain RWR form depends on the stimulus position. Both
   FWR and EWR are preserved alter spinalization, but their receptive
   fields are somewhat displaced. The hindlimb movement was divided into
   three phases: positioning (P), lowering, or orientation (L), and
   brushing aside (BA). In the intact frog, each phase is of approximately
   similar duration. The reflex phases and their temporal relations are
   preserved after spinalization. Total movement duration became longer in
   spinal animals, as compared with that In intact ones; in addition, this
   duration began to depend on the stimulus position. In the intact frogs,
   the position of a `'working'' limb shows the linear dependence on the
   stimulus localization; this dependence Is preserved after spinalization.
   Our results allow us to conclude that the central generator of wiping
   reflex includes several subsystems determining the reflex form in a
   probabilistic manner.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to assess the additional fatigue life enhancement
   obtained by coldworking a previously cold expanded plate hole. Two
   different methods of performing the second coldworking were considered,
   i.e. moving the mandrel in the same direction as for the first
   coldworking or moving it in the opposite direction. A three dimensional
   finite element analysis for establishing the residual stress field
   induced by two successive coldworkings (5.58\% then 4.8\%) was carried
   out. Al 7475-T7351 specimens with a central hole were cold expanded at
   5.58\%, subjected to cyclic loading at constant amplitude for a
   predetermined life fraction (on the basis of 5.58\% cold expanded hole
   fatigue life) and then re-coldworked at 4.8\%. After this rework, the
   specimens were again subjected to the same fatigue loading conditions
   until failure. During cycling, the fatigue crack extension was monitored
   using a video-camera in order to determine the coldworking effect on
   both the initiation period and the propagation life.
   The fatigue test results have shown that a second coldworking may
   enhance the fatigue life of an already coldworked hole. For a given
   cyclic loading level, the beneficial effect depends upon the applied
   life fraction before reworking. The direction of the mandrel movement
   during the second coldworking has no noticeable influence on the
   additional fatigue life improvement. These experimental results have
   been analyzed with reference to the calculated residual stress field.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Regional thrombolysis in the recanalization of peripheral
   vascular occlusive disease is an increasingly accepted therapeutic
   modality, Efficacy and complication rate are major issues in
   thrombolytic therapy, This prospective study was undertaken to determine
   if locally delivered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA) is
   safe and effective in clot lysis at non-weight-adjusted doses,
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (undergoing 21 infusions) from two
   centers underwent fibrinolytic therapy with use of r-TPA, at a dose rate
   of 2 mg/h. The mean duration of arterial occlusion was 27.2 days (range,
   1-117 days), Concomitant intravenous heparin anticoagulation was
   administered to all patients, A coaxial infusion delivery system was
   employed. Hematologic parameters and angiographic follow-up were
   evaluated at 4-hour intervals during thrombolytic infusion, The chosen
   maximum r-TPA dose of 40 mg could be extended at investigator
   discretion,
   RESULTS: Complete clot lysis was achieved in 18 of 21 (85.7\%) infusions
   at a mean total dose of 38.9 mg (range, 8-84 mg), The mean infusion
   duration was 19.7 hours. In 16 of 19 (84.2\%) infusions, in which the
   nadir fibrinogen level was recorded, it remained greater than 65\% of
   baseline, Three of 21 (14.3\%) infusions resulted in three major
   bleeding complications, one of which resulted in death,
   CONCLUSION: In this two-center trial, catheter-directed r-TPA infusion
   at 2 mg/h is effective for clot lysis, When combined with concomitant
   heparin administration, this treatment may result in an unacceptably
   high frequency of bleeding complications.}},

   to cAMP led us to examine whether CREB activity was correspondingly
   elevated in human somatotroph adenomas. In a series of 15 human
   ON-secreting tumors, we found that each of these contained elevated
   levels of Ser(133)-phosphorylated and, hence, activated CREB compared
   with nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. Four of the ON-secreting adenomas
   contained an oncogenic gsp gene by polymerase chain reaction analysis,
   and two additional adenomas expressed wild-type G alpha(s) protein at 5-
   to 10-fold higher levels than nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. As both
   oncogenic gsp and overexpressed G alpha(s) proteins can induce Ser(133)
   phosphorylation and cAMP-responsive gene expression in transfected GC

   methods of recording the external temperature. Considering the
   importance of degree days for an optimized planning, it was necessary to
   verify their values by direct calculation in a chosen climatic zone.
   The authors propose that a specific investigation should be carried out
   for the livestock sector given the substantial importance due to the

Abstract = {{A methodology was developed to integrate a simulation model and
   environmental databases for mapping pesticide leaching potential at
   landscape scale. A deterministic, one-dimensional solute transport model
   was applied using soil, land use, and climate data compiled for the
   northeast region of the United States. Landscape units that combined
   soil and climate variables were modeled to produce estimates of atrazine
   leaching in agricultural lands. Model results were aggregated into class
   ranges indicating the proportion of a landscape unit susceptible to
   pesticide leaching. Significant results were, first, that pesticide
   leaching potential was related to the amount and distribution of
   rainfall and soil organic carbon, and second, that a functional
   deterministic simulation model and database were developed for use by
   environmental professionals to model and visualize soil behavior at
   regional scale. Implications of this study indicate that aggregated
   leaching indices should be mapped at scales no finer than 1:250,000 when
   using regional-scale databases; and uncertainty associated with spatial
   and temporal variability, model type, and environmental database quality
   limit interpretations of regional model simulations and resultant map
   products to landscape units similar in size to Major Land Resource Areas
   or individual states, whichever is larger.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the usefulness of the Ramathibodi uterine
   manipulator (AMZURA Enterprises, Freeport, NY) in performing
   laparoscopic sterilization procedures in the supine position under local
   anesthesia.
   Design: Descriptive prospective study.
   Setting: Ambulatory surgical unit of university-affiliated hospital.
   Patients: Women presenting for elective sterilization and weighing <110
   kg.
   Intervention: The Ramathibodi uterine manipulator was used to provide
   uterine manipulation in 85 cases of laparoscopic sterilization, all
   performed in the supine position as local anesthesia-sedation
   sterilization operations. Because such procedures are becoming more
   common worldwide, we propose the acronym `'LASSO'' (Local
   Anesthesia-Sedation Sterilization Operation) for this class of
   operations. Although commonly used in minilaparotomy procedures, use of
   this uterine manipulation device in laparoscopic procedures has not been
   published previously.
   Main Outcome Measure: Successful tubal occlusion.
   Results: Among the 85 cases reported here there were no failures to
   manipulate the uterus successfully, to identify the tubes, and to
   occlude them.
   Conclusions: The simplicity of the Ramathibodi uterine manipulator
   provided several advantages over other means of uterine manipulation,
   notably {[}1] constant easy-to-learn maneuvers, {[}2] no tenaculum or
   balloon requirement, {[}3] the procedure could be performed in the
   supine position, and {[}4] there are no working parts, screws, or
   springs that could be lost or broken by operating room staff. Our
   experience with this device leads us to recommend it to colleagues as an
   inexpensive, safe, and effective alternative to currently available
   instruments for providing uterine elevation during laparoscopic
   sterilization procedures.}},

   are used. While in the case of pipeline insulation exceeded limit values
   could only be determined for dry working procedures, removing and
   mounting stuffed insulation material always caused concentrations above
   the limit value, independent of the working procedure chosen. The
   greater the distance to the workplace, the lower the MMMF-concentration;
   thus, concentrations below the limit value were measured at all

Abstract = {{The influences of the gestational age (range: 28-36 weeks) and the

   the liver were studied in 51 preterm appropriate-for-gestational-age
   infants and in 20 preterm small-for-gestational-age infants using the
   {[}N-15]methacetin urine test. Methacetin is a test drug assessing a
   two-step pathway of biotransformation including monooxygenation and
   conjugation. After oral administration of 3 mg {[}N-15]methacetin/kg
   bodyweight, the cumulative {[}N-15] excretion in urine during the
   consecutive 9 h was measured and used as a marker of microsomal
   biotransformation capacity. In preterm appropriate-for-gestational-age
   infants, the biotransformation capacity increases with gestational age
   as well as with postnatal age, but the strongest correlation could be
   found between cumulative {[}N-15] excretion and postmenstrual age.
   Intrauterine growth retardation results in lower biotransformation
   capacity (26.3 +/- 11.3 vs. 36.1 +/- 9.6\% {[}N-15] excretion, expressed
   as percentage of intake) and disturbed postnatal development of this

Abstract = {{There is considerable uncertainty about the extent of mineral weathering
   and neosynthesis in arid soils. Although researchers have speculated
   that smectite neosynthesis can occur in soils containing opaline silica
   cement, no evidence has been presented to support this hypothesis. We
   investigated the mineralogy of two Aridisols in the western Mojave
   Desert, California, to study phyllosilicate distribution and origin in
   sons with opaline silica. The clay fraction of both soils is dominated
   by Al-rich, dioctahedral smectite, characterized by a Mg-saturated
   d(001) spacing of 1.52 mn and a d(060) spacing of 0.149 to 0.150 mm.
   This smectite is also present in silt and sand fractions of deeper
   horizons, where it exists mainly as microagglomerates of clay-sized
   crystals. Biotite is most abundant in silt and sand fractions of
   near-surface horizons of both pedons, where physical weathering is
   greatest. Deep, alkaline, silica-rich horizons of both pedons contain
   more silt- and sand-sized vermiculite than biotite, probably due to
   rapid chemical weathering of biotite to trioctahedral vermiculite. Clay-
   and silt-sized hydroxy-interlayered 2:1 minerals are present in the
   upper horizons of these soils. Given the lack of gibbsite and
   substantial amounts of kaolinite and AL hydroxy-interlayered 2:1
   phyllosilicates, we propose that neosynthetic dioctahedral smectite was
   the dominant sink for Al released by feldspar weathering in these
   Aridisols. Silica not consumed in smectite neosynthesis can cement
   microagglomerates. We further speculate that minimal physical weathering
   in the alkaline, high-silica environment of deep horizons favors
   aggregation of smectites to silt- and sand-sized microagglomerates.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a possible feedback mechanism, causally relating the
   nutritional status of nestling British storm petrels to the subsequent
   rates of food provisioning by their parents, was examined using a
   supplementary feeding experiment. There were no differences in parental
   provisioning behaviour between experimental and control groups before
   the supplementary feeding regime commenced. Thereafter, chicks receiving
   supplementary food showed higher levels of body condition (attributable
   to the experimental protocol), and consequently received smaller and
   less frequent meals from their parents than controls. The total amount
   of food received by the experimental group (parental delivery plus
   supplementary food) was similar to the amount delivered by control
   parents, indicating compensatory regulation of provisioning. These
   results support earlier findings at the same colony but are in contrast
   to similar studies on other procellariiform species elsewhere. The
   demonstration of regulation of food delivery casts doubt on hypotheses
   relating slow growth and lipid accumulation of procellariiform nestlings
   to scarce and unpredictable food resources, and indicates that more
   recent explanations relating lipid deposition to chronic
   overprovisioning by the adults are untenable for this species. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The influence of age, urethral resistance and bladder contractility on
   voiding efficiency was evaluated by pressure-flow studies in 138 men of
   a mean age of 60 years (range 18 to 86). From these studies the urethral
   resistance parameter was calculated and the maximum bladder contraction
   strength was determined. Premature fading of the bladder contraction was
   quantified by a bladder contraction strength decay factor. Voiding
   efficiency was expressed by the parameter of post-void residual urine
   volume as a percentage of the initial bladder volume.
   Multiple regression analysis showed that voiding efficiency depended
   significantly in descending order of importance on urethral resistance,
   maximum bladder contraction strength and bladder contraction strength
   decay factor. Patient age was not an independent factor. Maximum bladder
   contraction strength and bladder contraction strength decay factor were
   not correlated, suggesting that maximum bladder contraction strength and
   its decay constitute different properties of bladder contractile
   function. A voiding efficiency nomogram is proposed, making use of the
   values for maximum bladder contraction strength and urethral. resistance
   in individual patients. Such a nomogram may have predictive value for
   the occurrence of acute retention but it must be tested prospectively.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolism of caffeine was studied in isolated rat hepatocytes, in

   metabolite fractions were identified by high performance liquid
   chromatography: 1,7-dimethylxanthine, 3,7-dimethylxanthine,
   1,3-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. The incubation with
   the lowest concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu M) of capsaicinoids (natural
   extract. capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin) showed a stimulatory effect on
   caffeine metabolism, which was further enhanced with capsaicin. At 10 mu
   M, capsaicin stimulated the two pathways of metabolism of caffeine
   (N-demethylation and C-8 oxidation). In contrast, dihydrocapsaicin and
   the natural extract seem to inhibit the N-demethylation pathways without
   affecting the C-8 oxidation route. The inhibitory activity on the
   N-demethylation pathways and especially the N-7 demethylation pathway
   was pronounced at the first 30 min of incubation. These results suggest
   that the two pathways (N-demethylation and C-8 oxidation) are mediated
   by different isozymes of cytochromes P-450. This is in agreement with
   recent findings.}},

Abstract = {{E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion protein specifically expressed at the
   basolateral membrane of thyrocytes, is variably dysregulated in thyroid
   carcinomas in parallel to the dedifferentiation of the tumors. No data
   are currently available on the regulation of E-cadherin in messenger RNA
   (mRNA) expression by physiological stimulators of thyroid proliferation
   and differentiation. The present study investigated the control of
   E-cadherin steady state mRNA levels and protein expression in primary
   cultures of dog and human thyrocytes under the influence of
   physiological regulators of thyroid differentiation and
   dedifferentiation using Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.
   Following dedifferentiation by epidermal growth factor and fetal calf
   serum in primary cultures of dog and human thyrocytes, E-cadherin steady
   state mRNA expression was low but easily detectable. Stimulation of the
   cells by TSH (1 mU/ml) or forskolin (10 mu M) induced an increase in
   E-cadherin mRNA levels with a maximal effect after 20 h. An
   up-regulation of E-cadherin protein levels are also observed by
   immunostaining with anti-E-cadherin antibodies. A concentration-response
   relation determined for TSH stimulation (10 mu U/ml to 10 mU/ml) led to
   a concentration-dependent stimulation of E-cadherin mRNA levels and a
   parallel increase in protein expression with a minimal effective
   concentration of 10-30 mu U/ml. These effects depend on protein
   synthesis as they are completely blocked by the presence of 10 mu g/ml
   cycloheximide. Treatment with EGF did not markedly alter E-cadherin mRNA
   expression, whereas removal of insulin from the medium slightly
   decreased E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels. There is, therefore, a
   qualitative parallelism between the effect of the various factors on
   E-cadherin protein and mRNA levels.
   These results suggest that the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is
   under the control of the TSH-cAMP-dependent pathway and may play an
   important physiological role on the action of this pathway in
   proliferation and differentiation.}},

Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the
   incidence and frequency of cerebral embolic signals in a patient
   population with the same mechanical heart valve using transcranial
   Doppler examination. Furthermore, it aimed to identify patient and valve
   characteristics that correlated with the occurrence of these signals.
   Methods Ninety-two patients with Carbomedics valves and 15 healthy
   control subjects took part in the study. Thirty-six patients were
   examined before and immediately after valve implantation (group 1), 34
   patients 1 year after surgery (group 2), and 22 patients 5 years after
   surgery (group 3). Cerebral embolic signals were detected using
   transcranial Doppler monitoring of the right middle cerebral artery.
   Results Asymptomatic cerebral embolic signals were detected in 87\% of
   the total 92 patients, in 77.8\% of group 1 patients, in 91.2\% of group
   2 patients, and in 95.5\% of group 3 patients. No cerebral embolic
   signals were detected in group 1 patients before surgery or in control
   subjects. The incidence (P=.04) and frequency (P=.002) of cerebral
   embolic signals increased significantly with longer duration of valve
   implantation. A significant positive correlation was also found between
   frequency of cerebral embolic signals and valve size (r=.4326,
   P=.00001). Median frequency of embolic signals in patients with a
   history suggestive of cerebrovascular events (n=14) was 60 signals per
   hour compared with 11 signals per hour in those with no such history
   (n=42; P=.04).
   Conclusions The incidence and frequency of cerebral embolic signals
   increased with the duration of valve implantation. The frequency of
   these signals also was dependent on valve size. Patients who had
   experienced cerebrovascular symptoms had a higher frequency of cerebral
   embolic signals compared with those with no such signals. These results
   should be interpreted with caution but suggest that this method could be
   of help in assessing the risk of stroke in prosthetic heart valve
   patients and that prospective clinical studies should now be carried
   out.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of the sensory saphenous nerve leads to
   neurogenic edema formation in the innervated area of the paw of the
   anesthetized rat. Evidence suggests that the edema formation is the
   result of increased microvascular permeability mediated via neurokinin
   NK1 receptors and increased blood flow mediated via calcitonin gene
   related peptide CGRP(1) receptors. Results indicate that selective
   receptor antagonists will only inhibit the response mediated by the
   specific receptor they antagonise. In the case of neurogenic
   inflammation, where it is common for more than one biologically active
   neuropeptide to be released concomitantly, it may be more sensible to
   develop agents that inhibit neuropeptide release. The effects of some
   agents suggested to affect neurogenic responses are presented. The
   anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone (1 mg/kg subcutaneously, -4 h)
   significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited edema formation, but the mechanism of
   action is likely to be related to the general anti-edema effect of
   dexamethasone. In contrast the anti-asthma agent nedocromil sodium (up
   to 10 mg/kg intravenously, -15 min) and the histamine H-3 agonist
   (R)-alpha-methyl histamine (1-10 mg/kg intravenously, -5 min) both
   failed to inhibit saphenous nerve induced edema formation, despite
   positive results in other sensory nerve systems. The results are
   discussed in the context of evidence obtained using other agents in

Abstract = {{Although the temperature structure of small-scale magnetic features in
   the lower and middle photosphere has been constrained quite well, there
   are still considerable uncertainties in the upper photospheric and lower
   chromospheric thermal structure. As a step towards an improvement of
   this situation we investigate, using a non-LTE analysis, the diagnostic
   capabilities of the Stokes I and V profiles of the Mg I b(2) 517.3nm and
   the Mg I 457.1nm lines. We find that the V profile of the former line
   can constrain the magnetic element thermal and velocity structure near
   the temperature minimum, which goes beyond the capabilities of the
   commonly used Fe I and II lines. The lambda 457.1nm line, on the other
   hand, does not provide any additional information on its own. A
   comparison of synthetic profiles with plage and network Stokes I and V
   spectra confirms the findings of Bruls and Solanki (1993) that the
   chromospheric temperature rise starts at a substantially lower height in
   magnetic elements than in the quiet Sun. Some of the ambiguities in
   previous empirical models of magnetic elements are also removed. We
   confirm that small-scale magnetic features are associated with larger
   line broadening velocities than the quiet Sun, particularly in the
   higher layers. Finally, the Mg I b(2) line is revealed to be a direct
   diagnostic of the merging height of magnetic elements.}},

Title = {{A LATE INCREASE IN FREE-RADICAL ACTIVITY POST MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{899-902}},

Abstract = {{Free radicals (FR) are a highly reactive chemical species which have
   been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. Experimental
   models of reperfusion injury have demonstrated that FR scavengers
   improve myocardial salvage and this it has been postulated that they may
   be of benefit in acute myocardial infarct (MI) patients treated with
   thrombolysis. Previous studies of FR activity post MI have focused on
   the immediate post reperfusion period; the present study investigated FR
   activity in post MI patients over a longer time span.
   Free radicals have a very short half-life and in clinical studies their
   activity is usually assessed indirectly by measuring either the level of
   FR reaction products such as malondialdehyde (MDA) or FR scavengers such
   as plasma thiols (PSH). In the presence of increased FR activity MDA
   levels increase and PSH levels decrease.
   Twenty-two acute MI patients had blood samples taken on admission, day 7
   and day 21 post MI for measurement of MDA and PSH levels. ON day 7 post
   MI a significant increase in MDA was detected P=0.0001 (Sign test)
   (median change +2.1 mu mol.l) and a significant decrease was detectedin
   PSH P=0.04 (Sign text) (median change, -38 mu mol.l(-1)). No significant
   differences were detected between admission and day 21 levels of MDA and
   PSH.
   This study demonstrated the presence of enhanced FR activity at a later
   time point than has previously been recognised. White blood cells
   utilise FRs during phagocytosis and the late rise in FR activity
   detected in this study may reflect white blood cell removal of necrotic
   myocardium.}},

   used fluorophores: lissamine rhodamine (LRSC); tetramethyl rhodamine
   isothiocyanate (TRITC); Texas Red; and cyanine 3.18 (Cy-3), Fluorescence
   lifetime recordings revealed that these spectrally overlapping
   fluorophores can be individually detected by their lifetimes, indicating
   that at least four fluorophores can be individually identified in
   discrete tissue domains by confocal microscopy. A further advantage of
   lifetime recordings is that fluorophores that emit light within the same
   wavelength band can be used and chromatic aberrations are therefore
   circumvented, thereby improving the spatial accuracy in imaging of
   multiple fluorophores, Low and high pH, respectively, tended to
   influence fluorophore emission spectra and fluorescence lifetime, IgG
   conjugation of the fluorophores tended to shift the spectra towards
   longer wavelengths and to change the fluorescence lifetimes. The
   IgG-conjugated form of the fluorophores may, when applied to tissue
   specimens, change the emission spectrum and lifetime. In addition,
   different tissue embedding procedures may influence fluorescence
   lifetime, These observations emphasize the importance of spectral and
   lifetime characterization of fluorescent probes within the chemical
   context in which they will be used experimentally. Changes in spectra
   and fluorescence lifetimes may be a useful tool to gain information
   about the chemical environment of the fluorophores.}},

   encodes an N-terminal actin binding domain and a C-terminal portion
   comprised of the hemidesmosomal protein, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1

   partially deleted in a transgenic strain of mice, Tg4, that harbours an

Abstract = {{To examine potential mechanisms for the blood pressure-lowering action
   of the thiazolidinedione compound, pioglitazone (PIO), we studied the
   effects of the drug on blood pressure and insulin action in vivo and on
   vascular tissue in vitro. In vivo, PIO lowered blood pressure in
   fructose-fed and chow-fed rats to an extent that could not be explained
   by alterations in fasting plasma insulin or free magnesium
   concentrations or by alterations in whole-body insulin sensitivity. In
   vitro, PIO caused significant blunting of the contractile responses of
   aortic rings to NE, arginine vasopressin (AW), and potassium chloride;
   the blunting of responses to NE was maintained after removal of the
   endothelium, To assess the potential importance of extracellular calcium
   to the vasodepressor effect of PIG, me measured contractile responses to
   NE in the absence of calcium, and then after acute restoration of
   calcium in the presence of NE, PIO had no effect on the contractile
   response in the absence of calcium. By contrast, PIO blunted by 42\% the
   contractile response that occurred when the extracellular calcium supply
   was acutely restored in the presence of NE, suggesting that the blunting
   was mediated by blockade of calcium uptake by vascular smooth muscle,
   Such an effect was confirmed in cultured a7r5 vascular smooth muscle
   cells, which exhibited a brisk increase in intracellular calcium in
   response to AVP that was blocked by PIO in a dose-dependent fashion.
   Our data indicate that PIO has a direct vascular effect that appears to
   be mediated at least in part by inhibition of agonist-mediated calcium
   uptake by vascular smooth muscle. The direct vascular effect may
   contribute to the blood pressure-lowering actions of PIO in vivo,
   because that effect could not be explained by alterations in whole-body
   insulin sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Antibodies to several epitopes of the human immunodeficiency virus type
   1 (HIV 1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41) can synergize in inhibiting
   HIV-1 infection, In the present study we tested the ability of a
   monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5A8, which interacts with CD4 domain 2, and
   other CD4-specific MAbs to synergize with antibodies against gp120. We
   have previously found that 5A8 inhibits HIV-1 entry without interfering
   with gp120 binding to CD4, presumably by affecting a postbinding
   membrane fusion event. Because antibodies to the gp120 V3 loop also
   affect post-CD4-gp120-binding events, 5A8 was first tested in
   combination with anti-V3 loop antibodies for possible synergy. The
   anti-V3 loop antibodies 0.5 beta, NEA-9205, and 110.5 acted
   synergistically with 5A8 in inhibiting syncytium formation between
   gp120-gp41- and CD4-expressing cells. A human MAb to an epitope of gp120
   involved in CD4 binding, IAM 120-1B1, and another anti-CD4 binding site
   antibody, PC39,13, also exerted synergistic effects in combination with
   5A8. Similarly, an antibody against the gp120 binding site on CD4, 6H10,
   acted synergistically with an anti-V3 loop antibody, NEA-9205. However,
   a control anti-CD4 antibody, OKT4, which does not significantly inhibit
   syncytium formation alone, produced only an additive effect when
   combined with NEA-9205. Serum from HIV-1-infected individuals, which
   presumably contains antibodies to the V3 loop and the CD4 binding site,
   exhibited a strong synergistic effect,vith 5A8 in inhibiting infection
   by a patient HIV-1 isolate (0104B) and in blocking syncytium formation,
   These results indicate that therapeutics based on antibodies affecting
   both non-gp120 binding and gp120 binding epitopes of the target receptor
   molecule, CD4, could be efficient in patients who already contain
   anti-gp120 antibodies and could also be used to enhance passive
   immunization against HIV-1 in combination with anti-gp120 antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are known to secrete several types of
   toxins including STb, a heat-stable enterotoxin. STb enterotoxin
   production was studied in wild-type E. coli strains. Using a
   quantitative STb-specific inhibition ELISA, the amount of toxin present
   in the culture supernatant fractions of various E. coli strains was
   determined. Variation in the production of STb toxin was observed for
   the wild-type strains. For E. coli strain 82-4247 grown in trypticase
   soy broth, the toxin was produced after 4 h of growth and was maximal
   after about 57 h of growth. The amount of toxin in the culture
   supernatant fraction increased concomitantly with bacterial growth.
   Using the rat loop assay, the biological activity of STb was retained
   even after the logarithmic phase of growth when STb production levelled
   off (i.e. from 24 to 74 h). STb production by E. coli strain 82-4247
   varied with the culture medium used. In particular, addition of 1.0\%
   (w/v) compared to 0.1\% glucose to Davis minimal medium decreased STb
   production, whereas addition of 1.0\% (w/v) glycerol did not affect STb
   production. Addition of exogenous cAMP reversed the repressive effect of
   glucose. Using mutant strains, STb production was shown to be subject to
   catabolite repression.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial cell dysfunction has been implicated in the development of
   atherosclerosis. Of vital importance to the maintenance of endothelial
   cell integrity is the preservation of membrane functional and structural
   properties, such as membrane fluidity, The aim of this study was to
   develop a model for studying the relationship between endothelial cell
   integrity and membrane fluidity alterations in a well-defined cell
   culture setting, Alterations in membrane fluidity were assessed using
   electron spin resonance after labeling endothelial cells with the
   lipid-specific spin labels, CAT-16 and 12-nitroxide stearic acid.
   Endothelial cells were exposed to various Ii-carbon fatty acids, i,e,
   stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), or linolenic (18:3), in
   addition to lipolyzed HDL (L-HDL) and benzyl alcohol, Membrane
   phospholipid fatty acid composition of endothelial cells supplemented
   with these fatty acids was analyzed using gas chromatography, All fatty
   acids, except 18:0, decreased membrane fluidity, A relationship between
   membrane fluidity and fatty acid compositional alterations in cellular
   phospholipids was observed. In particular, the arachidonic acid content
   decreased following exposure to 18:1, 18:2, or 18:3, Exposure of
   endothelial cells to L-HDL, lipoprotein particles which contain high
   levels of 18:1 and 18:2, also decreased membrane fluidity, The
   stabilization of cytoskeletal actin filaments by phalloidin partially
   prevented 18:2-induced increases in albumin transfer, thus implicating a
   cytoskeletal involvement in the 18:2-induced membrane fluidity changes
   involved in endothelial cell dysfunction, The present study shows that
   the exposure of endothelial cells to various lipids causes membrane
   fluidity alterations which may contribute to endothelial cell
   dysfunction and atherosclerosis,}},

   to dam's abdomen to let the pups deliver naturally. Severe HI insult
   from the surgical manipulation was evident in that the lactate levels of
   fetal brain increased, and fetal blood pH decreased with the duration of
   vasculature clamping up to 1 h. The experimental KI insult up to 1 h did
   not affect fetal survival rate, but retarded growth of fetuses or
   newborns was observed in the 1 h HI group. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-
   and kainate (KA)-stimulated cGMP formation and glutamate accumulation
   were measured in cerebellar granule cell cultures from 8-d-old pups
   suffering from various durations of antenatal HI insult. NMDA (100 mu
   M)-induced elevation of cGMP was further augmented by a 10-35-min HI
   insult as compared with the control cells (62.4-78.2 versus 49 pmol/mg
   protein). In the presence of L-N-G-monomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA, 150 mu
   M), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NMDA-induced cGMP formation was
   blocked, and the blockade of cGMP formation by L-NMMA (10 mu M) could be
   reversed by simultaneous application of 1 mM arginine in both control
   and HI cells. Antenatal HI insult (20-35 min) also augmented NMDA-, but
   not KA-, stimulated accumulation of extracellular glutamate. The
   hypersensitive response in NMDA-induced glutamate accumulation could be
   suppressed by 150 mu M L-NMMA. The overall results suggest that
   antenatal HI occurring in the last half of gestation may result
   chronically in adverse effects on NMDA receptor-mediated
   neurotransmission and that nitric oxide is possibly involved in these
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The canalicular and saccular stages of rat lung development are marked
   by thinning of mesenchymal tissue. Because cell-cell interactions are
   important for normal fetal lung development, we investigated whether
   this regression of mesenchymal tissue is controlled by
   fibroblast-epithelial cell interactions. Using flow cytometry, thymidine
   uptake into DNA, and cell doubling time, we observed an increase in the
   proportion of lung fibroblasts in the G(0)/C-1 phase of the cell cycle
   with advancing gestation. Conditioned medium of epithelial cells from
   the canalicular stage of lung development, but not from the
   pseudoglandular and saccular stages, inhibited fetal lung fibroblast
   proliferation. Fetal lung epithelial cell growth was not affected by the
   epithelial cell-conditioned medium. The response of fibroblasts to this
   epithelial cell-derived growth-inhibitory activity was organ specific
   but not gestation dependent. The inhibitory effect of epithelial
   cell-conditioned medium on fibroblast proliferation was overcome by the
   addition of > 2\% fetal bovine serum. The inhibition was not mediated by
   prostaglandins because 50 mu M ibuprofen, a prostaglandin synthase
   inhibitor, did not block the elaboration of the inhibitory activity by
   fetal lung epithelial cells. Partial characterization of the fibroblast
   growth-inhibitory activity in epithelial cell-conditioned medium showed
   that it was trypsin labile, heat and acid insensitive, and lipid
   extractable. Its molecular weight appears to be > 3.5 and < 12.5 kD.
   Transforming growth factor-beta(1) and surfactant proteins B and C did
   not mimic the inhibitory effect of epithelial cell-conditioned medium.
   These data suggest that fetal lung epithelial cells elaborate a
   hydrophobic polypeptide that inhibits fetal lung fibroblast
   proliferation in vitro. The results are compatible with a role for
   epithelial cells in regulating mesenchymal condensation at late fetal
   rat gestation.}},

   Studies in conscious chronically instrumented animals have extended

   nitric oxide synthase with L-arginine analogs increases the
   vulnerability of the myocardium to ischemia. The variable extent to
   which endothelium-dependent function is impaired in human
   atherosclerosis raises the possibility that abnormalities in resistance
   vessel control contribute to the functional significance of a fixed
   epicardial coronary stenosis. This may explain the wide variability
   between the physiological effects of a given coronary stenosis and its

Abstract = {{To establish whether alterations in insulin action and secretion and
   their relationship to body fat distribution occur early in the course of
   developing obesity, we studied 14 obese adolescent girls {[}13.2 +/- 0.7
   yr, body mass index (BMI) 32 +/- 1.4], 16 nonobese adolescent girls
   (12.5 +/- 0.6 yr, BMI 21.0 +/- 0.8), and 14 nonobese young women (24.0
   +/- 0.6 yr, BMI 21.0 +/- 0.9). Insulin action was assessed by a
   sequential two-step (8 and 40 mU . m(-2). min(-1)) euglycemic insulin
   damp in combination with {[}1-C-13]glucose and indirect calorimetry.
   Insulin secretion was determined by the hyperglycemic clamp technique
   (6.9 mmol/l). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify visceral
   and subcutaneous abdominal fat depots. In obese girls, an impairment in
   glucose disposal was present with both insulin doses; at the higher
   dose, rates of glucose uptake were reduced by 30\% in nonobese girls
   (240 +/- 30 vs. 340 +/- 19 mg . m(-2). min(-1), P < 0.05) and by an
   additional 29\% (170 +/- 17 mg . m(-2). min(-1), P < 0.05) in obese
   girls. Insulin infusion failed to stimulate glucose oxidation and to
   suppress lipid oxidation only in obese girls. Suppression of free fatty
   acid levels, but not hepatic glucose production, was decreased in obese
   girls compared with controls. Fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin
   responses were greater in obese than in nonobese adolescents, who, in
   turn, had greater responses than lean women. In obese girls, visceral
   fat, but neither waist-to-hip circumference ratio nor subcutaneous fat,
   was highly correlated with basal insulin secretion (r = 0.89, P <
   0.001), stimulated insulin secretion (r = 0.61, P < 0.05), and insulin
   resistance (r = -0.87, P < 0.02). Increased visceral fat,
   hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance (involving glucose and Lipid
   metabolism) are closely linked abnormalities that are expressed early in
   the natural history of obesity. Adolescents with central adiposity
   should be targeted for weight reduction and health surveillance to
   reduce morbidity of adult obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To study the effects of oral mifepristone and vaginal
   gemeprost on the mechanical properties of the cervix prior to first
   trimester termination of pregnancy by vacuum aspiration.
   Design A comparative study. Each patient served as her own control.
   Setting The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.
   Subjects Forty nulliparous women at six to twelve weeks of pregnancy.
   Interventions The women received either gemeprost (1 mg) 3 h prior to
   termination of pregnancy or mifepristone (200 mg) 48 h before operation.
   Main outcome measures Two different objective methods of assessment of
   the mechanical properties of the cervix, one measuring the
   distensibility of the cervix before drug administration and immediately
   before the operation, and the other measuring the force necessary to
   dilate the cervix; incidence of new symptoms following drug intake;
   immediate complications and estimated blood loss.
   Results Both treatments significantly increased cervical distensibility.
   Baseline dilatation was greater in the mifepristone group. The force
   required to dilate the cervix was significantly reduced in
   mifepristone-treated patients. There was a good correlation between the
   two different methods of assessment of the mechanical properties of the
   cervix only in the gemeprost group.
   Conclusion Cervagem and mifepristone can be used to increase cervical
   distensibility. Cervical dilatation is easier with a 48 h regimen of
   mifepristone than with gemeprost.}},

Abstract = {{An exocellular proteinase activity has been characterized in
   Paracoccidioides brasiliensis culture filtrates. Chromatographic
   analysis showed that the activity was eluted from an anion-exchange
   Resource Q column at 0.08-0.1 M NaCl, and by gel filtration near
   ovalbumin elution, in a single peak. Purification of the proteinase,
   however, was hampered by the low protein yield, in contrast to the high
   peptidase activity. Numerous chromogenic peptidyl p-nitroanilide
   derivatives and internally quenched fluorescent peptides, flanked by Abz
   (O-aminobenzoyl) and EDDnp (ethylenediaminedinitrophenyl), were tested
   as substrates. Cleavage was observed with Abz-MKRLTL-EDDnp,
   Abz-FRLVR-EDDnp, and Abz-PLGLLGR-EDDnp at Leu-Thr, Leu-Val and
   Leu-Leu/Leu-Gly bonds respectively as determined by isolation of the
   corresponding fragments by HPLC. Leucine at P-1 seemed to be restrictive
   for the activity of the exocellular enzyme, but threonine (P'(1)) and
   leucine (P'(2)) in Abz-MKRLTL-EDDnp apparently were not essential. Also,
   a pair of alanines could substitute for lysine (P-3) and arginine (P-2)
   in this substrate, with a decrease in the K-m values. The exocellular
   peptidase activity of P. brasiliensis had an optimum pH of > 9.0 and was
   irreversibly inhibited by PMSF, mercuric acetate and
   p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Inhibition of the mercuriate compounds could
   be partially reversed by Cys/EDTA. E-64
   {[}trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanido)butene] was a weak and
   reversible inhibitor, whereas EDTA and pepstatin were not inhibitory.
   These results suggest that P. brasiliensis exocellular enzyme belongs to
   the subfamily of SH-containing serine proteinases.}},

Abstract = {{The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are important regulators of
   growth and development in eutherian mammals. In this study we have
   analyzed circulating insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
   (IGFBPs) by Western ligand blotting (WLB) and neutral gel filtration,
   and hepatic IGFBP mRNA transcripts in the wallaby, Macropus eugenii, a
   marsupial in which the fetus is born al an immature stage compared to
   eutherian mammals. Plasma from male and female adults, lactating
   mothers, and pouch young contains an IGF binding species consisting of a
   42- to 50-kDa doublet, 30, 28, 24, and approximately 200 kDa, as shown
   by WLB. This pattern of IGFBPs is very similar to that observed in human
   and sheep. Neutral gel filtration revealed IGF binding activity of
   molecular size 70-160 kDa. When electrophoresed under nonreducing,
   denaturing conditions, the 70- to 160-kDa IGF binding activity appeared
   as a 42- to 50-kDa doubler, indicating the presence of a
   high-molecular-weight circulating IGF binding complex. These properties
   are again analogous to those observed for eutherian IGFBPs. Northern
   analysis of total wallaby liver RNA detected transcripts of 1.8 kb for
   IGFBP-1 and 1.6 kb for IGFBP-2, the same as those observed in the sheep
   and rat. Transcripts of 3.2 kb were detected for IGFBP-4, larger than
   the major band of 2.6 kb observed for the sheep and rat. Transcripts
   representing wallaby IGFBP-3 mRNA were not detected using a rat IGFBP-3
   cDNA probe. Circulating IGFBPs were analyzed in plasma from wallaby
   mothers and their pouch young. There were no changes in circulating
   IGFBPs in the wallaby mothers throughout lactation. However, the
   abundance of IGFBPs in plasma from the pouch young increased throughout
   the suckling period. Therefore, the IGFBPs present in the tammar
   wallaby, M. eugenii, are very similar in apparent molecular size and
   liver mRNA transcripts to those in eutherian mammals and undergo
   developmental changes. Since the pouch young is more accessible than a
   fetus in utero, this species may be useful for further comparative
   studies of the roles and regulation of IGFs and IGFBPs in early growth
   and development. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Eight rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulata) were trained to self-administer
   orally delivered ethanol (8\%) and saccharin (0.03 or 0.3\% wt/vol) or
   water under concurrent fixed-ratio (FR) schedules. The FR requirement
   for saccharin was fixed at 32, while the FR for ethanol was varied (4,
   8, 16, 32, 64 and 128) in a nonsystematic order to assess demand for
   drug. Demand was defined as consumption plotted as a function of price
   (FR). Income was defined as the duration of access to available
   resources. Income was varied by allowing access to the concurrently
   available liquids 20, 60 or 180 min per day. Order of testing was
   counterbalanced across monkeys. Saccharin deliveries were much higher
   than ethanol deliveries under the 180-min income condition; however,
   they were lower than ethanol deliveries when income was reduced to 20
   min and the ethanol FR was 4, 8 or 16. Thus, when the price of drug was
   relatively low, consumption of drug exceeded that of the nondrug
   reinforcer, and that relationship was reversed as income decreased.
   Saccharin deliveries sustained a proportionally greater reduction due to
   decreased income compared to ethanol deliveries. As income decreased
   from 180 to 20 min, saccharin deliveries were reduced by an average of
   79.1\% (across ethanol FR conditions) while ethanol deliveries were
   reduced by an average of 41.2 and 40.8\% when concurrent saccharin or
   water were available, respectively; thus, drug self-administration was
   more resistant to income changes than saccharin. The demand for ethanol
   was shifted downward in a parallel fashion as income decreased. As
   ethanol cost (FR) increased, there were proportionately greater
   decreases in ethanol intake when saccharin was concurrently available
   compared to when water was available. There was a 35-50\% reduction in
   ethanol deliveries due to concurrent saccharin (versus water) at FR 4,
   compared to a 55-75\% reduction at FR 128. Cost of ethanol (FR), income
   level and the availability of a nondrug reinforcer are all variables
   that modify ethanol-reinforced behavior, and income alters the relative
   preference for a drug versus nondrug reinforcer.}},

   body dissatisfaction, possibly surpassing levels observed in the 1985
   survey. Nearly one-half of the women reported globally negative
   evaluations of their appearance and a preoccupation with being or
   becoming overweight Whereas age effects were minimal, significant
   race/ethnicity effects were found, with clearly more positive body

Abstract = {{This investigation was performed to determine whether droperidol
   interacts with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors in the rat
   aorta. Droperidol caused concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in
   endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortic rings precontracted
   with noradrenaline or 5-hydroxytryptamine. Conversely, the contractile
   effect of prostaglandin F-2 alpha was not affected by droperidol.
   Pretreatment with propranolol, brompheniramine and atropine (10(-6) M
   each) did not alter the relaxant effects of droperidol. In addition,
   droperidol shifted the 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline
   concentration-response curves to the right in an apparently competitive
   manner. However, prazosin did not modify the concentration-response
   curve to 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is consistent with the hypothesis
   that the latter has an intrinsic efficacy for
   non-alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. These results strongly suggest that a direct
   arterial endothelium-independent relaxant action of droperidol can be
   attributed to a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor-blocking property and
   support its vascular alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking effect.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a multispectral analysis of a small flare which
   may be considered as a sequence of elementary bursts rather than a
   collective flare phenomenon. A series of 5 short-lived (duration
   approximate to 1-7 s) emission spikes are in fact observed in hard X-ray
   (SXR). The flare was also observed in soft X-ray (SXR), with 3 s
   temporal resolution, and in the optical range with very high spatial
   (approximate to 0.5'') and temporal (2.7 s) resolutions. Sequences of
   filter images, in H-alpha +1.5 Angstrom, He-D-3 and Na-D-2 wavelengths
   were acquired.
   The flare impulsive phase, indicated by the occurrence of the HXR
   spikes, is preceded by an enhancement in the chromospheric and in the
   coronal SXR emissions starting, respectively, 40 and 15 s before the
   flare. This indicates that a density and/or a temperature increase in
   the flaring loop starts at chromospheric levels, and only after this
   phase are the 5 separate electron beams sequentially accelerated and
   stopped in an atmosphere that is already modified.
   Four of the 5 HXR spikes are temporally associated with chromospheric
   emission features over small areas of 3'' size, while the fifth spike
   does not have detectable associated signatures. Apparent contradictions
   between H-alpha + 1.5 Angstrom and He-D-3 emissions can be explained
   assuming atmospheric inhomogeneities, already present within the flaring
   loop.
   The flare occurs within an area of positive magnetic polarity, which
   shows a moderate but constant weighted magnetic shear. No inclusions of
   the opposite polarity are found in the flaring region, and no changes in
   the distribution of any of the magnetic field parameters are detected
   before, during and after the flare occurrence.
   No detectable modifications are measured in the continuum and in all the
   wavelength points of the Na-D-2 line profile apart from the line core;
   this means that flare-associated modifications of the flaring loop
   atmosphere do not penetrate below the temperature minimum region.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding of recently planted fields of maize (Zea mays L.) in the spring
   results in poor emergence of some germplasm. Previous studies have shown
   genetic variation for flooding tolerance of maize inbreds and hybrids.
   This study was conducted to identify a biochemical basis of reduced
   germination after flooding and determine differences between tolerant
   and sensitive inbreds. Seeds soaked in nonaerated water accumulated CO2.
   Reduction of germination after soaking was partially reversed by venting
   the seed with ambient air after soaking and prior to planting.
   Respiration was measured immediately after soaking and after venting.
   Respiration rates of hood tolerant inbreds Increased faster and to a
   higher level after flooding and venting than those of sensitive inbreds.
   The apparent Michaelis constants for succinate oxidation by isolated
   intact mitochondria of flood sensitive inbreds were higher than those of
   tolerant inbreds. Succinate oxidation was competitively inhibited by
   bicarbonate. As the apparent quantitation of Inhibition (Ki) bicarbonate
   increased, flooding sensitivity decreased. Genetic differences in
   flooding tolerance of maize inbred seed germination were at least in
   part influenced by sensitivity of respiration to CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Flaxseed is increasingly being used in some food products because of its
   high content of alpha-linolenic acid and dietary fibre. However,
   flaxseed contains cyanogenic glycosides which release toxic hydrogen
   cyanide in the presence of water (autohydrolysis). A method for
   estimation of cyanide in flaxseed under these conditions is described.
   The determination is carried out by homogenizing the sample with water,
   letting it stand, filtering it through a membrane and then injecting the
   filtrate into an HPLC system consisting of an anion exchange column and
   an electrochemical (amperometric, oxidation) detector. The homogenate is
   analysed at various intervals until a maximum value of cyanide is
   observed. The cyanide content of ten cultivars of flaxseed, when
   analysed by this method, was found to range from 124 to 196 mu g/g. The
   release of cyanide showed a maximum at about 3 h of hydrolysis.
   Virtually no cyanide was detected on boiling the homogenate or the
   flaxseed before determination.}},

   pressure and flow waves. The model-estimated parameters were capable of
   representing the mechanical properties of the blood vessel walls.
   Dicentrine had a beneficial effect on the rigidity of head and body
   circulation, respectively. There were great improvements not only in the
   tube distensibility and wave transmission time, but also in the
   peripheral load compliance and resistance. In global circulation that
   was defined as the parallel combination of head and body circulation,
   dicentrine significantly reduced values in characteristic impedance of
   the ascending aorta from 164 +/- 67 to 105 +/- 43 dynes/s/cm(5), and in
   wave reflection factor from 0.46 +/- 0.14 to 0.36 +/- 0.13, and in total
   peripheral vascular resistance from 4,751 +/- 1,226 to 3,581 +/- 1,277
   dynes/s/cm(5). On the other hand, total peripheral load compliance was
   increased from 0.2950 +/- 0.1794 to 0.4457 +/- 0.2199 ml/mm Hg. Cardiac
   output (CO) and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged, however. Dicentrine
   had an impact on the mechanical properties of Windkessel vessels and
   resistance vessels in the systemic circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and galanin were isolated in
   pure form from the stomach of the European green frog, Rana ridibunda.
   Frog VIP is identical to the previously characterized VIP from chicken
   and alligator. The primary structure of frog galanin contains only two
   amino acid substitutions (asparagine for histidine at position 23 and
   histidine for tyrosine at position 26) compared with porcine galanin.
   The data indicate that evolutionary pressure to conserve the amino acid
   sequence of both peptides during the evolution of amphibia to mammals
   has been strong. Synthetic frog VIP produced a dose-dependent increase
   in cAMP concentration in frog anterior pituitary fragments. The potency
   of the peptide (ED(50) = 1.2 x 10(-6) M; mean +/- SE; n = 8) was
   comparable to that of porcine VIP (EC(50) = 1.3 x 10(-6) M), but was
   approximately 10-fold less than that of frog pituitary adenylate
   cyclase-activating polypeptide {[}PACAP-(1-38); ED(50) = 1.1 x 10(-7) M]
   in the same system. The increases in cAMP concentrations produced by
   maximal doses of PACAP (10(-5) M) and VIP (10(-5) M) were not additive.
   The data suggest that the effects of both peptides are mediated through
   a common PACAP-preferring receptor that is pharmacologically different
   from the mammalian PACAP type I receptor. Synthetic frog galanin also
   produced a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of cAMP in
   isolated frog anterior pituitary fragments (ED(50) = 9.3 X 10(-8) M)
   consistent with a possible role for the peptide as a hypophysiotropic
   factor in amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a
   difference in the accuracy of sonographically determined birth weight
   estimate in fetuses presenting by the breech as compared to the vertex..
   Prospectively, 104 consecutive singleton fetuses presented by the breech
   presentation were identified who also had a sonographic estimate of
   birth weight within 72 h of delivery. The control group (n = 104)
   consisted of fetuses presenting by the vertex of women who had the
   following hospital number and who were of similar demographic
   characteristics; the birth weight estimate in the control group had to
   be within 100 g of that of the women with the breech fetus. Tire
   estimate of the birth weight was derived for both groups using seven
   published models. Prediction limits were calculated for an estimated vs.
   actual birth weight for parturients with breech presentation.
   Among the study group, the mean standardized absolute error was similar
   for the seven models (range 120 +/- 104 to 138 +/- 118 g/kg; p = 0.08).
   For six of the models, the mean standardized absolute error was
   significantly higher for fetuses in the breech presentation than for
   fetuses in vertex presentation (range 80 +/- 63 to 112 +/- 95 g/kg; p =
   0.02 to < 0.0001). Prediction limit calculations indicate that 99\% of
   the time the actual birth weight was between 1500 and 3999 g if the
   estimate of birth weight was 2400-2900 g.
   We conclude that, for fetuses in a breech presentation, the error with
   most models is significantly higher than for a singleton in the vertex
   position.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of modeling 5, 8, and 15 GHz maps of the
   gravitational lens MG 1131+0456 using the LensClean algorithm. Two
   models for the mass distribution in the lens were fitted: a de
   Vaucouleurs model and a model with the two-dimensional potential phi =
   b(2-alpha)(r(2) + s(2))(alpha/2)/alpha, both in an external shear field.
   The best-fit de Vaucouleurs model has an effective radius of R(e) =
   0''.83 +/- 0''.13, larger than that measured at optical wavelengths. The
   best-fit `'alpha-model'' has alpha = 0.6 +/- 0.2 and a core radius of s
   = 0''.19 +/- 0''.07. An isothermal model (alpha = 1) is inconsistent
   with the data. The best alpha-model fits the 8 GHz map significantly
   better than the best de Vaucouleurs model, and it is a good fit at all
   three frequencies. Although the peak residuals in the best
   reconstructions are less than 5\% of the map peak and it is difficult to
   distinguish visually the original image and the reconstructions, none of
   the models is statistically consistent with the data. Experiments on the
   effects of using Clean maps suggest that systematic errors are not the
   source of the discrepancy. We believe the primary problem is that an
   external shear is an inadequate model for the angular structure of the
   lens galaxy. The finite core radius in the models is required by the
   structure of the extended ring, so we confirm that the central component
   in the 8 GHz map is a central, lensed image of the source rather than
   the lens galaxy. Two galaxies 3'' from the ring add an external shear to
   the lens model that is within 3 degrees of the fitted model. The
   alignment is remarkable, but the two galaxies cannot account for the
   magnitude of the shear unless the effective ratio of their luminosity to
   the primary lens galaxy is 25 times larger than the measured ratio. The
   model lens positions, the position angle of the shear, and the mass
   interior to the ring are determined very precisely by the lens models.
   The time delay between the compact components is predicted with an
   uncertainty we estimate to be at most +/-9\%; the formal uncertainty is
   +/-4\%.}},

   solved using a finite difference method, employing a boundary-fitted

   dependent on the magnitude of the input power. A four-cell flow
   structure in the melt is obtained. The effect of thermocapillary
   convection is much more significant than that of buoyancy-driven
   convection. The results show that the steady, axisymmetric flow may not

Abstract = {{In addition to the mu- and delta-opioid receptors previously reported,
   the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line has high levels of kappa(3)
   receptors, accounting for 40\% of total opioid binding, as measured with
   {[}H-3]-diprenorphine binding. Competition studies reveal binding
   profiles for all three receptor classes that are similar to those
   observed in brain membranes. Differentiation with retinoic acid
   increases the levels of opioid receptor binding in the cell line, with
   the largest elevations in kappa(3) binding. Fully 75\% of the increased
   binding corresponds to kappa(3) sites, which represent 50\% of total
   opioid receptor binding in differentiated cells. Morphine inhibits
   forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, and this effect is readily
   blocked by the mu antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2
   (CTAP). Naloxone benzoylhydrazone, a kappa(3) agonist, inhibits
   forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation more potently than morphine
   and is not reversed by CTAP. These studies indicate that SH-SY5Y cells
   contain high levels of functional kappa(3) receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma membrane proteins were extracted either from epididymal
   spermatozoa after incubation with ventral prostrate gland secretion or
   from spermatozoa recovered from uteri of females mated with surgically
   treated males belonging to the following groups: TX (excision of all
   accessory sex glands, ASG), VPX (bilateral excision of ventral
   prostate), VP (bilateral excision of all ASG except the ventral
   prostate), and SH (sham-operated). Incubation of spermatozoa with
   ventral prostatic secretion resulted in an 11-fold increase in
   glycoprotein content of the plasma membrane, but total protein
   concentration remained unchanged. The in vivo study indicated that
   interactions of ASG secretions and spermatozoa were complicated by the
   presence of uterine secretions. Glycoprotein content was reduced in the
   presence of ventral prostatic secretions. SDS-PAGE profiles showed that
   both uterine and ASG secretions could modify proteins on the sperm
   surface. Enrichment of a 25-kD subunit was apparently effected by
   uterine secretions and further promoted by combined secretions of the
   ampullary gland, coagulating gland, dorsolateral prostate, and seminal
   vesicle, but was reduced by the ventral prostate. A number of other
   protein subunits appeared to be specifically modified by the ventral
   prostate, while other ASG secretions were also shown to alter the
   effects of the ventral prostate on the sperm surface.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variation in seed traits was investigated in cloned genotypes
   of the perennial grass Amphibromus scabrivalvis to explore the degree to
   which individuals alter reproductive traits in response to enhanced soil
   resources. The seeds of this species matured in cleistogamous spikelets
   on panicles enclosed within leaf sheaths along each tiller. Ten clones,
   each a genotype from one seed, were separated into 48 ramets and planted
   in the greenhouse. One-half of all ramets received 20\%-20\%-20\%
   (N-P-K) fertilizer every 2 wk, while the other half were not fertilized.
   For each clone, 24 ramets were harvested after 20 and 26 wk. Seed number
   and dry mass were recorded; seed allocation was expressed as a
   percentage of total dry mass. To visualize the relation of genotype to
   phenotype, reaction norms were plotted. Plasticity was expressed as an
   index that measured the percentage change in a trait from the fertilized
   to the unfertilized environment. There were significant differences
   among clones in seed number and total seed mass at both 20 and 26 wk,
   and in seed allocation at 20 wk. Most seed traits were increased by
   nutrient addition. Crossing of reaction norms and some significant
   treatment by clone interactions revealed that clones varied in the
   extent to which they responded to elevated nutrients. For both harvests,
   seed number and total seed mass were significantly more plastic than
   seed allocation and mean seed mass; however, variation in plasticity
   among clones was significantly greater for the latter two traits. This
   species mostly changes seed number in response to enhanced soil
   resources rather than mean seed mass or seed allocation. The marked
   genotypic variation in the plasticity of mean seed mass and allocation
   indicates that selection could alter the relative abundance of genotypes
   if the phenotypic responses of these traits to the availability of soil
   resources enhances reproductive fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Results of observations of the X-ray pulsar GX 301-2 carried out with
   the WATCH instrument of the GRANAT Orbiting Observatory between January
   1990 and October 1993 are reported. The deduced mean light curve of this
   X-ray source exhibits a flare near orbital phase 0.94, which virtually
   terminates before the X-ray source reaches the periastron. The time of
   the X-ray flare derived from the WATCH data has made it possible to
   refine the period of the pulsar's flares. The deduced value, within the
   limits of the errors, closely matches the orbital period of GX 301-2
   previously obtained from the Doppler shift in the source's rotation
   period. The luminosity of GX 301-2 at maximum light, its mean
   luminosity, and the total energy released by the pulsar during the flare
   near the periastron have been determined. The pulsation period of the
   source during the WATCH observations has been evaluated. The
   correspondence of the observed evolution of the rotation period with
   various accretion models is checked. The premature turnoff of the flare
   is interpreted in terms of the formation of a rarefaction zone around
   the neutron star due to heating of the stellar wind by X-ray emission
   from the pulsar during the flare.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction (APBDJ) induces various
   pancreatobiliary diseases, Because of the high incidence of biliary
   tract carcinoma, excision of the gallbladder and choledochal cyst is now
   recognized to be the treatment of choice for patients with choledochal
   cyst, However, surgical strategy for patients with APBDJ without cyst is
   not well evaluated, Forty-five consecutive patients with APBDJ (33 with
   cyst, 12 without cyst) treated over a 20-years period were divided into
   two groups based on the presence or absence of choledochal cyst and
   associated pancreatobiliary diseases were examined to evaluate the
   surgical strategy for patients without cyst, Mean age of patients
   without cyst was older (p<0.01) than that of patients with cyst,
   Female/male ratio was 1.0 in patients without cyst while it was 4.5 when
   cyst was present, Carcinoma of the gallbladder or bile duct was found in
   12\% and pancreatitis in 21\% of patients with cyst, while 33\% of
   patients without cyst had gallbladder carcinoma or pancreatitis, Chronic
   calcifying pancreatitis was present in 17\% of patients without cyst but
   not in patients with cyst, We conclude that a significantly higher
   incidence of gallbladder carcinoma necessitates cholecystectomy in
   patients with APBDJ without choledochal cyst, Excision of the
   extrahepatic bile duct is recommended for these patients at an early
   stage of pancreatitis to prevent an irreversible pancreatic damage.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptional activation of c-fos in response to both serum
   stimulation and DNA damage requires the serum response element. The
   inability of in vitro aged or senescent fibroblasts to proliferate in
   response to serum has been shown to be associated with repressed c-fos
   expression and reduced AP-1 binding activity. In contrast, we have
   observed similar levels of c-fos mRNA and protein expression in young
   (early passage) and old (late passage) cells following their treatment
   with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS).
   Thus, the early events in the signal transduction pathway leading to
   transcriptional activation of c-fos following DNA damage are distinct
   from those mediating the gene's expression in response to mitogenic
   stimulation. Despite normal levels of c-fos expression, we observed a
   reduced level of AP-1 binding activity in old cells relative to young
   cells treated with UV irradiation or MMS. Reduced AP-1 binding activity
   is associated with reduced expression of the AP-1-dependent gene,
   collagenase, in old cells treated with DNA damaging agents. Since other
   DNA damage-inducible genes also contain an AP-1 regulatory element
   presumed to play a role in their expression, reduced AP-1 binding
   activity is likely to have a major impact on the old cell's ability to
   respond appropriately to DNA damage. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.{*}{*}}},

Abstract = {{The sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine (CSH), promotes the accumulation of
   autofluorescent, peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic granules in cultured
   astroglia akin to those which naturally accumulate in astrocytes of the
   aging periventricular brain. Both in vitro and in situ, CSH rapidly
   induces various heat shock proteins (HSP) in astrocytes long before
   granulation occurs. In the present study, we determined that CSH
   treatment resulted in an increase in HSP 27, HSP 90 and heme oxygenase
   (HO-1) at both the protein and mRNA level. We also showed that C6 glioma
   cells, unlike primary astrocytes, constitutively express HSP 27, HSP 90
   and HO-1 at low levels. Moreover, CSH is incapable of eliciting further
   HSP expression or inducing granulation in the glioma cells. Our results
   support the hypothesis that the biogenesis of redox-active astrocytic
   inclusions in CSH-treated glial cultures and in the aging
   periventricular brain is dependent on an antecedent cellular stress
   response.}},

Abstract = {{All available controlled studies of warm versus cold and antegrade
   versus retrograde delivery of cardioplegia were reviewed to assess the
   incidence of perioperative stroke and adverse neuropsychological
   outcomes. Nine randomized trials and substudies and two studies with
   immediate historical consecutive controls reported neurological outcomes
   and were described as warm versus cold. Pooled event rates for
   perioperative stroke were 1.5\% for warm antegrade, 3.14\% for warm
   retrograde, 1.7\% for cold antegrade, and 0\% to 1.2\% for cold
   retrograde. Examining within trial differences, only one study showed a
   significant disadvantage to warm 4.5\% versus cold 1.4\% on incidence of
   perioperative stroke, but the design does not permit determination of
   whether the difference is due to systemic temperature, retrograde
   coronary perfusion, or other factors. Furthermore, if only warm (> 33
   degrees C) versus cold (< 30 degrees C) systemic perfusion is examined
   in all studies for the incidence of stroke irrespective of cardioplegia
   temperature or antegrade versus retrograde coronary perfusion (warm
   2.1\%; cold 1.6\%), the above study remains a significant outlier. This
   suggests that the differences found are unlikely to be due to
   temperature but may be related to antegrade versus retrograde coronary
   perfusion. Review of randomized trials evaluating neuropsychological
   function post-cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB) also failed to reveal
   any advantage related to temperature of systemic perfusion. Since
   manipulations that are most likely to give rise to cerebral embolization
   are uniformly carried out at normothermia at the beginning and end of
   the operation, it is not entirely unexpected that the incidence of
   neurological events was found to be independent of the temperature of
   CPB. Because stroke is both too rare and too variable in magnitude by
   chance alone, no studies to date have adequately assessed stroke
   severity in relation to systemic perfusion temperature or mode and route
   of cardioplegia delivery.}},

   were obtained from the right and left masseter muscles. On the side
   opposite the interference, myoelectric clenching activity was
   significantly reduced. Correlation analyses showed that the interference
   elicited a non-linear (complex) co-ordination of the amplitude, but not
   the duration, of bilateral masseteric clenching activity, i.e.
   frequently there was significant motor facilitation on the side of the
   interference, and significant motor inhibition on the side opposite the
   interference. Theoretical considerations predicted that brief clenching
   on the interference would easily lead to frontal plane rotatory motions

   calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) (rat, I-125-labelled rat CGRP
   alpha; monkey, I-125-labelled human CGRP alpha). In rat, amylin
   receptors were discretely distributed with the highest receptor
   densities found in mid-caudal accumbens nucleus, parts of the bed
   nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Moderate to
   high densities of binding also occurred in the area postrema,
   subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, locus
   ceruleus, dorsal raphe, and caudal solitary tract nucleus. In monkey,
   the distribution of amylin binding sites was similar, although the
   highest densities of receptors were in the hypothalamus, with relatively
   fewer sites present in the accumbens nucleus. In rat, the distribution
   of amylin receptors formed a subset of the receptor distributions for
   I-125-labelled salmon CT and I-125-labelled rat CGRP alpha. In contrast,
   in monkey, although the amylin receptors again formed a subset of the

   little overlap with the pattern of CGRP receptor distribution. This
   suggests that the specificity profile of amylin receptors in primates
   differs from that of amylin receptors in the rat, with CGRP alpha having
   relatively lower affinity for the primate amylin receptors.}},

Abstract = {{We asked whether dynamization of externally fixed diaphyseal fractures
   could improve bone healing in co parison to rigid fixation of fractures
   having similar remaining gap sizes. To answer this question we evaluated
   metatarsal osteotomies in 12 sheep. The osteotomy with a 0.6-mm gap was
   stabilized with a specially designed high bending and torsional
   stiffness external ring fixator. Osteotomies in six sheep were
   stabilized rigidly (axial movement < 0.06 mm) or dynamically (axial
   movement 0.15-0.34 mm). The cyclical axial interfragmentary movement was
   caused by the load-bearing of the operated limb. With increasing healing
   time, the initially allowed movement was decreased by callus formation
   around the osteotomy. The reduction in interfragmentary movement was
   measured and monitored by a linear variable displacement transducer at
   the external fixator and a telemetry system. After 9 weeks the sheep
   were sacrificed and the healed bones were investigated biomechanically
   and histomorphologically. Compared to the rigidly fixed osteotomies, the
   dynamized osteotomies showed significantly (P < 0.05) greater (+ 41 \%)
   callus formation and 45\% greater tensile strength of the newly formed
   bone in the cortical osteotomy gap. Histological analysis indicated that
   the effect of dynamization occurred mainly after the 5th week.
   Relevance
   From these results we conclude that dynamic fixation of diaphyseal gaps
   is advantageous in comparison to stable external fixation.}},

   have variable lipid acid apolipoprotein contents, and it is difficult to
   consider each parameter separately, particularly because an increase in
   the apo CIII content is always associated with an increase in the
   content of other C apolipoproteins. Therefore, we used affinity-purified
   LpB free of other apolipoproteins. Lipid content of LpB was increased by
   incubation with a lipid emulsion, and this triglyceride-enriched LpB was
   named TG-LpB. Free apo CI, apo CII, apo CIII, and apo E were added to
   LpB and TG-LpB and their associations to the lipoprotein were assessed
   by gel filtration, nondenaturing electrophoresis, and immunoblotting.
   Molar ratios of 6 (ape E), 30 (ape CII), 20 (ape CIII), and 30 (apo CI)
   for 1 apo B were obtained. The association of apo CII to LpB and TG-LpB
   induced modifications to the LpB structure and a redistribution of
   lipids and apolipoproteins on the lipoprotein particles. The binding of
   these LpBs and TG-LpBs with and without added apo CI, CII, CIII, and E
   was tested at 4 degrees C on the LDL receptors of HeLa cells. The
   increased content of lipids reduced TG-LpB binding to the LDL receptor.
   Addition of apo CIII to LpB decreased its affinity, although this
   decrease was lower than that observed with LpB:CIII prepared from whole
   plasma. Apo CIII almost completely abolished the interaction of TG-LpB
   with the receptor, indicating a synergistic effect of lipids and apo
   CIII. The apo CIII effect was specific and cannot be obtained with apo
   CI. With apo CII, an inhibitory effect can also be obtained but to a
   lesser extent than with apo CIII. At 37 degrees C the C apolipoproteins
   decreased the catabolism of LpB and TG-LpB by the LDL receptor of
   fibroblasts. Addition of apo E to either LpB or TG-LpB had a small
   effect on the binding of the enriched lipoproteins at 4 degrees C but
   markedly increased their catabolism at 37 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Embryos of the crustacean Artemia franciscana survive continuous anoxia
   for periods of years, during which their metabolism comes to a
   reversible standstill. A question of some interest concerns the
   maintenance of cellular integrity in the absence of biosynthesis and an
   ongoing energy metabolism. The present paper continues previous work on
   an abundant protein (p26) that undergoes extensive intracellular
   translocation during aerobic-anoxic transitions, exhibits several
   characteristics of stress proteins, and might be involved in metabolic
   regulation during aerobic-anoxic transitions. Since it has been
   established that intracellular pH (pH(i)) plays a major role in
   aerobic-anoxic transitions in this system we examined the pH-dependence
   of nuclear-cytoplasmic translocations of p26. In unincubated and
   aerobic-incubated embryos (pH(i) greater than or equal to 7.9) p26 was
   located in the `'soluble'' fraction, whereas in anoxic embryos (pH about
   6.3) roughly 50\% was translocated into the nucleus as shown by
   immunocolloidal gold electron microscopy. These nuclear translocations
   also took place in vitro, simply by manipulating buffer pH in a
   physiologically appropriate fashion. Immunostaining of Western blots
   prepared after two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed several isoforms
   of native p26. The isoelectric point of the major isoform was 7.10 +/-
   0.05, a value close to the pH at which p26 translocation into the
   nucleus was first initiated in vitro. P-31-NMR measurements indicated
   that pH(i) was maintained at acidic levels (about 6.3) during prolonged
   anoxia. We also found that pH(i) of hydrated (0 degrees C) but otherwise
   unincubated embryos was alkaline, allowing for rapid resumption of
   metabolism under permissive conditions. The significance of these
   pa-dependent translocations of p26 is discussed. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{As cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts function for several years,
   outgrowth and disconnection of the distal catheter are seen more
   frequently. Though a shunt revision is clearly indicated if patients are
   symptomatic, asymptomatic patients with a disconnection or who have
   outgrown the distal catheter may no longer require CSF diversion. This
   follows an assumption that the shunt is no longer functioning and, in an
   asymptomatic patient, no longer required. However, patent fibrous tracts
   have been postulated which may allow passage of CSF through disconnected
   or outgrown distal catheters. We have recently treated 2 patients with
   ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts with evidence of a persistent fibrous
   tract. A 13-year-old boy was asymptomatic for 2 years after radiographs
   revealed an outgrown distal VP shunt catheter, after which he acutely
   deteriorated and died from massive hydrocephalus, although the entire
   shunt was patent. Another 14-year-old boy who was profoundly retarded
   presented with subtle changes in his daily activity. Shunt radiographs
   revealed two disconnections and a broken valve, but a shunt tap revealed
   a normal opening pressure (OF). A radionuclide shuntogram revealed rapid
   passage of isotope through fibrous sheaths at the disconnections, and
   into the peritoneum. A shunt revision was performed and the patient
   returned to his previous level of health. Patients with outgrown or
   disconnected distal catheters may be asymptomatic and/or have normal OF,
   and must not be assumed to have arrested hydrocephalus. A ventricular
   pressure measurement and radionuclide shuntogram should be performed to
   rule out a patent persistent fibrous tract.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility that progesterone or estradiol may regulate expression
   of G protein in the rat myometrium during the course of pregnancy has
   been investigated using 1) immunoblot analysis of Gi2 alpha, Gi3 alpha,
   and Gq alpha subunits and 2) hybridization blot analysis of subunit
   mRNA, Eighteen hours after administration, estradiol had significantly
   increased the levels of both Gi2 alpha subunit and Gi2 alpha mRNA (by
   40\% and 32\%, respectively). In control pregnant rats, we observed
   similar changes at the end of pregnancy, when myometrial concentrations
   of estradiol had increased, i.e., a 41\% increase in immunoreactive Gi2
   alpha subunit that correlated with a parallel 45\% increase in mRNA
   levels, In contrast, levels of immunoreactive Gi3 alpha subunit and
   mRNA, which decreased with advancing gestation, were not influenced by
   estradiol or progesterone administration. Progesterone administration
   resulted 30 h later in a significantly decreased level of Gq alpha
   immunoreactivity (32\%) and Gq alpha mRNA (30\%), In control rats, Gq
   alpha protein and mRNA were also significantly lower at midpregnancy
   under progesterone dominance vs. term. At this stage, a twofold increase
   in Gq alpha subunit correlated with a 40\% increase in mRNA levels.
   These results demonstrate that myometrial Gi2 alpha and Gq alpha
   subunits are physiological targets for estradiol and progesterone,
   respectively, invivo. Alterations of these G protein levels are
   discussed in relation to their mediating effects on adenylyl cyclase
   activity or the phospholipase C pathway during the course of pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new adaptive scheme for the motion control of an
   important class of Lagrangian systems. The proposed controller does not

   general and computationally efficient, and is implementable with a wide
   variety of systems. It is shown that the control strategy is globally
   stable in the presence of bounded disturbances, and that in the absence
   of disturbances the ultimate bound on the size of the trajectory
   tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small. The capabilities of the
   proposed control scheme are illustrated through computer simulations and
   experiments involving industrial robots. These studies demonstrate that
   the controller provides a simple and effective means of obtaining high
   performance trajectory tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Excised mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) hypocotyl sections were exposed to
   40 degrees C for up to 4 h in the presence or absence of 50 mu M
   cycloheximide (CHX) before being held at a non-chilling (20 degrees C)
   or chilling (2.5 degrees C) temperature. Mung bean hypocotyl tissue is
   chilling sensitive, and the rate of solute leakage is highly correlated
   with the extent of chilling injury, A 3 h heat shock at 40 degrees C
   reduced chilling-induced solute leakage by up to 40\%, but leakage was
   similar to non-heat-shocked hypocotyls when CHX was present, Specific
   proteins were labelled when hypocotyls were exposed to {[}S-35]
   methionine during the last hour of heat shock. The nine most intense
   bands on the autoradiographs of SDS-PAGE gels of extracted protein
   corresponded to molecular weights of 114, 79, 73, 70, 60, 56, 51, 46,
   and 18 kDa, The 18 kDa band reached a maximum after 1 h at 40 degrees C
   and then rapidly decreased in intensity as the heat shock continued,
   becoming undetectable at 4 h, The four most intense bands after 3 h at
   40 degrees C corresponded to molecular weights of 79, 70, 51, and 46
   kDa, The synthesis of these four hsps was markedly reduced when the
   hypocotyl sections were exposed to CHX during heat shock, During
   chilling for 6 d, the levels of hsps 79 and 70 remained significantly
   higher in tissue that was heat shocked prior to chilling than in tissue
   that was not heat shocked, In contrast, the levels of hsps 51 and 46
   were similar in both heat-shocked and control tissues,
   Heat-shock-induced chilling tolerance was lost between 6 and 9 d of
   storage at 2.5 degrees C; this loss coincided with the decay of hsps 79
   and 70 to control levels. These results suggest that heat shock induces
   an increase in both chilling tolerance and the de novo synthesis of
   specific heat shock proteins; namely hsps 79 and 70, This is the first
   report showing a relationship between heat-shock-induced chilling
   tolerance and specific heat-shock-induced proteins.}},

   D2O, mannitol, copper(II), superoxide dismutase, 2-H-propanol,
   deferoxamine and surfactants, we suggest a photosensitization mechanism
   involving singlet oxygen and free radicals. The higher rate of
   photocleavage in nitrogen compared to that in an air-saturated solution
   and the results obtained from oxygen consumption measurements support
   the hypothesis that both the type I and type II photosensitization
   mechanisms are operative and that oxygen quenches the excited state of
   the irradiated drug. The photosensitization model applied was in
   agreement with that previously applied to cell membrane SPF photoinduced
   damage. Interaction of the drug with DNA, studied through circular
   dichroism and fluorescence anisotropy, probably occurs through a surface
   binding mode. The experimental techniques used for assessing the
   photodamaging activity of this drug may be useful for screening of
   phototoxic compounds in the environment and for determining the active
   species involved.}},

Abstract = {{Three groups of calves (15-18 per group) were injected twice at a 3-week
   interval with 2 doses of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, CONTROL group),
   2 doses of PRESPONSE, a Pasteurella haemolytica Al bacterial extract
   vaccine (PRESPONSE-2 group) or 1 dose of PBS followed by a 2nd
   vaccination with 1 dose of PRESPONSE (PRESPONSE-1 group), Three weeks
   after the 2nd vaccination, the calves were challenged intratracheally
   with P, haemolytica Al, Calves were evaluated clinically for 3 days
   prior to challenge and for 5 days after challenge, Six days
   postchallenge, calves were either euthanized or sent to slaughter and
   the lungs were evaluated for percent pneumonic tissue.
   There was a significant effect of single or double application of
   vaccine on clinical scores (P = 0.0409), Percent pneumonic tissue at
   necropsy was significantly affected by vaccine group (P = 0.014), Calves
   in the CONTROL group had significantly higher percent pneumonic tissue
   after arcsine transformation (45.30\%) than calves in any group
   receiving PRESPONSE, regardless of vaccination frequency (25.18\% and
   25.78\%, for calves receiving 2 doses or 1 dose of PRESPONSE,
   respectively), Both serum toxin neutralizing and direct agglutinating
   titers were negatively correlated with percent pneumonic tissue, Most
   importantly, 1 dose of PRESPONSE was as efficient as 2 doses at
   eliciting a protective immune response. It is concluded that the
   presence of P. haemolytica as a natural commensal in the upper
   respiratory tract of the calf can effectively prime the animal, and
   allow the animal to respond in an anamnestic nature to only 1 dose of
   this vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{This work shows how to extend the differential correction algorithm (a
   well-known technique for rational minimax approximation of real
   functions) to handle simultaneous minimax approximation of magnitude and
   phase of complex-valued functions defined on the unit circle of the

   best approximants with poles only inside the unit circle. Hence, the
   approximants obtained can be used as transfer functions of causal and
   stable linear systems, and the proposed technique can be profitably
   applied to digital filter design. The differential correction strategy
   can also be applied to rational complex approximation, and can also be
   extended to the case of multidimensional rational functions, retaining
   the properties of the one-dimensional case. This ability to produce
   stable transfer functions is of special interest in the multidimensional

Abstract = {{Amonafide is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid, The drug had
   demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some
   activity in Phase I trials, The drug is extensively metabolized and
   detected in plasma and urine, Its toxicity has previously been
   correlated to the formation of an active metabolite, N-acetyl-amonafide.
   Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
   (CGLGB) master metastatic breast cancer protocol, CALGB 8642 randomizes
   previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of
   several Phase LI agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by
   standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil or to immediate
   treatment with standard cyclophosphamidedoxorubicin-5-fluorouracil. The
   end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival,
   toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents
   precedes standard chemotherapy. This report deals only with amonafide as
   a Phase II agent. Comparisons with the
   cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed,
   Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer
   and a performance status of 0-1. Patients could not have had prior
   chemotherapy for metastatic disease, Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was
   permitted. Patients could not have visceral crisis, Amonafide was given
   at 300 mg/m(2)/day i.v. for 5 days, and repeated at 21-day intervals for
   a maximum of four cycles, Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated
   dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof, Toxicity was primarily
   hematological and bimodal: 32\% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24\% had
   grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia; 22\% had no leukopenia and 44\% had no
   thrombocytopenia, The response rate was 18\%, including one complete
   response. When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity, there
   was a 35.7\% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 (versus
   8.3\%, P = 0.08). There was a 50\% response if patients had
   thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (versus 7.1\%, P = <0.01). We conclude that
   amonafide is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer
   patients. There may be a steep dose-response curve, based on the
   significant correlation between myelosuppression and response, Rates of
   responses in patients adequately dosed (i.e., with significant
   hematotoxicity) dth amonafide ranged from 35 to 50\%. Further studies
   will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator
   phenotyping.}},

   Results. We found 10,350 people with KS: 1,935 reported only to the AIDS
   registry, 1,428 reported only to the cancer registry, and 6,987 reported
   to both. Ninety-three cases of non-HIV-associated KS were expected. For

Abstract = {{To estimate the persistence of xenobiotic in the environment, a new
   ultimate mineralization approach for assessing ready biodegradability in
   seawater has been developed, based on the OECD 301 B guideline for
   freshwater, A few changes in the currently accepted procedure have been
   made to adapt the test to seawater, The assays, realized with seawater
   as test medium and inoculum, give high variability results of
   biodegradability, To lower this variability a synthetic marine medium
   joined to a highly concentrated inoculum from a marine aquarium filter
   have been used, The results reveal (i) a decrease of variability,
   together with an increase in degradation rate of the tested chemicals
   due to a better control of inoculum and test medium, and (ii) no
   difference in easy biodegradable compound (sodium benzoate)
   biodegradation rate when two marine aquarium inocula are tested, This
   study demonstrates that the ready biodegradability test developed on
   synthetic marine medium and inoculum from marine aquarium filter
   minimizes the effect of the sample location on the biodegradation
   results of compounds and allows classifying chemicals as a function of

Abstract = {{A clinical trial of efficacy of methotrexate and misoprostol for
   abortion was performed involving 86 women requesting an abortion at <56
   days gestation. An acceptability evaluation was included in the design
   of the trial. Subjects were questioned before the study about their
   reasons for choosing a medical abortion and past experience with
   surgical abortion. After the study was completed, the women were
   questioned about their medical abortion experience. All questions were
   asked in an open-ended manner. Eighty-five of 86 (99\%) patients
   completed both questionnaires. The most common reason cited as to why
   women chose to have a medical abortion was to avoid some aspect of the
   surgery (48\%). Forty-one (48\%) women had experienced a surgical
   abortion; 49\% of these women chose to have a medical abortion because
   of a `'bad'' past experience related to the surgical procedure. Upon
   completion of the study, 67 (79\%) patients stated the medical abortion
   was a good experience, 12 (14\%) a bad experience, and 6 (7\%) had a
   neutral response. When asked what method they would choose if they were
   to have another abortion, 89\% would choose this method of medical

Abstract = {{Two peptides that correspond to sequences within the major 33-amino acid
   sequence recognized by human liver-kidney microsomal-l autoantibodies
   were used to elicit antibodies in rabbits (four per peptide) against
   CYP2D6. Peptide 1 (DPAQPPRDLTEAFLA) corresponded to amino acids 263-277,
   and peptide 2 (LLTEHRMT-WDPAQPPRDLTE) corresponded to amino acids
   254-273 of CYP2D6. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates
   elicited good immune responses against their respective peptides as
   judged by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (titers of 1/10,000 to
   1/30,000). The antisera recognized CYP2D6 on Western blots and, to
   varying extents, inhibited recombinant CYP2D6 and liver microsomal
   CYP2D6 activity. Immunization with peptide 2 produced antisera with the
   greatest inhibitory potency. Antiserum from a rabbit (\#236) immunized
   with peptide 2 inhibited up to 95\% of dextromethorphan O-demethylase
   activity in human liver microsomes at the highest concentration tested
   (40\% v/v) but did not significantly inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, or
   CYP3A4 marker activities. On Western blot, only a single immunoreactive
   protein comigrating with recombinant CYP2D6 was recognized. In liver
   microsomes from a CYP2D6-deficient individual, no proteins were
   recognized, and the antisera did not cross-react with recombinant
   CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4. There was a significant correlation
   between the quantity of immunoreactive CYP2D6 as determined by
   immunoblotting with anti-peptide 2 antiserum and dextromethorphan
   O-demethylation in a panel of 10 human liver microsomes (r = 0.95).
   These data identify a peptide sequence (peptide 2) that can be used to
   raise antisera that specifically recognize and inhibit CYP2D6.}},

Abstract = {{Deltamethrin is a potent neuroactive pyrethroid insecticide. Literature
   reports of the in vivo potency of deltamethrin, however, vary by greater
   than three orders of magnitude in studies employing numerous vehicles
   and routes of exposure. Therefore, the present study systematically
   compared IP and PO routes of exposure to deltamethrin (0.3-1000 mg/kg)
   delivered to adult rats in one of four different vehicles (corn oil,
   glycerol formal, Emulphor(R), or methylcellulose). A reduction in motor
   activity as measured in figure-8 mazes was used to index the potency of
   this pesticide on CNS function. Dose-effect and time-course
   determinations were made for each combination of vehicle and route.
   Results demonstrated that the potency of deltamethrin was dependent on
   both the route of administration and the vehicle. The ED(50) for
   deltamethrin was 5.1 mg/kg when administered PO in corn oil, whereas,
   the ED(50) was > 1000 mg/kg when administered PO in methylcellulose.
   Thus, reported discrepancies in the potency of deltamethrin on CNS
   function are at least partially attributable to route of administration
   and vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of suspected

   27 control subjects and to determine the association of these bacteria
   with periodontal destruction. Subgingival plaque was collected from the
   mesiobuccal sites of ah teeth, except 3rd molars. Bacteria were
   identified and enumerated using non-isotopic whole chromosomal DNA
   probes and a colony lift method. At baseline, HIV seropositive subjects
   had significantly higher mean \% of Porphyromonas gingivalis than
   control subjects. This difference could be attributed to a subgroup of
   HIV seropositive subjects with widespread attachment loss. No
   correlations were observed between the mean \%s of DNA probe species and
   mean attachment loss, CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte counts or CD4: CD8 ratio.
   No significant microbiological differences were detected between active
   and control sites in HIV seropositive subjects on a longitudinal basis.
   There appeared to be an inverse relationship between the mean \%s of P.
   gingivalis and V. parvula, with respect to progression of HIV infection.
   The ability of microbiological parameters to predict site-specific
   breakdown in HIV seropositive subjects requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen sorghum varieties were studied for two years in the rainy and
   dry season in a random block design with 4 replications. The plots were
   21 m(2) of harvesting area in a typical red ferrallitic soil. Cutting
   was at 90 day in both seasons and 70 days of regrowth. Irrigation was in
   the dry season according to the variety requirements. Average height,
   stem diameter, width and length of the leaves differed significantly (P
   < 0.001) in both years in each season. The best morphological
   characteristics as forage in the rainy season were shown by G-192,
   CC-72, Criollo and Criollo MS with heights between 286 and 346 cm and
   limbo length between 70 and 104.9 cm. Range boss was better in the dry
   season with values of 230.5 cm height and 101.9 cm limbo length and did
   not differ from Graze all in certain measurements. Generally, there was
   a greater tillering in the rainy season than in the dry season ranging
   from 3.3 to 4.8 and 4.1 to 5.8 in the forage varieties in the dry and
   wet seasons, respectively. Dry matter yield showed a seasonal
   performance with accumulated average values in two cuts varying from
   26.9 to 22.2 t/ha in the rainy season in G-192, CC-72, AG-2002 and
   Criollo which differed significantly from the remaining varieties (P <
   0.001), while in-the dry season the best yields were from 11.0 to 8.5
   t/ha for CC-72, Graze all, Range boss and G-191. The percentage
   components of dry matter and leaf stem ratio differed between varieties
   (P < 0.001). the varieties with better forage characteristics were
   G-192, CC-72, Criollo and Range boss and Graze all. Further
   bromatological and performance studies on pests and diseases are

   nonextraction treatment modalities. Ninety-one patients (44 extraction
   and 47 nonextraction) were evaluated using standardized facial
   photographs, available at pretreatment, posttreatment and e-years in
   retention. The photographs were digitized and displayed on a computer
   monitor. Thirty-eight landmarks (18 frontal and 20 lateral) were
   located. From these landmarks, 29 angular and linear dimensions (8
   frontal and 21 lateral) were constructed. Descriptive and analytical
   statistics were used to compare the absolute dimensions, as well as the
   incremental changes, between the extraction and nonextraction groups.
   The present findings indicate: (1) After treatment the upper and lower
   lips were retracted significantaly more in the extraction group compared
   with the nonextraction group. These differences persisted into
   retention. (2) The upper lip length increased more among subjects who
   were treated without extractions. (3) The upper vermilion height in male
   subjects and the upper and lower vermilion heights in female subjects
   increased among subjects who were treated without extractions and
   decreased among subjects who were treated with four first premolar

   derivative estimation with respect to most structural parameters in

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet-B (UVB, wavelength 280-320 nm) radiation has been
   demonstrated to affect growth and development of many plants. This study
   was conducted to determine the effect of UVB radiation on stomatal
   density and opening of Oryza sativa and to test if the stomatal response
   to UVB was associated with different sensitivity of growth to UVB in
   four cultivars. Ten-day-old seedlings of IR45 and IR74 (UVB sensitive),
   and IR64 and IR30 (UVB less sensitive), were subjected to UVB radiation
   in a glasshouse for 6 h d(-1) for 4 weeks. The unweighted UVB radiation
   was 1.94 W m(-2) for UVB treatment and 0.15 W m(-2) for control. Leaf
   area and plant dry mass were determined every 2 weeks while stomatal
   density and opening were recorded weekly. Results showed that a 2-week
   UVB treatment had no effect on the leaf area or plant dry mass of any
   test cultivar, but significantly reduced stomatal density and opening in
   IR45 and IR74. Under 4-week UVB exposure, leaf area and plant dry mass
   of IR45 and IR74 were significantly reduced. Stomatal density decreased
   in all cultivars, except in IR64. Greater reduction of stomata on the
   adaxial surface than on the abaxial surface under 3 and 4 weeks of UVB
   exposure suggests a direct effect of UVB radiation on stomata. IR45 and
   IR74 showed significant reductions in stomatal opening after 2 weeks of
   exposure to UVB, while stomatal opening in IR30 and IR64 decreased
   significantly after only 4 weeks of UVB treatment. Difference in plant
   dry mass between UVB treated and control plants was significantly
   correlated with the reductions in stomatal opening and density on
   adaxial surface under UVB treatment. Thus, reduction in dry mass of rice
   plants under UVB in the glasshouse could be attributed to decrease in
   stomatal density and opening. (C) 1995 Annals of Botany Company}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - we developed a disability scale to monitor myasthenia
   gravis (MG) patients, based on degree of function impairment and daily
   frequency of each symptom. Material \& methods - the scale was based on
   standardized questions and clinical examination. The scale was
   administered to 12 patients, one or more times, for a total of 22
   interviews. Each observation was recorded on videotape and reviewed by
   five independent observers. The ability of our scale to discriminate
   clinical changes was also compared with the Osserman classification.
   Results - our scale showed from substantial to almost perfect inter and
   intraobserver agreement. Our findings showed that clinically relevant
   changes not detected by Osserman staging were disclosed by our scale.
   Conclusion - our scale is simple and easy to use in clinical practice.
   It offers an accurate means of evaluating disability in MG patients and
   may detect clinically relevant changes in disability. It would therefore
   be useful to monitor the effects of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The growth and development of hair follicles is influenced by a number
   of different growth factors and cytokines, particularly members of the
   fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF
   or FGF-7) is a recently identified 28-kd member of the FGF family that
   induces proliferation of a wide variety of epithelial cells, including
   keratinocytes within the epidermis and dermal adnexa. Because KGF
   induces marked proliferation of keratinocytes, and both KGF and KGF
   receptor (KGFR) mRNA are expressed at high levels in skin, we sought to
   localize KGF and KGFR in skin by in situ hybridization KGFR mRNA was
   relatively strongly expressed by keratinocytes in the basilar epidermis
   as well as throughout developing hair follicles of rat embryos and
   neonates, KGF mRNA was expressed at lower levels than was KGFR but could
   be localized to follicular dermal papillae in rat embryos and neonates.
   These results prompted us to investigate the effects of KGF on hair
   follicles in two distinct murine models of alopecia. In the first model,
   recombinant KGF (rKGF) induced dose-dependent hair growth over most of
   the body in nu/nu athymic nude mice when administered intraperitoneally
   or subcutaneously over 17 to 18 days. When administered subcutaneously,
   rKGF induced the most extensive hair growth at the sites of injection.
   Histologically, rKGF induced marked follicular and sebaceous gland
   hypertrophy, a normalization of the nu/nu follicular keratinization
   defect, and an increase in follicular keratinocyte proliferation as
   assessed by bromodeoxyuridine labeling. In the second model, a neonatal
   mt model of cytosine arabinoside chemotherapy-induced alopecia in which
   interleukin-1, epidermal growth factor, and acidic FGF have all
   demonstrated some degree of alopecia cytoprotective, rKGF induced a
   dose-dependent cytoprotective effect, abrogating as much as 50\% of the
   alopecia in this model when administered beginning I day before the
   onset of chemotherapy. Taken together these data suggest that KGF is an
   important endogenous mediator of normal hair follicle growth,
   development, and differentiation.}},

   production in all four stock types, whereas it promoted pollen-cone
   production only in unpruned field-grown grafts and mature trees. The
   older and taller a tree, the less the response to the GA(4/7) treatment
   was influenced by the climatic conditions prevailing during the

Abstract = {{We experimentally investigated the dependence of the laserchemical decay
   reaction of silicon tetrafluoride on the radiation frequency and the gas
   pressure. The reaction was observed only when the gas was subjected to
   the influence of radiation in the frequency range from 974.6 to 982.1
   cm(-1). Within the frequency ranges of 935 - 953, 1035 - 1055, and 1071
   - 1085 cm(-1), the reaction did not occur. The results of investigations
   make it possible to infer that direct laser heating cannot initiate the
   reaction. The reignition of the reaction after a short-time (from 2 to
   10 s) interruption of irradiation occurs at pressures that are
   noticeably lower than the initial ignition pressure. This effect may be
   accounted for by the appearance of clusters, which can be produced in
   the course of the reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Amylase from germinating cereal grains enables the preparation of

   This food can be combined with fermentation, which inhibits pathogen

   the household level, and are therefore particularly appropriate for use
   in developing countries. In a controlled clinical trial, 75 children
   aged 6-25 months admitted to hospital with acute diarrhea were
   rehydrated and then randomly allocated to three corn porridge dietary
   groups: conventional, amylase-digested (AMD), and fermented and
   amylase-digested (FAD). The study diets were given ad libitum five times
   daily, and all intakes except breast milk were weighed. Mean daily
   energy intakes over 4 days in the conventional AMD, and FAD groups,
   respectively, were 32.4 (95\% CI 28.7-36.6), 46.0 (CI 39.6-53.4), and
   37.3 (CI 31.8-43.9) kcal/kg/day. The energy intake in the AMD group was
   42\% higher than the conventional group (p = 0.003). There were no
   significant differences between the groups for duration of diarrhea,
   frequency of stooling, or vomiting. Starch digestion using amylase from
   germination is an effective way of improving energy intake in children
   with acute diarrhea.}},

Abstract = {{We have compared the voltage-gated ion channels present in larval
   ascidian muscle at two developmental stages: muscle precursor cells just
   after the terminal cell division and mature contractile muscle, 7-11 hr
   later. All precursor cells express a high-threshold transient Ca current
   and a slowly activating delayed K current, and about half the cells
   express a low-threshold transient Ca current, An inwardly rectifying K
   current, which had been present from fertilization until just before the
   terminal cell division, is absent. Mature muscle retains two of the
   tailbud currents: the low-threshold transient Ca current and the slow
   delayed K current, although at larger densities, and also expresses a
   high-threshold Ca current that is similar in most respects to the
   precursor cell current but that lacks inactivation, In addition, mature
   muscle expresses two rapidly activating outward K currents, one voltage
   and one Ca dependent, that generate a composite outward K current that
   is eight times larger and activates eight times faster than the tailbud
   K current, Mature muscle also reexpresses the inward rectifier, We
   propose that the transient absence of the inward rectifier and the slow
   activation of the delayed K current early in development create a window
   of developmental time when spontaneous electrical activity is likely.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a nutrient-limited periphyton community in a segment of
   stream was modeled. The stream segment was assumed to consist of two
   zones, free-flowing water and a boundary zone of zero water flow, which
   acted as a transient storage zone for nutrients. Studies with a
   biologically unreactive tracer solute (sodium chloride) were used to
   obtain parameters for diffusion of solute into the transient storage
   zone. Two simple alternative functional responses representing
   nutrient-limited periphyton growth were formulated, one with only
   nutrient limitation on periphyton growth and one that additionally
   included density-dependent limitation of periphyton growth.
   Attempts to fit the two alternative functional responses for periphyton
   growth and to predict nutrient levels in the transient storage zone
   showed that the two alternatives had very different implications for the
   steady state and dynamics of the storage zone. Empirical studies of
   periphyton biomass and nutrient turnover give support for the second
   alternative function. The model results suggests some additional
   experiments that can be performed to test the two alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The human MAGE1 gene directs the expression of an antigen recognized on
   a melanoma by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes. MAGE1 belongs to a
   family of genes that are expressed in a number of tumors of various
   histological types but not in normal tissues except testis, The IMAGE
   genes are arranged in two groups that are located within two different
   regions of the human X chromosome (Xq26-qter and Xp21.3), By hybridizing
   mouse genomic libraries with a MAGE1 probe, we identified three
   homologous genes, Two of these mouse genes, Smage1 and Smage2 are more
   than 99\% identical to each other and encode the same protein of 330 aa.
   The 5' noncoding region of Smage2 provides the potential for regulating
   the expression of the gene through several different promoters located
   in front of alternative first exons. The third gene, Smage3, has the
   structure of a processed transcript. It codes for a protein with only 11
   aa substitutions with respect to the Smage1/2 product. Somatic cell
   hybrids and interspecific backcross analysis showed that Smage3 is
   autosomal and that Smage1 and Smage2 are located between the Dmd and the
   Ar loci on the mouse X chromosome, Since this region is syntenic to the
   human Xp21.1-p22.1 region, we conclude that Smage1 and Smage2 are
   homologous to the IMAGE-Xp rather than to the MAGE-Xq genes. Smage1/2
   transcripts were detected in several tumor and embryonal cell lines but
   not in normal mouse tissues with the exception of testis, Expression of
   Smage3 was found in embryos from Day 11 to Day 15. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{A novel fiber optic pH sensor is reported. The sensor is based upon
   surfacic adsorption of methylene blue dye, producing absorption in the
   evanescent field surrounding the sensing fiber. The sensor is based upon
   a 200 mu m diameter Plastic Clad Silica (PCS) fiber which has its
   cladding removed in order to expose its core. The linear range of
   operation is between pH 3 and pH 9 and its response time is considerably
   shorter than indicator based probes which measure spectral changes of pH
   sensitive chemicals. Effects of measurand ionic strength are shown to be
   negligible which is a further important advantage of this sensor Over
   other optical fiber pH sensors. The sensor design is sufficiently
   flexible to allow it to be configured in probe (reflective) or in-line
   (transmissive) form, The latter allows the application of time domain
   reflectometry technique which may be used to achieve multipoint
   (distributed) sensing.}},

   Minimum values for surface tension were also found to shift toward the

Abstract = {{Mating type allele distribution and phenotypic variability were
   investigated in field populations of Laccaria bicolor. Sporophores
   associated with Norway spruce (Picea abies), colonized by natural
   sources of inoculum and growing in a seed orchard, were sampled to
   obtain dikaryotic strains and assay their phenotypic variability for
   traits important to the symbiosis. Basidiospores were also collected for
   mating type analysis of different mycelia. Four sporophore mating types
   were identified containing seven A and five B factors. Outbreeding
   efficiency was estimated at 73.8\% and the population was slightly
   inbred. Crosses with previously characterized L. bicolor strains from
   two nearby populations identified in total six sporophore mating types
   and ten A and nine B factors, for an estimated outbreeding efficiency
   (85.7\%) similar to previous studies of more spatially disparate
   Laccaria spp. populations. Dikaryotic strains were rested for mycelial
   growth rate, as a measure of their competitive ability, on agar media
   containing a soluble (NaH2PO4), or an insoluble (CaH-PO4) phosphate
   source. Their ability to solubilize the latter was also tested to assess
   their relative capacity to access insoluble, inorganic phosphate. In
   most cases, significant variation was detected among strains from the
   same site for all variables. On three sites (VC4, VC5 and VC7), each
   determined previously to possess a uniform mycelial genotype, phenotypic
   variability was likely due to epigenetic variation among different
   strains of the same genotype. Possible evidence for di karyon-monokaryon
   crosses was observed in vivo on one sample site (VC2) where adjacent
   mycelia shared two mating factors. The phenotypic variability of
   different mycelial genotypes reflected their genetic variability
   observed as mating type allele diversity and underlined the importance
   of basidiospore dispersal in introducing new genotypes into the
   population. The reproductive strategies of L. bicolor are discussed and
   compared to those of other basidiomycete species.}},

Abstract = {{The life cycle of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) presents several
   distinctive features, such as high plasticity in body growth, marked
   sexual dimorphism, sex ratio strongly skewed in favor of females and
   sexual maturation largely dependent upon the size of individuals. A
   demographic model incorporating all these characteristics is derived on
   the basis of a multiple classification of individuals by age and size,
   and variability in individual growth is explicitly included. Existing
   theory for size-structured stocks is extended to include the dependence
   of sexual maturation on size, while natural mortality is age specific.
   Using 1989 population data from Comacchio lagoons (Italy), we estimate
   mortality and metamorphosis rate and abundance in each age- and
   size-class for both yellow and silver eels, crucial information for the
   management of the Comacchio fishery. The use of a nonparametric
   technique (bootstrapping) yields not only the moments, but also the
   distributions of these estimates. Validation of the model is performed
   on the data collected in 1990. The approach adopted is very flexible and
   different assumptions about survival, sexual maturation, and net
   selectivity can be easily incorporated in the model.}},

Abstract = {{The class 3 outer-membrane protein (OMP) of Neisseria meningitidis is a
   potential target for bactericidal and opsonic antibodies in humans.
   Synthetic peptides spanning the class 3 OMP from the vaccine strain
   44/76 (B:15:P1.7.16:L3,7) were synthesized on pins and screened with
   serum obtained from Norwegian adolescents immunized with a meningococcal
   serogroup B outer-membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine. A strong IgG response
   to a single peptide ((19)FHQNGQVTEVTT(30)) located within loop 1 (VR1)
   was stimulated after three doses of OMV vaccine in three vaccinees
   selected on the basis of their antibody response to class 3 OMP. No
   clear linear B-cell epitopes were recognized by four different murine
   serotype 15-specific mAbs. A 23mer peptide (D63b2) containing loop 1 of
   the class 3 OMP was synthesized, and the IgG responses were measured in
   pre- and post-vaccination serum from 27 vaccinees. Specific IgG rose
   significantly in 37\% of vaccinees 6 weeks after the second dose and in
   74\% of the vaccinees 6 weeks after the third dose of the OMV vaccine.
   Most immune sera reacted distinctly on immunoblots with denatured class
   3 OMP, and the immunoblotting reactivity correlated strongly with
   concentration of the IgG antibodies specific for peptide D63b2. When
   added to a post-vaccination serum from one vaccinee, peptide D63b2
   competed efficiently with the class 3 OMP for specific antibody binding
   on immunoblots and in pin ELISA. The results show that the significant
   part of the humoral response to the meningococcal class 3 OMP elicited
   by vaccination with the Norwegian OMV vaccine was directed against a
   single continuous epitope.}},

   -7-amine (10). Scission of the sulfonamide bond in 10 gave the target
   compound 1. A byproduct which was isolated was assigned to the structure
   of 1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-6-{[}3-{[}1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)]pyrrolyl]indole

   Design Retrospective review of computerised data base and clinic files.
   Setting Colposcopy Clinic, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South
   Africa.
   Subjects Two hundred and ninety-eight women considered suitable for the
   local outpatient management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
   Methods Two groups of patients were identified: group A consisted of
   women who had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed
   colposcopically and who underwent directed punch biopsy; group B
   consisted of women who had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed
   colposcopically and were referred for large loop excision of the
   transformation zone without confirmatory punch biopsy.
   Results In Group A (n = 184) 123 women had cervical intraepithelial
   neoplasia diagnosed on punch biopsy. Large loop excision of the
   transformation zone was performed on 116 women and 7 were lost to follow
   up. The procedure confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 95
   cases (82\%), but there was no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 21
   cases (18\%). Sixty-one women had negative punch biopsies. Of these, 13
   underwent large loop excision of the transformation zone, 31 had
   persistently negative follow up cytology, and 9 had positive cervical
   smears of which 7 were treated with large loop excision of the
   transformation zone, and 8 were lost to follow up. Overall, 25\% of all
   negative punch biopsies were falsely negative. In group B 114 were
   treated with large loop excision of the transformation zone and cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia was confirmed in 97 cases (85\%); one woman
   had unsuspected microinvasion (1\%) and 16 women (14\%) had no cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia. Negative histology after large loop excision
   of the transformation zone was not statistically different in groups A
   and B.
   Conclusion Punch biopsy does not reduce the occurrence of negative
   histology after large loop excision of the transformation zone.}},

Abstract = {{WASP gene has been recently cloned from Xp11.23 and shown to be mutated
   in three patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), We have
   developed a screening protocol for identifying WASP gene alterations in
   genomic DNA and have identified a spectrum of novel mutations in 12
   additional unrelated families, These missense, nonsense and frameshift
   mutations involve eight of the 12 exons of the gene, Two mutations
   creating premature termination codons were associated with lack of
   detectable mRNA on Northern blots, Four amino acid substitutions,
   Leu27Phe, Thr48Ile, Val75Met and Arg477Lys, were found in patients with
   congenital thrombocytopenia and no clinically evident immune defect
   indicating that the WASP gene is the site for mutations in X-linked
   thrombocytopenia as well as in WAS, A T-cell line from a WAS patient
   contained two independent DNA alterations, a constitutional frameshift
   mutation, also present in peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient,
   and a compensatory splice site mutation unique to the cell line, The
   distribution of eight missense mutations provides valuable information
   on amino acids which are essential for normal protein function, and
   suggests that sites in the first two exons are hot-spots for mutation.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms controling potato tuber dormancy maintenance and release
   are not understood. To identify molecular events associated with
   dormancy release in potato microtubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) produced
   in vitro, changes in soluble proteins were investigated by the use of
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Potato microtubers (var. Desiree)
   used in this study were dormant at the harvest time. The duration of
   dormancy corresponded to 22 weeks in cold storage condition at 4 degrees
   C. During this period, the germination observed after transfer of the
   microtubers at 19 degrees C for 3 weeks, showed a sharp increase from
   8\% to 80\%, between 14 and 22 weeks respectively. The water content of
   the microtubers decreased during the first weeks of storage whereas the
   total soluble protein content was more variable. Two-dimensionnal
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins extracted from potato
   microtubers revealed changes during microtubers storage. The major
   changes appeared after 3 weeks and were characterized by the
   accumulation of three polypeptides (b(5), b(6) and b(7)), with an
   apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa. A protein set (a(2) to a(6)) with
   molecular mass of 40 kDa, which are likely to be part of the patatin
   family, and one polypeptide with a molecular mass of 29.8 kDa (b(8)),
   increased strongly between 4 and 9 weeks. When the first germinations
   were potentially possible after 9 weeks, these polypeptides decreased in
   amount or were not longer detected. When the germination capacity
   increased from the 10th week no protein changes were detected. The
   possible roles of the accumulated proteins on dormancy breakage were
   discussed.}},

   Results: Forty patients showed significant improvement in all
   obstruction parameters (detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate, urethral
   resistance relation, theoretical cross-sectional urethral area, minimal
   detrusor pressure and linear passive urethral resistance relation)
   together with significant subjective improvement in international

   no longer be considered to have obstruction. No difference in outcome
   among the devices used was found.
   Conclusions: Laser prostatectomy is indeed capable of relieving bladder

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the results of photometric observations
   performed from 1984 until 1992 with the 0.5-m and 1-m telescopes of the
   European Southern Observatory (La Silla, Chile), and the 1.5-m telescope
   of the Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna (Italy), in order to increase
   the available data sample of intermediate size asteroids (diameter
   included between 80 km and 150 km). We obtained a total of 26 single
   night lightcurves and the first determination of the synodical
   rotational period of six asteroids: 117 Lomia (P-syn = 9.127(h)), 212
   Medea (P-syn = 10.12(h)), 276 Adelheid (P-syn = 6.328(h)), 530 Turandot
   (P-syn = 10.77(h)), 705 Erminia (P-syn = 7.22(h)), and 1031 Arctica
   (P-syn = 51(h)). For 431 Nephele the amplitude of the light variation of
   the obtained lightcurves is negligible and does not allow any
   determination of the rotational period. For 213 Lilaea we have
   determined a synodical rotational period of 8.045(h), which is a little
   bit different from that published by Zeigler (1987). We have also
   determined the U - B and B - V color indices for six of the observed
   asteroids.}},

   maximum security. Factors largely beyond the control of Special Hospital
   consultants accounted for most of the delay in the transfer procedure.
   Fifty-eight per cent of the total time taken for transfer was
   attributable to delays by regional/district services in the assessment,
   response and admission of cases. Noticeable delays in receiving Home
   Office recommendations were also encountered in restricted cases.
   Suggestions for improving current standards are made.}},

Abstract = {{In wetlands and lakes, the movement of water is the primary vehicle for
   inorganic and organic chemical processes. The advective flow of ground
   water and surface water acts to import and export dissolved and
   suspended organic and inorganic constituents. Surface and groundwater
   also mediate inorganic and biochemical reactions. Except for many bogs
   and other wetlands developed in low-permeability sediments, most
   wetlands in the midwestern United States in humid climates are in direct
   contact with active groundwater systems. Wetlands in contact with ground
   water are ecosystems in which biospheric processes such as evaporation,
   transpiration, precipitation, and impacts from biological communities
   interact with physical-hydrogeologic processes to produce a complex
   array of responses to natural and anthropogenic stresses. Several of
   these complex responses are displayed in a mid-continental wetland and a
   northern peatland in North America. The variety of hydrogeologic
   characteristics present and the processes that operate in wetlands and
   lakes indicate that site-specific hydrogeologic investigations should be
   a part of any accurate assessment of an aquatic system.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation was undertaken to evaluate cross-linked human type I
   collagen, with and without added metronidazole, when used as a barrier
   membrane in the guided tissue regeneration (GTR) principle of treatment
   for periodontal disease. 16 patients suffering from moderate to severe
   periodontitis with 78 bilaterally matched periodontal defects underwent
   similar contralateral surgical flap procedures after preliminary
   scaling, polishing and oral hygiene instruction. At the experimental
   sites, which were selected at random, the flap was closed over
   metronidazole impregnated collagen as a GTR membrane, the contralateral
   sites receiving a plain collagen barrier as control. The plaque index
   (PLI), gingival index (GI), bleeding index (BI), probing pocket depth
   (PPD) and probing attachment level (PAL) were recorded at baseline, 6,
   12 and 26 weeks post-operatively. The bony defects were classified and
   furcation involvement noted. The clinical parameters were recorded by an
   examiner, other than the surgeon, who had been previously assessed for
   accurate reproducibility of measurements and was unaware of the
   experimental sites. PPD and PAL were measured with a constant pressure
   probe, localised by a soft stent. Post-operative discomfort was
   evaluated by means of a questionnaire. PLI, GI and BI were significantly
   improved compared to baseline for both test and control sites at 6, 12
   and 26 weeks post surgery (p<0.001) but there was no significant
   difference between these sites (p>0.05). There was a reduction in PPD at
   6 weeks which was significant at 12 and 26 weeks post-operatively
   (p<0.001) for both test and control sites, but no difference between
   these sites was evident (p>0.05). Probing attachment levels showed a
   significant improvement at 6, 12 and 26 weeks at both test and control
   sites (p<0.001), again with no significant difference between these
   sites (p>0.05). 6 patients experienced pain and an unpleasant taste
   after surgery, 5 at the control sites but only 1 at the test site. This
   study showed that all sites improved clinically and that there was less
   post-operative discomfort when metronidazole was incorporated in the
   collagen. Nevertheless the latter did not appear to enhance periodontal
   regeneration beyond that of collagen alone.}},

Abstract = {{In November, 1993, a 33-month-old child in a day-care center was
   diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB). To identify her source of infection,
   close contacts, other day-care children and staff were screened by
   tuberculin skin test (TST). TB registry and medical/laboratory records
   were reviewed. The only 2 community TB cases reported in the past 3
   years were investigated. Of 164 children 2 were diagnosed with TB; their
   TSTs were greater than or equal to 10 mm but no specimens were obtained.
   Six children had TSTs greater than or equal to 5 mm. Of these 4 had TST
   conversions between December, 1993, and March, 1994. There were no
   additional positive TST children in June, 1994. No TB case was
   identified among staff or parents. A possible epidemiologic link with
   the index case was found for 1 community case. No source of infection
   was found for the other children. Possible explanations for not finding
   a source are: an as yet unidentified case in the day-care center or
   community; or false positive TST results in children related to low

Abstract = {{The effect of music-induced pleasure and arousal on consumers' desire to
   affiliate in buyer-seller interactions were investigated in the context

   extracts pretested to vary in pleasure (low, moderate, and high) and
   arousal (low, moderate, and high) according to the Affect Grid (Russell,
   Weiss, \& Mendelsohn, 1989). Independent and interactive effects of
   music-induced pleasure and arousal on consumers' desire to affiliate
   were found. Higher desire to affiliate was associated with more pleasure
   and more arousal; pleasure had a stronger positive impact under low and
   high arousal than under a moderate level, and arousal had a stronger
   effect under low and high pleasure compared to moderate level.
   Theoretical and practical implications of the results are provided. (C)

Abstract = {{Neurons in the dorsal region of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd)
   have previously been shown to respond to the expanding radial motion
   that occurs as an observer moves through the environment, In previous
   experiments, MSTd neurons were tested with radial and circular motion
   centered in the visual field, However, different directions of observer
   motion, relative to the direction of gaze, are accompanied by visual
   motion centered at different locations in the visual field, The present
   experiments investigated whether neurons that respond to radial and
   circular motion might respond differently when the center of motion was
   shifted to different regions of the visual field, About 90\% of the 245
   neurons studied responded differently when the center of motion was
   shifted away from the center of the field, The centers of motion
   preferred by each neuron were limited to one area of the visual field,
   All parts of the visual field were represented in the sample, with
   greater numbers of neurons preferring centers of motion closer to the
   center of the field, We hypothesize that each of the MSTd neurons has a
   center of motion field with a gradient of preferred centers of motion,
   and that there is an orderly arrangement of MSTd neurons with each
   region of the visual field being represented by a set of neurons, This
   arrangement creates the potential for graded responses from individual
   neurons for different directions of heading as an observer moves through
   the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Convective heat transfer coefficient identification behind a
   backward-facing step by active infrared thermography. A methodology for
   measuring mean and unsteady local heat transfer coefficient, based on
   the thin film method, is presented. It consists in following the
   evolution of the surface temperature of a sensible surface submitted to
   a perturbed pow. The temperature field along the time is acquired by an
   infrared thermography system synchronized with velocity and fluctuating
   pressure measurements. A thermal modelisation of this wall allows us to
   characterize and identify the local value of the mean and unsteady heat
   transfer coefficient. This measurement method has been validated by
   studying the impact of a pulsed turbulent air jet on a pat plate. It is
   now applied to the study of the heat transfer in the aerodynamical
   reattachment zone present in the pow downstream a backward-facing step.
   A first correlation, for the mean heat transfer, is proposed for the
   backward-facing step setup of the DERMES (Departement d'Etudes et de
   Recherches en Mecanique et Energetique des Systemes). The unsteady
   results are analysed in time evolution in a thermal point of view and
   compared to the tomographic visualizations of this pow. Finally, the
   contribution of synchronised measurements and infrared thermography ave
   discussed as for their efficiencies and future developments.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional median filters can be designed so that they have
   properties similar to f-k fan filters. This is done by using the
   coefficients of a truncated impulse response of an f-k filter as the
   weight coefficients for the weighted median process. The filter is
   called a median f-k filter and can be used to discriminate between
   events on the basis of apparent velocity. The filter appears suitable as
   a poststack coherency filter because it produces less distortion at
   wavefield terminations than conventional f-k fan filters.
   One-dimensional weighted median filters that include negative
   coefficients are a logical starting point for the analysis of median f-k
   filters since simple numerical techniques may be used to analyze the
   behavior of these filters. We show that median filters with negative
   coefficients do not provide an unbiased estimate of the mean and can
   misplace the position of steps. Faults on a stacked section may be
   modeled by steps, and therefore applying a median f-k filter to stacked
   seismic data could change the position of faults. However, the
   distortion of steps introduced by median f-k filters is shown to be less
   than the distortion produced by the corresponding linear f-k filter, and
   the error in step placement is small. We present simple model examples
   and a seismic field data example to illustrate differences between
   linear f-k filters and median f-k filters.}},

Abstract = {{Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently
   textured regions. Many texture-segmentation schemes are based on a
   filter-bank model, where the filters, called Gabor filters, are derived
   from Gabor elementary functions, The goal is to transform texture
   differences into detectable filter-output discontinuities at texture
   boundaries. By locating these discontinuities, one can segment the image
   into differently textured regions. Distinct discontinuities occur,
   however, only if the Gabor filter parameters are suitably chosen. Some
   previous analysis has shown how to design filters for discriminating
   simple textures. Designing filters for more general natural textures,
   though, has largely been done ad hoc. We have devised a more rigorously
   based method for designing Gabor filters. It assumes that an image
   contains two different textures and that prototype samples of the
   textures are given a priori. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be
   modeled as Rician random variables (often approximated well as Gaussian
   rv's) and develop a decision-theoretic algorithm for selecting optimal
   filter parameters. To improve segmentations for difficult texture pairs,
   we also propose a multiple-filter segmentation scheme, motivated by the
   Rician model, Experimental results indicate that our method is superior
   to previous methods in providing useful Gabor filters for a wide range
   of texture pairs.}},

Abstract = {{The human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line REH6 was used to
   analyze the regulation of a ubiquitous intracellular phosphoprotein
   stathmin (Mr 19,000, pl=5.6-6.2). We demonstrated by P-32-labeling that
   the short (1 h) treatment of the REH6 cells with the tumor promoting
   phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), resulted in a
   rapid phosphorylation of at least three (P1, P2 and P3) stathmin
   isoforms without an alteration of stathmin isoform expression.
   Furthermore, Western blot analysis with specific antiserum showed that
   the prolonged period (48 h) of IPA treatment partially reduced protein
   levels particularly of two (N2 and P2) stathmin isoforms. The potent and
   relatively specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor,
   1,(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)2methylpiperasine dihydrochloride (H7),
   partially inhibited these TPA effects, whereas the specific calmodulin
   inhibitor R24571 (calmidazolium) had no effect upon these events. Our
   findings suggest that stathmin phosphorylation in REH6 cells could be in
   part mediated by PKC activation.}},

Abstract = {{Two independent experiments were carried out to determine whether
   Clenbuterol is accumulated by pigmented tissues. In the first
   experiment, unpigmented and pigmented rats were injected two times with
   5 mu g of Clenbuterol subcutaneously and the eyes were analyzed after 63
   h of withdrawal by enzyme immunoassay. Only pigmented rat eyes showed a
   clear accumulation of Clenbuterol (68.1 to 81.5 ng/g), whereas the eyes
   of unpigmented treated rats demonstrated levels similar to the negative
   controls (<.27 ng/g). In the second experiment, two Holstein-Friesian
   calves were fed with .8 mu g of Clenbuterol/kg BW two times a day
   (therapeutic dose) in milk replacer and black and white hair was
   collected separately before, during, and after the treatment. The hair
   was analyzed with an enzyme immunoassay that provided blanks less than
   1.0 ng/g and a mean recovery of 67\%. This experiment showed an
   accumulation of Clenbuterol in both sets of hair, but a definitely
   higher accumulation of Clenbuterol in black (pigmented) hair than in
   white hair. The black/white quotient amounted to approximately 50 at 1
   wk after treatment. Results of these experiment favor the use of the eye
   as well as the hair for residue analysis but in case of hair, variation
   of pigmentation in different animals must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest carbon-containing molecules as the best
   candidates for the carriers of the unidentified diffuse interstellar
   bands (DIBs), considering their abundance and ability to form stable
   bonds in interstellar space. The spectra of the naphthalene and pyrene
   cations in a neon matrix were recently reported, indicating a link
   between these small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ions and some
   diffuse bands. We have searched for new DIBs in the near-infrared and
   around 4592 Angstrom in order to identify the coronene (C24H12) and
   ovalene (C32H14) cations in the diffuse medium. Due to their
   pericondensed structure these molecules should be among the most stable
   PAHs in the interstellar medium. The absorption spectra of both
   molecules were recently measured in solid neon. We report on the search
   fbr the bands at 9465/4592 Angstrom and 9780 Angstrom, and derive
   corresponding limits on the presence of the coronene and ovalene cations
   in the diffuse interstellar medium. From these results, we discuss a
   possible selective destruction mechanism of PAHs through dication
   formation, and the role of PAH compounds as possible DIB carriers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is conflicting evidence concerning the prevalence of
   Helicobacter pylori gastritis in HIV1-infected patients. Furthermore, a
   possible influence of immunodeficiency on the acquisition of
   mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in the antral mucosa remains to
   be elucidated. Methods. Seventy-seven consecutive HIV1-infected patients
   (mean age, 40.2 years) were compared in a prospective study with 77
   HIV1-negative age-matched patients, using immunohistochemical stainings.
   Results: In HIV1-infected patients the prevalence of H. pylori gastritis
   was lower and the inflammatory reaction less pronounced than in
   controls. Lymphoid follicles and intraepithelial B cells were
   significantly more often detected in HIV1-negative patients.
   Conclusions: Evidence of acquired MALT is only rarely found in
   HIV1-infected patients. These findings might contribute to the
   explanation of why low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas have not been
   reported in HIV1-infected patients so far.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampal formation (HF) functions in two domains of memory:
   spatial and nonspatial associative memory. The HF includes the
   hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex.
   Studies of spatial correlates of HF neuronal activity have revealed that
   a subject's location in space can impose critical constraints on
   patterns of neuronal activity in the HF. This report compares monkey HF
   neuronal responses in two kinds of stimulus-response association tasks
   (go/no-go tasks with symmetrical reinforcement). In a place-dependent,
   conditional, stimulus-response association (PCA) task, the subject's
   location was the condition upon which stimulus (object)behavioral
   response association depended. In a place-independent, simple,
   stimulus-response association (ISA) task, the object-behavioral response
   contingency was independent of the subject's location.
   Of 329 neurons recorded, the activity of 88 increased or decreased
   significantly in response to the presentation of an object during the
   PCA task. Responses of 17 neurons depended differentially on specific
   combinations of object, place, and behavior in the PCA task
   (specific-combination neurons). These specific-combination responses do
   not simply reflect object-behavioral response association in the PCA
   task, since neuronal responses in the same object-behavioral response
   association were not restored in the ISA task in which there was no
   dependence on the subject's location. This suggests the influence of
   location on HF neuronal responses in object-behavioral response
   association when the subject's location is imposed as a condition.
   Responses of 12 neurons differentiated the kind of object in the PCA
   task (object-differential neurons). In the ISA task, most
   object-differential responses diminished or disappeared. Since the HF
   object-differential responses occurred in all locations, these responses
   were probably elicited by the conditions imposed by the PCA task.
   Characteristics of the two neuron types suggest that HF neurons encode
   both stimulus percept and attributes such as the place where the
   stimulus is presented and the conditional relation imposed in the task.}},

   on the adsorbent plates of a chromatographic column. The influence of
   the relative size and concentration of two different adsorbing species
   on the degree of coverage of the successive plates of the column was
   investigated, and chromatograms derived from simulation were compared to

Abstract = {{Objective To study the behaviour of pigtail polyurethane ureteric stents
   during breathing and change in body habitus and thereby explain some
   side-effects of stenting, particularly spontaneous stent fracture.
   Patients and methods The study comprised retrospective evaluation of
   records and radiographs of seven patients (five men and two women, mean
   age 41; so 10.9 years) who were admitted with fractured polyurethane
   pigtail stents, and a prospective fluoroscopic study of the behaviour of
   14 stents in 12 patients (11 men and one woman; mean age 40; so 9.3
   years) during breathing, spinal flexion, extension and rotation.
   Results Five of the seven pigtail stents fractured where the stent
   crossed the lateral edge of psoas muscle, 7-10 cm below the renal coil
   of the stent. The sixth stent was fractured at its lower third and the
   seventh fractured just proximal to the stent's bladder coil. The
   prospective study revealed a 20-80 degrees bend in the upper third of 11
   of the 14 stents and a 35 degrees bend in the lower third of two stents.
   A 1-5 cm craniocaudal movement and a 0-2 cm vertical movement of the
   stents occurred during breathing and spinal flexion and extension, There
   were no changes in stent configuration during spinal lateral rotation or
   at the sacral promontary. The bend in the upper third of the ureter was
   profound in two stents whose vertical movement was restricted by other
   conditions.
   Conclusion As the kidney-to-bladder distance shortens during inspiration
   and spinal flexion, the stent adapts by bending and/or moving. Fracture
   of the stent may be caused by repeated mechanical stress, particularly
   across the side-holes, and by diminution of its tensile strength by
   depolymerization during long indwelling times. Large polyurethane stents
   tended to bow, displacing the upper ureter anteriorly, while small, soft
   stents conformed to the anatomical course of the meter, suggesting that
   they should be used after open or endoscopic surgery to the upper
   two-thirds of the ureter. Stress on the stent can be minimized by
   choosing the correct length, particularly where vertical stent movement
   is limited by other conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The unique, influential, and successful characteristics of outreach as a
   risk behavior reduction intervention among active drug users is
   examined. The history of outreach is posited as a delineation of roles,
   and the outreach process as one of communication and role enactment. The
   premise is that the outreach worker's juxtaposition of multiple
   communicative roles facilitates success with HIV outreach interventions.
   The word `'outreach'' implies a desired object that eludes one's ready
   grasp. In the attempt to educate the active drug user about HIV risk
   behavior, it is the addict that often eludes the educator's ready grasp;
   a small dilemma for the creative outreach worker. An ethnographic
   description is provided of four different outreach workers' abilities to
   penetrate social networks, locate and recruit hidden populations,
   contextualize client behavior, respond to client needs, and build trust
   necessary to engage them in risk-reduction interventions, while still
   adhering to program recruitment guidelines. Investigative, study, and
   outreach limitations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A National Institutes of Health-funded trial of perfusate temperature
   and neurological function was begun in the Baystate Medical Center in
   February 1994. It randomizes patients having coronary revascularization
   to three temperatures-warm (37 degrees C), tepid (32 degrees C), and
   cold (20 degrees C)-for systemic perfusate and blood cardioplegia
   temperature at 37 degrees C warm, 32 degrees C tepid, and 6 degrees C to
   10 degrees C cold. The goal is to have a quantitated neurological
   examination performed prior to operation, prior to discharge at day 3 or
   4, and at a 1-month follow-up interval. The initial 51 patients
   completing a 1-month follow-up broke down to 14 cold, 22 tepid, and 15
   warm. The neurological examination quantitated their performance on the
   Mathew Scale, an ordinal measure from 1 to 100, with 100 being normal.
   There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease across the entire study from
   preoperative to postoperative that was no longer present at late
   follow-up. Although the lowest mean scores (94.8) occurred in the warm
   group, they were not statistically different from the other groups', and
   there was no discernible influence of temperature on neurological
   function. Additional patients will be entered to validate a difference
   if such exists.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive approach for nonparametric speech enhancement is
   developed. The underlying principle is to decompose the vector space of
   the noisy signal into a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace.
   Enhancement is performed by removing the noise subspace and estimating
   the clean signal from the remaining signal subspace. The decomposition
   can theoretically be performed by applying the Karhunen-Loeve transform
   (KLT) to the noisy signal. Linear estimation of the clean signal is
   performed using two perceptually meaningful estimation criteria. First,
   signal distortion is minimized while the residual noise energy is
   maintained below some given threshold, This criterion results in a
   Wiener filter with adjustable input noise level. Second, signal
   distortion is minimized for a fixed spectrum of the residual noise. This
   criterion enables masking of the residual noise by the speech signal. It
   results in a filter whose structure is similar to that obtained in the
   first case, except that now the gain function which modifies the KLT
   coefficients is solely dependent on the desired spectrum of the residual
   noise. The popular spectral subtraction speech enhancement approach is
   shown to be a particular case of the proposed approach. It is proven to
   be a signal subspace approach which is optimal in an asymptotic (large
   sample) linear minimum mean square error sense, assuming the signal and
   noise are stationary. Our listening tests indicate that 14 out of 16
   listeners strongly preferred the proposed approach over the spectral
   subtraction approach.}},

Title = {{INCISION AND DRAINAGE VERSUS ASPIRATION OF FLUCTUANT BUBOES IN THE
   EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DURING AN EPIDEMIC OF CHANCROID}},
Journal = {{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{217-220}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Goal of this Study: To compare outcomes of incision and drainage with
   packing to needle aspiration of purulent buboes in patients with
   presumed chancroid. The safety and efficacy of incision and drainage
   were compared with that of needle aspiration.
   Study Design and Methods: The study was a prospective randomized,
   nonblinded clinical trial carried out from April 1992, to January 1994
   in an inner city emergency department. A consecutive sample of 27 adults
   with fluctuant inguinal buboes presumed or proven to be chancroid or
   lymphogranuloma venereum were eligible for inclusion. Patients were
   excluded if they were believed to have buboes secondary to disease other
   than chancroid. After informed consent was obtained, patients had buboes
   drained by needle aspiration or by incision and drainage with packing
   according to a random numbers table.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients were included in the study (22 men and 5
   women), with 12 randomized to incision and drainage and 15 to
   aspiration. The mean age was 35.7 +/- 13 years. Genital ulcer or bubo
   pus cultures for Haemophilus ducreyi were positive in seven patients,
   negative in 15 patients, and not done in five patients. Follow-up was
   obtained for 23 (85\%) patients, 11 of whom had incision and drainage
   and 12 of whom had aspirations. No adverse effects were reported in
   either group.
   Conclusion: Incision and drainage is an effective method for treating
   fluctuant buboes and may be preferable to traditional needle aspiration
   considering the frequency of required re-aspirations in the study
   patients. Limitations of this study include lack of complete laboratory
   testing and lack of follow-up of all patients.}},

Abstract = {{Migration of leukocytes through an in vitro, cell culture model of the
   blood-brain barrier (BBB) composed of murine brain microvessel
   endothelial (En) cells and astrocytes, and in vivo in experimental
   allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), was investigated. We have recently
   shown that the adhesiveness of cultured murine brain microvascular
   endothelial cells for lymphocytes can be increased significantly by
   pretreatment with IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and LPS. In the
   present study, we investigated the role of TGF-beta 2 on the migration
   of leukocytes through the BBB. In vitro migration was assessed by
   measuring the percentage of Cr-51-labeled leukocytes migrating through
   the En/astrocyte monolayers. The basal level of migration was
   up-regulated significantly by treating the En/astrocyte monolayers with
   IL-1 alpha, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and LPS. The ability of these
   cytokines to modulate migration was dose-dependent. Treatment of En
   cell/astrocyte monolayers with TGF-beta 2 down-regulated the level of
   leukocyte migration up-regulated by IL-1 alpha, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha
   in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-beta 2 also inhibited the
   migration of lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo
   in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, these findings strongly
   suggest that TGF-beta plays an important role in the reduction of
   lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS in inflammatory demyelinating
   diseases such as EAE.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen molecular dissociation is studied in DC diode and thermionic
   triode glow discharges of pure nitrogen and nitrogen-argon mixtures.
   Optical emission spectroscopy is used to determine the relative
   proportions of atomic and molecular nitrogen in the cathode sheath and
   plasma regions of these discharges operated at -2 kV cathode bias in the
   range 0.1-10 Pa. The results show that for nitrogen-argon diode
   discharges at 6.67 Pa total pressure, (i) dissociation rates within the
   sheath compare with those of pure nitrogen discharges operated at
   similar nitrogen pressure and the same mechanism (N-2(+)-N-2(0)
   dissociative charge exchange) is believed to be primarily responsible;
   (ii) without argon, the proportion of atomic to molecular nitrogen in
   the plasma is very low compared with the sheath but increases when argon
   is introduced, the suggested cause being reduced quenching of electron
   energy by nitrogen gas, leading to increased electron impact
   dissociation. For nitrogen-argon thermionic triode discharges at 1.33 Pa
   fetal pressure, the proportion of atomic to molecular nitrogen in the
   sheath does not significantly vary with nitrogen concentration; this is
   thought to arise from increased incident ion energies in the sheath,
   compared with the higher pressure diode case, making Ar-N-2 dissociative
   charge exchange collisions more prominent. The implications of these
   findings are discussed in relation to plasma nitriding techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical reduction of UO2(NO3)(2) has been studied by
   polarography on a mercury cathode in CH3COOH solutions. It has been
   found that UO2(NO3)(2) is reduced to U(IV) by a mechanism similar to
   reduction in nitric acid solutions at pH > 2. The polarograms have been
   recorded with various solid cathodes. The cathodes having current
   density of uranyl reduction close to that on mercury cathode have been
   further investigated. The most suitable cathode materials for reducing
   1-2 M UO2(NO3)(2) solutions have been found to be Hg, Ti, and stainless
   steel. The use of a stainless steel cathode is complicated by minor
   corrosion; as a result, iron ions appear in the solution, which catalyze
   the oxidation of U(IV) with air oxygen and nitrate ions. On a titanium
   cathode at a potential of -0.24 V 1.6 M UO2(NO3)(2) solution in 5 M
   CH3COOH is reduced in the presence of 0.5 g l(-1) of N2H4 with 90\%
   current efficiency and 99.3\% extent of reduction. In the case of a
   mercury cathode 1.9 M UO2(NO3)(2) solution in 4-6 M CH3COOH is reduced
   to U(IV) in the presence of 0.5 gl(-1) of N2H4 with 97+/-2\% current
   efficiency and 99.7\% extent of reduction. The formal potential of the
   U(VI)/U(IV) couple is equal to 0.32+/-0.01 V and only slightly depends
   on temperature T and concentration of acetic acid {[}CH3COOH] over 20-30
   degrees C and 0.5-4 M ranges respectively. The acetic acid solutions of
   U(IV) thus obtained from UO2(NO3)(2) are considerably more stable than
   nitric acid solutions of U(IV), even in the presence of much smaller
   amounts of N2H4 or other stabilizers.}},

   investigated whether this deficiency in M-CSF production alters the
   production of cytokines in op/op bones. Calvariae of phenotypically
   normal (+/?) and op/op mice were stimulated in vitro with
   lipopolysaccharide or Pasteurella multocida toxin to produce cytokines.
   Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
   factor (GM-CSF) synthesis was the same both in calvaria from
   osteopetrotic and phenotypically normal animals. However, the production
   of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
   and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) was lower in calvaria from
   op/op animals than was the case in +/? calvaria. Thus, the lack of
   biologically active M-CSF causes defects which are not compensated by
   cells independent of M-CSF.}},

   well as older workers were unable to discriminate brood. Teneral workers
   learned to recognize and prefer nestmate brood, even if it was unrelated
   (adopted from an alien conspecific colony). The familiarization learning
   was always very labile, however. A temporary estrangement from brood was
   enough for a worker to lose either the template of recognition cues, or

   superoxide dismutase (SOD) in Echinococcus granulosus cyst, and the
   effect of anthydatid drugs on these 2 enzymes, mice infected with E
   granulosus protoscoleces for 10 - 12 months were used. METHODS: The
   activity of GST was measured by conjugation rate of
   1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene with glutathione (reduced form), while the
   activity of SOD was measured by a modified autoxidation of 1, 2,
   3-trihydroxybenzene method. RESULTS: Activities of both GST and SOD in
   the cyst wall were 12.3 +/- 4.3 to 13.5 +/- 4.8 mu mol min(-1)/mg
   protein and 4.4 +/- 2.9 to 6.1 +/- 1.4 U min(-1)/mg protein,
   respectively. When infected mice were treated ig with mebendazole (Meb)
   25 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 14 d, the GST activity of both collapsed and full
   cyst walls were inhibited by 30.1 \% and 26.8 \%, respectively. Whereas
   SOD activity of the cyst walls were activated by 105 \% - 163 \%.
   Albendazole 300 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 14 d and praziquantel 500 mg kg(-1)
   d(-1) for 14 d had no apparent effect on both GST and SOD of E
   granulosus cyst wall. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the
   inhibition of GST activity in the cyst wall induced by Meb might damage
   the defence system of the parasite.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the feasibility of using the primate E complement
   receptor (CR1), in concert with Ag-based heteropolymers (AHP), as a
   potential therapy to remove autoantibodies from the circulation. AHP are
   prepared by cross-linking an anti-CR1 mAb with the acetylcholine
   receptor (AChR), the principal target Ag in myasthenia gravis. In vitro
   studies demonstrate that this methodology facilitates specific, rapid,
   and quantitative binding of an anti-AChR mAb to primate Es. In vivo
   experiments in rhesus monkeys indicate that AHP-mediated binding of an
   anti-AChR mAb to Es leads to the clearance of the mAb from the
   circulation. Once bound to the E via the AHP, the autoantibody is
   transported to the liver and spleen, where it is degraded without
   destruction of the E. It is therefore likely that the complexes of AHP
   and target mAb, when bound to Es, are recognized in vivo and processed
   by a mechanism quite similar to that which occurs when
   complement-opsonized immune complexes, bound to primate Es, are cleared
   from the circulation. It may be possible to extend and generalize this
   work to allow for the development of a simple, noninvasive therapy that
   can be made specific for the treatment of several different autoimmune
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Identified leech neurons in culture are providing novel insights to the
   signals underlying synapse formation and function. Identified neurons
   from the central nervous system of the leech can be removed individually
   and plated in culture, where they retain their characteristic
   physiological properties, grow neurites, and form specific synapses that
   are directly accessible by a variety of approaches. Synapses between
   cultured neurons can be chemical or electrical (either rectifying or
   not) or may not form, depending on the neuronal identities. Furthermore,
   the characteristics of these synapses depend on the regions of the cells
   that come into contact. The formation and physiology of synapses between
   the Retzius cell and its partners have been well characterized. Retzius
   cells form purely chemical, inhibitory synapses with pressure-sensitive
   (P) cells where serotonin (5-HT) is the transmitter. Retzius cells
   synthesize 5-HT, which is stored in vesicles that recycle after 5-HT is
   secreted on stimulation. The release of 5-HT is quantal,
   calcium-dependent, and shows activity-dependent facilitation and
   depression. Anterograde and retrograde signals during synapse formation
   modify calcium currents, responses to 5-HT, and neurite outgrowth. The
   nature of these synaptogenic signals is being elucidated. For example,
   contact specifically with Retzius cells induces a localized selection of
   transmitter responses in postsynaptic P cells. This effect is signaled
   by tyrosine phosphorylation prior to synapse formation. (C) 1995 John

   antibiotics against Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites (E. R. Pfefferkorn and
   S. E. Borotz, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother, 38:31-37, 1994), we have
   carefully examined the replication of parasites as a function of time
   after drug addition, Intracellular tachyzoites treated with up to 20 mu
   M clindamycin (>1,000 times the 50\% inhibitory concentration) exhibit
   doubling times indistinguishable from those of controls (similar to 7
   h). Drug-treated parasites emerge from infected cells and establish
   parasitophorous vacuoles inside new host cells as efficiently as
   untreated controls, but replication within the second vacuole is
   dramatically slowed, Growth inhibition in the second vacuole does not
   require continued presence of drug, but it is dependent solely on the
   concentration and duration of drug treatment in the first (previous)
   vacuole, The susceptibility of intracellular parasites to nanomolar
   concentrations of clindamycin contrasts with that of extracellular
   tachyzoites, which are completely resistant to treatment, even through
   several cycles of subsequent intracellular replication, This peculiar
   phenotype, in which drug effects are observed only in the second
   infectious cycle, also characterizes azithromycin and chloramphenicol
   treatment, but not treatment with cycloheximide, tetracycline, or
   anisomycin. These findings provide new insights into the mode of
   clindamycin and macrolide action against T. gondii, although the
   relevant target for their action remains unknown.}},

Abstract = {{A scheme is proposed whereby homologous sequences can be rapidly
   searched for in databases using their computed images. Three methods
   were developed to cover a broad range of sequence comparison functions:
   local homologies in stretches up to 12 nt, statistical homologies in
   about 40 nt, and homologies in regions of 100-150 nt simulating
   restriction map comparisons. For each of these, a library of computed
   sequence images is first compiled; the library volume is smaller than
   the one needed to store the sequences proper in compressed format and,
   furthermore, the compared regions are prealigned. These techniques
   reduce the overall time of homology search by two orders of magnitude.
   The composed programs can be readily attached to any software package
   permitting batch processing of sequences. One of the methods was
   realized as a DNA-SUN supplement and installed in two information
   centers.}},

Abstract = {{The alpine tundra of the Colorado Front Range supports a variety of
   plant communities whose distribution corresponds to their topographic
   position. Our objectives were to: (i) determine patterns in net N
   mineralization and microbial N pools among three communities, Kobresia,
   Acomastylis, and Carer meadows, that span a topographic gradient, and
   (ii) relate any patterns to soil microclimate differences among these
   communities. Average yearly net N mineralization rates, measured with an
   in situ core incubation technique, were 1.2 g N m(-2) in 1991 and 1.0 g
   N m(-2) in 1999. No differences were detected in yearly N mineralization
   rates among the three communities; however, net nitrification and other
   soil properties were found to differ among communities. Net N
   mineralization rates and microbial N showed strong temporal variation,
   and this variation was related to different variables for each
   community. Seasonal variation in N mineralization was related to soil
   water and microbial N In Kobresia meadows, to soil temperature and
   microbial N in Acomastylis meadows, and to soil water and temperature in
   Carer meadows. Seasonal changes in microbial N were related to soil
   water in Kobresia and Acomastylis meadows. Large fluctuations in
   microbial N indicate that periodic losses from the microbial pool may be
   important to N availability in this alpine tundra site.}},

Abstract = {{Apidium phiomense is the most common primate from the early Oligocene
   deposits of Fayum, Egypt. It is known from hundreds of dental remains
   and dozens of skeletal remains, including numerous representatives of
   the long bones of the forelimb and hindlimb. Apidium phiomense was a
   small (1,600 g) arboreal quadruped. The forelimb bones of this species
   show features characteristic of arboreal quadrupeds and lack
   characteristic features found in the forelimb bones of vertial clingers,
   terrestrial quadrupeds, or suspensory species. The pelvis and hindlimb
   bones show numerous adaptations for leaping from a quadrupedal position.
   In general, Apidium lacks characteristic features of either
   cercopithecoid monkeys or hominoid apes. Overall, the skeleton shows
   greatest similarities to the same elements of small platyrrhines such as
   Saimiri and is also very similar to the hypothetical morphotype for the
   ancestral platyrrhine. The skeleton of Apidium phiomense is the most
   primitive anthropoid postcranial skeleton known. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{It is well known that rebreathing relieves the respiratory distress of
   maximal breathholding despite worsening blood gases, and it has been
   suggested that vagal input has a role in ameliorating this sensation via
   activation of pulmonary stretch receptors (PSR). However, it is believed
   by divers that expiration can lead to partial relief of distress of
   breathholding at total lung capacity (TLC) allowing a prolongation of
   breathholding. We studied the independent effects of an expiration and
   an inspiration on relief of respiratory distress of breathholding.
   Subjects held their breath at TLC until distress became intolerable,
   then exhaled to FRC and performed a second breathhold. When distress
   again became intolerable, subjects inspired to TLC a gas that resembled
   their exhaled gas and performed a third breathhold. Subjects noted
   partial relief with both an expiration and an inspiration. However,
   relief of distress was greater and the subsequent breathhold longer
   after an inspiration than after an expiration. We suggest that relief of
   distress after an inspiration is compatible with the inhibitory effect
   of PSR input; the mechanism of relief that occurs after an expiration is
   as yet uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{Roxatidine acetate, a new H-2 receptor antagonist, was compared with

   duodenal ulcer were randomized to receive 150 mg roxatidine acetate or
   300 mg ranitidine at bedtime. Repeat endoscopy was performed after 4
   weeks (25-33 days) and if the ulcer had not healed, another endoscopy
   was performed after a further 4 weeks of treatment. Using per protocol
   analysis 73.6\% of ulcers treated with roxatidine healed at 4 weeks
   compared to 72.2\% of ulcers treated with ranitidine (P = NS). The
   healing rates at 8 weeks were 92\% with roxatidine and 81.3\% with
   ranitidine (P = NS). Using equivalence tests, the healing rate of
   roxatidine was found to be equivalent to that of ranitidine within a
   20\% region. Roxatidine users took significantly less antacids than
   ranitidine users (P < 0.05). There were no significant adverse effects
   due to roxatidine or ranitidine. Roxatidine is a safe effective drug in
   the treatment of duodenal ulcers with a healing rate comparable to that

Abstract = {{The alpha-aminoadipate pathway for the biosynthesis of lysine is unique
   to fungi. Molecular properties of the cloned lys1(+) gene and the
   regulation of the encoded alpha-aminoadipate reductase (AAR) were
   investigated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A 5.2-kb
   HindIII-EcoRI fragment of S. pombe DNA, containing a functional lys1(+)
   gene and a promoter, was subcloned to make the 10.7-kb plasmid pLYS1H. A
   nested 1.778-kb HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment that complemented the
   lys1-131 mutant phenotype was sequenced from the plasmid pLYS1D, and
   shown to contain an open reading frame (ORF) of 470 amino acids,
   preceded by putative POLII promoter elements (TATA and CCAAT box
   elements, and two potential yeast GCN4-binding motifs) within 368 bp
   upstream of the start codon. This ORF shared with the corresponding
   region of the isofunctional AAR of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 49\%
   amino-acid identity (62\% similarity) overall, within which were smaller
   regions of marked sequence conservation. One such region coincided (95\%
   identity) with a putative AMP-binding domain motifidentified in the AAR
   of S. cerevisiae. In wild-type S, pombe, AAR activity from cells grown
   in lysine-supplemented minimal or YEPD media was less than the activity
   of cells grown in minimal medium. The AAR of S. pombe was more sensitive
   to feedback inhibition by lysine in vitro than the AAR of S. cerevisiae.
   These results show the effects of extensive evolutionary divergence on
   the structure and expression of a pivotal enzyme in the
   alpha-aminoadipate pathway. Presumably, delineated regions of strong
   sequence conservation correspond to discrete domains essential to AAR
   function.}},

Title = {{FUNCTIONAL LINKAGES BETWEEN MOTOR CORTICAL-CELLS AND ELBOW FLEXOR
   MUSCLES - EVIDENCE FOR AND CHARACTERISTICS OF POSTSPIKE FACILITATION}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{74}},

Pages = {{130-141}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Two monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) making high-level but submaximal
   isometric flexions of the elbow were investigated for the output effect
   of motor cortical cells on the electromyogram (EMG) activity of two main
   elbow flexors using the method of spike-triggered averaging of rectified
   EMGs (STAs).
   2. Monkeys were trained to perform individual isometric contractions for
   >2 s, and two series of greater than or equal to 20 contractions, the
   second series being at a greater force. EMG electrodes pairs were
   implanted in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis. A total of 257
   cortical cells were found that discharged with the active and passive
   movements of the elbow. We examined the EMG postspike facilitations
   (PSFs) produced in either one or the two flexors for only those cells
   that discharged during the isometric contraction, and provoked PSFs in
   the two series of contractions.
   3. The main characteristics of the EMG isometric contractions in the
   agonists were analyzed. Spectral analysis showed that the increases in
   the EMG median frequency with force stabilized at the force levels
   performed by monkeys. Cross correlation methods showed no cross talk
   between agonists.
   4. The 26 selected cortical cells had a regular discharge frequency. Ten
   cells did not change frequency with a 22-30\% force increase, 14 cells
   discharged at a higher frequency, and 2 cells discharged at a lower
   frequency. For single-cell frequencies of 5-65 Hz, interspike intervals
   <10 ms were rare: the median and modal intervals were 20-30 ms.
   5. The significance of PSFs with respect to the EMG background noise was
   estimated statistically. STAs from successive epochs under identical
   load conditions, and STAs performed at a distance from the trigger,
   showed that PSFs were authentic postspike effects and not sudden EMG
   changes synchronized by chance with the triggering cell. The features
   distinguishing PSF from secondary postspike EMG changes or coactivation
   and task-related effects were studied in simultaneous STAs of flexors
   and autocorrelogram of cortical spikes.
   6. The magnitude of the PSF was expressed as the percent peak amplitude
   above the mean EMG baseline. The mean percent amplitude of the 90 PSFs
   produced in both muscles and series was 4.0 +/- 2.4\% (mean +/- SD).
   There was no difference in the average amplitude of PSFs in the two
   flexors, although the baseline voltages in the biceps brachii were
   higher. Neither was there any significant change with force while the
   baseline level increased by 29 +/- 10\%, indicating that the absolute
   PSF amplitude increased in the same proportion as baseline.
   7. The mean onset latency was 9.4 +/- 4.2 ms for all PSFs, but it was
   6.9 +/- 1.8 ms for two thirds of the PSFs. The differences in flexors
   were not significant. There was a weak correlation between the PSF
   amplitudes and latencies.
   8. Nineteen cells cofacilitated the two flexors. Fifteen cells
   facilitated the two flexors at the same latency within a 4-ms range at
   each force level, and 11 did it for the two levels of force.
   9. We conclude that motor cortical cells exert an excitatory effect on
   elbow flexor muscles via monosynaptic or disynaptic linkages.}},

Abstract = {{Three-year-olds usually fail to recall a previous false belief once they
   have discovered the true state of affairs. The failure is so dramatic
   that researchers have treated it as a case of functional retrograde
   amnesia. We found in a series of studies that the memory trace is indeed
   available but is inaccessible under traditional testing procedures. We
   also provided a new prediction that reminding children that they had
   briefly held a picture of an object would be a more powerful retrieval
   cue than a reminder that they had held the small object itself. It was
   further shown that an effective picture was one that reminded children
   of the content of the target belief and not one that would enable them
   to reconstruct the contextual cause of why they had held the belief - a
   case of `'recall without insight''. However, there was evidence that
   successful recall was associated with either (a) an insight that the
   recall was of a thought rather than of a pretence (delayed post-test
   technique) or (b) a readiness to attach a mentalistic label to the
   recall (immediate post-test technique). The results serve to narrow an
   assessment of the competence gap between 3- and 4-year-olds in recall of
   their own false belief. Rather than a sudden ability to preserve the
   memory in association with insight into its informational origins, it is
   only the latter that comes on stream in 4-year-olds. Alternative
   explanations of the picture facilitation effect suggest different
   research strategies, each of which aims at a gap in current formulations
   of false belief recall.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral spinothalamic tract, located in the anterolateral quadrant
   of the white matter of the spinal cord, is one of the most important
   structures in transmitting pain within the central nervous system. It
   has been known for almost a century that destruction of fibers in this
   tract results in analgesia contralateral to the lesion. The
   effectiveness and clinical importance of interruption of the lateral
   spinothalamic tract has been proven in many studies. Today cordotomies
   are still a useful neurosurgical treatment modality, especially when
   pain can no longer be sufficiently controlled by analgesic drugs.
   Although analgesia on the contralateral side is the desired effect, one
   must also expect to cause disturbance in temperature sensation when
   performing a cordotomy.
   The authors' observations showed that after a cordotomy the dermatome
   level of analgesia can be variable within certain limits, which is in
   accordance with the literature. Surprisingly, however, the loss of
   temperature sensation may differ significantly from the loss of pain
   sensation. It was also found to be possible to perform a successful
   cordotomy without altering the sensation of temperature at all. This
   indicates that pain and temperature sensations may be conducted via
   separate pathways. possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its capability of high-speed search, the associative memory
   (CAM) is expected to be used in a variety of information processing
   systems. In this paper, novel fault-tolerant techniques which are
   effective for on-line use are proposed for TLB which is an example of
   the application of CAM.
   First, fault and error models of the TLB consisting of the CAM part and
   the SRAM part are clarified. Then, the fault-tolerant techniques for
   these faults and errors, such as distance separable technique, cod-ing
   technique, simplified 1-out-of-n check and graceful degradation, are
   proposed. The distance separable technique which encodes the data stored
   in the CAM part is the one which masks the faulty CAM part and prevents
   errors from propagating to the subsequent circuits. The coding technique
   checks the one-to-one correspondence between the data in the CAM and
   those in SRAM by using the SEC-DED code with byte error detection
   capability, i.e., SEC-DED-SbED code, and at the same time it detects and
   corrects errors in the data stored in SRAM. The simplified 1-out-of-n
   check processes association errors. The graceful degradation gives a
   flag in the faulty memory section and prevents it from being used.
   The methods proposed in this paper are evaluated from area augmentation
   and error detection capability perspectives. The results show that the
   fault-tolerant TLB with 32 virtual address bits, 32 physical address
   bits and 128 entries gives single fault detection probability of nearly
   99 percent with 28 percent area increase.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical modification of Asp101 which is located at the upper
   end-most site (site A) of the binding cleft of hen egg white lysozyme
   affects the sugar residue binding of the midmost site (site C) in
   addition to that of site A, and results in the considerable decrease in
   the enzymic activity {[}Fukamizo, T., Hayashi, K. and Goto, S. (1986)
   Eur. J. Biochem. 158, 463-467]. In the present study, Asp101 was
   modified with histamine and converted to
   {[}2-imidazol-4(5)-ylethyl]asparagine. Contrary to the findings
   described above, the specific activity of the modified lysozyme was
   higher than that of the native lysozyme by a factor of about two, and
   the loss of sugar residue binding ability caused by the modification was
   found to be restricted to site A. From the H-NMR spectra of the modified
   lysozyme, the pK(a) value of the imidazolylethyl group covalently
   attached to Asp101 was 7.1, and was higher than that of
   N-acetylhistidinemethylamide (6.65). This indicates that the
   imidazolylethyl moiety is not exposed to the solvent but adheres to the
   surface of the lysozyme molecule in an unidentified manner. When
   N-acetylglucosamine trisaccharide {[}(GlcNAc)(3)] was added to the
   modified lysozyme, the H-1-NMR signals of H2 and H4 of the
   imidazolylethyl group were strongly affected. This indicates that the
   imidazolylethyl moiety is located near (GlcNAc), binding region. When
   the Hy signal of Ile98 was saturated, nuclear Overhauser effects were
   observed on H2 and H4 resonances of the imidazolylethyl moiety. NOE was
   also observed on the signal of Trp63 H6 upon the saturation of the H4
   signal of the imidazolylethyl moiety. Thus, the imidazolylethyl moiety
   should be located near Trp63 and Ile98, which are in the hydrophobic box
   mast proximal to the sugar binding cleft. This situation of the
   imidazolylethyl moiety did not result in steric hindrance to the sugar
   residue binding at sites B and C. The modification affected only the
   sugar residue binding at site A, and resulted in the enhanced activity.}},

Abstract = {{There is general trend toward larger chip size and tighter layout due to

   This trend makes yield difficult to be maintained high enough, since
   larger amount of defects are distributed on such large and tight-ruled

   Simulator) and DD-TEG (Defect Density TEG) have been developed. DD-TEG
   extracts defect size distribution and its amount automatically, while
   RADLYS simulates defects on any layout and outputs yield based on the
   extracted defect size distribution. Critical layout from yield point of
   view can be found in this procedure. DD-TEG and RADLYS are used as a set
   of parameter extraction and simulation of the SPICE. In this paper, we
   introduce these tools and showed two application results. The predicted
   yield showed a good agreement with the actual yield in the first
   application (Optical Device A). Critical layout at the Local I/O portion
   was found in the second application (Random Logic portion of Memory

Journal = {{CNS DRUGS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{68-78}},

Abstract = {{ICI-204,636 is a dibenzothiazepine analogue which is at an advanced
   stage of clinical development for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has
   binding affinities for a variety of receptors including
   alpha(1)-adrenergic, serotonin 5-HT2-, alpha(2)-adrenergic, dopamine
   D-2-, 5-HT1A- and dopamine D-1-receptors. However, ICI-204,636 has
   virtually no binding affinity for muscarinic receptors. Studies using
   several animal behavioural models have generally shown ICI-204,636 to
   have significant antipsychotic activity combined with a low potential
   for extrapyramidal effects. Electrophysiological investigation in rats
   demonstrated a selective effect of ICI-204,636 on mesolimbic versus
   nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways, a phenomenon suggested to be
   predictive of antipsychotic activity and low potential for
   extrapyramidal effects. However, this mesolimbic selectivity was not
   confirmed in a behavioural study in rats.
   Data from a few phase II noncomparative and comparative clinical trials
   indicate that ICI-204,636 appears to be effective in the treatment of
   acute exacerbation of subchronic or chronic schizophrenia, although few
   study details are currently available. At dosages less than or equal to
   750 mg/day, ICI-204,636 was superior to placebo in improving
   schizophrenia symptomatology, although, since the effect was only
   transient in one study, results were equivocal. Significant
   antipsychotic effect was seen within 7 to 14 days after initiation of
   therapy. In a comparison with chlorpromazine, ICI-204,636 produced
   similar reductions in symptom scale scores.
   The most commonly reported adverse effects of ICI-204,636 include
   somnolence, agitation, headache, insomnia and elevated liver function
   tests. ICI-204,636 elevates plasma prolactin levels in rats to a similar
   extent to that produced by haloperidol but the effect appears to be
   transient. Similarly, in patients with schizophrenia, ICI-204,636 does
   not produce sustained elevations in plasma prolactin levels. Based on
   animal data and initial clinical results, ICI-204,636 may have a low
   propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects, although it remains to be
   proven whether the severity is lower than that seen with conventional
   antipsychotics.
   In summary, ICI-204,636 is a new agent with demonstrated antipsychotic
   activity and a possible low propensity to cause extrapyramidal effects.
   As expected for a drug in late phase III development, there are many
   questions concerning ICI-204,636 which must be answered before its
   overall place in therapy can be defined.}},

Abstract = {{Serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, protein, albumin, bilirubin and
   glucose were examined every 4 days until time of death in rabbits with
   VX-2 carcinoma implanted in one kidney. The rabbits were treated with
   doxorubicin, nephrectomy or combinations thereof and observed for up to
   1 year. Rabbits treated with doxorubicin only showed a slight creatinine
   rise initially, but over time creatinine reached almost the same
   concentration as that in nephrectomized rabbits receiving equivalent
   doses of doxorubicin. Creatinine concentrations increased significantly
   above the normal range following nephrectomy combined with doxorubicin.
   Doxorubicin nephrotoxicity in rabbits occurs at lower doses than
   previously reported. In all rabbits the parameters except creatinine
   remained stable within the established normal ranges, except for the
   last 4 days before time of death in the animals with metastatic disease.
   Weight loss was the best parameter for making a prognosis for an
   individual rabbit, since peak weight was noted 16-20 days before death.
   In experimental work with VX-2 carcinoma, weight is thus the most
   important indicator of the time at which rabbits not responding to
   treatment can be put to death to avoid unnecessary suffering before the
   end of the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are normally devoid of the adhesion
   protein vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which has, however,
   been observed on human VSMCs in atheroma. We now show that cultured
   human saphenous vein VSMCs express small amounts of VCAM-1 and that the
   cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces, in a time- and
   dose-dependent fashion, a significant increase in its expression.
   Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-1, and to a lesser extent interferon gamma have
   similar effects. TNF-alpha-stimulated human VSMCs demonstrate increased
   binding of T lymphocytes that is totally VCAM-1 mediated. The cytokine
   transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) at 2.0 ng/mL inhibited basal
   VCAM-1 expression by 84+/-8\% and the induction by TNF-alpha by between
   56+/-16\% and 77+/-15\% depending on the dose of TNF. Furthermore,
   coculture on opposing sides of a polycarbonate filter of human VSMCs
   with human umbilical vein endothelial cells also inhibited the induction
   of VCAM-1 by 47+/-6\%. As active TGF-beta is produced upon the coculture
   of VSMCs and endothelial cells, we suggest that the close physical
   proximity of these cells in vivo is responsible for the lack of
   expression of VCAM-1 on VSMCs and that the interruption of this contact
   in atheroma is an important pathogenic event. As VCAM-1 not only serves
   as an adhesion molecule but also as a costimulator of immune cells, its
   expression may be crucial in the propagation of vascular lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Blood pressure (BP) rises at the termination of obstructive episodes in
   patients with sleep apnea. Although the relationship of these BP
   elevations to oxygen saturation (Sa(O2)) and arousal has been explored,
   the influence of sleep stage is undefined. To examine the effects of
   sleep stage on the postapnea BP elevation, we enrolled 12 patients with
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and successfully collected data from
   seven of these (all male). Subjects slept overnight in the sleep
   laboratory, with full sleep and respiratory monitoring. Arterial
   pressure was assessed continuously with a radial artery catheter (six
   patients) or with digital photoplethysmography (one patient). Apneas
   occurring in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement
   (NREM) sleep were matched for duration and degree of desaturation. When
   mean arterial pressure (MAP) at termination of apneas during NREM sleep
   associated with Sa(O2) nadirs 78 to 82\% (NREM 80\%) was compared with
   MAP following apneas in REM with the same Sa(O2) nadir (REM 80\%), there
   was a significant difference (NREM 80\% 122 +/- 15.3 mm Hg, REM 80\% 132
   +/- 11.0; p = 0.0109). We also analyzed the effect of oxygen
   desaturation on MAP during REM sleep, by comparing events with Sa(O2)
   nadirs of 78 to 82\% with events with nadirs of < 75\% (REM < 75\%). In
   REM, further desaturation was associated with significant lengthening of
   the obstructive episodes and significantly higher postapnea BP increases
   (REM 75\% 143 +/- 19.9 mm Hg, p = 0.0392). We conclude that sleep stage
   alters the hemodynamic response to obstructive apneas during sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Thalassemia patients with heavy iron overload risk further
   increase of body iron stores after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) due
   to intensive red-cell transfusions in the post BMT course and to massive
   mobilization of iron deposits from marrow cells following the
   conditioning regimen. Nevertheless, iron chelation has not yet been used
   during the transplant period, mainly for concerns related to the
   toxicity and antiproliferative properties of the drug.
   Methods. Fifteen thalassemic patients received desferrioxamine (DFO)
   before and during BMT according to two different schedules (first: from
   day -9 to day +60, and second: from day -9 to day -2, then from day +28
   to day +60) at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day as a 24-hour intravenous infusion.
   Results. The median time to neutrophil, platelet and erythrocyte
   recovery showed no difference between DFO-treated patients and the
   control group (18 days vs. 15, 16 vs. 18 and 22 vs. 23, respectively;
   IF: NS.). The incidence of acute GVHD was 23\% in the DFO group and 13\%
   in controls (p: N.S.). The median serum ferritin (SF) at 6 months after
   BMT was significantly lower in the DFO-treated patients (2081 versus
   4187; p: 0.007) than in the control group. This difference continued to
   be evident, though not statistically significant, during longer
   follow-up.
   Conclusions. Intravenous DFO therapy during BMT does not seem to have
   affected the engraftment parameters or the incidence of infections or
   GVHD. No adverse effects were observed during the therapy. Therefore
   thalassemic patients with heavy iron overload can be candidates for a
   course of i.v. chelation during the transplant period. This therapy
   could also be followed by post-BMT iron removal (ie. phlebotomies or
   desferrioxamine) to accelerate the clearance of body iron deposits.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the charge-changing cross sections of 10.6 GeV/nucleon
   Au-197 nuclei interacting in targets of CH2 (polyethylene), C, Al, Cu,
   Sn, and Pb. Cross sections for H are calculated from those measured in C
   and CH2. The total charge-changing cross sections are higher than those
   measured at energies of less than or equal to 1 GeV/nucleon. The
   measured cross sections for the heavier targets are somewhat larger than
   those predicted by a model based on data taken at lower energies with
   lighter targets. Partial charge-changing cross sections for the
   production of fragments from the incident Au projectiles were measured
   for charge changes (Delta Z) from Delta Z = +1, Hg-80, down to
   approximately Delta Z = -29, Sn-50. In comparison to lower energy
   measurements, these partial cross sections are found to be smaller for
   small Delta Z and larger or the same for large Delta Z. The H partial
   cross sections are found to follow a power law in Delta Z similar to
   that for heavier targets, instead of the exponential form observed at
   lower energies. Factorization is found to hold for all partial cross
   sections with Delta Z greater than two. In the heavier targets, the
   cross sections for one and two proton removal have significant
   contributions from electromagnetic dissociation. The electromagnetic
   dissociation contribution to the total cross section is derived and
   found to be relatively small, but with a strong dependence on the charge
   of the target nuclei of the form Z(T)(1.76+/-0.01).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: High glucose levels inhibit fetal lung maturation in vitro,
   consistent with the increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome
   in diabetic gestation. Lung fibroblast neutral lipid stores may
   preferentially provide substrate to type II cells for surfactant
   phospholipid synthesis.
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To analyze the impact of high glucose on fetal lung
   morphology and on fibroblast neutral lipid stores, 20-day fetal rat
   right upper lobe lung explants were cultured in F-12 medium with final
   glucose concentrations of 10 mM or 100 mM and were examined by electron
   microscopy.
   RESULTS: Decreased numbers of type Il pneumocytes/alveolar lining cell
   (0.19 +/- 0.04 versus 0.34 +/- 0.04; p < 0.05) and lamellar
   bodies/alveolar lining cell (0.48 +/- 0.13 versus 0.97 +/- 0.14; p <
   0.05) were noted in the high glucose-treated explants. Lamellar bodies
   in potential airspaces were also significantly decreased in the high
   glucose group. Type II cell glycogen stores were increased in the
   glucose-treated group. The ratio of lamellar bodies in type II cells to
   lipid inclusions in adjacent fibroblasts was decreased in
   glucose-treated explants (0.23 +/- 0.09 versus 0.93 +/- 0.33 in
   controls; p < 0.01) as was the ratio of the total areal density of
   lamellar bodies to lipid inclusions in adjacent fibroblasts (2.78 +/-
   0.24 versus 4.44 +/- 0.58; p < 0.01). Although the number of lipid
   inclusions/fibroblast and of fibroblasts/alveolar lining cell did not
   differ between the two groups, the size of fibroblast lipid inclusions
   was significantly greater in the high glucose-treated lungs (0.79 +/-
   0.12 versus 0.45 +/- 0.04 mu M(2); P < 0.02), resulting from a
   subpopulation of large lipid inclusions measuring >1 mu M(2).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm our previous biochemical results
   indicating an adverse effect of high glucose on fetal lung surfactant
   metabolism in vitro and are suggestive of a block in the trafficking of
   lipids from fibroblasts to type II cells under these conditions. This
   block may be involved in the pathogenesis of the delay in fetal lung
   development observed in the diabetic pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted in the 14- by 22-Foot
   Subsonic tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center to quantify the rotor
   wake behind a scale model helicopter rotor in forward flight (mu = 0.15

   the present test consisted of a four-bladed, fully articulated hub and
   utilized blades of rectangular planform with a NACA-0012 airfoil
   section. A laser light sheet, seeded with propylene glycol smoke, was
   used to visualize the flow in planes parallel and perpendicular to the
   freestream flow. Quantitative measurements of vortex location, vertical
   skew angle, and vortex particle void radius were obtained for vortices
   in the flow; convective velocities were obtained for blade tip vortices.
   Comparisons were made between the experimental results and the wake
   geometry generated by computational predictions. The results of these
   comparisons show that the interaction between wake vortex structures is
   an important consideration for correctly predicting the wake geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Response of net photosynthesis (Pn) of Begonia plants to photosynthetic
   photon flux density (I-o) and carbon dioxide concentration (C) was
   measured and modelled. Measurements were performed on whole plants at
   different growth stages in either controlled (assimilation chambers) or
   in situ conditions (glasshouse), A rectangular hyperbola was chosen as
   the response function of net photosynthesis to I-o, C and leaf area (A).
   Parameterisation and validation of the model was carried out using Pn
   measurements on Begonia plants, cv, `'Line''. The model was then tested
   for its extrapolative ability with two other data sets: one obtained in
   assimilation chambers with different cultivars (cv. `'Heidi'', and shoot
   cuttings of the Rosalie group) and the other from in situ measurements
   in glasshouse with the cv. `'Line'', using a portable assimilation
   chamber. Prediction of Pn was satisfactory under normal conditions of
   air temperature (T-a), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and I-o in
   glasshouse production. Discrepancies between measured and estimated
   rates of Pn occurred under high I-o (more than 700 mu mol photon m(-2)
   s(-1)), T-a (over 25 degrees C) and VPD (more than 1.5 kPa), and can
   possibly be attributed to effects of stomatal closure on the net

Abstract = {{Greater numbers of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) reach adulthood
   and, therefore, actively participate in the labor force. In this study,
   we estimated labor force participation rates and determined risk factors
   for work disability among persons with CF. We recruited 49 (73\%) of 67
   adults followed at one of two hospital-based CF centers. We ascertained
   employment history and CF-attributed work disability by structured
   questionnaire. Independently, we reviewed medical records for
   demographics and illness severity indicators. We analyzed potential risk
   factors for work disability by logistic regression analysis. All of
   those studied reported past or present labor force participation,
   consistent with high work motivation. Complete cessation of work
   attributed to CF was reported by 17 (35\%; 95\% CI, 21 to 49\%).
   Although 23 (47\%; 95\% CI, 32 to 60\%) of those surveyed stated that CF
   had affected career choice, only nine respondents had ever received
   career counselling and 16 had ever discussed job choice with their
   physicians. After adjusting for standard measures of disease severity by
   multiple logistic regression, age, adult diagnosis of CF, female gender,
   and single marital status, analyzed as a group, provided significant
   additional explanatory power to a predictive model of disability risk
   (model chi square {[}4 d.f.] = 11.5, p < 0.05). Health care
   professionals who design interventions targeted at work disability among
   persons with CF should address demographic factors as well as illness
   severity and should assess the vocational needs of persons with CF and
   the potential benefit of career counselling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. A geographic information system was used to identify and
   locate residential environmental risk factors for lyme disease.
   Methods. Data were obtained for 53 environmental variables at the
   residences of Lyme disease case patients in Baltimore County from 1989
   through 1990 and compared with data for randomly selected addresses. A
   risk model was generated combining the geographic information system
   with logistic regression analysis. The model was validated by comparing
   the distribution of cases in 1991 with another group of randomly
   selected addresses.
   Results. In crude analyses, 11 environmental variables were associated
   with Lyme disease. In adjusted analyses, residence in forested areas
   (odds ratio {[}OR] = 3.7, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.2, 11.8),
   on specific soils (OR = 2.1 95\% CI = 1.0, 4.4), and in two regions of
   the county (OR = 3.5, 95\% CI = 1.6, 7.4) (OR = 2.8, 95\% CI = 1.0, 7.7)
   was associated with elevated risk of getting Lyme disease. Residence in
   highly developed regions was protective (OR = 0.3, 95\% CI = 0.1, 1.0).
   The risk of Lyme disease in 1991 increased with risk categories defined
   from the 1989 through 1990 data.
   Conclusions. Combining a geographic information system with
   epidemiologic methods can be used to rapidly identify risk factors of
   zoonotic disease over large areas.}},

   The major driving force for these changes is a technological development

   mid-1970s. In 1986 the US Food and Drug Administration comprehensively
   evaluated exposures and potential health effects of sugars contained in
   carbohydrate sweeteners. A UK Department of Health report followed in
   1989. An overview of issues is provided, terminologies used to describe
   sugars and sweeteners are defined, the findings of the US and UK reports

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to investigate neural control of mouse
   small intestinal longitudinal muscle. Electrical field stimulation
   evoked acetylcholine- and neurokinin A-mediated contractile responses,
   whereas nitric oxide-mediated neuro-transmission resulted in relaxation.
   The inflammatory mediators, histamine and leukotriene D-4, contracted
   the longitudinal muscle preparation. Histamine-evoked contractions
   resulted from binding to histamine H-1 receptors on non-neural cells of
   the small intestine. Leukotriene D-4 played a role in neurokinin
   A-mediated excitation as the leukotriene D-4 receptor antagonist, WY
   48,252, reduced the response to nerve stimulation under noncholinergic
   conditions by almost 80\%. In contrast, WY 48,252 had no effect on the
   response to exogenous neurokinin A, indicating that the response to this
   neurotransmitter is not mediated by leukotriene D-4 release.
   Subthreshold concentrations of leukotriene D-4 did not modify the
   response to neurokinin A, ruling out a synergistic relationship between
   these two agonists. Leukotriene D-4 did not cause synaptic transmitter
   release through ganglionic stimulation, because its contractile effect
   was tetrodotoxin insensitive, and did not contribute to noncholinergic
   excitation through stimulation of neurokinin A release, as the
   neurokinin(2) receptor antagonist, MEN 10,376, did not alter the
   response to leukotriene D-4. instead leukotriene D-4 may modulate the
   release of neurokinin A from nerve endings during nerve stimulation.}},

   or a related condition, and to determine the frequency with which
   patients with and without a diagnosis of PVD or a related condition were
   treated with drug and nondrug therapies.
   DESIGN: A multicenter, disease-based, retrospective evaluation.
   SETTINGS: 41 nursing facilities in 6 regions of the US.
   PATIENTS: 4038 patients in a nursing facility: 827 patients with a PVD
   or related diagnosis; 2719 patients without a PVD or related diagnosis
   but with risk factor(s) for or clinical evidence of PVD; and 492
   patients without a PVD or related diagnosis, risk factor(s), and
   clinical evidence.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of disease and drug therapy for PVD.
   RESULTS: PVD was documented in 21\% of patients; another 67\% had risk
   factor(s) for or clinical evidence of PVD but no diagnosis of PVD or a
   related condition. Pentoxifylline was prescribed for 3\% of the total
   sample and 12\% of patients with PVD or a related condition.
   CONCLUSIONS: PVD appears to be inadequately evaluated in patients in a
   nursing facility. Disease treatment strategies should be developed and
   implemented to educate healthcare professionals and the general public
   about the need to acknowledge, assess, and treat PVD and related
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Various authors interested in postmodernism suggest that Las Vegas is a
   particularly strategic site that promotes and even exaggerates a
   postmodern logic and `'structure of feeling.'' The present ethnographic
   fragments seek to evoke this postmodern logic through its subjectively
   experienced structure of feeling. The approach used to produce these
   fragments consists of juxtaposing postmodern insights; unstructured
   interviews with, and interventions by, a wide variety of individuals
   encountered in Las Vegas; and self-reflexive observations in the rapidly
   disappearing space separating the mediascape from the everyday.}},
